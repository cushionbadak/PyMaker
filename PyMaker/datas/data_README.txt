This folder is large file storage for [PyMaker] "https://github.com/cushionbadak/PyMaker".
I needed this shared folder because I do not know how to use git-lfs.
To use these files appropriately, copy and place these folders (e.g. GoogleNews, object4_wv_rep) into '[ProjectRoot]/PyMaker/datas'.
You need to decompress files too. Please place decompressed file directly in the folder.
For example, decompressed file 'GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin' should be placed like '[ProjectRoot]/PyMaker/datas/GoogleNews/GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin' .
