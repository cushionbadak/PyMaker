After deploying AskBot I observe an unusual error:AttributeError at /settings/QA_SITE_SETTINGS/     'SortedDict' object has no attribute 'insert'This is the result of the following code:According to Django wiki,  seems to have  method.Any idea?Here is the complete error page.Related: AskBot bug.
The  method was deprecated in Django 1.5, and removed in Django 1.7. The wiki page you linked to was out of date, so I removed the mention of the  method from there. itself is deprecated in Django 1.7, and will be removed in Django 1.9.Now that Django only supports Python 2.7+, the correct fix is to use  instead of .
