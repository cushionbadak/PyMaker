i have a python script that collects data from a server in the form of here, the first field is Date and the second field is an integer digit. this data is being written into a file.i have another thread running which is plotting a live graph from the file which i mentioned in the above paragraph.so this file has data like,Now i want to plot a time series Matplotlib graph with the above shown data.but when i try , it throws an error saying,when i have normal data like shown below, things are fineUPDATEmy code that generates graph from the file i have described above is shown below,UPDATED CODENow i am getting the error at this line ()how will i get over this?
You are trying to parse an integer from a string representing a timestamp. Of course it fails.In order to be able to use the timestamps in a plot, you need to parse them to the proper type, e.g.,  or . You can use ,  or maybe also  for this.Plotting the data is straight-forward, then. Have a look at the interactive plotting mode: .For reference/further reading:https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-dateutilhttp://dateutil.readthedocs.org/en/latest/parser.html#dateutil.parser.parsehttps://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.strptimehttps://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html#time.strptimehttp://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.ionPlotting time in Python with Matplotlib How to iterate over the file in pythonBased on your code I have created an example.

The error tells you the cause of the problem: You're trying to convert a string, such as , into an integer. This string is not a valid number.Instead, you should either look into using a  object from the datetime module to work with date/time things or at least ting the string into fields using  as the delimiter and the using each field separately.Consider this brief demo:
