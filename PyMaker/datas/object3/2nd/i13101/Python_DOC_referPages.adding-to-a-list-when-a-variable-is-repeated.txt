So I'm listing all the models and the avg mpg in a function.Where I have and the expected output ismy code so far is which results in all the mpg keep on adding regardless of the model.How can I fix it?Edit: the counter is so that the total mpg can be divide by the number of the times the make appears for example for 
Your code seems to rely on a magical ; that value is simply the very last value from the .Store the total so far and the count of entries in a dictionary, keyed by manufacturer:You could also simply group the entries into lists, keyed on the maker, and sum the values later on:The above function assumes your  uses tuples per entry:The output uses floating point values, consistently:The order of the output differs from your expected output because dictionary order is arbitrary and depends on the current hash randomisation value as well.
You could use a dictionary instead:I think this should work.
