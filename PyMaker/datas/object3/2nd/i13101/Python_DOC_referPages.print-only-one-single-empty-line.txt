I am reading files in a folder in a python. I want print the each file content separate by a single empty line.So, after the for loop I am adding  which adding two empty lines of each file content. How can I resolve this problem?
will print a single new line in Python 3 (no parens needed in Python 2).The docs for  describe this behavior (notice the  parameter), and this question discusses disabling it.
Because  automatically adds a new line, you don't have to do that manually, just call it with an empty string:
From  (I think you're using Python 3):print(, ..., , , , )Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default.     Optional keyword arguments:file:  a file-like object (stream); defaults to the current sys.stdout.     sep:   string inserted between values, default a space.     end:   string appended after the last value, default a newline.     flush: whether to forcibly flush the stream.So 's default  argument is . That means you don't need add a  like . This will print two newlines, just use .By the way, if you're using Python 2,  use .
 has a  embedded in it....so you don't need to add  by yourself
Or, if you want to be really explicit, useWrite method doesn't append line break by default. It's probably a bit more intuitive than an empty print.
