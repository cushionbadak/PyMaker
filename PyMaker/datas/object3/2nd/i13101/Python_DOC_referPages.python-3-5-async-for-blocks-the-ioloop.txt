I have a simple aiohttp-server with two handlers.First one does some computations in the  loop. Second one just returns text response.  returns 30-th fibonacci number with the slowest recursive implementation, which takes something about one second.When I'm trying to fetch  and then , it gives me response for the second one only when the first one gets finished.What am I doing wrong and how to make index handler release the ioloop on each iteration?
Your example has no yield points ( statements) for switching between tasks.Asynchronous iterator allows to use  inside / but don't insert it automatically into your code.Say,should work as you expected.In real application most likely you don't need  calls because you will wait on database access and similar activities.
Since,  is CPU bound and sharing little data, you should probably use a  (as opposed to a ):Setup  when you create the :
An asynchronous iterator is not really needed here. Instead you can simply give the control back to the event loop inside your loop. In python 3.4, this is done by using a simple :In python 3.5, you can define an  object that basically does the same thing:Then use it with the  syntax:Or simply use asyncio.sleep(0) that has been recently optimized:You could also run the  in a thread using the default executor:
