I found this code in a 3rd party module which was ignoring  or  in this case.While supporting steps would be ideal, assuming this isn't going to be supported, I'd like to add an exception, otherwise  for eg will ignore the  in the slice.eg:So my question is, for valid but unsupported slice steps,which exception type should be used?
ValueErrorRaised when a built-in operation or function receives an argument that has the right type but an inappropriate value, and the situation is not described by a more precise exception such as IndexError.https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError"The right type but an inappropriate value" seems to match your description pretty well.
