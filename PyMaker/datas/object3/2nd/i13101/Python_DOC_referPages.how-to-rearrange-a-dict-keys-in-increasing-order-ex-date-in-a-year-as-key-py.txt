Ive been working with dictionaries recently and Ive been working on a project which includes saving events of a day to a calendar.so the format for the key would be in the date format yyyy-mm-dd. I wanted to make it so that every 'key' that is in the dictionary would come out as according to the days. For example:the key 2015-11-10 with its events on that day and 2015-11-9 with its events, I would like 2015-11-9 and its events to be printed out first. I have tried sorting and tuples etc.. but that would only sort what is inside the key not the key itself. Any ideas or suggestions?What I need is this:
Normal dictionaries are unordered. If you want an ordered dictionary, you have to use .But I guess it would be enough to iterate over the values in an ordered fashion. Usually, you do it like this:Please note that  is still unordered.  returns a list of  tuples. And lists can be sorted.dict with list elements
