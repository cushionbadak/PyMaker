I'm trying to import this CSV file. It works perfectly on my local setup on django. However- it won't import on my actual server/production version. I am using SQLite (locally), and Postgres on the server. But I don't see any settings that would affect it. Any suggestions?My import file:Error:
You are using different versions of Python locally and on the server. Locally, you are likely using Python 3, because Python 3.4 knows the  argument for On the server, you probably run Python 2, because in in Python 2.7 the  argument does not existThat's why the error message is complaining about 'errors' being "invalid".
