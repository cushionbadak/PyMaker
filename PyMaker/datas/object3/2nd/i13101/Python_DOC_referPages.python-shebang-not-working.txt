Python is installed at:At the top of my program I put:I opened windows command prompt and entered:The message I got was:I was told this should work great on Windows so I'm confused?
 will not work on the Windows command prompt, this way of executing scripts is meant for Linux/UNIX shells.If you're using Python 3.3+:The shebang lines will be obeyed by the Windows Python Launcher  if you have it installed (https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#shebang-lines).Make sure you have that installed and try launching using:
There are multiple problems here.Shebangs are a Unix thing.  Windows does not recognize them at all.  Instead, Windows uses file extensions.  There is no file named /usr/bin/env on Windows, so even if your shebang did work, it wouldn't do what you want.The Python installer normally associates Python with  files on installation.  If it did not in your case (because you disabled the option?) you need to go fix that. doesn't work on cmd.exe.  It's  or just .
Whoever told you, must have either misunderstood you or you misunderstood them.Shebang lines have no effect with windows unless you're trying to use cygwin. The other reason you'll need them to ensure smooth transition between windows and linux if you're passing the code to someone who might be running on linux.As far as the "." it is not used in windows. Its reason in linux OS is to inform the command that the script is in the current directory.For windows all you'll need is: .
Your first problem is that Windows won't treat  as a path separator here. It has to be  or just . That's why you get the error you see.The next problem is that the shebang is not implemented by the windows command shell. It works on linux shells (and linux-like shells on Windows such as cygwin) because those shells read the front bit of executables to see how they should be executed. Windows does this by looking at the extension.
