I need to replace an element of a matrix.I initiate a 4x4 matrix through the command .For example I want to change the  element.For logic I write:and the error code says So I try:but instead of change only the  element, it changes all the "second column" in this way:What's the problem? How can I replace only one element?
The problem is that when you do something like this: You are not creating different lists, you are simply copying a reference to the same list four times. So if you make a change in one of your sublists with your methodology of creating that 4x4 matrix, you are seeing the expected behaviour.Official documentation will explain this further as wellYou should do something like this to achieve what you are looking for:Now, you have four different lists in your list. If you make a change it will only be with reference to that explicit index you provide. 
create the Array like this:then  will work
