What is wrong? How do I improve? It keeps coming up with a syntax error and I don not know why.
You're missing closing parentheses on your question lines:Should be:You also don't need to convert the input to a string, because  already does that for you:If the prompt argument is present, it is written to standard output  without a trailing newline. The function then reads a line from input,  converts it to a string (stripping a trailing newline), and returns  that.
