I'm discovering possibilities of string formatting with .format( ) method in Python 3 but i raised an error that i do not understand.So, why the following line is ok [wich let me think that "0" can be used exactly like the argument passed to format()]:but not this one [applying a method or a function to 0 in {0} doesn't work?]:raising the following error:Why the raised error says i've used upper as an attribute and not as a method?And is there another way to do it than:Thanks!

Using such literals you can do:
