I attached the python script above. I am trying to print out the information I need in to a csv. Whenever I attempt this, I get a TypeError: 'newline' is an invalid keyword argument for this function'. I am very new to python so I'm not sure how to address this (or if there are other issues in the script). 
You are using Python 2, and the open function has no  argument.You should use Python 3 in order to use that argument. See the new open documentation.
In Python 2, use  instead of  to achieve the same effect. Python 3 uses the latter.
