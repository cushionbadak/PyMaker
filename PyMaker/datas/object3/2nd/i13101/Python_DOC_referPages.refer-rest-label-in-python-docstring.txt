Natural Text
I want to refer to reST label in my python method docstring and am expecting Sphinx to generate appropriate links.I tried the following which does not work for me.myown.rstmymodule.pyThis produces "See my-label" as text in the generated html file while I am expecting it to create appropriate hyper-link.I see this kind of references in python-docs (e.g. see https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#classmethod ) and reference to Function definitions (which is generic explanation). However, this is not generated from docstrings (as can be seen from funcobject.c) .. so I am inclined to think that it is handcrafted rst !! 
Based on comment from @mzjn - the section header was missing in the rst file. Adding that and regenerating fixes the issue.
