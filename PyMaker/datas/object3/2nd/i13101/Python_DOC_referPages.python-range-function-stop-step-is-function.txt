Simple question that likely due to keywords, lead to an explanation on the function itself rather than clarification on whether or not the following is the case:When using the range function to loop, with a function as the stop step, e.g. is the result of the function call stored for use or evaluated at each step?I'd imagine its the former but it agitates that I can't confirm.
There is nothing special about  here.  The behavior is defined in the language reference.The expression list is evaluated onceThe "expression list" is the part after the  (i.e.,  in your example).  No matter what is there, it is only evaluated once.
