Natural Text
I have a list with the same values as the keys of a dictionary. I want to write a code that does something to the values of the dictionary (e.g. increases them by one) as many times as their key appears in the list.So e.g. I tried this code:But it raises this error:Could you tell me why it doesn't work and how I can make it?
 will by default refer to .Because you want both the  and its value it should bewhich will yield a list of tuples: is also available, but yields from a  generator instead of a list:However, you should take into consideration directly indexing by key, otherwise your assignment  will not be persisted to the dict:
You're missing the point of having a dictionary, which is that you can index it directly by key instead of iterating over it:
It looks like you're trying to use a dictionary as a counter. If that's the case, why not use the built-in Python ?
I suggest you use , which is a  subclass for counting hashable objects.
You can iterate a dictionary like this:
 instead of . When trying to iterate over  you are receiving only keys.
