I am parsing an xml file exported from iOS Health App. The records of start time has this format:I am just wondering what does the part '15170-0800' stand for. Can anyone help?
 would be the format .So, the  portion of your question is the time, in Hours Minutes Seconds.What follows after would be a + or -, and how many hours and minutes you're offset from UTC, so the  would be UTC-8 timezone.
It doesn't look like a standard time format (such as rfc 3339) or a default time format for a Date Formatter but it is easy to parse anyway.The time format is :Note: it differs from @Christian Witts's answer ( is a part of the numerical utc offset).Don't use the label  in the programming context; it may be ambiguous. If you don't know the timezone name such as ; just numeric offset () is less ambiguous.
