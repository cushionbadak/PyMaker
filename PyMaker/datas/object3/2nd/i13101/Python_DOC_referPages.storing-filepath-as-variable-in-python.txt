I'm sure this is an easy question but I have searched for a while to no avail. I want to define a file path as a variable and use that variable elsewhere in my python code on Ubuntu. What I have so far is:and I call on it later in the code as:When I do this, I get an error saying that a float was expected and not a string. How can I get this to work?Thanks in advance!
use  with %s instead of %fBut you are much better off using 
You passed a formatter that expected a float (%f) not a string (%s). You can either replace this with  or just concatenate it directly like so, .Do note that you're  better off working with  module directly for essentially anything to do with paths :-) Will edit answer if you require further explanation as II sent this from phone.
