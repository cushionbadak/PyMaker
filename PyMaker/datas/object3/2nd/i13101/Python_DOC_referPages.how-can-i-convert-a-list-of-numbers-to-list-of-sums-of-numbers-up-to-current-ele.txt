This question already has an answer here:How to find the cumulative sum of numbers in a list?                    18 answers                To clarify, my original list contains the difference between two consecutive values, starting from zero. I want to convert this list to a list of actual values using a functional style, without having to keep a global state during calculation, without for loops, using map, reduce, etc.
Just use .
