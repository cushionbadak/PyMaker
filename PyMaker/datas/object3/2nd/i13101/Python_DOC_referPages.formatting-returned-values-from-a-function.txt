But I need to pass the data over to another function and display it in the same mannerTo get what I want printed within the function, I have this piece of code:Is there a way I can take the returned values and print it in the same fashion in another function?
I believe you are simply looking for this: ExplanationYour method is returning two values . If you are to do this simply: You will still have access to both of your returns, however, they are returned as a tuple:Simplified example of what is happening:So, to handle the return in to their own variables, so you can pass it to a new method, you should be using the example I provided above. To re-iterate: Now you can pass  (which will hold ) and  (which will be holding ) to whatever other method you need to send it to: 
You should call your existing function and assign the two lists to two different variables, or together they will be returned as a tuple. Then it would be cleanest to use string formatting to print the results:Alternatively, with one variable:
