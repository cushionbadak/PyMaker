In an application I want to collect messages related to some dedicated part of the processing, and then show these messages later at user request.  I would like to report severity (e.g. info, warning), time of message, etc., so for this I considered to use the Python standard  module to collect the messages and related information.  However, I don't want these messages to go to a console or file.Is there a way to create a Python logger, using , where the messages are kept internally (in memory) only, until read out by the application.  I would expect start of code like:I have tried to look in logging â€” Logging facility for Python, but most example are for immediate output to file or console, so an example for internal logging or reference is appreciated.
You should just use another handler. You could use a  over an  that would simply log to memory:All logging sent to  can be found in Of course, this is just a simple Handler that concatenates everything in one single string, even if for versions >= 3.2 each record is terminated, by default with a . For more specific requirements, you could have a look at a  or implement a dedicated .References: logging.handlers in the Python Standard Library reference manual.
