Natural Text
I'm writing code that goes over a text file counting how many words are in every line and having trouble putting the result (many lines that each consist ofa number) into a new text file.My code:But the file I'm getting has all the number together in one line.How do I seperate them in the file I'm making?
You need to add a new line after each line :Also as a more pythonic way for dealing with files you can use  statement to open the files which will close the files at the end of the block.And instead of multiple assignment and converting the length to string you can use  method to do all of this jobs in one line:
Add newline in the file while writing
As the previous answers have pointed out, your need to write a newline to separate the ouput.Here is yet another way to write the code
