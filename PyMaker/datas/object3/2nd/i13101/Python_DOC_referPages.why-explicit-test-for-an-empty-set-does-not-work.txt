If empty  is , shouldn't the  clause in the following code evaluate to ? ouput:
In simple terms, the equals operator  will perform an equality comparison between those two objects: A set and a boolean value will never be equal, so the result of the comparison is false. On the other hand, just checking  (or ) will check the trueness of the object, something that can be evaluated for every object. In a way, this actually does a type conversion using . And for empty sets, this is false.In the data model, both of these operations invoke different special method names. Comparing two objects using the equality operator will invoke  while calling  on an object will invoke .
The operator  will check the values of 2 object and in this case an empty  and a False value have not a same value.And since python evaluates any empty sequence as False and none empty sequences as True, if you want to check the validation of the  object you can simple use :Truth Value TestingAny object can be tested for truth value, for use in an if or while condition or as operand of the Boolean operations below. The following values are considered false:List itemNoneFalsezero of any numeric type, for example, 0, 0.0, 0j.any empty sequence, for example, '', (), [].any empty mapping, for example, {}.instances of user-defined classes, if the class defines a  or  method, when that method returns the integer zero or bool value False.All other values are considered true â€” so objects of many types are always true.
The key point here is,  is not the only value that is considered falsy. An empty set is also interpreted as false in the condition.However, the explicit equality test  is not true because an empty set, as definition, is of type , which is never equal to a boolean value .See Boolean Operations:In the context of Boolean operations, and also when expressions are used by control flow statements, the following values are interpreted as false: , , numeric zero of all types, and empty strings and containers (including strings, tuples, lists, dictionaries, sets and frozensets). All other values are interpreted as true. User-defined objects can customize their truth value by providing a  method.
