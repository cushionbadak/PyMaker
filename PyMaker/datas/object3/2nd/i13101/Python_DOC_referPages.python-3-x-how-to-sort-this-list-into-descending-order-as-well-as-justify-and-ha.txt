How do I obtain this into a sorted list without having count_list return into just 5 returns of nothing, a justified width of 25 to the left and symbols of numbered rank items to = "#"? after I run the program, it keeps giving me just a list of none's. I'm trying to do a descended list of stars as well as justifying the pibs far from the hashtags at 25 at length.This is the final output and the further I go into this the further it becomes complex. I also need help on how to attach or append stars to the descending numbers from 5 to 1, I tried doing reverse function but it is not compatible with merely adding the string 'Stars' to it. I believe I may have a solution to assign the stars to the number ranking stars, but I need a solution to check my progress.Example of printed output:This is my own code after some help on it.
Use a  object, which automatically counts each element in your iterable and creates a dictionary. You can then loop over the keys and print an appropriate heading for that star rating, and then the formatted string representing the number of items with that star rating. The  means an aligned string, left-aligned, filled to a width of 23 characters, with the default fill character (space).Result:
