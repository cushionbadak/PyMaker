Natural Text
I am reading a text file, separating the word and the number with the comma then adding them into separate lists however, the first name gets omitted. Here is my code.
You're jumping ahead with the first  and just use  defined in the  statement.
It seems that you  is a file object and since file objects are iterator (one shot iterables) after the first line that you loop over it you consume the first line.And then you are using  to read the next line which is extra here, so for getting ride of this problem you need to remove this part.Also as a more pythonic way you can use a list comprehension to create the list of words by splitting the lines with comma.If you want to create a list of all words you can use a nested loop :But if you want to put the separated words of each line in a separate list you just need to use a one loop :Or as a better choice use  module to open the file as a separated words.You can pass a delimiter argument to  function :Here  is a iterator from tuples of separated words. And of you want to concatenate them you can sue  function.
