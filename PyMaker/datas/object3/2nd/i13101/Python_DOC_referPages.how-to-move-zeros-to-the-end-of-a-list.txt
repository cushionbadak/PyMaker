I have to create a code(function) that moves elements in a list without using temporary list and the function has to return nothing, I've tried the following but It won't work please help
Here is one way to do it:
The big "gotcha" here is "no temporary list." This means that the usual approach of iterating over a copy of the list while mutating the real list......violates the rules of the assignment. Instead you'll have to do some jiggery pokery with indexes and etc.This is generally a Bad Idea, and definitely code smell in Python. You shouldn't feel bad about using a temporary list if this were Real Code, but I assume it's a homework assignment.
This is very easy to do with normal list methods, although this isn't necessarily the prettiest or most efficient way to accomplish your task.Take some regular list of integers with some zeroes sprinkled in:Figure out how many zeroes there are. You'll be sticking these on the end later:You can remove the original zeroes with a simple loop. This method will cause a (catchable)  when you run out of zeroes to get rid of:Then you put the number of zeroes you removed back on the right end:The only thing left for you is to complete your homework by looking up the actual methods I used in order to "fill in the blanks" in this answer. Use this page in the Python docs as a reference to help!
Not a very efficient solution, but I think, that's the type of solution you need.Output:
Updated answer with a solution for same list; You can use a listcomprehension with sorted() and reversed()
