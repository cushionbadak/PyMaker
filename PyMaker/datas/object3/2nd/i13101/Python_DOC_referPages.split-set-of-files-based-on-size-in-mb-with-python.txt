Is there any way to have a function in Python that can walk a folder with a list of files & separate the list into "partitions" (which will become folders) based on total size of the files in each partition/folder in megabytes? I'm not sure how to start with this or what to do first.
Assuming you want a starting point, not a solution in a can:Use  to scan a whole directory tree. If you only need to scan one folder, not a whole tree, you can optimize a bit without sacrificing simplicity (particularly on Windows) on Python 3.5 with the new  function that will give you  info for free on Windows (and make it accessible as a lazily cached value on *NIX systems). On earlier versions of Python, a third party  module on PyPI provides the same interface.If not using , you'd use  to get file sizesUse a  to map from file sizes in MB to a  of files that round to that size (or just process the files as you go instead of storing in a container at all). Alternatively, sort with  -ed on the size and use  (with whatever MB granularity you like) to group the resulting files.
