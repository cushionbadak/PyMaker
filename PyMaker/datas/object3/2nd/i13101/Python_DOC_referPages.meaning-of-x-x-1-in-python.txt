I am studying this snippet of python code. What does  mean in last line?
So what that line did is sliced the array, taking all rows () but keeping the second column ()
it is simply like you are specifying the axis. Consider the starting column as 0 then as you go through 1,2 and so on.The syntax is you can also specify a range of row values as per need in row_index also eg:1:13 extracts first 13 rows along with whatever specified in column
