Following is a list in python which contains a list of time for a train with each index as a stoppage for the trainAs evident from the list, this train runs for three consecutive days ( is the starting station). I am trying to get the time difference between two stations , and since using 12-hour format will create chaos i tried using the following script to convert the whole list to 24-hour formatwhich is givingas an output. Is there any way to avoid getting the UTC date?Additionally, I am stuck on how shall I get the time difference between two stations on different days; viz, 09:30PM (day 1) and 12:15PM (day2)
I am trying to get the time difference between two stations , and since using 12-hour format will create chaos i tried using the following script to convert the whole list to 24-hour formatThe day doesn't matter if all you need is to find a time difference for adjacent items:Here's  is the accumulative time between stations starting with the first station that has the arrival time i.e.,  is a time in transit  for the -th station (the time difference between the station and the first station). It is computed as a series of partial sums (like ) of time differences between adjacent stations, namely: stations are identified by their index in the  list (shifted by one compared to the  list) and/or their arrival times -- look at the Station column in the output below is the time difference between adjacent stations -- look at the Adjacent column in the output below is the previous item in the series (the last one) -- it is the same as  in Pythonthe current item is the sum "the current difference + the accumulated sum" -- look at the Total column in the output below.Is there any way to avoid getting the UTC date? The result of  is a naive datetime object that does not correspond to any time zone. There is no point to talk about time zones if you don't know a specific date (year, month, day).I am stuck on how shall I get the time difference between two stations on different days; viz, 09:30PM (day 1) and 12:15PM (day2)It is easy to find the time between adjacent stations and the total time in transit:OutputTo find the time difference between -th and -th stations:
First, convert all the time strings to dates. The day does not matter, but we will need it later.Now, you can keep a running count of days to add, and add those to all the datetimes in the list. Whenever the current time is smaller than the previous, add another day.Now, you can get the adjusted times and the total time difference between the first and last time. To get an output list "day 1, time x", just strip the year and month from the output.Output:Of course, if the time difference between two consecutive times is greater than one whole day, then you are out of luck.
