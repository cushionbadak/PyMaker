I'm wroking c++ with embedding python using boost::python development environment is Windows 7, Visual Studio 2012, boost 1.55(64bit), Python 2.7.10(64bit).the python module uses UDP. It works well on python on console(cmd). but if i run this module on C++(visual studio), recv sockect throws time out exception.I'm using https://github.com/Parrot-Developers/bybopIn here, recvfrom method of _read_loop of Bybop_NetworkAL.py throws time out.p.s Sorry for my not enough english.
I'd post this as a comment if I could... Look into the datetime module, http://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html - You can use datetime.now() and timedelta to accomplish the same thing as you have above.
