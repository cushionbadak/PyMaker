I wrote a very simple Spark code in Python: I get following output and error:However, if I run the following piece of code, I don't get any error:What gives?
Edit:Support for serializing named tuples has been introduced with SPARK-10542.Original answerWhy it doesn't work? Because  call creates a class and classes in Spark are not serialized as a part of the closure. It means you have to create a separate module* and make sure it is available on the workers:Next you can simply import and everything should work as expected:On a side note leading underscore is there for a reason.* It could be done dynamically like this  or by defining  inside  but it is neither pretty or efficient.
