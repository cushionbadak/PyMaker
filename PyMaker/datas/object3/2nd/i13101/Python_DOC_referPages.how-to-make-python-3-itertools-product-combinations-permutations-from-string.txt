Natural Text
Hi!  I want to make mixing strings program in python 3.4. Something like input: string1 = 123, string2 = abc, string3 = 4g6. Output should be like combine of string1, 2 and 3. Example: 1234g6abc. I tried searching in itertools and there was only combine of letters not words. And i want words. Please help.">
Add your strings to a list, use itertools permutations, and then join the result.
