Hey so I'm using argparse to try and generate a quarterly report. This is what the code looks like:the error I receive is: TypeError: init() got an unexpected keyword argument 'type'  as far as I can tell from the argparse documentation type is one of the parameters of the add_argument function. I tried removing this and updating the code to :I then tried to run it with:  and it is giving me the following error:error:unrecognized arguments: 1 2015 I don't know why that is either. Can anyone please shed some light on this.   
What  means is that if the argument is given on the command line then a  value should be stored in the parser. What you actually want is to store the given year (as a string) and quarter (as an int).When you specify  argparse is internally instantiating a  instance whose constructor does not accept a  parameter (since it will always be a boolean (True/False)). You cannot supply  and 'type' at the same time.
The  documentation is not as detailed as it could be (but still has more information than many users can absorb).In particular, the actual information that an argument needs varies with .A  action does not take any parameters (i.e. nargs=0).  It's default value is , and if used the attribute is set to .If you want the user to give one of those four numbers I'd suggest usinghttps://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#choices has a similar example.The examples in https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#action give a pretty good idea of what parameters each action class takes.There is a Python bug/issue discussing improving either the documentation, or the error message when unnecessary parameters are given in the function.  As it stands, it's the Python subclass definition that is issuing the error message.
