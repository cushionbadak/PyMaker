In Python 2.7, I'm getting 'module' has no attribute, and/or'name' is not definederrors when I try to split up a large python file.(I have already read similar posts and the Python modules documentation)Say you have a python file that is structured like this:So I can easily categorize groups of functions together, create a python file for each group, and put them there. The problem is whenever I try to call any of them from the main python file, I get the errors listed above. I think the problem is related to circular dependencies. Since all of the functions rely on the globals, and each other, they are circularly dependent. If I have main_file.py, group_of_functions_1.py, and group_of_functions_2.py, main_file.py will have:and group_of_functions_1.py will haveand group_of_functions_2.py will haveRegardless of whether I use "import package_x" or "from package_x import *" the problem remains. If I take the route of getting rid of the globals, then most of the functions will have 50 parameters they will be passing around which then also need to be returnedWhat is the right way to clean this up?(I have already read similar posts and the Python modules documentation)
One of the sources of your errors is likely the following:When importing, you don't add  to the end of the module name. Do this instead:
