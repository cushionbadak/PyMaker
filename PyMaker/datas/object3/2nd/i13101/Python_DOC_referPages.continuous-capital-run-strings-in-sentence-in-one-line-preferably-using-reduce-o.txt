Natural Text
Here I am trying to get all the continuous capital letter strings in a sentence. I have tried the following which gives an output as 'LJ'I haven't been able to figure out why it doesn't add  and  but it adds only  instead to the list. Does it assume  as a string.My input is : and I wish to get an output as Test case :     Any help is appreciated.Using Reduce I came up with this Finally but its not efficient: 
Finding patterns in strings is what the  module is for:or, if you don't want to include capital letters that are part of another word, you can exclude them using word boundary anchors:Caveat: This only looks for ASCII letters.
With a regular expression and Explanation: matches one or more subsequent captial letters or whitespace returns a list of all matches.
Just for completeness, another solution using :
This is my version using reduce which works as it should for input  it gives output . Its nice to get different ways to solve.I know this is not efficient.
