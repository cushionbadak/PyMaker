In Python, whenever I try to use  or a  on a list like such:The  and  will be  as both methods return . Of course, I am aware that there is a  function for . However, the  does not. So the fix for this is to do:or from another post:Is there a general and elegant way to store literals, edited by methods that return , into a variable?
