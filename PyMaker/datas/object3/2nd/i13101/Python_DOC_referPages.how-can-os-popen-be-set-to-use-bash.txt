I have the following function that is used to execute system commands in Python:I am using the  module instead of the  module because I am dealing with a single environment in which I am interacting with many environment variables etc.How can I use Bash with this type of function instead of the default  shell?
 is implemented in terms of  module.I am dealing with a single environment in which I am interacting with many environment variables etc.each  call creates a new  process, to run  shell command.Perhaps, it is not obvious from the  documentation that says: Open a pipe to or from command "open a pipe" does not communicate clearly: "start a new shell process with a redirected standard input or output" -- your could report a documentation issue.If there is any doubt; the source confirms that each successful  call creates a new child processthe child can't modify its parent process environment (normally).Consider:Output: means that  is empty in the second command because the second command runs in a different  process from the first one.To run several bash commands inside a single process, put them in a script or pass as a string:Example:Output:Note:  is not empty here.If you need to generate new commands dynamically (based on the output from the previous commands); it creates several issues and some of the issues could be fixed using  module: code example.
