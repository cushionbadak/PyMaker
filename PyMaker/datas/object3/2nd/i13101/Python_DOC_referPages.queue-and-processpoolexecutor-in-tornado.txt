I'm attempting to use the new Tornado queue object along with  to allow my webserver to pass off cpu-intensive tasks to other processes. I want to have access to the  object that's returned from the  from the  module so that I can query its state to show on the front-end (e.g. show the process is currently running; show that it has finished).I seem to have two hurdles with this method:How can I submit multiple  objects to the  while also having access to the returned  objects?How can I let the  get access to the  object returned by the  so that I may show the state information on the front-end?Thanks for any help.
What are you trying to accomplish by combining a  and a ? The executor already has it's own internal queue. All you need to do is make the  a global (it doesn't have to be a global, but you'll want to do something similar to a global even if you keep the queue; it doesn't make sense to create a new  each time through 's loop) and submit things to it directly from the handler.
