I am trying to convert input() data to int() with the following code:I get the following odd error when I enter asd2 for example:What am I doing wrong?
The problem that you are facing is that the interpreter raises the error in the  and executes the  block. After that it will start to execute everyline. This will throw the You can overcome that by putting the rest of the  program into the  block. Quoting from the Python tutorial The try ... except statement has an optional else clause, which, when  present, must follow all except clauses. It is useful for code that  must be executed if the try clause does not raise an exception.Another way is to use a sentinel valueThis will also work. However the results may not be as expected. Protip - Use 4 spaces to indent
The problem isn't with the conversion to an .  doesn't get a value if an exception is thrown, but it's used later.You can fix this by putting the code that uses  in the try-block. I'll also add create a function to clean things up.See the ideone here.
This may not be the cleanest solution but it addresses the problem, in your code user_num is not initialized unless it is a number.
