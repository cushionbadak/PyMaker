I have a table similar to the following:Ignore the actual times, point is the days don't line up.  Most of what I've seen for re-shaping has everything nice and square, where my data may end up being sparse reshaped.  Is there an easy way (looking for R solutions, but open to Excel or anything quick) to create a table aggregation similar to the following:Where each person is aggregated to one row (don't know how to handle headers either at this point, open for suggestions.)
Consider this base R solution that uses a running count on the distinct names and the reshapes long to wide by count:OUTPUT
With the assumption that all the lines to be aggregated under the same name are contiguous, this Python scriptdoes the trick.For example, with an input file ofit produces an output file ofIt leverages the power of itertools.groupbyBasically, it keeps grouping the lines as long as the prefix (i.e. the name) doesn't change. When it does it moves on, creating another group on the newly found prefix.It then simply joins the elements of each group on a single line, separated by ','Note: in case you want the header to appear in the output file, change the lineto
