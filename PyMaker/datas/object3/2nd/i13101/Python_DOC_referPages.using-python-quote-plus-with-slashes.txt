I'm using  from  which works great along with its cousin , for making pluses between the spaces such that:  becomes  which is great. However now the issue is that using this effects the path when I have  becomes something like thisWhat should I do. I really want the plusses for the spaces, but I'm torn between doing just a replace on spaces for plusses. Is there a proper treatment in building up the path to start with. I really want to preserve the slashes and the plusses.Flask template view:in the code.py:also:
When you call quote_plus, set safe='/', which is what you are asking for.Check out the docs at https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.htmlNotice that quote has a default parameter safe='/'wherease quote_plus has a default safe=''The difference is illustrated here:output
How about using  instead of ? It will quote '+' with '%20' and leave slash unchanged. I think it is not customisable, because it should conform with certain url standard.
