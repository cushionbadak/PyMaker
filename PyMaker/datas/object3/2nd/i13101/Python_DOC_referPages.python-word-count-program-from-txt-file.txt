Natural Text
I'm trying to write a program that counts the 5 most common words in a txt file. Here is what I have so far:The program as it is counts every word in the .txt file.My question is how to make it so it only counts the 5 most common words in the file so that it displays the words and the word count next to each word.One catch - I can't use dictionary...whatever that means.
Easy, you just need to find the 5 most common words in the file. So you could do something like this:And then, this dictionary will be sorted by values(remember that  return a list). You can use the following code to get the 5 most common words:So the full code looks like:Also, here is a more simple way to do this use use :The output is same as the first solution.

There is a built-in function that sorts a dictionary by key:Now it's up to you to figure out how to get/print only the first five elements ;)Note: of course sorted is also capable to sort other collections.
