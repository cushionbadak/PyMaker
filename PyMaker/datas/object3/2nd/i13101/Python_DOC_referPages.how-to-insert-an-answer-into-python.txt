I am making a game using python and I attempted to insert a question but I do not know how to put in the answer.For example,print ("What is the most popular search engine?")I am unsure what to put after this. In addition, I don't know how to make python move on to the next question.
If you want to get it so that Python asks the user "What is the most popular search engine?" and then stores the answer in a variable then you should use the  method.What this does it it prints "What is the most popular search engine?" and then waits for the user to enter something. Whatever the user enters is then stored in the variable .Now, if you wanted to check to see if the user entered 'google', you could just use a basic if statement. I would recommend using  and  so that what the user enters does not have to be case-sensitive.
