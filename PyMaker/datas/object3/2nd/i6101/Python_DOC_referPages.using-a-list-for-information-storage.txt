I am building a week planner system with 7 buttons, a RFID reader and a Raspberry Pi. I get the activity from the RFID tags and the day from the push buttons. I am playing a sound when a day is entered or an activity is given. I want to save a what activities a planned for what days. For example: Monday - Swimming, Coding, Doctor. So that I can read out what activities are planned for the specific days. Right now, I have code for picking day and activity but I am unsure on how to store the information for later use. Should I create a list for each day and then append activities into the list. Then I can search the list for activities and play sound based on what activities where found in the search? Is the a better way of doing so? 
Lists are great for things you intend to handle in a similar fashion. For example:For longer term storage (beyond a single run of your program), you might consider json for simpler but arbitrary data structures, csv for simple tables,  shelve for a key/value store or sqlite3 for full SQL relational databases. 
I suggest that you learn about Object Oriented programming. You should consider creating a class which represents the data you store in your program. For example, you can make an  class which stores the name of the activity and the day.Remember that variables are only stored in memory. This data disappears when the program ends or the machine is turned off. If you want to store data permanently between program executions, you must save it to a file in some form.
