In this other question it was asked how to tell pylint that multiple non-adjacent parameters are unused without adding a specific comment (e.g., by using ). Many of the answers were approximately "ZOMG YOU'RE DESIGNING IT WRONG" so I promised I would put up an example where this is needed and out of my control. Here is that example.  The "answer" so that pylint would not complain about  and  is tobut the new question is, how to do this without having  or  as parameters?
