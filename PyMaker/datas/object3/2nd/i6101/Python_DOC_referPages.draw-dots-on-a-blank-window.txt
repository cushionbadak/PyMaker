I am an artist. I have Python installed. It works. What I am trying to do is to create images on a white screen (window) based on reiterative algorithms. I can't seem to get anything to put dots on a window. If I could just get a bit of python code that, and the library(s) that contain that code, based on an x,y coordinate, that could draw a dot in that window I pretty much could figure out the rest. Also would be nice to vary the color of the dot.So flow control would look like:Calculate an x,y coordinate (my equations would do that)Specify a dot color (this might always be the same color)Draw the dot at the specified coordinate.Pump the x y answers from 1 above back into equation and calculate a new x,y coordinate.Loop to 2 above a specified number of times.I can pretty much figure all this out but the "draw the colored dot" is beyond me.
I believe the  method in the turtle library that comes with Python is your simplest solution:Turtle also has a  method but it draws from the edge of a circle (based on a radius instead of a diameter) not the center like the  method.  One advantage of  is the outline and fill can be different colors unlike .
Can you install the Pygame module? Something like  from a command line might work for you. If that's not working for you, then look at turtle as suggested by Vijay above, it's included in your python installation.Here's an example using Pygame that draws random circles on a window that should be suitable for you to modify for your purposes:Press the escape key to clear the screen and use the up and down arrows to change the speed. Close the window by pressing the X on the title bar.
