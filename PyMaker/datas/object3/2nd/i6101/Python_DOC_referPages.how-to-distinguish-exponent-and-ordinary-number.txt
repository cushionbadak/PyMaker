The following two expressions return the later is exponent.I am looking for a way to distinguish them for all numbers
This is as documented.str.isdigit()Return true if all characters in the string are digits  and there is at least one character, false otherwise. Digits include  decimal characters and digits that need special handling, such as the  compatibility superscript digits. This covers digits which cannot be  used to form numbers in base 10, like the Kharosthi numbers. Formally,  a digit is a character that has the property value Numeric_Type=Digit  or Numeric_Type=Decimal.If you want to check if python is able to parse a string as a number, an idiomatic approach is to use try-except.
