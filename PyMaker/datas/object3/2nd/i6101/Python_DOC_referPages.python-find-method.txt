CORRECT OUTPUT : 3MY OUTPUT : 2it is not detecting the last substring.
the problem is thatreturns  if not found or the position if found. You want to test for  you're testing for position  (aka ) (https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.find).It's not "not detecting the last substring", it's detecting bogus matches.You could use  instead:Note that using  isn't a bad idea at all, since you don't have to slice the string (it's faster), there's a start position parameter which is handy here:or in one line:note that  doesn't yield the same result because it doesn't consider overlapping strings, like your solution does.
