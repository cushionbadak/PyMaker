I am trying to pass arguments to a function from a list using threads in python (Note:The values to the function should not be hard-coded and all the elements of the list will be passed.)Please look at the sample code here:Here i hard-coded the values to the function ('john','doe')instead of that pass from the list and all the elements will be passed.
I am not sure if I completely understand what you are looking to achieve. My understanding is that you want to start a separate thread for each value in your list, so each value gets processed "in parallel". I modified your  function to do so: creates a separate thread for each value in the list. starts each thread. makes sure each thread is finished before returning from the  function (if you would rathee return immediately, just delete this line).
Your tasks are well suited for use with the  module. In particular,  applies a function to the elements of an iterable.You can use something similar to the  example in the docs:If you find the  syntax to be awkward, you have a couple of alternatives:ORIn all cases, the  block will implicitly call , which will wait for all the tasks to complete.As a rule, don't call a variable : it will shadow the name of the builtin class.
