Suppose I have a numpy array of the form:I want to find the indices of the first index (for every column) where the value is non-zero.So in this instance, I would like the following to be returned:How do I go about this?
Indices of first occurrencesUse  along that axis (zeroth axis for columns here) on the mask of non-zeros to get the indices of first  (True values) -Extending to cover generic axis specifier and for cases where no non-zeros are found along that axis for an element, we would have an implementation like so -Note that since  on all  values returns , so if the  needed is , we would have the final output directly with .Sample runs -Extending to cover all comparison operationsTo find the first , simply use  as  for use in the function. For first ones equal to a certain value , use  and so on for all cases of  possible here.Indices of last occurrencesTo find the last ones matching a certain comparison criteria, we need to flip along that axis and use the same idea of using  and then compensate for the flipping by offsetting from the axis length, as shown below -Sample runs -Again, all cases of  possible here are covered by using the corresponding comparator to get  and then using within the listed function.
