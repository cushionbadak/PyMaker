I am wanting to check if one of a number of regex matches succeeds.  If it does, I want access to the groups in the match.  If I didn't need the groups, I could do something like this:Since I haven't assigned the result of the match to anything, I don't see how to access any of the groups that were part of the match.  So instead I'm assigning the matches to a variable before the conditional.  But that means I'm running all the matches every time, not just the necessary ones.How do I only run the matches that are necessary, while still being able to access the groups from that match at a later time?
I would list up your objects and run through them with a loop and breaking it once you found a match.
You could define a list of patterns and find the first matching one with  as a second argument for  is used to avoid a StopIteration:
