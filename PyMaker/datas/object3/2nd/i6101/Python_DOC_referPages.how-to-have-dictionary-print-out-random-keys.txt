Hi, I am trying to create a vocabulary test on python, but when I run the code, instead of printing out the key, it just prints out "None" What can I do for the code to print out a random key?
You can use random.choice instead of shuffle.shuffle changes the list you send into the function and since you don't save a reference to that list, you don't get anything. Also, it only generates a shuffled version of that list and not a single value.
