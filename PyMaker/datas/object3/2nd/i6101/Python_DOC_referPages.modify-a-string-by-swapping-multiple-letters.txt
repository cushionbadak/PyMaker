Say I have a very long string like  but it is only made up of five letters. Say I want all  to be  and vice versa, and same to  and (an example would be nucleotides in DNA....). The example, after modification, would be . I realized that code like  just wouldn't work. And I would like to know what is the fastest approach since the other approach that comes up to me is just finding every index, which looks a little bit complicated.
Since the requirement is for multiple replacements, its better to use  by creating a mapping table first using .Example using a shortened version of your sample where  ,  ,  , Another method would be to make use of  function, but which would require more amount of code lines for the same functionality. It can be done by using a temporary placeholder for replacements.Example : suppose for just  and  Here  is used as placeholder. As you can see, this becomes tiresome with large replacement requirements.NOTE : in the above method, the placeholders should be unique too and should not be already present in the string.
