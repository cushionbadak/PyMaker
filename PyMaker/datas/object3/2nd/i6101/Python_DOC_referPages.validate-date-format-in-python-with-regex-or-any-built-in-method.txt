I am having the python code that needs to validate the following date format:YYYYMMDDAbove format does not contain any special characters like [:,-,/].I have mentioned example like : 20170922We need to validate that above is valid date format by following YYYYMMDD format.if it's not, then it should raise some sort of error. 
you can use datetime for this (in python 2.7)if you date is not valid than you get:a ValueError Exception
