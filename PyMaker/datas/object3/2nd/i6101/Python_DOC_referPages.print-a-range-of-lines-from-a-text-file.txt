Natural Text
I have a text file (the U.S. constitution) and I want to print just the preamble. Here's the code I have so far:If, on the 5th line of code I type, it works, and prints just the first line of the text, which is simply the word "THE". But I want it to print lines 5-11, which is the preamble, but it always comes back saying the index is out of range... How can I fix this?
Make sure everything is at the right indentation level and that the print statement isn't inside the for loop. You can also reduce it down with list comprehension to make it clearer. 
You are doing  inside the loop. So the first line is added to the  and then you print 4th to 10th of it - it only yet contains 1 line.Move it outside the loop.
Alright, the issue with your code is that you try to  lines from 5 to 11 before you form the list. To clarify, in your posted code when  is executed your  list looks like . Thus, the interpreter correctly says that you specified index which is out of range since the list only contains 1 item.You should change your code like that:By the way, if the intention of your  statement was to terminate reading of the file after you read the first 11 lines, that is not what you did. Your  statement will be executed in the end of reading the first line.
You can use the readlines() method to generate a list of lines from the file. Then you can use join() to print out the specific lines you are looking for.All that the "".join() bit does is take list elements 4 through 10 from your newly formed list and join them together end-to-end. Since your list elements already have a newline character, there is no need to join them with a newline. Take a look at your list to see what I mean.
