All I would like to do is to enter three scores for player1, and have them appended to the list please:
list.append() - it's a method, so
 assigns a value to  method, which is read only and its not what you want.  makes and actual call to  methodThis can be solved with little research. Please grab a good Python book and spent few hours on it. Good luck!

You are trying to assing a value to list.append function. Rather you should give it as an argument to list.append function.Below code would do and is simplified one.
 is a method of a list, which means you should "call" it, for example like . Also,  accepts an argument, which is the string to print before getting the input - you can do something like . Using this, it might make sense to write a reusable function that gets a score for a certain player and round:The round argument is named  as  is already a Python builtin. Beware that this will crash if the user doesn't enter an integer, but that would take quite a bit more logic to fix. We can also write a function that collects a player's scores for a whole round:This uses a  loop to append a score for each round (note how the logic of actually getting the score has been abstracted away). It's prefixed with an underscore as this isn't the "final" version. Using this, we might even write a similar function to get scores for different players:However, we can actually rewrite both without needing  at all, with Python list comprehensions (which should be well documented elsewhere), like so:Now, we can use our functions like so:To get this behaviour:
