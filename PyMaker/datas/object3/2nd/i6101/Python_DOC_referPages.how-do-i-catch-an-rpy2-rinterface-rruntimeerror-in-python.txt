Now, for some of my inputs that I feed into the R function, R returns the following error:rpy2.rinterface.RRuntimeError: Error in integrate(PIntegrand, lower =  0, upper = Inf, lambda, vbar, eta,  :    roundoff error was detectedHow do I go about catching this RuntimeError in Python?
The  is derived from  so you should be able to catch it as you would with any other exception.More on this: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#handling-exceptions
Python makes catching exceptions relatively easy.
