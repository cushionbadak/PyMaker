I'd like to write a regex to replace matched string question.A is the short string and B is a long one contains A.I want to remove A part in B, as long as it contains A with “ (100%)”.This line works well.And it returns:However, when the A string contains “/” and “(”, “)”. It doesn’t work. Like:When I run the same line:nothing happens.How can I make the line work?

This would involve appending a backslash before each such character., however, provides a nice little convenience function, , that does this for you.Here's what you'd need to pass as your modified regex:
