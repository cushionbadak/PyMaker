I'm attempting Project Euler problem 484.  I'm in the beginning stages of the problem and am just searching for patterns in the numbers.The problem requests me to find an "arithmetic derivative".  For example, to find the arithmetic derivative of 60:60 = 2^2 * 3^1 * 5^160' = (2/2 + 1/3 + 1/5) * 60 = 92I utilized the built in primefac algorithm, and created a method for the arithmetic derivative.  Here is my code:Python casts 31.0 as an int to 30. Is this a floating point error? What is more perplexing is that  prints 31.0 but returns False when evaluated against each other. 
Yes, this is a floating point issue. There's an easy fix, though... since  will always by definition be evenly divisible by , you can cut out the floating point math entirely:
