I have an array of tuples like:I want to add the values  to a new data frame:not sure how to iterate through the array while adding a value to the column t.
 is not exactly a  but rather a  (see  source code), which allow to access its fields like arguments, and the names of these fields. As in your case it encapsulates two  (see  doc) you can use it directly as values for your new columns.inspired from this answer
