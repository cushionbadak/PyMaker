I've been following Python documentation on the SQLite tutorial and I managed to create an Employee table and write to it.I've been reading about the Write-Ahead Logging, but I can't find a tutorial that explains how to implement it. Can someone provide an example?I notice Firefox, which uses SQLite, locks the file in such a way that if you attempt to delete the sqlite file while using Firefox, it will fail saying "file is open or being used"(or something similar), how do I achieve this? I'm running Python under Windows 10.
The PRAGMA journal_mode documentation says:If the journal mode could not be changed, the original journal mode is returned. [â€¦]  Note also that the journal_mode cannot be changed while a transaction is active.So you have to ensure that the database library does not try to be clever and automatically starts a transaction.
