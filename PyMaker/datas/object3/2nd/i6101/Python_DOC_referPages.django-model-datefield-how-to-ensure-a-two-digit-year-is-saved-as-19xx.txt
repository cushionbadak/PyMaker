I have a form that takes a user's birthdate. By default, Django accepts three input formats for dates, including MM/DD/YY. However if I enter something like 02/13/45, it saves as 02/13/2045. I've looked through the places I expected to find some threads in the docs but still nothing. Can someone push me in the right direction?
DateField just uses the  method, which in turn uses the underlying C  implementation; there's no way to change the way it parses a two-digit year. As mentioned in the comment, probably the best way to do this is to check if it's in the future, then subtract 100.
