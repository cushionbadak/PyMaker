This question already has an answer here:Can I get a python object from its memory address?                    2 answers                I have looked around the forums and I can't seem to find an answer (and there might not be one actually) as to whether or not you can get the name of a variable or the value by using its memory location in Python.  In other words, when I declare  and assign the value  to the variable , and then I use the  function on  I get the location in memory where the value for  is stored.  Is there a way to, say, print the variable name  or the value  by referencing the value that  returns (either the decimal value or converting the decimal value to hex with the  function)?  I tried a few things like  and just  and no luck. Any help would be greatly appreciated and thank you in advance!Cheers!
This is possible with ctypes:This will, of course, work if the object is still there.
