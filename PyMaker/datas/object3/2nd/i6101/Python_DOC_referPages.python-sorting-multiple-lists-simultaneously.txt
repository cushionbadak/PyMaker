This is slightly different than most of the sorting questions on here and I haven't been able to figure out how to get this to work. I have 3 lists, and 2 of them I need to match the order of the 3rd list. There are integers in list 2 that correspond to the same indexed word in list 1. If there is an item in the 3rd list not in the other two i need to generate random numbers for it. The third list is also a tuple, but it's sorted so not sure that will matter. if a word is in lists are in 1 and 2 but not in 3 we can drop those. For example:what I'd like the results to be is 
Create a dictionary by ping the corresponding elements of  and . Then, you can create the final list by ting elements from that dict, or a list of random numbers if the element is not present.Some notes:I renamed  and  in the output to  and .Here, same words refer to the same numbers list instance from , i.e. if you modify one, you modify all of them. If that's not what you want, use  in the list comprehension for  to create new lists for each element.Using  with default might be a bit wasteful here, as it creates all those lists and calls  even if the default value is not used. Instead, you might want to use a ternary: Both ways, if the same word appears twice in  that's not also in , those two words will get different random numbers in ; if you want the same random lists for same words, use
