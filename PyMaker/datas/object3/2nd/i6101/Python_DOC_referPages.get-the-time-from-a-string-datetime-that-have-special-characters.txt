Natural Text
I am trying to get the time from this string  while using the code below:However  is slightly unique as it is appended with  that is appended behind, and at times it can be in 3-digits form eg. Instead of doing a roundabout method, using split('-') then remove the last element, is there a better method that I can get the time directly?
I would suggest using , which will avoid having to  the  result (since the date contains other dashes).There is no way to use  with characters to ignore, date string and format must match:If string [...] has excess data after parsing,  is raised.
