How lazy is evaluation in Python? If I have code that looks likeand the logging effective level is such that debug messages are ignored, do I incur a performance penalty for having this line?
This will not be lazily evaluated, but Python logging has a solution to this problem: .Your list will be built and formatted only if logger's level is higher than .
You will have a performance penalty because  will be created before calling  even if debug messages are ignored.  There is no lazy evaluation in Python. Every line is evaluated/executed before the next line. It means that expressions are evaluated when they are bound to variables.
