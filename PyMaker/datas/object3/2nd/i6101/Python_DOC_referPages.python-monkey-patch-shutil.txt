I'm trying to monkey patch shutil.copyfileobj() function, in order to change its default length from 16*1024 to a larger value (128*1024). Internally, other shutil methods like move call the copyfileobj() function, and I want those calls to be affected by the monkey patch as well. This doesn't seem to work:I would expect this to print "COPYING FILE FAST" but it doesn't. Is there any way to achieve what I'm trying to do?
My test case was broken. shutil.move() only performs a copy if the source and destination files are on different devices. Here's an updated version that shows the monkey patch worked:
