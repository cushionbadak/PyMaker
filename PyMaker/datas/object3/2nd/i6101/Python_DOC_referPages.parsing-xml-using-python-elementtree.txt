Natural Text
I have an XML document in the following formatHow can I extract the text from 'D' inside H tag and also all the text inside the F tags.
From ElementTree docs:We can import this data by reading from a file:Or directly from a string:and later in the same page, 20.5.1.4. Finding interesting elements:Which translate to:output:
You did not specifiy what exactly you whant to use so i recommend lxml for python. For getting the values you whant you have more possibiltys: With a loop:Output: ['14/11/2017', 'The quick', 'brown', 'fox', '14/11/2017', 'The lazy', 'fox']With xpath:Output:14/11/201714/11/2017The quickbrownfoxThe lazyfoxBoth have there own advantages but give you a good starting point.I recommend the xpath since it gives you more freedom when values are missing. 
This should help you
