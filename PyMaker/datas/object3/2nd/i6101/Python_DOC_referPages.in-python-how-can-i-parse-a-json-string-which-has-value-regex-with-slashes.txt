My application gets a request with regex in its JSON value.I use below code to parse it:But it fails because of non-JSON characters. I tried many ways, One of them is thisBease64 encoding and decoding :Observe the output -   : 1 extra slash added.Clearly now not able to distinguish between the one with 2 slashes and one slashes.Since the data is regex, I want it in the original format in a variable.How can I get that?
The issue here is that your json isn't properly encoded, so you're having trouble decoding it.  This is a chicken & egg problem.  You need to investigate how the json is being created before it's passed to you (if you're in control there) or reach out to the person generating it.
