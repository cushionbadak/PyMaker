I'm trying to rename some files which all start with the same string (Vertragshandbuch_Beitrag_) in a folder using pyhton on windows.An example file-name: Vertragshandbuch_Beitrag_004_Term Sheet.docxNew file-name should look like this: 4.docxMy current code looks like this:I'm getting this error:Traceback (most recent call last):  File "C:(...)rename.py", line 6, in     number = m.group(1)AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'I checked the regex with several filenames here: https://regex101.com/ and it was always a perfect match.I'm new to python and before asking the question I searched a long time and all the tips about normalizing the file name didn't help.I changed the script after input from blurp to:Still the same error and still a match when I check the regex.To test the regex match I used now:Still same error message.Okay, as a last resort I tried this in a folder which contained only the file Vertragshandbuch_Beitrag_003_Letter.docx: I got the following result:<_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(0, 40), match='Vertragshandbuch_Beitrag_003_Letter.docx'>Looks like it is matching, still the error. 
When you call  if the string supplied doesn't match the regex pattern, it will equal .What I'm assuming the problem is, is that you are coming across a filename that doesn't match the regex pattern you have supplied.Even if the regex matches your files correctly, the first time  returns  it will break unless you explicitly catch it. Otherwise, when you call , it doesn't exist and it raises an error.This worked for me when I made files with the name format specified:I created files with names like you supplied (numbers 001 - 007) andthis was my output:I hope this helps.
