To get the desired  you need to encode the hex digits of your  string to bytes. One way to do that which works on both Python 2 & Python 3 is to use .Your  function is a bit odd. It won't work on Python 3, since  objects don't have an  method. In Python 2,  is just a synonym for .Anyway, here's some code that works on both Python 2 & Python 3.outputThe output is identical on Python 2 & Python 3.BTW, it would be simpler to do this task in Python 3, which makes a clean distinction between text and byte strings. Also, the Python 3  module has a  function.
