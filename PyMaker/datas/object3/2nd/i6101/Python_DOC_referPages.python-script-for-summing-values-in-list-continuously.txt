I am trying to make a function "add" that will be able to sum elements of list continuously and return a new list of sums. In python there can be cases where input is not a list, or there are other objects in it instead of integers like string characters or float numbers, in these cases I have to return 'Invalid input'Eg :How do I do it?
numpy cumsum is likely the most adapted to what you are looking for:output:
There are two levels in this.Find if elements in the list are all  :If its  : print invalid ; otherwise continue with the computation.Give the cumulative sum of previous elements :#driver values :Or, an even easier method following  methodology :
Using  to get cumsum followed by  to validate if any element is stringPutting in function:
Result

we can use numpy cumsum to get the list of cumulative values.the above snippet output is 
This is the method that sum up only a valid int or float listthe method check if the values in the list are int or float values
