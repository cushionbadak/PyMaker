I've got this simple script that processes files using inotify module and mulit-threading:The problem I've got is that the watched directory can have many files before the script is actually started.I thought about something like the example below but this won't start "yielding" inotify generator until all existing files are processed and it will also miss new events created during this time:Is there a way to manually send  event or perhaps add these files to  generator?
Here's an example that processes the old files inside one of the workers allowing for new events to be captured in parallel while processing the old, existing files. For the record, even using your linear code, I had no trouble with missing events.Also, the PyInotify module is "defunct and no longer available." according to this inotify module which I used.Test:Start with a directory containing 10 files. Start the program, wait 2 seconds, and then create 5 new files. Look for the "submit" messages to see that the events were received and queued while still processing the initial files and that the new files are eventually handled.
