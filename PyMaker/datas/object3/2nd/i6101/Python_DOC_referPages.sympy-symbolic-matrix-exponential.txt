I am am trying to find out, if I can somehow find a matrix exponential in kind of closed form for the symbolic matrix:howeverseems not to work, "TypeError: cannot create mpf from a1"!Then I tried to get an estimate using the series expansion, but again:gives: "ValueError: Matrix det == 0; not invertible". I guess they try to get the power of the matrix by joran blocks and my structure is not good for that. How can I proceed anyway?  can be calculated, but the sum over  and  not?!
The method  belongs to mpmath library, used by SymPy for numerical calculations. It only works for numerical matrices.SymPy uses  for matrix exponentiation. I recommend using it with , as the output of   for your matrix is more complex than it could be. The simplified result, ,  isIf one wishes to compute a partial sum of the power series for exp(A), the way to do it is not because the above will attempt to raise A to symbolic power n before plugging in specific values. Raising a matrix to symbolic power is   implemented only for invertible A; it's hard to imagine what it should be for non-invertible ones. Instead, use Python's , giving it a zero matrix as initial value of the accumulator:
