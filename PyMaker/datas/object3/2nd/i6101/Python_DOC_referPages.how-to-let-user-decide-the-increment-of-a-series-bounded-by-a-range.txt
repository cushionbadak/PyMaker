I want to print a list of number which is bounded by the range -2 <= x <= 2 in an incremental value such that the list always start with -2 and ends with 2 or vice versa. I'm looking to let the user input an increment value i.e. 0.5 or 0.05. From the range given above it is evident that the largest increment would be 4. I'm looking to prompt an error message whenever the user inputs an increment value that's > 4 and also when they input an increment value that doesn't allow the list to start printing from 2 and finishes at -2 i.e. when the increment value is 0.23.The way I thought I could do would be to use the modulus operator where if (4%increment value) = str() i.e. a whole number means that the given increment value is valid for that range. However I'm slightly stuck since when I run my code I end up in a never ending loop. Below is what I've done so far, so hoping somebody can help me out here:As you can see I've tried to create a function which checks the increment. In the end I'm looking to print the list using something likewhich I can use to do other things. I need to use these x values and plot them into an arctan(x) function that I've approximated using a Taylor Series with a N value i.e. the number of iterations in the Taylor Series and compare them side by side with a real arctan(x) function basically. And then graph them. Thanks in advance.
let increment be .if  is less than 0, checkfind  by evaluating: Check  by plugging it into the above equation and verify resultelse if  is greater than 0, checkfind  by evaluating: Check  by plugging it into the above equation and verify resultelse, not possible - cannot go anywhere with an increment of zero. Throw an exception or print error message
This is how I would do it (without the user input routine)The infinite loop in your user input is explained in this question which @wwii linked in the comments
