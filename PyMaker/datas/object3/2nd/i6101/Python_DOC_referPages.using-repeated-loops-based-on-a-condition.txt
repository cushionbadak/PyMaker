I have no idea how to look up what I'm trying to do because I can only really describe it in layman's terms right now. Essentially what I think I need to do is to find a way to call a loop as many times as given, but nested. I am trying to do this for a dice rolling simulator for fun, but I'm running into issues with not hard-coding it. Here's what I have:Right now the function is hard-coded for 3 dice rolled. However, I want to make it dependent on the dice parameter. I also considered permutations/combinations, but I don't know how I would swing that either. Any advice/help is appreciated. I realize that the while/for loop is trash, and I would prefer using a consistent method. Think of the code there as my brainstorming. I'm working toward having python print out a line of each combination and the number of times that combination was rolled.
You can use a recursive function:Output:
You can factor out the loop count generation using itertools.product:If you want combinations without ordering, there's also combinations_with_replacement:The result was sorted (since the input range was sorted, it keeps the ordering), so you could sort your dice within each roll to get the same format. By the way, here's a distribution test using some standard library types:
