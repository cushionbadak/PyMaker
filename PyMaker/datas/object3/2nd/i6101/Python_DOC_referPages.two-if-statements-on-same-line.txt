Natural Text
Very new to this, and cant seem to get these two to print on the same line. Python 3Keep getting:cold andrainyI need:cold and rainy
 has an  parameter whose default value is , a newline. Call the first prints with  and they won't skip to the next line.
on the end of each print statement there is a \n which means "enter" or "new line"build your str with + signs and print the build-up string at the end.
Each call to  will result in the text being printed on its own line because a new line character is appended. This is mentioned in the documentation - The default value for  is why you are seeing a new line after each call to .What you could do is build a string variable in your conditional statements and then only print once at the end - In addition, I see you are assigning string values instead of boolean values. In python  is not the same as . You should assign proper boolean values. Take the following example - 
The print() function in Python takes more than one argument. One of the arguments is the .Now usually, the print function has a default argument of , where  is newline. This is the reason why your output comes as:cold andrainy - instead of:cold and rainyOne solution to the many is to specify . The  determines what the printed string will end with. For example:So to get your output on the same line, you can try the following:This will override the default argument of  and you will get the desired output.
Rather than two print calls, you can create a single string and print once.Consider:In this case you are using the boolean value of each  and  to index a tuple of strings to create a single string with all combinations.You can also use the Python ternary to accomplish the same:
You can also try this:
Use a logical and:
