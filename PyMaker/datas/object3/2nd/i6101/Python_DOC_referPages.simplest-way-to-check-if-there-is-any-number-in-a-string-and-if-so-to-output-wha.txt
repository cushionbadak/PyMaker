Most of the questions I've found are biased on the fact they're looking for letters in their numbers, whereas I'm looking for numbers in what I'd like to be a numberless string.I need to enter a string and check to see if it contains any numbers and if it does reject it.The function  only returns  if ALL of the characters are numbers. I just want to see if the user has entered a number so a sentence like"I own 1 dog" or something.Any ideas?
You can use  function, with the  function, like thisAlternatively you can use a Regular Expression, like this
You can use a combination of  and :The function will return  if a digit exists in the string, otherwise .Demo:
https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.htmlYou should better use regular expression. It's much faster.
use Ref: https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#str.isalphaReturn true if all characters in the string are alphabetic and there  is at least one character, false otherwise.
You could apply the function isdigit() on every character in the String. Or you could use regular expressions.Also I found How do I find one number in a string in Python? with very suitable ways to return numbers. The solution below is from the answer in that question.Alternatively:For further Information take a look at the regex docu: http://docs.python.org/2/library/re.htmlEdit: This Returns the actual numbers, not a boolean value, so the answers above are more correct for your caseThe first method will return the first digit and subsequent consecutive digits. Thus 1.56 will be returned as 1.  10,000 will be returned as 10. 0207-100-1000 will be returned as 0207. The second method does not work.To extract all digits, dots and commas, and not lose non-consecutive digits, use:
What about this one?
You can accomplish this as follows:https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#str.isdigitUsing  also means not having to resort to exception handling (try/except) in cases where you need to use list comprehension (try/except is not possible inside a list comprehension).
You can use NLTK method for it.This will find both '1' and 'One' in the text:
You can use range with count to check how many times a number appears in the string by checking it against the range:
Simpler way to solve is as
I'm surprised that no-one mentionned this combination of  and :in python 3 it's probably the fastest there (except maybe for regexes) is because it doesn't contain any loop (and aliasing the function avoids looking it up in ). Don't use that in python 2 as  returns a , which breaks  short-circuiting
This code generates a sequence with size n which at least contain an uppercase, lowercase, and a digit. By using the while loop, we have guaranteed this event.
