This can be done with the  object's   which makes it really easy:The documentation states:Return a list of the n most common elements and their counts from the most common to the least. So as it returns both the  and their  and we only want the , we still need to use a :
common_list is a dictionary, can't slice it (common_list[:9] won't work). You probably have to convert the common_list into an actual list and sort that one based on the occurrences.
You can use the following one-liner:why?Well you essentially have a  of words:and then you can get the counts of each elements with the   so by taking  which gives:and then we need to sort this and that is done by sorting on the second element of each  with . Which in our case would give:then we need to reverse it with  and take the first  elements with . Which would leave us with:If you just want the , just take the first element from each  in the  list with:
