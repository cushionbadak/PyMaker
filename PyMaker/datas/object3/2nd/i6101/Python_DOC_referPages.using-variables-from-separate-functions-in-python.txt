I am currently working on a coding project where I have set several functions. I am trying to figure out how to use variables from different function. I have tried using 'self' but it hasn't worked. Can anyone help me sort out my code? It's obviously not finished yet, but I would really appreciate guidance with how to correct my errors and use variables in different functions. Thank you very much!!
you can find everything in the Python documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html?highlight=class%20attributes%20access#class-objects So you need just create and then call class's attributes.Also you could use the best python practice DRY (don't repeat yourself) and merge two 'if' statements in def sign_up3 like this: 'if ag1 > 90 and ag1 < 16' (another and shorter way is 'if 16 < ag1 < 90')Hope it helped anyhow.best regards and good luck.P.S.: please, use the indentations.
You can use global variable. Assign the variable outside the function. Then inside the function called the variable with global in front of it. For example:
