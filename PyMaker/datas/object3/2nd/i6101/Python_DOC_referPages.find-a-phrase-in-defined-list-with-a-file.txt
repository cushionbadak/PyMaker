The reason for your error:The  operator as used in:for a string operand on the right side (i.e. ) requires a corresponding string operand on the left hand side. This operand consistency check is implemented by the  method, where the call to  is made from the string on the right hand side (see cpython implemenetation). Same as:You're however passing a list, , instead of a string.An easy way to resolve this is by check that any  of the items in the list are contained in the current line using the builtin   function:Or since you have just two items use the  operator (pun unintended) which short-circuits in the same way as :
You could also  the terms in  to a regular expression like  and use  or  to find the terms. This way, you can also enclose the pattern in word-boundaries  so it does not match parts of longer words, and you also see which term was matched, and where.
