For example, if I have a list like [a,b,c,d], and I needed to check if the elements at index 1,2 were b or c, then it would be true. For example, in [a,b,c,d], at index 1 there's a 'b' and at index 2 there's a 'c' which returns true. However, if the elements in those indexes were not a combination of b and c then false. So there has to be a 'b' or 'c' in index 1 and 2, cannot be (b and b) or (c and c). I'm not sure how to compare this.. Any hints?[a,b,c,d] is True because elements in index 1 and 2 contain a combination of b or c
A general solution to this is to use set membership.  So you could so:This will create a set from  and , and check if that set contains exactly the elements  and .
You can use a  for this, assuming the types you're interested in are hashable.This is similar to a solution using , but allows for cases where you care about the number of a certain element
Given a list of items and a slice to match:all you need is:Note:  returns a reversed version of .Alternative set-based version:
