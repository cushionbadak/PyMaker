I'm trying to build a simple tkinter GUI window around my flask application for noobs in my office. I want the script to perform these tasks in the following order:Start the flask web serverOpen a tkinter GUI window with one button. When pressed, that button opens the app's index page (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:5000)Terminate the flask web server when the tkinter gui window is closedThis is what I have so far but the app runs independently of the tkinter window and I must terminate the flask app using crtl+c before I even see the gui window:So how can I run a process while the app's running?
OptionsThe flask application is blocking your GUI.  You have two options:threading/multithreadingseparate applicationsMultiple ThreadsIt is possible to write  applications with multiple threads, but you must take care to do it. must be run within the primary thread cannot be accessed or implemented from any thread other than the primarySeparate ProcessesI would recommend using the  module.  If you separate our your functionality into two applications and use the subprocess module to start/stop the flask application, I think you will have what you want.
I would suggest taking a look at the Klein web micro-framework which runs on Twisted Python. It's similar to Flask and may suit your needs and will allow you to run it all in a single process.You can integrate it with the event loop of various UI toolkits, including tkinter.
