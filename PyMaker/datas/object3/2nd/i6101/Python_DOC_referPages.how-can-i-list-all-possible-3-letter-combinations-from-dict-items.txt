Natural Text
I'm making a consecutive letter checker and I got this problem and its supposed to return all the triple letter combinations from the keyboard, however, I don't understand what I'm doing wrong with the last part and how I could make it work? I can only get it to print the 3 letter combinations for the  not the  in the dict. The result I'm looking for is all possible 3 letter combinations from the 'items()' to be printed out in a list.I call the function by writingThe output is given by this code:['lin', 'ine', 'ne1', 'e1', '1', '', '', '', 'lin', 'ine', 'ne2', 'e2', '2', '', '', 'lin', 'ine', 'ne3', 'e3', '3']The wanted output is:['qwe', 'wer', 'ert', 'rty', 'tyu', 'yui', 'uio', 'iop', 'asd', 'sdf', 'dfg', 'fgh', 'ghj', 'hjk', 'jkl', 'zxc', 'xcv', 'cvb', 'vbn', 'bnm']
If you want to store all these combinations of keyboards, you have to iterate over the values of the dictionary. You write however:So you have to rewrite it to:Or more elegant:These generate:Note that most Python interpreters have unordered dictionaries, so the order of the lines can be different.
