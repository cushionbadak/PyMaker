There's quite a few issues here.You're redefining Python's builtin  function, and defining it as a variable, containing an empty dictionary (which is not even a list).You then throw away that empty dictionary and redefine  as the result of . That's not gonig to do what you want, because  returns an integer (https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.system). It looks like you were expecting it to return a list of results.You're then trying to use the  loop to iterate over that integer, which is what's giving you the . (which your program never gets to due to the error above) literally runs , you're not substituting  for the value of variable .Rather than using os.system to run , it would arguably be better to use Python's  (see https://www.pythoncentral.io/how-to-traverse-a-directory-tree-in-python-guide-to-os-walk/) to work through the directory tree yourself, rather than trying to manually parse the output of .
