I have a dataset where I am trying to find if a point lies on a line, and if not, what the closest point to that line is. If the point is on the line, then I want that to be the point that matches with the endpoints of the line, if not I then want the nearest point to pair up with the endpoints.Currently, my prorgram will return if the point lies exactly on the line, however, I am not sure how to get the points that vary slightly from the line to pair up.Here's my code:you can see where I was attempting to define a range off of the line where values would be accepted here:however I began to get duplicate values, and still not every data point was paired. as seen here:the optimal output should have 1-500 as the first digit with no number being repeated.Is there a function already in Python to perform this calculation? Or is there a math equation I can apply?
not sure to understand exactly your codewhat is the point, what is the line in your code.but scipy.spatial.distance may have functions you are looking for:for example:would give you the closest index of the line from the point
