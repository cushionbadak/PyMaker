Newbie question about scope: in the following example, how is  able to get access to  and  etc. That is, why don't those names have to be qualified with a , for example? The code is directly from the python docs (https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#property):Update: based on commentConversely if I had a class like thisThis would fail. Is that because CPython has no idea what's in  until I actually try to run it (and at that point we are no longer in the class scope)? 
The class is its own namespace until it is finalized, and so names inside it don't need to be qualified during class definition. (In fact, they can't be: the class doesn't yet have a name, so there is no way to specify what namespace the names are in.)In your class definition, , , and  can be used unqualified because the  call is executed during class definition.After the class is finalized, the class has a name, and for methods that are called on instances, the instance has a name (traditionally ). Accessing attributes and methods at this point requires qualifying the name with either the class or instance reference (e.g.  or ).
That is because there are two different scopes. One is  and one is .When you define a function in a class, that function is defined in  scope. You can build a minimal example:You can see that when defining , we can directly access variable  as they are in the same scope .But when you use a  scope variable in a function, that is another scope . So in this case you need to manually specify scope.Actually, this behave varies from language to language.
