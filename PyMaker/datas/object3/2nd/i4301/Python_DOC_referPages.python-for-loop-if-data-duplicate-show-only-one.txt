hello newbie python learner here. i got littlebit confused, i have data like thisand i want to show it if day are duplicate or acidentally have twice it will ignore another and only show one that have hour & minutes below another.in this case i have 2 data that duplicate on i want its only showsince hours/minutes lower than otheri do like thisbut its print all the data, not as i want.
So the issue here is that these two data are not equivalent:because they differ on the minute value. So == will say that they are different. 
Datetime provide a date get function, see datetime.date(). Just compare the date
