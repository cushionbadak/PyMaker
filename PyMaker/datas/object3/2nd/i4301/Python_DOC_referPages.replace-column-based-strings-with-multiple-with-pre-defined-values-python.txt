If it is TU then it should replace it with PL. The values can be random.My approach would be like below Read a line and then go to column 1read each character and replace one by one by using replace valuesGo to column 4 and then read each character and replace one by onego to next line and so on....I feel this might be poor way of coding. Is there any different way than above approach? Please suggest a method.Column's may be different for different files. It should be dynmaic
