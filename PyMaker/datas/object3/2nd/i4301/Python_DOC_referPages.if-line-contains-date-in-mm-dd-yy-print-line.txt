Natural Text
I want to identify if a string contains a date formatted as MM/DD/YY. It can be any date, as long as its in that format. Not sure how I would denote this. Data:This is one account's worth of data. There are approx 30 accounts I need to iterate through. The issue is that each section of data is separated by some text that is not necessary.   My current script grabs the account # along with yesterday's data:I was hoping that there would be a way to just find any string that began with a date formatted as MM/DD/YY
