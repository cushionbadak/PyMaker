I want to:Pass a function around, making it receive one argument at first, and then the other later.Here are the details:In the line:I passed the function sa_dir as an argument to SuLQ, while giving sa_dir one argument wj (the direction vector). the other argument for sa_dir is given in the function(where g is another name for sa_dir(wj,di) with argument wj already fixed)when executing But it seems that python does not allow this. Here is the error i got.I don't want to hard-code wj into sa_dir because I want to change wj later.Anyone has got suggestions? Thanks in advance.(Just in case you are interested, I am re-implementing a paper's framework using python.)(http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.126.209&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
Your answer is the  function, which takes one function and part of the arguments and then applies them later with all added arguments:
