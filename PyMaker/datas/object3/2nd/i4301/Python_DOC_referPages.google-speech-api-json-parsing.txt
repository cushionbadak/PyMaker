I have obtained the results from google speech in a variableOn this it throws errorFor the rest of parsing I wroteWhat am I doing wrong?
The dict doesn't need any further json methods, you can work with it as is. Yields this output:
The JSON parser in Python expects your blob to use double quotation marks, since that is the JSON standard.You could replace the single quotes with double quotes, as explained in this answer. However, I’m pretty sure the problem can be solved elsewhere, since the Google API most likely uses valid JSON in it’s responses. How do you parse the response from Google’s API?
The problem in your snippet is that you're passing a dict to json.loads. json.loads decodes json to dict, so it redundant and wrong.read the docs
