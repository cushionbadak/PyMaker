I want to merge dictx2 and dictx3 to dictx1 and get the output as "{'C': ['D', 'A','3','4'], 'sXZ': ['W', '3KL', 'L', 'E','S']}"I wrote below codeError:    dictx1[i] = list(lix[i][x] for x in range(len(lix[i])) for lix in ds)NameError: name 'lix' is not definedBut it already there with the 'for lix in ds'. I can write the code as below to get the same answer. But I want to know what's wrong with the above one line for codefor i in dictx2.keys():print (dictx1)
output
You can use a  and add all lists in a loop:If you don't want a  as the result, add  to turn it into a normal dict.
