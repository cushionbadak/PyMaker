For image processing I tend to use python to speed up my workflow. But what if there is missing functionality and you only find a library written in c++?For this special case, one could write a c++ extension and import it in python. The extension relies on openCV which would be bundled into the extension. But python can already use openCV on its own. So I would end up with 2 versions of openCV in my programm. Is there a way around this?
I am not sure I understand what you mean. So you have a third library with C++ that has some functionality which is lacking in OpenCV. You then want to talk to this library in Python together with the Python API from OpenCV. The extension you linked is just a way to include python in a C++ program and does not necessarly need OpenCV. Does the third library use OpenCV as well?In general you can say:If you do not modify OpenCV you do not need two versions. You install one and just have to make sure that another library that uses OpenCV as well links to the version you have used in the Python API when you build it.If you do modify OpenCV you should build it yourself with your changes and then use the Python API from this self build OpenCV to be used in your applications.
