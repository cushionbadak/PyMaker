I apologize if this is a bit basic, but I'm mostly a JavaScript developer so I'm unfamiliar with the way Python interprets code. It looks like I'm running into some sort of async/hoisting error on the following code:The error I'm getting is this:How do I deal with asynchronous issues like this in Python? Am I supposed to define the for loop as a function and use it as a callback?solution:Alex Hall was correct, my if test was failing because I forgot to convert resultsLength to an int, like soFor the record, I really shouldn't be getting downvotes for asking a "stupid" question if the majority of people are upvoting the wrong answer. Thanks, Alex, for correctly pointing out the issue.
Python is not running the code asynchronously, all your conditions such as  were false because  is something else.In this case your if statements are not needed and you should just write:In the more general case where the if statements contain something more complicated and you really only want to allow a few values, I would recommend adding something like this at the end of your elif chain:This will immediately alert you of the problem and let you know what  is.
You need to make sure the  variable has a value. In the example below I'm initializing it with the empty list ,  so that when none of the conditions match, it is still defined.
You ran that block but resultsLength was neither 10, nor 15, nor 20, nor 25, hence none of the if/elif block got executed and listLength was never set.You get the error https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#UnboundLocalErrorTo solve your problem, you can make sure resultsLength is set to an empty list before your first if, or you can use else to set it to an empty list as in:or
