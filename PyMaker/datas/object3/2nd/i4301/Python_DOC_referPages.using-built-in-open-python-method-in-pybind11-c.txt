How do you use basic ("default"/"built-in"; don't need to be imported) python methods in pybind11?Lists, dictionaries, and some others do have built-in compatibility, but the method I am looking specifically for (open) is not included via an import. I know that a way around it would be to create a python file with a method wrapping "open" and then calling it as you would any imported method, but I would prefer to do it directly in C++ (using pybind) if possible as otherwise that semi-defeats the purpose.Any assistance/advice would be greatly appreciated.
You are wrong. First, built-in names are importable from  module (in Python 3):Second,  also lives in  module so you can also use the following  line that is equivalent to the line above:This is for Python 3, but the last line works for Python 2.7 too.
