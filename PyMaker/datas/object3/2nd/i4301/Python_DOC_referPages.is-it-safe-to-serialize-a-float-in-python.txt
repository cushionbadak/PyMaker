I'm serializing Python s to a CSV file viaand then reading them back via  as . Is it guaranteed that the floating-point value I read in will be the value I get out, or is it possible that I may lose some precision? Thanks.
A comment in the Python source suggests this is safe.https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Python/pystrtod.c#L828Double check you are getting up to 17 significant digits in your csv file - otherwise you may need to force convert your floating point numbers with repr() on output to csv.
