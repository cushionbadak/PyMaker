I want to append the lines after the 3rd match of "config vdom" string. Unfortunately the script only consider the 1st match.Original code:I'm planning to used the enumerate but doesn't sure how to apply it in adding the next line.Enumerate line:Output:Sample Data:expected Output: It should be the three line below will be added in the x list.
This should help. 
 could help:this prints (or writes to your file)...is that your desired output? will be  for every line where  appears and false for all other lines.  collects all the lines until the value of  changes.you'd need to replace all the  parts with your desired files.
