I recently created a new environment in Anaconda so that I could download Python 3.6. The trouble I am having is routing the directory in jupyter/pandas so that I can easily access my csv files. Even if I input the direct path to the csv file pandas can't read it. Something must be off since I created the new environment in Anaconda, just not sure what it could be. Anyone have experience with this?
