If there is a file in python with a function definition only and i don't call that function in that file.. is it a script or module? For eg:-
Any python file is a module which you can .According to python doc:A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix .py appended.And also an empty python file is a module, although useless.And any python file is a also script.A python file containing only a function definition is a script, but it will not do anything.There's not much emphasis in making such a distinction in the Python world. Usually, a script is supposed to execute some code, while a module is a library of functions and classes to be imported and executed by some other script.There's a special variable  which you can check to tell if the current script is being run directly in a python interpreter (in that case will have the value ), or not (i.e. is imported by some other script), e.g.:Read more at https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html
This is module as well as script file as well. Python is a scripting language so any python file will considered script file first. In you case it will be considered as a module and that will be utilize as below:-Suppose your python script module file name is util.py
