I am attempting to learn Python and am working on an assignment for fun that involves translating "encrypted" messages (it's just the alphabet in reverse). My function is supposed to be able to read in an encoded string and then print out its decoded string equivalent. However, as I am new to Python, I find myself continually running into a type error with trying to use the indices of my lists to give the values. If anyone has any pointers on a better approach or if there is something that I just plain missed, that would be awesome. 
your code is fine, just a few changes (left your old lines as comments)ouputof course you can make it a lot simple and python's way... but wanted to change your code as little as possible
Your current issue is that you are trying to use letters as indices.  To fix your current approach, you could use  while looping through each of your strings.If you want a much simpler approach, you can make use of  and .  These two builtin functions help easily solve this problem:Output:If you want a looping approach, you can use  and  along with  to achieve a much simpler loop:Output:
