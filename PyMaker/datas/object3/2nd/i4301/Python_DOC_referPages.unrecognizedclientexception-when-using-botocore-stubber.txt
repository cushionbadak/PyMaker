I am using  to test a function that makes a call to AWS using .The function looks like this:I am using botocore stubber to stub this request in my unit tests like this:This test is failing with botocore.exceptions.ClientError: An error occurred  (UnrecognizedClientException) when calling the StartQueryExecution  operation: The security token included in the request is invalid.Why would this be failing? Is it because I am creating a new client in  which is different from the client used in the stubber? If so, how can I test this?Any help is much appreciated.
Currently,  is creating a new client, and using that instead of .One option would be to alter  to take  as an argument.Then pass  to .Another option would be to use mock to patch  to return your stubber.
