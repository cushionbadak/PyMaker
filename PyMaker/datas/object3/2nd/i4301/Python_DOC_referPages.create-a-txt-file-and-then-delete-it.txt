This is what danihp means:
There is a tempfile module in the standard library. You should not be doing this yourself with os method calls.The tempfile module will respect the operating system's native methods of creating temp files and will clean up the temp file automatically even if an exception happens.https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.htmlLook at TempFile and NamedTemporaryFile.Also os method calls are pretty much depreciated in favor of pathlib. It provides a much cleaner OO syntax.
