I have this one model where I have fetch  , , ,  on monthly basis is based on monthly count of   in model,  is based on monthly count of   in model,  and  is based on count of specific  value of  in model.I'm struggling after writing below queries,I'm clueless as to how fetch data to fill the columns(see figure). I'm not sure queries I wrote will help.The problem comes when I want to zip  and   but   has data from April month and  didn't have April month. when i zip , results will loose April month. I am not able to figure how to do this. I need the data to fill these columnsAny help is highly appreciated.
Perhaps you could use  which will zip the longest sequence and will substitute  for the missing values in the shorter sequence. That way you won't lose the April data. If you wish to use a value other than , specify the  argument.From https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.zip_longestitertools.zip_longest(*iterables, fillvalue=None)Make an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables. If the iterables are of uneven length, missing values are  filled-in with fillvalue. Iteration continues until the longest  iterable is exhausted.Note that the function is called  in Python 2.
