I was making a code in which I needed to compare two lists for exact matches, and I found this code (I had to add  so it would output the result):This code outputs  because it prints the list, and if I change the code toIt outputs  because the list is empty.This is all fine and good because it solves my list comparison problem, but I have almost no idea why or how it works. I would greatly appreciate either a detailed or partial explanation if you have one.
That's called a "list comprehension", let's break it down here: can be roughly understood as making a list of , where  (and ) come from  but only if . takes two arrays,  and , and combines them in such a way that the end result looks like So effectively, you're processing the result of  and iterating over tuples  to return only if  is "truthy". Explaining "truthy" is a bit out of scope for this answer, but in this case, the expression  evaluates to  if  and  have the same value. I.e.,  is , where  is .
This is a list comprehension, which is a python syntax feature. You can read about it in the python tutorial here.It is being combined with the  built-in function. Documentation for that function is here.A tl;dr is: the zip function makes pairs from both lists, and the list comprehension will filter out the pairs that don't compare equal, selecting only the pairs that match
To get the code working with the random indexing of the elements, you can try the following:a = [1,2,3,5,4]b = [9,8,7,6,5]print [i for i in a for j in b if i == j]This will output:[5]
