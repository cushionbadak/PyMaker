I've got a (third party) socket, that accepts input. I can call it from commandline with:I then get a response and the connection closes. I try to write a python script that automates calling this service. I want to send data directly (not from a file) to it. I tried it with a python script and socket.send() and recv() function. But the service gets no input on connection, so it returns an error and closes. when calling .send I get a broken pipe error (cause the connection got closed)my code (snippet):the error:The error is because the socket connection is closed by the server immediately if there are is no data. the .send is too late. Is sending data on connect possible using python (I assume it is)
My answer for now (I post this as an answer because it works, but I won't accept it because it's ugly as hell) is to use netcat and call it from python. This works because it's like using nc in command-line. The approach is ugly as hell though:This is for Python 2.7, for Python 3 there is subprocess.run and subprocess.check_output. (Got no code snippet for this because I coded the script in 2.7)
