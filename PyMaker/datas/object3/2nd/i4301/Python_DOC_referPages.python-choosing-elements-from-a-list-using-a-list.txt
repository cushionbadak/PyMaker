I need to choose some elements from the given list, knowing their index. Let say I would like to create a new list, which contains element with index 1, 2, 5, from given list [-2, 1, 5, 3, 8, 5, 6]. What I did is:Is there any better way to do it? something like c = a[b] ?
You can use :Or you can use numpy:But really, your current solution is fine. It's probably the neatest out of all of them.
Alternatives:
Another solution could be via pandas Series:You can then convert c back to a list if you want: 
Basic and not very extensive testing comparing the execution time of the five supplied answers:using the following input:simple python loop was the quickest with lambda operation a close second, mapIndexValues and getIndexValues were consistently pretty similar with numpy method significantly slower after converting lists to numpy arrays.If data is already in numpy arrays the numpyIndexValues method with the numpy.array conversion removed is quickest.
I'm sure this has already been considered: If the amount of indices in b is small and constant, one could just write the result like: Or even simpler if the indices itself are constants...Or if there is a consecutive range of indices...
My answer does not use numpy or python collections.One trivial way to find elements would be as follows:Drawback: This method may not work for larger lists. Using numpy is recommended for larger lists.
