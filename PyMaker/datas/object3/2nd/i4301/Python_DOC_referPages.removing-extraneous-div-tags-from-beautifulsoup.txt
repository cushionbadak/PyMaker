Full code:Notice that sometimes the wrong encoding is used:I may be crazy donât mind meThat's why I set it manually: . Fragment of the requests docs mentioning this situation:The encoding of the response content is determined based solely on HTTP headers, following RFC 2616 to the letter.

In the default mode, this matches any character except a newline. If the DOTALL flag has been specified, this matches any character including a newline.*    Causes the resulting RE to match 0 or more repetitions of the preceding RE, as many repetitions as are possible. ab* will match ‘a’, ‘ab’, or ‘a’ followed by any number of ‘b’s.?    Causes the resulting RE to match 0 or 1 repetitions of the preceding RE. ab? will match either ‘a’ or ‘ab’."from https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html
