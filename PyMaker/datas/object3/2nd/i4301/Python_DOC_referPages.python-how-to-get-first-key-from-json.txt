Im Using Json for NLP/ML which means my json file is HUUUGE.using MyPy(dont be confused this is python.)But. since i have 120000 keys, getting only keys takes more than 5 seconds.how could i limit of keys to retrieve?
Well, using python ordinary dictionaries you can't, as stated in this question:There's no such thing a the "first n" keys because a  doesn't remember which keys were inserted first.But, the same question shows a method to solve this using  recipes, specifically the  method, and as said in the docs:If start is non-zero, then elements from the iterable are skipped until start is reached. Afterward, elements are returned consecutively unless step is set higher than one which results in items being skipped. If stop is None, then iteration continues until the iterator is exhausted, if at all; otherwise, it stops at the specified position.Unfortunately I don't have any big enough dictionary to try it, but, if it still takes more time to run than you want to you can try using an  as shown here, although I don't think it will perform better than the 
It seems that  has to process the whole string first. Putting into dictionary form takes negligible time.  You can control the output with the  kwarg.  This can help you maintain the order, but it won't speed anything up. (there might be negligible time differences, but the bottleneck is parsing the string) Here's the times on a 120,000 keys dictionary.
