I have this  created and want to see if  exists or not, and if yes, then delete it. Where  is , , , etc ...I tried this:This returns error if  does not exist.Also this does not work:
This would remove it from any sub-dictionaries that contain it:Result:
You simply use  method with default argument(e.g. ) to omit checking if  exist as key.Note: it's not a good practice to change iterable object while iterating over it.
Here's a simple solution:
To check if a key is in a dictionary try  to check in nested dictionaries you follow the same logic:About removing an element, you should indeed use the  statement. I copied your main_dict, and ran the same as you:Maybe you're trying to remove it twice?
