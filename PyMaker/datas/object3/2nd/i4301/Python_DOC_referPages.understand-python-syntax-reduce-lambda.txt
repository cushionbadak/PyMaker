I have a pandas series 'structures'. It contains rows of list of characters.The line below is basically trying to find the union of all characters present in all the rowsBut, I'm not able to understand the syntax. What is | doing and why is set() being passed as an argument to reduce?
 is the union of  and .The  at the end is the initial value for , the first value of  that will be used so that the function can get going. The first value in  will be the first value of .If you left out the initial value, i.e. something like:then if  is empty this will raise:and if  has length one then  will just return the one element, not converted to a set.In general  is the bitwise OR operator but sets override several operators for their own meaning. For future reference the character is called a pipe, so for example searching for "python set pipe" yields some answers.
