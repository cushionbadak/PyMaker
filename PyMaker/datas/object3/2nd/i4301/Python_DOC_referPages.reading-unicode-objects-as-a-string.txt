Natural Text
I have an excel sheet crawled from a website using beautifulsoup and printed that unicode object result as it is into csv like {u'rgb': u'190,190,190', u'type': u'INTERIOR', u'name': u'Orchid, premium leather'}, {u'rgb': u'60,79,77', u'type': u'EXTERIOR', u'name': u'Nord Gray Metallic'}But now I'm not able to read them using pandas as a dictionary as it is returning single strings like '{',"u".I tried encoding the string too but no result.I want to read the dictionaries as it is.
