How to loop multiple variables and different steps parallel?Like, in c++, .
You can use the built-in function  to iterate multiple iterables in parallel:Possible output: will stop iteration once the first iterator is exhausted. When you want to continue until the last is done, providing fill values for the others, you can use .For reference:https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#ziphttps://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.zip_longest
In Python,  loops are usually iterated over a sequence (such as but not limited to: a ,  array, a , d type,  items etc).The below implementation is a 'd form of two  objects:The limitation in this approach is that the two sequences (one over  and one over  must be of the same length.However, if say  iterates over  elements and  over  elements, then the number of times the loop will be executed will be , i.e., the execution exits the loop as soon as one of the sequences is completed.
