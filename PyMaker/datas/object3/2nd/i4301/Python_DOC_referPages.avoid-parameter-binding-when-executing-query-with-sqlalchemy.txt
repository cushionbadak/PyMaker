I am using SQLALchemy to execute queries on Teradata. One of the queries I execute is a DDL statement to replace a stored procedure:This SQL statement is assigned to a variable  and is executed by SQLALchemy with the session execute method:The problem I have it that SQLAlchemy assumes the  variable is a parameter which should be supplied with a dictionary. See documentation here: http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/session_api.html#sqlalchemy.orm.session.Session.executeIn the current configuration, it triggers the error message:2018-04-18 19:09:27,874 - migration_script - INFO - Execute object DDL  statement on UAT environment. 2018-04-18 19:09:27,875 -  migration_script - ERROR - (sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError) A  value is required for bind parameter 'V_VAR' [SQL:  "()\rUNIT_TEST_NEW_STORED_PROCEDURE:\rBEGIN\r    DECLARE V_VAR  VARCHAR(50);\r    SELECT 'Hello World!'\r    INTO ?;\rEND;"]  [parameters: [{}]]Would you know a way to avoid this error message so that my DDL statement above is executed without error?
 interprets plain SQL strings as if passed in a  construct. Due to that you have to escape any colons that you do not want interpreted as beginning a placeholder:For SQL statements where a colon is required verbatim, as within an inline string, use a backslash to escapeSee: http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/sqlelement.html#sqlalchemy.sql.expression.textSo your DDL statement  should be:
