For a particular user having number of dates, I want to calculate total number of days bewteen two dates. Here the problem is a particular user has around 5 dates at random interval and I want to calculate frequency for the user. For two dates I know how to calculate but dont know for number of dates.data looks like: and I want to calculate total number of gaps between dates.Thanks in advance!
Assuming you need the diff between the date in your list. You can iterate over the list and use Output:
Given that you need the difference between the first and last date (the list doesn't need to be sorted), you can just do:As it doesn't matter how many dates are in the middle, the result will be the same as . As you can see the  cancels out and the result is just  in the sorted list.Below is my original answer to which I thought the average between each day was neededGiven that the days list is sorted, you can use the pairwise recipe that uses  to create a generator that grabs all the differences for you then get the arithmatic mean in days from the result.
