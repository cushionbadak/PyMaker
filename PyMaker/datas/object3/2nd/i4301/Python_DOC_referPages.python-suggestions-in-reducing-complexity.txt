Natural Text
Task: Given a string, S, of length N that is indexed from 0 to N-1 , print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as 2 space-separated strings on a single line.Input Format: The first line contains an integer, T (the number of test cases). Each line  i of the T subsequent lines contain a String S, .Constraints : T in range(1,11), len of String S in range(2,10001).
You could simplify your code by using advanced slicing on stringsFor  is the start index, if omitted, it just uses  is the end index, if omitted, it just uses  is the step value, so it will iterate though the sequence by that amount.So for even indexed characters, we start at the  index and step through every other character.  For odd indexed characters, we just start at the  index and get every other character.
