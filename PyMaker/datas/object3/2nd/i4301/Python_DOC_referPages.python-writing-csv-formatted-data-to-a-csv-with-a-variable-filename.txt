Python 3.6.New to Python...first post be gentle...I cant wrap my mind around this...As described in the title, I have CSV formatted data that I need to write to a CSV file with a variable filename. Currently my code creates the CSV with the appropriate filename, and writes data to the CSV, but the data is 1 letter on each row.Code looks like:Any help would be greatly appreciated, but I would like an explanation with the "solution" code if possible. I am looking to learn/grow, not have my ignorance enabled. 
 is expecting an iterable of iterables containing the data for each row, with the th element of the "inner" iterable being the contents of the th column of the a. It looks like  is a single string. (I'm guessing it looks like .)To elaborate, the reason you're getting a single character on each line is that one long string is itself an iterable of iterables--iterate over a string and you get an individual character and iterate over that character to get that same character. Thus each character becomes a "row".
This worked for me.   
Since your data is a single string, you should split it into rows as described in the  module documentation. If you constructed the string yourself, don't do that. Just let the CSV writer handle the delimiters and newlines.So for  to do its thing your data should look like this:That way you should be able to write the CSV file just fine:
