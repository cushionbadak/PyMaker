is this possible to pass Webdriver instance from Java Framework to Python script at all? if it is, How?
You would have to serialize the Webdriver instance in Java to something readable for both languages (so avoid the default Java serializer in this case). What you need is an XML or a JSON parser/serializer. Serialize the instance in Java to XML/JSON and parse the created serialization in Python. This serialization could be transferred via a file or WebSockets (Java - Python).XML:JavaPython 2Python 3JSON:JavaPython 2Python 3
