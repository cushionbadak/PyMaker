I am trying to list the settable properties of a class.Using 2 answers: list properies of class and know if properies is settable.For this class it work.I get {'var_a': property_object}.But for a child class:I only get {'var_c': property_object}. I expected {'var_c': property_object, 'var_a': property_object}I know it's due to self.class.dict return only the dict of the class and not of all the parent class. class namespaceSo my question is their a way to get a equivalent of dict of the class and all it's parent?I tried using dir(self), it do get me the name of the all the property but it doesn't give me the property objects. And using getattr(self, 'property_name') return the .fget() value of the property and not the property object.vars(B) also return only {'var_b': property object}
Found a solution using inspect.getmembersAn other solution using dir and getattr:
