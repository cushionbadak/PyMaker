I'm trying to calculate rolling r-squared of regression among first column and other columns in a dataframe (first column and second, first column and third etc.) But when I try threading, it kept telling me the error that TypeError: ParallelRegression() argument after * must be an iterable, not int". I'm wondering how do I fix this? Thanks very much!See a summary of the data (df) in the picture linked below:
 class needs an iterable of arguments as the  parameter. You're passing  which is a single  object, you need to pass some iterable object that would allow multiple args, even when you only want to pass one arg. would work, because that makes a  which is iterable.
