I am supposed to generate a csv file with 10 columns (from A to J) with 10000 rows that contain random numbers between 1 to 1000. I am able to get the desired output but cannot write this output to a csv file. Please find my code and the generated error message below. Error Message 
It looks like writenow only takes the string as an arg, nothing else.https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html#csv.csvwriter.writerowIf you want a  at the end just do . Char just converts a single character though. I think you're looking for So,And When you specified delimiter  when creating the csv_write I think it will end the row with  anyway so you don't need to append it to the end. Might have to try it out. 
According to this document when you open a CSV file for write, you will give a  and  and other staff, so here in your case you dont need to pass  to . this method just gives a list to write in your file. good luck.
