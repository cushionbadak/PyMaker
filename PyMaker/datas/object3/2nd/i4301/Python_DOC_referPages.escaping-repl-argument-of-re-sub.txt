Natural Text
I would like to make sure the  argument of  is escape, so that any special sequences like  are not interpreted:Is there a function that can do this? I know that  exists, should this be used?
Do not use  for this purpose.  is meant to be used in the  argument, not the  argument.Instead, follow the advice of Python's documentation, and just replace all backslashes with two backslashes manually:
