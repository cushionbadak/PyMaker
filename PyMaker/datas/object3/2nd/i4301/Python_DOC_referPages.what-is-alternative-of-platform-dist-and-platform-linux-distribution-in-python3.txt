It says here both Platform.dist() and platform.linux_distribution has been deprecated in version 3.5 and will be removed in version 3.7 (Current version 3.6.5 with 3.7 in preview mode). and I can't find any way around on how to find/get linux distro name in python3! Any way? Thanks in advance.
I didn't search this a lot, but if you want the version informations, an easy way, maybe what python's  did anyway, would be to read files orand see what you can get from them. ^^' So long that it's not in a performance-wise critical section of the code. Have a nice day!
After a small search, I found it here and it can be installed with . Then  instead of the .Output:I’ve tested in python versions 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and it’s working perfectly.
This pip package solves it. [Not limited to python 3.7 issue]https://github.com/nir0s/distro
