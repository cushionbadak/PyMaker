I have OGR Virtual Format as test.vrt file, and tried to read it using Python  lib.After that I am receiving an error:Here is my test.vrt file:What I am doing wrong?
Fiona only handles a subset GDAL’s supported drivers, and VRT is not one of them:VRT files are format drivers - they’re used to create geographic datasets,  reference geographic datasets, and even specify geometric changes to datasets. But VRT files are not geographic datasets themselves. They’re XML files!Python’s standard library has plenty of support for processing XML files:https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.htmlAnd there are some great 3rd party options too:xmltodictuntangle
Strangely enough enabling  support at least for such simple vrt files seems to be possible. If you add  to supported_drivers dictionary in  file opening above xml file with fiona using geopandas seems to work. Use at your own risk! :)
