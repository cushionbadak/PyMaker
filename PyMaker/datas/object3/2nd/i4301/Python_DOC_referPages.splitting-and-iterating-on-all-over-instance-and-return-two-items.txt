I am splitting x variable (string)  in based on  and then  and return out all info.  I tried so for below and it give only  info.so basically I want to split and iterating on all over instance and return two items which will then go into  to make folder/subfolder
Use  to split on multiple delimiters and then iterate through the  two at a time:EDIT (using function as requested):Note that the function returns a list and you can access each item simply by index.
