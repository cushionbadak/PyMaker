In python3, following works:However following gives a syntax error due to semicolon:Why is that, and is there a way to write a lambda function in single line (I intend to pass it as a short argument, without defining the function elsewhere)
Existing answers cover the "how?" of the question, but not the "why". Which is to say, why doesn't  work? The answer is in the language specification.From https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#lambda:Lambda expressions (sometimes called lambda forms) are used to create anonymous functions. The expression  yields a function object. [...] Note that functions created with lambda expressions cannot contain statements or annotations.From https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html?highlight=semicolon#simple-statements:A simple statement is comprised within a single logical line. Several simple statements may occur on a single line separated by semicolons. contains a semicolon, so it is a collection of simple statements. But a lambda can't contain statements. So a lambda can't contain .So why does  work? It's because  is not a statement. It's an expression: in particular, it is a tuple literal (formally, a parenthesized form whose expression list contains at least one comma), whose first element is a call to  with argument 3, and whose second element is a call to  with argument 5. All of this is a single expression, so lambda accepts it without trouble.
Another possible option:
You can create a lambda function and use it in a single line. But its not with semicolons. Define lambda in brackets and pass arguments immediately after that using brackets:This will give output 10.
