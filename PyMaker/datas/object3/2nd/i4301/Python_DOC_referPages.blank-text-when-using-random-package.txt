Natural Text
I'm making a dice program and whenever I try to type "D4" (Since that's the only thing I have right now) I get the random numbers I coded in, then blank text.I'm using:Windows 10 HomePython 3.6  This is my code:I understand that this is very messy code so I'll try and explain why I have certain things the way they are.First of all, this: https://i.stack.imgur.com/6cvmD.pngThe reason why I have this is that if I just try to have the "if" statement in the general the code, nothing shows up. That's why I just have it show up with the actual code in the else statement.Second of all, this: https://i.stack.imgur.com/QBoj0.pngI know this can be very easily simplified, but the thing I'm trying to do is to show random numbers before the actual result comes in, giving the effect that it is actually a die that you're rolling.I really hope somebody sees this because I've been trying to fix it for around 5 days now.
So if I did understand you right, this should do what you want:
Just Instead of ,because D4 is a string
Your error comes from comparing a string  with an integer stored inside a variable . is a string - so compare it to another string - not to a integer. Also  is enough - randint already produces a integer, you do not need to convert it with  into one.You can get the dice to be rolled directly from the input and skip parts of your code like so: See randint-Dokurandom.randint(a, b)  Return a random integer N such that a <= N <= b
