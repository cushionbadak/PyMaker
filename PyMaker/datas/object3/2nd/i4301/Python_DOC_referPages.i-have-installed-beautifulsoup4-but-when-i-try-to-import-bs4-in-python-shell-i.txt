I have repeatedly installed and uninstalled , but no matter what I try to do, when I try to  in shell, I get . I'm on  and using . I'm new to programming, but am on my third Python book and this is the first time I've run into a big problem trying to import a module, including those I've installed using . 
Are you writing- ?This will install only  module and not .Do this:-And then do this in your python file:-Also you may need administrator access for installing.
So, I don't really understand what is happening, but I at least temporarily solved my problem. I have two different "Lib > site-packages" directories in my C: drive, and pip is installing in a different one from what Python is using. So I just copied the BeautifulSoup and bs4 folders and pasted them into the one that Python is using, and now it works. Python is using this folder: "C:\Users\Victor Hart\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32", while pip is installing bs4 and BeautifulSoup here: "C:\Users\Victor Hart\Envs\virtual", which doesn't make any sense to me.
