Natural Text
I am trying to write in a CSV file using this code:but when I open the  file I find that it adds a blank line after every line.Why is that?
If you are using Python 2.x use  in your . If you are using Python 3.x add  as another parameter. This is recommended in the  documentation. For example:Python 2.xPython 3.xNote, by making this change it will remove additional blank lines between rows.  will always add a newline at the end which is usually required. To stop it from writing that, you would need a different approach that first writes the data to a string not a file, strip the newline and then write the resulting text to a file.See also: Python CSV insert final newline - how can I avoid it?
