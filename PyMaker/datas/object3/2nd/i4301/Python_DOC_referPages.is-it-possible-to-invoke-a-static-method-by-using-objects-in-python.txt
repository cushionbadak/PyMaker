I am new in Python. I have one doubt regarding static methods in Python. I know that we can invoke a static method by using class name () and it's not possible by using objects (like ).But I am able to invoke a static method by using objects.This is my code. I can call the method  by using object.How is this possible?
There's nothing stopping you from using an object instance to invoke a static method. See the documentation for the  decorator:It can be called either on the class (such as ) or on an instance (such as ). The instance is ignored except for its class.
