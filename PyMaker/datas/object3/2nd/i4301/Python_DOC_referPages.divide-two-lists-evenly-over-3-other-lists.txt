I'm struggling to come up with a effective but simple solution to the following:I have two lists of dicts:I want to iterate over these lists of dicts and assign them to 3 empty lists:desired output:I want to evenly divide the lists of dicts over the 3 empty lists. Each item in the list of dicts can only be in the empty lists once. So first line of list of dicts should go in list_1. then the 2nd line of list of dicts should go in the list_2 etc etc until there's nothing left in the list of dicts. Is there a simple way to achieve this? 
You can do so using  loop:EDIT:Can be done using  loop too!EDIT 2:It can be done even better way and still easy to understand for a beginenr
Iterators are very useful here: You can use  to obtain an iterator that endlessly loops over ,  and . Then simply iterate over the dicts in  and  and append them to the list you get from :I used  to combine  and  into a single iterable, and the  function to manually advance the  iterator.Results:Another option is to concatenate the two input lists into one gigantic list and then slice it:However, concatenating lists is somewhat costly, so it should be avoided if your lists are very large.
