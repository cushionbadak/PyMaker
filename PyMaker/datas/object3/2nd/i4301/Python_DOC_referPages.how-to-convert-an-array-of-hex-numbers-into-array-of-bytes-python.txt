I have an array of hex values in python, and I want to convert it into an array of those values broken up into individual bytes, stored as strings.For example:Given the inputI would like the outputI was wondering if there is a built-in python function to do this conversion, or some other simple way to do it?EDIT: My input values are integers stored as hex values in an array. My input array has 48 of these integers, I just shortened it to make it easier to read. Hope this helps.
The fact that your ints are encoded in hex is irrelevant to the question.andresult in the same list.Python integers have a method to convert to bytes already: . Converting to a string afterwards is pretty easy (just use  or ). The only catch is that you need to know the number of bytes to use up-front. In your case, you can either use the number 3, or you can use the method  to calculate it.Here is one possible implementation of the above:This produces the resultThe order here is big-endian: the highest byte of the integer is in the lowest index of the array.If you want to do it as a one-liner, you can do:One possible caveat here is that different numbers in the input may give you different numbers of elements in the output. For example, if your input is , the first element will result in one string, while the second will result in 2. If you want to avoid this, find the maximum number of bytes required to encode one of your integers, and use that instead of :In this case, an input like  will result in a bunch of zeros, but equal number of bytes per number: .
 uses the  formatting operator to convert the integer parameter into a string containing its representation in hexadecimal; and then uses a list comprehension to split that string into a list every second character (i.e. into each byte). Note that since the leftmost byte might be lower than , the code prepends a  beforehand (i.e. when the string is of odd length). simply iterates through the array parameter and appends the result of .The s afterwards are just a quick way to test the code and, at the same time, show the reader the expected results.
