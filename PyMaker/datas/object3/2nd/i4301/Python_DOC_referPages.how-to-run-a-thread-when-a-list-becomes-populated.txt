Currently, I am using a system like this:Basically users in a game append tasks (which is essentially a ) to . The main point of this system is to make sure that the actual user object is pickleable.However, this is very inefficient because it is constantly checking if the queue has any tasks in it. I would rather make it so that it only runs when a task is appended to the queue. Is there any way to accomplish this?
I think what you are looking for is a message queue.
