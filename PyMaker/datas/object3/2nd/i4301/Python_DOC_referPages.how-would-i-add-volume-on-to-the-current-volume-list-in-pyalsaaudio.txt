I'm trying to add on volume to a current set volume, in this case we will say it's 80%. Using the alsaaudio module in Python, there is a function called  or  in my case dumps a list such as  for 80% volume. I am trying to add volume on to the current one like this, But my problem is, since it's a list I cannot strip or replace characters and since I am relatively new to Python, have no clue on how to strip the characters in the list and then add 5 on to that integer after converting.I created a run-able example here:It prints: , even though this issue is solved, thanks for your responses.
Mixer.getvolume([direction])Returns a list with the current volume settings for each channel. The list elements are integer percentages.https://www.programcreek.com/python/example/91452/alsaaudio.Mixer
According to the docs,  returns a list of integer percentages, with one element for each channel. The docs for  are less clear, but apear to imply that the first argument is an integer.If my interpretation is correct, and you have only one channel, you can use list indexing to get the first element of the list as an integer. The other steps are as you show in the question. You may want to make sure that the incremented result is less than or equal to 100. The  function provides a standard idiom to do that:I've submitted issue #58 to pyalsaaudio to get the docs clarified a bit.
