When I have a long list likewhere each string has the same length, how do I calculate an array like in the most effective way ? 
Here is one way using  and .I have explicitly defined a  function for clarity.Result:
Transpose the input list with the old  trickUse a  to count the letters in each rowSort the counters' elements by valueTurn the sorted elements into sTo give some more insight into what each step does, I'll post the intermediate results here.After transposing the input, it looks like this:These tuples are then turned into Counters:Sorting these turns them into lists of  tuples:And in the last step they're converted to OrderedDicts.
