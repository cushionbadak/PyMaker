Natural Text
I'm a freshman in college, who's taking a python coding class. Currently I'm working on making a program count the amount of vowels or consonants based on a user's input to determine the mode.currently, I've made two lists, and I'm trying to find out how to program python to count the vowels/consonants.This is what I have so far - please keep in mind, I've worked on both ends, and the center is where the counting goes.

So I timed my and eumiro's solution. His is better
Using regex would be an alternative:If you take its length your problem is solved.
This is a solution which counts consonants and vowels, while excluding punctuation explicitly.

Most other answers seem to count each character separately and then sum up the results, which means the code has to iterate over the input string many times and is somewhat inefficient. More efficient would be to count all occurences of all characters in one go, using a :
How about list comprehension with regular expressions?
