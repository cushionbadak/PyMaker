This question already has an answer here:Passing functions with arguments to another function in Python?                    7 answers                I would like to sort a list using a function that returns a float value. If the function had a single argument, I would simply use and be on my merry way. However, this doesn't work for functions with multiple arguments. How can this be done?Edit:People asking for more details, so here we go:This is a small part of a chess engine. The 'Bestmove' function takes in the board position (a list), the depth (an integer), and alpha/beta values and returns a list with two entries: the board evaluation (a float), and the suggested move (a list). In an effort to optimize the alpha/beta pruning process, I would like to change the order in which moves are evaluated (strong moves evaluated first leads to greater efficiency). To achieve this, I would like to sort the list of moves by the first value in the list returned by the 'Bestmove' function.    
There are several ways you can do this. Assume we have a list .Set default valuesThis works only if you can set in advance the default values for your unused parameters.Use partial functionsYou can use  to create a function with certain parameters fixed.Pass through lambdaIf your additional parameters are dependent on the list item itself, you can pass through an anonymous  and include your logic.
