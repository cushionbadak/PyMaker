I am just starting with Python.How to get index of integer  from a list if the list contains a boolean  object before the ?I think Python considers  as  and  as  in the argument of the  method. How can I get the index of integer  (i.e. )?Also what is the reasoning or logic behind treating boolean object this way in list?As from the solutions, I can see it is not so straightforward.
The documentation says that Lists are mutable sequences, typically used to store collections of  homogeneous items (where the precise degree of similarity will vary by  application).You shouldn't store heterogeneous data in lists.The implementation of  only performs the comparison using  ( operator). In your case that comparison returns truthy value because  and  have values of the integers 1 and 0, respectively (the bool class is a subclass of int after all).However, you could use generator expression and the built-in  function (to get the first value from the generator) like this:Here we check if  is an instance of  before comparing  to 1. Keep in mind that  can raise , in that case it may be desired to (re-)raise  (to mimic the behavior of ).Wrapping this all in a function:Some examples:
Booleans are integers in Python, and this is why you can use them just like any integer:[this doesn't mean you should :)]This is due to the fact that  is a subclass of , and almost always a boolean will behave just like 0 or 1 (except when it is cast to string - you will get  and  instead).Here is one more idea how you can achieve what you want (however, try to rethink you logic taking into account information above):This code redefines 's method, which is used to compare elements in the  method, to ignore booleans.
Here is a very simple naive one-liner solution using  and :Here we map the type of each element and create a new list by zipping the types with the elements and ask for the index of .And here is a generic iterative solution using the same technique:Here we basically do the same thing but iteratively so as to not cost us much in terms of memory/space efficiency. We an iterator of the same expression from above but using  and  instead and build a custom index function that returns the next value from the iterator or a raise a  if there is no match.
