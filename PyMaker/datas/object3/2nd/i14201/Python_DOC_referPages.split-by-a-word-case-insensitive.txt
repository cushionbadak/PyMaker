If I want to takeand split it on , and have that split be case insensitive (split on any of , , , etc), what should I do? Keep in mind that although I would like to have the split be case insensitive, I also DO want to maintain the case sensitivity of the rest of the string.So if I have:I would get  respectively.But what I want is:every time. The goal is to maintain the case sensitivity of the original string, except for what I am splitting on. So if my test string was:my desired result would be:
You can use the  function with the  flag (or  for short):
You can also search for something and get the startposition of the keyword. I would recommend that and cut it with "substring" method out. (I am from C# so i dont know whats the method in this language)
