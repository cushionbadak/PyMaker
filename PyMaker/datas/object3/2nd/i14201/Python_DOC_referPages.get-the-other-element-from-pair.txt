For example, in the turn-based strategy game, I want to swap players:This code works perfectly, but it's ugly.Of course, in this particular case, I can always store an index (0 or 1) of the active player, and then do:And then write the @property method. But it's not that interesting.Is there any beautiful way to do it?

For the task of finding the other element in a pair, Iâ€™d just write a nice and clear function:If it works for your case, though,  might be a better way to cycle through options:
You can utilize the fact that  can be used as index 1So you can define your function asDemo
Just swap when you want to change the player and take the first element then you don't have to care who is active as you will get a different player each time:Or better again as minitech commented just call 
This is a common way to toggle a flag:
a better solution for this would be to have a generator.this way you can have list of all your players and get one player everytime to replace with. it will also be better a easier if you are gonna have multiple players in a team playing at a time.
I suggest:that gives :
