I wrote a code in PyCharm and after running it, PyCharm and Python3 show only six columns.I think, it is correct. Can me someone explain, please, where is the problem?
You are putting more than 12 values into your columns. The first 12 are 6 numbers and 6 tab characters. Each of those  strings is a value too; you are essentially producing:as the string; note the spaces between! That's one space for values shorter than 2 characters, and another space from the template itself.You don't need to put those tab characters into your format; you already spaced out the slots:Now you pass in 12 arguments for 12 slots.If you really wanted to put tabs in between you'd put those in the  string instead:Python gives you the tools to avoid having to type.  already puts spaces in between separate arguments. Together with another loop in a generator expression, you can format all those numbers without writing out all those  arguments:If you still needed to have tabs in between instead of spaces, you can tell  to use that as a separator using the  argument:Take into account that because you are multiplying by 11 and 12, you'll get numbers that won't fit in 2 characters:
