I have a program that reads data from cli sys.argv[] and then writes it to a file.I would like to also display the output to the buffer.The manual says to use getvalue(), all I get are errors.Python3 manualerror:How do I output the data from io stream write function data to buffer as well as to file?
You use  to open the file, so it isn't a StringIO object, but a file-like object.  To get the contents of the file after you write to it you can open the file with , and instead of , do:This will put the contents of the file into var.  This will also put you at the beginning of the file, though, so be carefully doing further writes.
