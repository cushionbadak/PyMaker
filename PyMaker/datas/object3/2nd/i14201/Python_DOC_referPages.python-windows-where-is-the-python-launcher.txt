I'm trying to use different versions of  on , and I was told that I can use the . I find the docs for it: https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#launcherBut I don't know where is it. Someone say its called , but there is no file with this name on my computer.I installed python  with , https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/, comes with ===========UPDATE:Since there is no  in , how can I re-install it? Or if there is better way of using different version on ?
It should be in the root directory of Python 3.3 installs and higher. It is not available for Python2.Go to C:\PythonXX\ and you should find py.exe for your version.In Command Prompt or your favorite shell (like Cygwin), run:However, this only works if you have a 3.3 or higher install.EDIT: Anaconda does not come with Python launcher. It is only available for an ActiveState, standard, or probably many other installs.EDIT2: Here are two brand-new, Python 3.4 installs of ActiveState Python and Anaconda Python, screenshotted. Notice how Anaconda Python does not include py.exe and a lot of other (non-essential) executables?EDIT3: After some "difficult" testing, just set anaconda as your default install for Python3.4 and grab the py.exe from another install. That is all. So you can install Python3.4 from another source, uninstall it, and save the py.exe, make sure it is in the system path, and the python launcher is fully installed.EDIT4: Actually there's also a standalone installer available here:https://bitbucket.org/vinay.sajip/pylauncher/downloads
It looks like the python executable is part of the  command if you're using Anaconda, according to their website. According to Alexander Huszagh (see his answer), the python launcher doesn't come with Anaconda python.Here is a blog post that is perhaps relevant.
If installing python from python.org's downloads and you select "[x] install pylauncher [x] install for all users", py.exe is installed in .I think if you don't install for all users, then it's in the python install root.If you are able to run  from , then you can find out where it is with .
The experts gave a reply which seems relevant to one version of python but not the latest version.  e.g. In my least favorite command line tool I entered:C:\Program Files (x86)\Python36-32>dir py.exe /sIt replied:File Not Found
