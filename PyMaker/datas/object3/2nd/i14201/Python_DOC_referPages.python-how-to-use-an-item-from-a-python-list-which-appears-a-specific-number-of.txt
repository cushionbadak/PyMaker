Suppose I have a python list num = [1,2,5,3,4,4] and I know that there is an item which appears 2 times in num. Now I want to use only that item.Is there a predefined function to choose that item?*There is no upper limit on value of items in num. 
There is no predefined function, no. You'll have to count all the items and figure out which one can be found twice in the list.You can use a  object to get the counts, and from there it is reasonably easy to enumerate the values that appear twice:
Yes (if the data contains only one repeated item):Otherwise you'll have to use  and search for the element that occurs twice.A  allows you to count elements and determine the most common element. If the data satisfies your assumptions (that there is one element occurring twice) then this approach would allow you to find it.
