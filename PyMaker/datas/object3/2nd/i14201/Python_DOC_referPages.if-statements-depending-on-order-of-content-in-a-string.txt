Natural Text
I would like to create different  statements based on the order of content in a string.So if  comes before  in  do x.Or if  comes before  in  do y.Note that  does not necessarily have to contain both  and . It can contain just one of them, or none.Currently I use the code below to do different things if there is one of  or . But if both are present, I would like to set  to the one occurring first.
Use  and EAFP
use  to get the index of a substring. It will return -1 if not present.
Here is a generic solution, utilising  that will return the first sub-string that is matched from a list of  sub-strings, rather than simply  i.e. or , this solution can be extended to any number of possible sub-stringsTwo-Line Generic SolutionMore Informative FunctionTakes  as the string to search across and  as a list of substrings to search for.It returns the the first  that is found in , from  or  if none are found.Example
