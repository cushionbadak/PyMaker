I have a SQL database which I wish to run a query on through python. I have the following code:Where I use the same select command in sqlite3 directly it works, but through Python no database entries are outputted. What am I doing wrong?
Consider this SQLite database.Python connects and queries this database like this.Output:You have to use one of , , or  to get rows from the cursor. Just doing  does not return the rows.
