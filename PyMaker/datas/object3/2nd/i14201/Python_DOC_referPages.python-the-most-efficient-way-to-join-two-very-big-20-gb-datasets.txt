I have a 21 GB dataset df_ns:and another 12 GB dataset df_ip:and I would like to join them on domain name and for the domains that are in both files extract ip and ns.The way I thought of using it is loading the df_ip data into a dictionary and going through df_ns data line by line and check if the domain is there, then extract the ns. But it is still very resource consuming .Does anybody have any other, more efficient idea how to do it?
