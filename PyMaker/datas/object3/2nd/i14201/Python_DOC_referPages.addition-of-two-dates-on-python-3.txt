I try adding date and hours from csv file in one datetime variable. I read questions about adding some timedelta and official doc https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#timedelta-objects, but don't understend how it works.My csv row looks like - ['2005.02.28', '17:38', '1.32690', '1.32720', '1.32680', '1.32720', '5'].I convert row[0] = 2005.02.28 to date and convert row[1] = 17:38. Now i need creating new datetime variable looks like 2005.02.28 17:38. How i can do it?
