This question already has an answer here:subprocess.check_output return code                    3 answers                While developing python wrapper library for Android Debug Bridge (ADB), I'm using subprocess to execute adb commands in shell. Here is the simplified example:If command executed propery exec_adb_command returns 0 which is OK.But some adb commands return not only "0" or "1" but also generate some output  which I want to catch also. adb devices for example:I've already tried subprocess.check_output() for that purpose, and it does return output but not the return code ("0" or "1").Ideally I would want to get a tuple where t[0] is return code and t[1] is actual output.Am I missing something in subprocess module which already allows to get such kind of results?Thanks!
Popen and communicate will allow you to get the output and the return code.check_output may also be suitable, a non-zero exit status will raise a CalledProcessError:You  also need to redirect stderr to store the error output:Just pass your commands:
