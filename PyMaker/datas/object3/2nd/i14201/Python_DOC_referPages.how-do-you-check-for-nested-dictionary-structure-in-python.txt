One way is to check the type, however there seems to be varies of other flavor of dictionary also, eg. defaultdictThis is exactly why the idiomatic way to check types is to use . Since  is a subclass of ,  will be true for a .Also, you may want to look at  (or , in 3.2 and earlier) and see if  is really what you want to check for. If you want to catch any mappings, even things like a , you'd check . Or, if you want to catch any container at all (including sequences, sets, etc.), . Or maybe you want . You can read the descriptions and decide which one means "not atomic" for your use case.
You can check if the value inherits from a Mapping class. Defaultdict is a type of dict, and OrderedDict directly inherits from dict.
