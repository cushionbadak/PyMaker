I've already searched for a solution to my problem but with no success. Part of the solution for my problem is here, but this does not solve it all.I have two lists of dictionaries like this - each dictionary is written to a csv file but I read the contents to the following variables:Using the solution of the link above, ie:I get no matches because the order of the dictionary is different. But in fact, both lists are the same. How can I check this? Do I have to sort the dictionaries before writing them to the csv file? Can this be a solution?This is my major problem at the moment but I have another issue also. It would be great to be able to make this match check but ignoring one or more keys defined by me. Is this also possible?EDIT: I have the dicitonaries in a csv file and I'm reading them with the following code:This is very important because I think the problem is that after reading the values from the csv it's not dictionaries anymore, so the order has to be the same.EDIT2: sample of the csv file (3 lines, it's creating an empty line but that's not an issue...)
Part of this solution was found by OP as per our last CHAT conversation, it was to convert a string into dictionary using ast module.Now using this module to convert every row read by the  as it returns a list of strings, which would be a list of one string in case of OP's CVS file, then append this dictionary into a list. After that using list comprehension with , we can get the difference between the two lists.
You need to double check your code. I'm not getting the issue you're bringing up.If I change list1 and list 2 (middle dictionary):Running same code:The provided code in the link seems to be working fine. The order of the dictionary or a list does not matter in python.
Use a dictionary comprehension instead of a list comprehension in your return.
