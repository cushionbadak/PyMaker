Python version 2.7.3Python code, interactive modeErrors outSyntax looks correct. I even tried with another IP address that is pingable and same error.Thanks!
I am looking at the port you are using (21) and it's the FTP port.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbersI don't see any errors in your code per se, but here some things I am worried about:a) A lot of places lock down and turn off , , etc. ports     that are historically used, but in today's security consious world,     we use  and  (instead of  and ).  You might talk to your     system administrators and see if that service is even turned on,     or let alone your filewall even allows that port to go through.b) I am not used to seeing the default parameters, but I assume you      want socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)I have Python 2.6, and that is the defaults for that (which I assume   is the same for 2.7).c) I would try this on different ports to see if it is a port problem.     Of course, the early numbered ports are special "well-known ports" that     normal users can't use.   I usually use port 9711 or 8888.d) I would also try it without the timeout and see if that works.I hope this helps!
This is not a direct answer to your question, but if you're seeking to do FTP transfers, may I suggest to use the standard ftplib module instead?
