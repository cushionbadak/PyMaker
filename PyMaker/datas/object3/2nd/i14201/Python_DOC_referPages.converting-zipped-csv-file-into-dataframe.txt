I am trying to access the "Yield Curve Data" available on this page. The code below does this, but I am then trying to convert the zipped CSV File obtained into a Dataframe. The code below works upto the part when I want to convert the zipped file into a Dataframe. I get the Error  in the line . I was wondering how to circumvent this issue. Thank You
 just returns a list of filenames -- it does not actually extract anything (https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipFile.namelist).This should work:
