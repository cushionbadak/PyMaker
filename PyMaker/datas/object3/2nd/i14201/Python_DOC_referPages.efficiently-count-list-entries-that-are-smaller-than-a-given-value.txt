I have two lists, one contains employee salaries and one contains queries. For each query I want to print how many employee salaries are less than that. Below you can find code I currently use, which exceeds my time limit for large inputs. Therefore, I'm looking for more efficient solutions.
I don't know whether this will be any faster (or slower) than your solution. You can use the  module to determine with your large inputs.Depending on data sizes, you could sort the salaries and queries beforehand and then you only need make one pass over the lists:This second method will be faster for long inputs, but perhaps slower for shorter inputs - you'd have to profile with representative data. If your data is already sorted this method will be very fast.

Use  on a sorted  list: does a logarithmic search, where the largest element of  is. For large lists, the complexity is  instead of  for the other solution with two for-loops. This is considerably faster for large numbers .
