I am new to python and I am using python to query a device for information.  The information that is returned is an IP address, and a score.  For example the data may look like:The lists are very long, but using the above as a sample I am trying python to return the information above in this format.I thought I could use a dictionary to do this.  As I get an IP address I open the dictionary and either add the IP as a new record, or it exists do nothing.  If the IP was new and was added, then it would also add the subsequent number.  If the IP was already in the dictionary, it would ADD the number to the IP.  For example, if  was in the dictionary, and the next value was  and , the IP would not be added since the key is already in the dictionary, but the  would be added to the previous value of  and the new dictionary would entry would be: 
Use the dictionary  method which can return a default value if the key is not found.
