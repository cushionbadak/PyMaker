You want what immediately precedes ? Then useDemo: https://regex101.com/r/sR4kN2/1This greedily matches everything that comes before , so that only the desired title appears.Alternatively, if you know there is a character that doesn't appear in the title, you can simplify by just using a character class exclusion. For example, if you know  won't appear:Or, if you know whitespace won't appear:A third option, using a bit of code to find all red titles (assuming that the input always alternates title, color):
If you want to get the last match of a sub-regexp before a certain regexp the solution is to use a greedy skipper. For example:the first  is greedy and it will skip as much as possible (thus skipping first ) backing up to the one that allows matching the desired color.As a simpler example consider thatprocessed onwill match  in the first group and  in the second.
Why don't you skip the regexes, and use some split functionality instead:results inRegexes are nice, but can cause headaches at times.
Try this using re module
