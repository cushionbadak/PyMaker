I want to distinguish between these three cases:The flag is not present at all ;The flag is present but without a value ; andThe flag is present and has a value .How can I do this with Python ? The first two cases would be covered by  but then the third case becomes invalid.
You can do this with :One argument will be consumed from the command line if possible, and  produced as a single item. If no command-line argument is present, the  value from default will be produced. Note that for optional arguments,  there is an additional case - the option string is present but not  followed by a command-line argument. In this case the value from const  will be produced.Your three cases would give:The  value;The  value; andrespectively.
