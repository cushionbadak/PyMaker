I'm currently working on a simple file transfer program in Python. I am having trouble with the function for prompting the user for the location of the folder to be copied.The variable source comes up as an unresolved reference. I understand that the variable must be initialized again due to the scope of an if-else statement, but I am unsure of how to save the directory in the source variable without the user being prompted for the directory again.
When you call  a second time, the value of  that was created the first time has long since gone out of scope and been garbage collected. To prevent this, try making  an attribute of the function the same way you did for .Although, it's a bit messy to have two attributes when you can make do with one:If you're in a higher-order functional mood, it may be worthwhile to create a function that memoizes other functions. You can look at PythonDecoratorLibrary for some tips on doing that, or you can just use one already prepared by Python
