is that the function, it works doing the sum of each sublist but it preserves the the index [0], [1], [2] and [3] and sum the anothers. In this example I will use the list , in this list the function works correctly. The exit of the program is:is what I've said it preserves the members [0],[1],[2],[3] and sum the other indices of each sublist.But when we use some number more than once, it fails.using:the 6 (index 4) in second sublist was writen twice (the another at the index 5 at the same sublist)the exit was :It's wrong!The correct exit should be: Can someone tell me where my code is wrong?
I would recommend ditching the  approach entirely.This works on s with repeated elements.
