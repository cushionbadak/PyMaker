I have a Python 3 project.On install, I would like to move my latex files to known directory, say , so I've told  to include data filesNow when I runorI get the following error:Running just  works fine, so the problem must be in package creation.
When creating a deb file (I guess the same counts for a rpm file),  first creates a source distribution and uses that archive for further processing. But your LaTeX files are not included there, so they're not found.You need to add them to the source package. Such can be achieved by adding a MANIFEST.in with contents:distutils from version 3.1 on would automatically include the  in a source distribution, while setuptools apparently works very differently.
