Natural Text
I have a json string in a txt file and I'm trying to read it to do some other procedures afterwards. It looks like this:I know the json is valid, but I'm getting:I used this website to check if the string is valid. If I use , I get a different error:Originally the json was embeded in my script like this:And didn't get any errors. Any ideas on how to fix this???Running python 3.3.3 just in case.Thanks!!EDIT:Just some random (valid) json on the txt and I get the same issue. This os one of the ones i tried:Which is valid as well as per jsonlint.com.
