According to the Python docs: "when defining , one should also define  so that the operators will behave as expected". However, it appears that Python computes  as  automatically:So what's the point of defining  if it's just going to be ? And furthermore, where is this behavior actually documented?EDITApparently it matters that I am using Python 3. In Python 2, I getBut the docs I referenced are the Python 3 docs. Were they just not updated?
Python 3 changed behaviour for the  case, see Python 3, What's New: now returns the opposite of , unless  returns .It was deemed a useful change.The fact that the documentation has not been updated is indeed a long standing bug.However, as a comment on the report points out, if you inherit from a class that already has defined , overriding just  is not enough and you'll also have to override the  method.
