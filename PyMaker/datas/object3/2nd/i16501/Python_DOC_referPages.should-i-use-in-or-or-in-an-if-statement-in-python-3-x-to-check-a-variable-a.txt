Suppose I have the following, which is the better, faster, more Pythonic methodand why?or :
In Python 3 (3.2 and up), you should use a set:as set membership is a O(1) test, versus a worst-case performance of O(N) for testing with separate  equality tests or using membership in a tuple.In Python 3, the set literal will be optimised to use a  constant:Note that this optimisation was added to Python 3.2 and in Python 2 or 3.0 or 3.1 you'd be better of using a tuple instead. For a small number of elements, the difference in lookup time is nullified by the set creation for each execution.
