In python 2.7 time.mktime does not accept year before 1900, this is strange.But the calendar.timegm can do all the values.Is this expected behaviour? It is kind of strange to me. It seems not possible to overflow double for just -71 years.
This is expected behaviour.The first is documented in the Python 2.7 docs under Year 2000 (Y2K) issues. There it  statesValues 100â€“1899 are always illegal.Python 3 supports these dates, so there are no such restrictions (docs).The second point with the negative dates is also expected. The dates are in seconds since the epoch (seconds since 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970). So dates before this are stored as negative numbers.
The issue you have found is related to the platform specific time implementation that  falls back on:The earliest date for which it can generate a time is platform-dependent.https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.mktime is a completely separate implementation that happens to operate with time tuples. This tuple stores the entire year so it is able to represent pre 1900 dates easily.https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html#time.struct_time
