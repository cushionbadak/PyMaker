I have to model bacterial growth as a function of optical density. The problem is simple: for every hour specified by the user, the OD in each cell in a table increases by 5%; when the cell reaches an OD of 1.0, the excess is distributed to cells N,E,S and W of the overflowing cell. If they are all at 1.0, no more growth takes place. The table of ODs is square and can be of any dimensions, it does not wrap around.In the code below:array3 is the initial table of ODs and length is the amount of rows and columns. I know that I am making a logical error in the nested while loop, because only the first row updates, and only once:
As already pointed out in the comments, the problem is that you increase the counter variables in the loops, but you do not reset them to their original values before the next iteration. Adding  just before  (and similar for ) would solve your problem, but I'd recommend to use  loops instead, looping over the  of values the variables should take.As you can see, I've made a few more alterations: is very useful, e.g. for iterating over the product of two variables, like  and  you can use the  builtin function to cap the growth at looping over all the 'deltas' for  and  instead of having the same code for all 4 neighbors
