I know the difference between  and .But I was surprised to see that  wasn't a but a .What's the difference then, how to create a  and when used it over a ?
The reason that  is a sequence object is because it supports the sequence methods interface.  For example you can index it (which is something you can't do with a vanilla generator):In other words, something is a sequence if it supports all of the methods defined in that link.If it's a generator, it probably only supports a couple methods ( or  are the most important)1.  there's also an in-between land which is "iterable" -- "iterables" have a typically2 defined  method which returns "generator" (something with a well defined  or 3 method)just to be complete, you'll often see people say "iterators" which are very similar to generators (implement  which returns the object itself and has a well defined  and/or  method).More formal definitions can be found in the documentation glossary1generators also support  and simply return themselves. so techincally, all generators are also iterables (and iterators!), but not all iterables (iterators) are generators.2 +  is enough to create an iterable as pointed out in the comments.3 is the method name for python3.x
A  is a special, C-provided type.  A  can be written by user code.This is a Python 2 thing -- in Python 3:Python2:
