I was working with the inspect module and noticed that it returned unsized objects from time to time. For example  which returns the tuple? of the default values of the functions arguments. When you use  on the previous snippet you get a cannot get the length of an unsized object.Why is this an unsized object?
If there are no defaults then the defaults value is None rather than an empty tuple.If you need to test for presence of default arguments then rather than using , just use the object itself.eg.or better yet:
If you doyou get a result which is likeWhat does that man? It is an object which obviouusly has a length (), and whose  I can get:Huh? What's that?Ah, it is . Ok.Let's have another look:It seems a  object is something like a namedtuple; its  is the  value, which is just .It completely depends on what you try to do with that object.
