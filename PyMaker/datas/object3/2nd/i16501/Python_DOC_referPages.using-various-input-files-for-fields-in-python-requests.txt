I am sending queries to Google's directions API. From another programme, I am generating origin and destination latitude and longitude coordinates. I am currently saving these in CSV's files in this structureI am using the fantastic python Requests to generate these queries, but cannot work out how to specify in the fields, a look up to these csv files I have created. I am using the following - How do I tell the requests where the file is and what fields within the CSV to use? For the API, the coordinates need to be entered without comma's or spaces, so I would need to carry out this manipulation too. Perhaps there is a better way than using CSV's?
No, the Google Maps API webservice, nor  take CSV filenames. You'll have to read the data from the CSV file first, then pass the values to the API. You can use the  module for this instead:Here, the  will take the first row as keys, so each column can be addressed as  and , respectively. I then just format those into a string Google can understand.I've assumed that the CSV file represents a series of points to get directions for; start, waypoints and end.Demo:In this specific case, your coordinates do not actually result in a viable route, so  is returned.
