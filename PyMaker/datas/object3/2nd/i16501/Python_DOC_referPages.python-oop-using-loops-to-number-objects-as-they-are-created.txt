I'm stumped on a python problem. I'm writing a program that receives a command from Scratch (MIT) and then should create a new object, in this case named PiLight. The object only need to be created when the command is received so it doesn't have to loop, just be able to executed repeatedly and have the number increment each time it is executed.A list will not work for me due to the requirements of the program and talking between Scratch. I'm trying to figure out a way for the constructor, once initialized, to print out a statement something likepilnumber should be 1 for 1st object, 2 for 2nd, etcFrom there I need the creation of the object to change the number in the name of the object as wellI tried messing around with for loops but just ended up making more of a mess

Use number generator as class variableThen using in code:The trick is to have the  (what is actually a generator of numbers, not list of numbers) as class property and not property of class instance. This way it is globally shared by all class instances.
if you need to keep objects:and now you have access to objects as
