While looking through the webapp2 documentation online, I found information on the decorator (which can be found at https://webapp-improved.appspot.com/api/webapp2.html#webapp2.cached_property). In the documentation, it says:A decorator that converts a function into a lazy property.My question is:What is a lazy property?Thanks!
It is a  decorator that gets out of the way after the first call. It allows you to auto-cache a computed value.The standard library  decorator is a data descriptor object and is always called, even if there is an attribute on the instance of the same name.The  decorator on the other hand, only has a  method, which means that it is not called if there is an attribute with the same name already present. It makes use of this by setting an attribute with the same name on the instance on the first call.Given a -decorated  method on an instance named , this is what happens:Python resolves . No  attribute is found on the instance.Python finds the  descriptor on the class, and calls  on that.The   method calls the decorated  method.The  method calculates something, and returns the string .The   method takes the return value and sets a new attribute  on the instance; .The   method returns the  return value.If you ask for  again, Python finds the  attribute on the instance, and uses that from here on out.Also see the source code for the original Werkzeug implementation:
