Is there a more efficient way to do this?
From your comment I gather you are concerned about memory use and you want to avoid creating a temporary list. Unfortunately Python doesn't have an iterator version of string.split (AFAIK), but you can use re.finditer:But unless your input is many megabytes long there's really no need to worry about memory and complicate your code like this.
