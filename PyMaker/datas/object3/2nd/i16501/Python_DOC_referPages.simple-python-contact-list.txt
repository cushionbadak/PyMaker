My code does not seem to be working. It will create a max of one dictionary. If you create another name and number, aka dictionary it will replace the current one.Here is my code:Sorry if this is a stupid question, I am still new to programming.
Each time  is called, you are doing this:That replace the contents of list with an empty dictionary!Just remove that line.Since you're new to programming, allow me to point out a few other issues with your code:You are not asking for new input if the input is not validYou shouldn't need to repeat the choice entry code like that.You can process your choices with a simpler condition.Take a look at this, and see what you can learn from it:You can then remove that repeated code from the end of  and .As others have mentioned, using the name  as a variable is also a bad idea, because it hides the built-in .Finally, it's generally considered bad practice to use global data like that.  Consider declaring your contact list dictionary in , and passing it as a parameter to  and .
You are resetting  each time you call :That rebinds  to point to a new dictionary, remove that line. If all you do is add new keys to the dictionary, you don't even need the  line here.Further down, the line:will indeed correctly add a new entry to the dictionary. Using  for adding one entry is overkill however, you can just assign to the key instead:Note that using  as a variable is a bad idea, you are masking the built-in type. A better name would be .
