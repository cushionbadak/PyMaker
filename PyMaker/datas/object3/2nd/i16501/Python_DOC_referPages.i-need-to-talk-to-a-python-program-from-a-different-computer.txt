I have seen people make IM servers through python so i could use that. But any other ideas would be great. I know I can send emails using python but maybe I could have python wait for one? I don't know. But any ideas will help. Anything that sounds like a valid solution i will try to learn about. Go easy on me, i am new at stack overflow.also i will be writing this in python.
The best solution is probably going to be a direct socket connection. One computer would be the socket client, and the other would be the socket server. Take a look at the  documentation.https://docs.python.org/2/library/socket.html
