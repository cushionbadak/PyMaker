I have a python 2.7 script which usually runs for hours, and I am now trying to optimize it. It has a lot of searches for strings, which represents the heavy part of computation. At the moment I am currently using  to find substrings in longer strings. I am considering rewriting all expressions that do not contain regular expressions and use  instead. Almost all strings that are searched for are normal strings, ie contains no regular expressions.I know that  uses a  method to check substrings, but I have no clue how re.search works for strings that are non-re. How does re.search actually work? Would it really be more efficient to use in rather than re.search for substring in string comparision?EDIT: To clarify I can give an example of currently running code:Could be replace by:
As others have commented, executing a regular expression search is inherently more complex than a simple substring search. Here's a very rough benchmark:But if your program runs for hours, I doubt that the source of the problem lies in such areas.
