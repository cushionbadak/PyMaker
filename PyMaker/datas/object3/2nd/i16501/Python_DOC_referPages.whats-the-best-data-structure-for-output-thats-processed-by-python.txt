Natural Text
My client currently has text files that are output as tab delimited data and with HTML table chunks.  Their system takes these HTML table chunks and sticks them in an HTML template file.  I was looking at outputting the data as json or xml, and separating out the views functions.  I've done this a bunch with front-end processes.  The difference for me here is that I'm processing the data on the server-side and outputting simple HTML, instead of populating it via Javascript.  My tendency is towards json, since I already am outputting a few other files in this system that way.
JSON is probably your best bet. Python has an excellent JSON library which can provide native Python objects with just one function call. From the docs:Just save the output of  into a variable and you're off and running.
