How do I tell whether a number, stored as a string, is an int or a float?For example:What is the required  function?One solution is to convert x to a float, find , and then determin whether . But is there anything built into Python that does this for me more neatly?
You can use :If you want to do some sanity check as well, in case user might also pass a non-numeric string:
You can use a  block to see if the string number can be converted into an integer:See a demonstration below:If you want to protect against the user entering a non-numerical string, you can add one more level of error handling:

I think the most easy variant is using eval:Dont pass untrusted code to this function ;)
