I am using  and then  to load , now I want to make a list of just the functions in  that are functions of  but I can't seem to find a  attribute that is unique to Classes which would filter out all other methods in .
If you search for existing solution, use builtin  module, it has plenty of functions to test for specific types,  for your case:However, if you want to get into depths, there are few other approaches.In Python everything is an instance of something. Classes are not an exclusion, they are instances of metaclasses. In Python 2 there are two kinds of classes â€” old-style () and new-style (). Old-style classes are instances of , visible as , while new-style classes are instances of , which itself is both function and metaclass at the same time (callable metaclass to be strict). In Python 3, there are only new-style classes, always derived from  (which in turn is instance of ).So, you can check if  is class, by issuing if it's an instance of metaclass producing classes:Or for old-style:You can also take a look at data model and list of class-specific magic fields.
