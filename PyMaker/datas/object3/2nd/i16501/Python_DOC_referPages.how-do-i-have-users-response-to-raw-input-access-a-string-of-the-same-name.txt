Natural Text
I am attempting to have two pieces of user input become parts of a filename that my Python script will then access.For example, I want to use the pieces of user input to construct: date_time_place.txt.  I know I can do that by concatenating strings.I ask the user for raw_input() for date and time, but I have named the date and time options they can use:I specify that the user must enter his or her response as date# or time#.What I want is to be able to use his or her response to obtain what date# or time# already is assigned to be.  How does one go about such a thing?
Although you can, you should not attempt this. Put your variables in a dictionary instead;Now access is as simple as  or .You could access local variables with the  function, globals with  (both return a dictionary), but you then cannot constrain the names they have access to.
it is a sample solution. check for out of index values and non-int value exceptions.
