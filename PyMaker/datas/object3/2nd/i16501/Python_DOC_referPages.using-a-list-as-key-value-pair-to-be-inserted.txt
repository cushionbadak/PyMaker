Hello I have a list that I wish to insert into a dictionary - however not each element a new element in the dictionary - the list itself is 2 items long and should be used as "key-value" pair.Or (as knowing python there are dozens of ways to do something so maybe this isn't even necessary). The base problem is that I wish to split a string into 2 parts around a delimiter and use the left as "key" and the right as "value":Of course I could do a manual split like:But that doesn't seem to be idiomaticcally "python", so I was wondering if there's a more clean way?
You can use sequence unpacking here:See a demonstration below:
