Python allows the multiplication of strings by integers:How is this implemented in CPython? I would particularly appreciate a pointer to the source code; the Mercurial repository is a labyrinth beyond my abilities to navigate.
Note: I'm going to answer for Python 3, where the string type is called . Python 2 is similar.When a  opcode is executed (in ), there are two possible slots that can get called:  and . (This is in , in ): implements the latter, in :
For Python 3.x, the implementation can be found in .  Specifically, it begins on line 12175 where  is defined:Later, on line 13703, this function is supplied as the  slot for the  of the  object.
