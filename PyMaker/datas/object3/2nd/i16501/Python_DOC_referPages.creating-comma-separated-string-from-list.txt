This question already has an answer here:TypeError: sequence item 0: expected string, int found                    5 answers                I have a list of ints and want to create a comma-separated string. The following:Give the error:How do I create the string? I could manually convert every element from int to string, insert this into a new list, and then do the join on this new list, but I'm wondering if there is a cleaner solution.
 only accepts an iterable of strings, not one of integers.  From the docs:Return a string which is the concatenation of the strings in the iterable .Thus, you need to convert the items in  into strings.  You can use either  or a list comprehension:See a demonstration below:
If you are dealing with a csv file that is something other than the trivial example here, please do remember you are better off using the csv module to read and write csv, since CSV can be surprisingly complex.Here is a write example:Note the embedded comma in  and the embedded new line in  that may trip up efforts to decode if not properly encoded. The file 'test.csv' that the csv module produces:Note the quoting around  and "H, 4"` in the file so that the csv is correctly decoded in the future. Now check you can read that back:Just sayin' You are usually better off using the tools in the library for csv. 
Just modify the argument to  so that each element is converted to a string:
