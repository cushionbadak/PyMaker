I need to calculate  where . This raises the warning:I cannot safely ignore this warning, but neither SymPy nor mpmath is a solution and I need to perform array operations so a Numpy solution would be my dream.Does anyone know how to handle this problem?
You could use a data type that has the necessary range, for example :But what are you using these numbers for? Could you avoid the exponentiation and work with logarithms? More detail about your problem would be helpful.
I think you can use this method to solve this problem:NormalizedI overcome the problem in this method. Before using this method, my classify accuracy is :86%. After using this method, my classify accuracy is :96%!!!It's great!first:Min-Max scalingsecond:Z-score standardization These are common methods to implement .I use the first method. And I alter it. The maximum number is divided by 10. So the maximum number of the result is 10. Then exp(-10) will be not !I hope my answer will help you !(^_^)
