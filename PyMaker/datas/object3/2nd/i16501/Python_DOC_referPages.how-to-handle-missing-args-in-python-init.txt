In a multi-threaded implementation, i need to generate lots of instructions, then pass them to the single processing thread. Here is my custom Instruction class:I will have to call different kinds of instructions, thus the defined parameters may differ. It will always be one parameter missing, like no target, no action, etc.As is the current constructor, if i call it without target, i'll get that:I know i can define custom constructors, likeand then call it as But, is there other ways to do that?If so, could you please detail these? Thanks!Sorry if i mis-used or mis-spelled some words, English isn't my native language.
All your parameters in your function definition are optional as they are specified as default parameters, so you don't have to pass in values for all.When calling the function, just name the arguments you do want to pass in; these are called keyword arguments:When using keyword arguments in a call, the order doesn't matter, you can mix them up freely.Also see the Keyword Arguments section of the Python tutorial.
Pass keyword arguments.
