so far I have this:However, this line is not functioning as I want it, it still returns a blank line on the log file:I want it to not return anything and simply continue the while loop, How would I fix this?
You should be usingEditYou're missing what the pass function is all about. I would re-write your look like so. This way we're only processing this if the msg is not one of the bad input. Once we're done we break out of the loop.
Evaluation of the rest of the loop will still continue after , and as  does not equal , this means the block beginning with  will be executed.  You need to either unite the  into a single  block by changing  to  or else change  to .
Your condition doesn't make any sense. The  function will never return , only strings.If you want to skip empty strings, a better test would be  (empty strings are "falsy"). Or, if you want to reject any all-whitespace strings, try  (which removes leading and trailing whitespace before checking if the rest of the string is empty or not).Further, it's rarely a good idea to write an  statement that just contains . Instead, invert the test so that the condition is true for cases where you want to run some code (in this case, when  is not empty or all whitespace) and simply omit the cases where you'd do nothing:One final issue (unrelated to the main question). Python's  function is primarily intended for use in the interactive interpreter. It is added to the builtins by the  module, and so it won't exist if Python was run with the  flag. If you want to close the interpreter, you should instead call , raise a  exception, or just run off the end of the main module (a  statement would probably do that for the loop you've shown here, or perhaps a  if you're in a function somewhere).
