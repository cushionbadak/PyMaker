Under Python 3.4 on Windows, I need to stream data written to stdout/stderr by a child process, i.e. receive its output as it occurs, using the asyncio framework introduced in Python 3.4. I also have to determine the program's exit code afterwards. How can I do this?
The solution I've come up with so far uses SubprocessProtocol to receive output from the child process, and the associated transport to get the process' exit code. I don't know if this is optimal though. I've based my approach on an answer to a similar question by J.F. Sebastian.
Since the event loop may see and notify the process exit before readingthe remaining data for stdout/stderr, we need to check PIPE close eventsin addition to the process exit event.This is a correction for aknuds1 answer:
I guess to use high-level api:Also you can do more:and so on.But, please, keep in mind that waiting for, say,  when child process prints nothing can hang you coroutine.
