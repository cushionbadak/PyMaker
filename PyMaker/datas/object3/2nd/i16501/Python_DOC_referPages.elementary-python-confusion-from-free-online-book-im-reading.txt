I'm reading http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/pythonds/Introduction/introduction.html#review-of-basic-python. If  is a dictionary, then  returns the keys of the dictionary in a  object. However, I just tried this in a Python shell:And the book says that if I type , it should return  instead of just . Why is that?
Your book is using Python3In python2, a  is returned instead of these new  and  objectsSince the book is using Python3, you should probably go ahead and install that alongside your Python2 to try out their examples or you'll have more problems like this down the track
Your book was written for Python 3.x but you are using Python 2.x. In Python 3.x only,  returns a dictionary view object of a dictionary's keys (or what you called a  object):In Python 2.x however, the method simply returns a list of the keys.You need to use  to get a dictionary view object like in Python 3.x:
