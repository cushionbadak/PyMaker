I'm creating a xlsx output with  into a temporary file using  module, I store the path to this temporary file inside a variable that I later use in another script to open it.The problem is that sometimes opening the file fails with the error : Sorry I don't have an exact idea about the frequency of this problem occurring but it seems like it happens from time to time, so I don't understand why...This is how I save into a temporary file : Then to create the xlsx output : Then in a Python CGI script I use the variable xlsxfilename which is the path to the script to open it : What am I doing wrong here and any ideas on how to solve this by maybe using another method to storing into a temporary file?
I believe the issue here is that your program is overwriting the created file with its own output, as thestatement creates a new file. The conditions under which thish might be deleted will depend on when the named temporary file is deleted (technically this happens on ).You should think about using  instead, since you already explicity delete the file you are creating. Overwriting that file, whose name is guaranteed unique and which is not deleted automatically, should be more controllable.
