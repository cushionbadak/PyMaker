I am Using python3.I get an errow which is :sqlite3.Warning: You can only execute one statement at a time.if I delete ';' I get this:sqlite3.OperationalError: near "UPDATE": syntax errorSo what is happening? And I haven't find the title name. sorry... 
I would suggest breaking it down to smaller parts first, for debugging, and build it up again when each part is working as expected.I have taken the liberty to replace non-ASCII characters with visually similar ASCII versions for this example.Since I cannot test this, I may have made mistakes. It's just an approach to finding out what is going on.
Don't use Python  formatting, it won't quote correctly for SQL.  Use the  placeholder instead:c.executemany('INSERT INTO stocks VALUES (?,?)', (12, 'whiskey'))Do the sub selects separately, verify the values, then use them in the larger SQL statement -- it's clearer and simpler.https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html
