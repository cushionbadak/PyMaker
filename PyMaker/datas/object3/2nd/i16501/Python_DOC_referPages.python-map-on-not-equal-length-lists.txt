In lisp I used to do things like that, knowing it won't crash:The equivalent in python seems to crash:Is there a function in python that works like the lisp version on not-equal length lists? Or, is there a way to change the behavior of map? 
This problem is suitable for Python 2.x (thanks to @user2357112). The documentation for  in Python 3.x says:The iterator stops when the shortest input iterable is exhausted. So, in Python 3.x you could just use :But the documentation for  in Python 2.x says:If one iterable is shorter than another it is assumed to be extended  with None items.So, you should firstly  these lists:Because  will truncate returned list to the length of the shortest argument sequence (as said in documentation)You could also define your own function  (example from this answer):Example of usage:
