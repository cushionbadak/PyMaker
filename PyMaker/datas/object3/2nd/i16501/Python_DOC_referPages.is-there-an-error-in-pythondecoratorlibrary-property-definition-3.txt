I tried to use the property definition from PythonDecoratorLibrary (example 3).=> https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonDecoratorLibrary#Property_DefinitionAfter additionally importing sys I get this error:Line 12 is: function() because of the sys import :)My python version is 3.4.1 on Windows.
First of all: That is one ugly way to allow for local functions to define the 3 property functions.The sample decorator masks the  built-in, but then tries to use it still to produce the  object. Oops.You can still access the orginal built-in with:The  module lets you access the builtins even when a local name has overridden it.I've updated the wiki page to reflect this.
The example is relying on the built-in  function, while also naming itself :So it ends up calling itself (which doesn't take a  keyword argument), instead of the built-in  (which takes a  keyword argument). So yes, the example is broken. The function it's calling  should be named something else, or it should save a reference to the built-in  and call that internally.Edit: Using  is obviously much nicer than saving a reference to  before masking it. So go with that.
