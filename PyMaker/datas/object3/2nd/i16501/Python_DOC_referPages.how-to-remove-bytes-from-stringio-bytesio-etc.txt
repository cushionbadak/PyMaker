I'd like to use a BytesIO object as a continuous buffer (a common use-case). However, is it possible to remove bytes off the head that are no longer needed?It doesn't seem like it, as there is only a truncate() method.
No, you cannot, as  is an in-memory version of a common file object.As such it is treated as a sequence of bytes that can be overwritten or appended to, and just like a file removing elements from the front is not efficient as it requires a complete rewrite of all data following.You probably want to look into the  type instead.
