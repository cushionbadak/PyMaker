I am using Python.org version 2.7 64 bit on Windows Vista 64 bit. I am looking at the docs and sample code for URLLIB here:https://docs.python.org/3/howto/urllib2.html...and trying to submit the following code to access data from the Guardian API:This is not working and is kicking out the following error:On page address for the documents it is pointing to a sub directory called 'urllib2', but the code examples are referencing a module called 'urllib'. On PYPI I can find no installation for 'urllib'.If I just run the import statement the code executes without causing an error, but with the rest of the code does not work.Can anyone tell me which 'urllib' module I should have installed and/or why the code is producing this error?Thanks
You are using Python 2.7, but trying to follow a HOWTO written for Python 3.Use the correct documentation instead: https://docs.python.org/2/howto/urllib2.html, note how the URL contains a , not a , and the styling of the documentation differs materially.Next, you are importing several names from the  module:This means now have bound the name  (together with  and ), so you don't (and can't) use the  module name in your code:
Please use  or if you really need  API,  that is shipped with .Everything else is has way too many gotchas, for example when it comes to ssl.
