I just started using Python today for my class and one of my problems is cubing a number in Python. I know the way to do it is , but that doesn't work in Python. I was just wondering how I would be able to do that. This is what I tried so far, but as you can see, I keep getting syntax errors:
Python uses the  operator for exponentiation, not the  operator (which is a bitwise XOR):Note however that the syntax error is being raised because there is no newline before :When you are in the interactive interpreter, the newline lets Python know that the definition of function  is finished.  
Actually different symbols mean different things in different programming languages. In some languages,  means exponent, but in Python, the exponent operator symbol is :The  symbol is for the bitwise 'xor' operation:Read the documentation on the operator module to see how Python really treats these symbols.
Use the  key twice
You can use the  operator to do exponential calculations.
Use two asteric's between the number and the power. Ex  in math is  in python. You can also do something along the lines of .
The Best way to do this iscube = lambda x: x**3cube(3)but one another solution be like which result into the samecube = lambda x: x*x**2cube(3)one another alter solution be likemath.pow(3,3)all will return the cube of number 3.
