The  library requires Python 3.3 or up:Requirements[...]The first software requirement is Python 3.3 or better. This is required to use the library.and from the Trove classifiers:Programming Language :: Python  Programming Language :: Python :: 3  Programming Language :: Python :: 3.3  Programming Language :: Python :: 3.4  The  module is part of the Python 3 standard library; in Python 2 you'd use  here.
You can do that using Python 2.Remove Make that line: You cannot have  in Python 2, you need to have Python 3 or above.
