Why does the following code work fine in Python 2.x and not in Python 3.3+:Python 2.7.6 output:Python 3.1.5 output:Python 3.2.3 and 3.2.5 output:Python 3.3.5 and 3.4.1 output:
 has always ignored extra arguments, and has issued a  at least since Python 2.6.The reason why you aren't seeing the  in 2.7 and 3.2 is that since 2.7 and 3.2  has been suppressed by default; if you use  or  then you will see the warning.In Python 3.3 the  was converted to an error.The correct way to write your code (in any version of Python) is to swallow the extra argument in :Since  is derived from , the extra argument will be passed to .
You can move the __init__ function to TestA like so:Notice how TestB is not required.Notice how the 'e' parameter is omitted from the call to object.__new__.The new function of object class only takes a class as parameter and any additional parameters in the overloaded __new__ function (in this case that of class TestA) is automatically passed to the constructor function (__init__) of the classed passed to object.__new__ (which in this case is also TestA).
