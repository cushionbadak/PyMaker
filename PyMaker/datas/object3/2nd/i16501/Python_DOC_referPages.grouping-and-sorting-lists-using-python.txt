I am trying to use one list to sort another and keep them synchronized at the same time:I want to use the keys list to organize the data list into subgroups of the same keys. I also want to make sure that the list is sorted within each subgroup. so far i was able to get it all sorted properly:What else am I missing? Thanks!
