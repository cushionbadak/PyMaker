I have a little Python program that uses keyboard input to run certain commands. I setup everything in one main program loop but now I'm wondering, do I even need a main loop?  Here is what I mean:Do I actually need that while loop?Thanks!
No, you do not need a main loop if you use the  class included with Python:The documentation for the  module includes an example near the bottom to help get you started.
