I know how to use both, but I'm curious why the decision was made to make one a statement and the other a function.
First of all you can import using a function, from importlib's documentation:The  function     The  statement is syntactic sugar for this function.for instance both of these statements are equivalent:However the  statement greatly benefits from alternate syntax where as  does not really have any alternate meaning.I can also imagine a lot of beginner programmers making this mistake if reload was it's own statement:Since the  function requires a module (which is not preduced with ) coders may wonder why the names imported are not reloaded. related to this answer
