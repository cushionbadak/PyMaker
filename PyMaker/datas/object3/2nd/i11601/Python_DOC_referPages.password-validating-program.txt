I need to write a program that checks to make sure a password inputted by the user passes the following parameters:Contains at least eight characters.Contains no more than 24 characters.Consists of only letters, digits, and one of the special characters given below.Contains at least two upper case letters.Contains at least two lower case letters.Contains at least two digits.Contains one of the following special characters: !@#$%&*()_I have everything working except for the "Consists of only letters, digits, and one of the special characters given below".I have no idea what to write to check for this. Any ideas? Any tips on cleaning up the code or writing it more efficiently would also be appreciated.

Let your password be .This code will give you .So you just have to check for the length of the result of the difference. If it is  everything is fine.
