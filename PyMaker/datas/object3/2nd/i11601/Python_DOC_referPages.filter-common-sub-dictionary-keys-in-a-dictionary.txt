How do i filter all common sub dictionary keys that exists in other sub dictionary keys in the parent dictionarycurrent solution isIs there any simpler solution for this?
You can  the dictionaries to  and then  using :Note: In Python 3,  has been moved to .Update: As seen in @John's answer,  can handle an arbitrary number of sets, so the  is not even necessary. Just 
You can do a single  operation once you extract all the keys.  It's a one-liner then:Breaking that down, the first part evaluated is this:That's a generator which produces:In Python 3 that generator is equivalent to:But in Python 2,  is less efficient because it constructs a  that we don't need (as does  instead of ).In any case, the results of that generator are passed to  (using the  argument unpacker) to do the heavy lifting in a single call.
An alternative with , the keys do not need to be ordered:
