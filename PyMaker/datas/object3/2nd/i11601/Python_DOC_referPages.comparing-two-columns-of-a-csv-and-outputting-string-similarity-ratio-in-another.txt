I am very new to python programming. I am trying to take a csv file that has two columns of string values and want to compare the similarity ratio of the string between both columns. Then I want to take the values and output the ratio in another file. The csv may look like this:I want the output file to show for each row, how similar the string in Column 1 is to Column 2. I am using difflib to output the ratio score.This is the code I have so far:I get the error:I feel like I am not importing the column list correctly and running it against the sequencematcher function.
Here is another way to get this done using :Consider your csv data is like this:CODEResult
The  loop you're setting up here expects something like an array where you have , and judging by the error you're getting, that's not what you have. It looks like you're missing the first argument for , which should probably be . See 6.3.1 here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/difflib.htmlWithout that first argument specified, I think you're getting back  from  and then trying to run  off of that. Even if you correct your  call, I think you'll still be trying to iterate on a single float value that  is returning. I think you need to call  inside the loop for each set of values you're comparing.So you'd wind up with a call more like this in your function: . Or if you'd prefer, since these are named arguments, you could do something like this: .
Your sample file looks like it contains markup tags. Assuming you are actually reading a CSV file, the error you are getting is because match_ratio is not an iterable datatype, it's a floating point number -- the return value of your function: similar(). In your code, the function call would have to be contained within a for loop to call it for each a, b string pair. Here's a working example I created that does away with the explicit for loops and uses a list comprehension instead:In addition to the error you received you might also have run into a problem when instantiating the SequenceMatcher object -- its first parameter wasn't specified in your code. You can find more on list comprehensions and SequenceMatcher in the Python docs. Good luck in your future Python coding.
You are getting that error because the records row[0] or row[1] contain most probably NaN values.Try forcing them to string first by making str(row[0]) and str(row[1])
You are getting the error because you are running SequenceMatcher on the list of strings, rather than on the strings themselves. When you do this, you get back a single float value, rather than the list of ration values I think you were expecting.If I understand what you are trying to do, then you don't need to read in the rows first. You can simply find the diff ratio as you iterate through the rows.
