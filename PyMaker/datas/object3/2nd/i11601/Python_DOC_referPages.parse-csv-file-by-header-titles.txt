I have a couple of CSV files with information about different users. Every file has 3 or 4 columns with the first rows being the titles and the respective information underneath it. Such as:Some of the columns are out of order or missing in half of the CSV files so I can't simply do row.split(',')[0] to get all the Usernames in all CSV files.My question here is: How would I be able to get and read all the column information by the header titles and not by rows.

The  library in the Python Standard Library contains a class called  that does what you want.
