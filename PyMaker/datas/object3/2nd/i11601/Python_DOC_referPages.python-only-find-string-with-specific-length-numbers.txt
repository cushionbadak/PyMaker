Natural Text
I am trying to create a script that search for strings of numbers with only specific length numbers from an output.txt.Example output.txt:When I use:I would like to get only output:  instead of:
Use  and 
A non-regex solution. This can be done by just getting the length of each name and getting the one of interest by also validating : 
Just specify boundaries what you expect: you expect 5 digit not surrounded by other digits:
 is pretty quick and you keep your regex as simple as it can be.
this should work fine for you ..
If you want to use a regex-based solution, you should use  for that :Matches the empty string, but only at the beginning or end of a word. A word is defined as a sequence of Unicode alphanumeric or underscore characters, so the end of a word is indicated by whitespace or a non-alphanumeric, non-underscore Unicode character. Note that formally,  is defined as the boundary between a  and a  character (or vice versa), or between  and the beginning/end of the string. This means that  matches , , ,  but not  or .
