I have a main dict with a certain number of keys e.i.I have a series of this dicts and all of them are inside a list.Is there a way to loop through this list and create a list with dictionaries with, for example, only the key NAME and respective value? Is there a straightforward way to do this?PS: I'm using dict1 as an example as in my program I'm working with dicts with a lot more keys.
