Is there a way to discover the potential keyword arguments for a function in python from the command line? without looking at the source or docs. Sometimes the source is to c lib even that isn't visible
You can use the  module. In 3.3+, this is easy by using Immediately underneath the linked doc is an example that pulls out only the names of the keyword-only arguments, which may be worth reading too!Of course if you're looking to deep inspect the source code to try and find anything that is pulled out of a  argument, you're probably out of luck. Something like:is probably going to be hard to find.
