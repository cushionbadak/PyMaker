I've been trying to test various methods for making my code to run. To begin with, I have this list:I tried to pass it into this query:However, I get an error that says:'Invalid parameter type.  param-index=2 param-type=list', 'HY105'So I looked around and tried using formatted strings:Now, I get the error:'The SQL contains 18622 parameter markers, but 3 parameters were supplied', 'HY000'because it's looking to fill in all the  placeholders in the formatted string.So, ultimately, is there a way to somehow evaluate the list and pass each individual element to bind to the  or is there another method I could use to get this to work?Btw, I'm using  as my connector.Thanks in advance!
Break this up into three parts to help isolate the problem and improve readability:Build the SQL stringSet parameter valuesExecute pandas.read_sql_queryBuild SQLFirst ensure  placeholders are being set correctly. Use str.format with str.join and len to dynamically fill in s based on  length. Below examples assume 3  elements.ExampleReturnsSet Parameter ValuesNow ensure parameter values are organized into a flat tupleExampleReturnsExecuteFinally bring the  and  values together in the  call
If you're using python 3.6+ you could also use a formatted string litteral for your query (cf https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html#whatsnew36-pep498)
