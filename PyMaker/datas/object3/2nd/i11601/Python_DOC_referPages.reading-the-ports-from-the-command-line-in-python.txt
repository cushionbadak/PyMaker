I need to read ports from the command line in my python Script.For example, from the script, I need to prompt the user to enter the ports that he wants to connect to. The user will enter at the command prompt 1/2, 1/3/4, 5/6 etc. I need to store each of these in an array and then using the array indexing I need to access them later. Can any one please suggest me how to do it?Thanks
You should use the split method of strings.Example in Python 3 :Be careful, the list values will be strings and not integers.
