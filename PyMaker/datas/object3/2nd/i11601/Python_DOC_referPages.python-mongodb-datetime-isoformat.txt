Hi all this is my code:Since I have the date and the time, how can I create an isodate to send to MongoDB?Thanks in advance.
You do not need to create any special format for your date. pymongo works with python standard library types and automatically converts them, which means you can use the python standard library datetime module for your date/time/datetime.
