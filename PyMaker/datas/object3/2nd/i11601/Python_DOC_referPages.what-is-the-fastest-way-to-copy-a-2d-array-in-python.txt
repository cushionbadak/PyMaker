I have to make a very large number of simulations on a  grid.These simulations are altering the grid, so I need to copy my reference grid before each, and then apply my simulating function on the fresh new grid.What is the fastest way to do this in Python?Since I have not found a similar question on StackOverflow, I did the tests myself and decided to post them here thinking they could be useful to other people.The answer will be a community response so that other people can add new measurements with possibly other techniques.If you add another method, remember to measure all the old tests and update them because the time depends on the computer used, avoid biasing the results.
I used a bash variable for setting up the  tests:Just for convenience, I also set a temporary alias :Python 3Python 3.5.0+ (default, Oct 11 2015, 09:05:38)Deepcopy:Modifying pre-created array using index:Nested list comprehension:Slicing:NumPy copy:Copying to pre-created NumPy array:There is nothing very surprising in these results, as you might have guessed, use NumPy is enormously faster, especially if one avoids creating a new table each time.
