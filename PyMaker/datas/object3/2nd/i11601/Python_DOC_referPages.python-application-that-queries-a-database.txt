I need to develop a GUI desktop application that takes input from the user, does some calculations, and then runs a bunch of queries which should be exported into a csv, xls or txt file. I want to create an installation package which the user can install without installing any other applications (used for front end) and other database (other than MS Access). My questions areIf I use python for my front-end/GUI, can I create an installation package? I understand that we can create and .exe file from the .py file. I want the dB to be get copied in the right folder (path referenced in my program) on the end-user's computer when the user installs the package.MS Access (2010) on my computer (Windos 7 OS) is 32-bit and I'm having trouble using it with 64-bit python (version 3.5.1) and pyodbc(version 3.0.10). Can I use any alternate dB (sqlite?) that the user doesn't have to install to run the application and I don't have to worry about getting the dB in the right folder on the end-users computer. My dB is very small (few tables with about 1000 rows each).Thanks much!
Looks like you can do both - pyinstaller seems to support sqlite3, the python library for working with sqlite which seems like a great fit for your use case:https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.htmlhttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyInstaller/3.0About exporting - you can write code for that using python, depends on the  exact output you are looking for. Here's an example of using sqlite tools for basic export:Export from sqlite to csv using shell scriptHope this helps :)
