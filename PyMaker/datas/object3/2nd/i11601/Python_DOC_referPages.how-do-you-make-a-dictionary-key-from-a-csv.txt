I'm having issues creating a dictionary key using a csvreader.  I want to create a dictionary, which contains the location column where the data was found, so that I can write it out to a new location later. I haven't included the write function, because I want to understand how to do the create the keys first. For example, this data point 123-123-1234 was found in row[0]. Current input being read inNote that 2 entries have no pattern to match.
