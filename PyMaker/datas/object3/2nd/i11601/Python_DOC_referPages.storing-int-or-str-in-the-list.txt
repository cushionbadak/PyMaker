Natural Text
I created a text file and opened it in Python using:To loop through the words in a line in txt file.The text file only has one line, which is:When I make a list using :It creates:And I was looking for a way to check if  () is an integer.But when I try , it says that its  because of .My goal is to read through the txt file and see if it is integer or str or other data type, etc.
What you have in your list is a string. So the type coming is correct and expected.What you are looking to do is check to see if what you have are all digits in your string. So to do that use the isdigit string method:Depending on what exactly you are trying to validate here, there are cases where all you want are purely digits, where this solution provides exactly that. There could be other cases where you want to check whether you have some kind of number. For example, . This is where  will fail. For cases like that, you can take a look at this answer that provides an approach to check whether you have a 
I don't agree with the above answer.Any string parsing like @idjaw's answer of  will fail on an odd edge case. For example, what if the number is a float and like .50 and starts with a dot? The above approach won't work. Technically we only care about ints in this example so this won't matter, but in general it is dangerous. In general if you are trying to check whether a string is a valid number, it is best to just try to convert the string to a number and then handle the error accordingly.
