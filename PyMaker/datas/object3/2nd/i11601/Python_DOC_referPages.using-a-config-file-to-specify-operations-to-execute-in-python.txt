I'm trying to build dynamic operations using a config file, python and ConfigParser. I'm fairly new to Python (2 weeks old) so I'm not sure if this is even possible, which is why I thought I'd ask.Here's a sample config file:So here I would use the merging variables to merge the first and second dataset, retaining and possibly aggregating the desired variables. Then, based on the operations specified in the operations section, I would execute and store them in a variable with the same name as the second item in the list.The reason I want to specify these operations in a config file rather in a python script is because the number and type of these operations will vary. I need to create dynamic code that will be able to parse this option in the config file as if it were code and execute it.I would like some direction on how to get started.
You can use code introspection using the design pattern "Factory" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern if you are familiar with object oriented programming.Otherwise, you can look at the  and the  functions: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#evalHere is an example of using the eval function:
