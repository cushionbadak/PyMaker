I have the following string:2016-04-29T00:00:00+01:00I want to turn it into a Unix date timestamp using Python.I've tried this to convert it into a date object:But I get the following error:
is not in a form that  can understand. It supports UTC offset in the form +HHMM or -HHMMbut note that there is no colon  in the timezone!So first remove the colon  from your input and then use .
If you want to return the current date in a specific format, you should use time.strftime(). No need to over complicate things with datetime.Note: You may need to change some of the formatting characters in order to get the output you want.
I doubt strptime supports %z in python 2.7. Either you can upgrade to python 3 version or use parser module
