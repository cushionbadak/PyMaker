You could do: expects 3 integers but  returns a string. This means that we have to:split the string returned by  by comma to get three partsconvert each part to an integerfeed these parts to This makes more sense, if you ask me: takes a string as input which is convenient because  happens to return a string. This means that the splitting and casting/converting isn't necessary. You can find all the different date formats supported by  in the datetime docs.
