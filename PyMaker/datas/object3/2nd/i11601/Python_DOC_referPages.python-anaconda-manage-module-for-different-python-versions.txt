In general you can create new environments, with whatever python and packages you need, for whatever project you are working on.  In this specific instance, if you want to use the aiohttp that requires the higher python, I would do the following:This will install aiohttp in your py35 environment.
I just found the solution:from python.org.
You can use conda tool to manage your environments(for Python2/Python3) and packages.See: https://www.continuum.io/content/python-3-support-anaconda for more information.
