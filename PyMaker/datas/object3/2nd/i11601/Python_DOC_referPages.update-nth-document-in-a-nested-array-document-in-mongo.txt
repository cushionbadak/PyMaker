I need to update a document in an array inside another document in Mongo DB.If I try to update first document in comments array by below command, it works.But if I put the same in python code like below, I am getting Write error, that it can't traverse the element. I am not understanding what is missing!!Can anyone help me out please.
comment_ordinal should be a substitution, not the index itself. You're treating it like an integer that can be mapped to an ordinal number. I mean you should do something like:Hope this helps.
You are doing it wrong you need to build your query dynamically and the best way to do that is using the  method.Also you should consider to use the  method for single update and  if you need to update multiple documents because  is deprecated.
