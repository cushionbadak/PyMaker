If you need it in more places than just this one, you could also use the tabulate module which will format it nicely for you and doesn't require guessing the lengths upfront.
You need to align  part as well for the rest of columns to be aligned. Try this:
You can use the < and > alignment operators of the format() string method. Look at the documentation here:https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/string.html#format-string-syntaxFor example:
You can use f-strings with format spec. Basically It's just like str.format. For example, you can useand it will outputbut the point is you can set the alignment length programmatically like thisand I get resultf-string is new in Python 3.6 and I'm using Python 3.7.1https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#formatted-string-literals
