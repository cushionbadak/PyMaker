This question already has an answer here:Python List vs. Array - when to use?                    9 answers                I've used JavaScript before where we use arrays. I'm following a textbook that teaches Python. I'm now learning about lists. They sound exactly like arrays. Is list simply the Python word for array, or does Python have arrays and lists which are different things?
Yes, lists are the data structure in Python. Sidenote: Numpy (a python library) has arrays But, as pointed out in the comments Python does, in-fact, have an  module. Which is a list of all the same data types 
you can check:Which returns True.Just make sure with a friend that [] is a list...
Python's lists can be treated as arrays, but they are not arrays. They are the closest thing to Javascript arrays, though.Numpy has high performance arrays for numerical computations, but all elements must be of the same type.
