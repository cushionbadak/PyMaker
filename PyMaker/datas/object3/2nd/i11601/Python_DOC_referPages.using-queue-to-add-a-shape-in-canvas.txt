I was confused on how to add a shape using a queue in canvas. I'm trying to add a triangle. This is the code I've got. I'm getting an error >>> AttributeError: 'Queue' object has no attribute 'enqueue'I've been trying this for awhile now and I thought I had the right idea, I just need some guidelines thanks! 
For the module queue I don't see a function enqueue().There is , though.UpdateIs it possible, that python is taking the "wrong" , meaning the one from inside the module queue?UpdateMaybe start by renaming your class "Queue" to something different like "Queue1".Or just use the  from the module.UpdateIf you want to use a stack, just use  funcitonalities, no class Stack is necessary:By just using  you make it appear to be a stack.
