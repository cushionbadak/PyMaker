I'm a newbie to Python and I came across this question somewhere:"Produce a programme that can calculate the perimeter of the triangle, the area of the triangle and the height of the triangle from the length of the three sides of a triangle. If the three lengths of the sides of the triangle do not define a valid triangle, a message should be displayed stating that this is not a valid calculation and the process should be terminated."Anyone know how this could be solved? It's probably easy, but I'm a newbie so yeah This is what I've got so far:I still have to calculate the height. Everything else seems to be working now :D
In mathematics, the triangle inequality states that for any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than or equal to the length of the remaining side.
