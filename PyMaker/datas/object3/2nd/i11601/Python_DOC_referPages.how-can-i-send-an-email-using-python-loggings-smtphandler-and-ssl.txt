I'm developing a flask app in which I'd like to send error level logging to an email address. I tried setting up the typical error handler:Note the configuration values are as set up using flask-mail, with  and .However, upon invoking an error (on purpose during testing) I get socket timeout errors - other than the port, I can't see how to tell the handler to use SSL. There is a  parameter that can be passed (see the SMTPHandler docs) but that specifies us of TLS, not SSL.Any clues how to do this? Thanks!
Figured it out with thanks to Ned Deily pointing out that smtplib (which sits under SMTPHandler) requires special treatment. I also found this post demonstrating how to do that, by overloading the SMTPHandler (in that case to fix a TLS problem).Using  (see smtplib docs), rather than the straightforward , I was able to get the whole system working. This is the utils/logs.py file I use to set up the handlers (which should be a nice example of file, as well as email, handlers):This is registered in my application file with:Hope this helps somebody!
