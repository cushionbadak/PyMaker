Natural Text
I have a Python script that prints out a randomly generated password, then prints prints it to a text file, adding a new row every time it is called. For example:Note, the variable PSWD contains lower case, upper case, and numbers.I then want to read the file and count the number of individual characters, and print a report to a different text file, but not sure how I can do this. I have asked a similar question here, which answers how to print a character report to the console.Any idea how I can read PSWD_output.txt, and count each different character, writing the result to a separate text file? Any help appreciated!
