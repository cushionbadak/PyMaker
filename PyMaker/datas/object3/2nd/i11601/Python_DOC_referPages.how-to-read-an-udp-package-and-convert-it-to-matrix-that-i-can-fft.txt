What do I need to do with  for FFT to work?
You can unpack a byte stream into a Python data structure with the struct library. You'll need to represent the incoming stream using the format characters that correspond with the C data types in the data. For example, if you knew that your input stream was a series of 5 unsigned ints represented as 4 bytes, you could use(the recvfrom documentation says that it returns a tuple of (string, address), where string is the data received).This would return a tuple of 5 integers. From my understanding, a list of tuples is valid input for , but of course you can preprocess the tuples however you need to before you feed it to numpy.
