I want to combine three dummy variables into one. For example:x1: 1 0 0 0 1x2: 0 0 0 0 1x3: 1 1 0 0 0I want to create:x4: 1 1 0 0 1 (Takes 1 if any of the three dummies has 1, and takes 0 if all of them are zero)Note: They are variables in a data frame. So the new variable will be a part of that data frame too.I am new in python and I appreciate your help. Best
Let's say you define  as a grid:For each row, we can use  to see if any of the items in the row is one.  We can then turn the result (a boolean) into an integer with :
I'm not so sure what you mean by the new variable being part of the data frame.I think the most literal way to create x4 is by using a bitwise OR operator in a list comprehension:The list comprehension (see https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions) builds a new list while iterating over the first, second, etc values of x1-x3. The bitwise OR operator (|) (see https://wiki.python.org/moin/BitwiseOperators) each time evaluates to 1 if any of the 3 values is 1 and to 0 otherwise.
