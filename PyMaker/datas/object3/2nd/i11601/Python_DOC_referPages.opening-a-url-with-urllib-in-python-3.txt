You need to use , also I suggest you use the  statement while opening a connection.
In Python 3 You can implement that this way:Pay attention:Some IDE can (Spyder) directly, while some need to (PyCharm).That's because you sometimes need to explicitly import the pieces you want, so the module doesn't need to load everything up when you just want a small part of it.Hope this will help.

 is a module whereas  is a function.check out this link, it can help you clear your doubts.https://docs.python.org/3.0/library/urllib.request.html
