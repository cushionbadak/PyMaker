I don't understand the  method. I only know it is similar to  method and you can also pass a dictionary as an argument (please see my example). Example:Can someone explain to me the difference between  and  methods and why do I need  the   method? 
 makes a new dictionary in the process of calling.  does not. In addition to being slightly faster,  allows you to use a  subclass (or other object that implements mapping) with special behavior, such as gracefully handling missing keys. This special behavior would be lost otherwise when the items were copied to a new dictionary.See: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format_map
 when called creates a new dictionary, whereas  doesn't. The format_map(mapping) lets you pass missing keys. This is useful when working  per se with the dict subclass.
