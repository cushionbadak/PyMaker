Natural Text
I'm looking for a more robust way to convert the string below. I want to find the first 3 letters of the 3 words and change the case. The words could be anything, right now I'm just using string replace for each lower case letter.
 capitalizes groups of consecutive letters - you'll just have to exclude the extension.One way to do that:
The easiest solution is using .title():Since you don't want to capitalize the last part, you'd do:
You could use This capitalizes all the first letters, producing .If you would like to do it for the first three words only, you can use a slice, and then append the extension.This produces .The advantages of using capitalize over title is title capitalizes every word following a period, if you have an item you would not like to capitalize, you can omit the item (such as the last item in this case).A more compact way would be using list comprehension to capitalize each item, with the exception of the last item, merge the lists and join the result string in a single step.:
Although your question is ambiguous on this, I think you want something like this:
