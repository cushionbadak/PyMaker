I have an Excel spreadsheet of data with outputs and features to predict this output. For example a row of a certain output will look similar to this:The variables X1, X2, and X3 are important and have to be Y, N, Y respectively to get the correct Y output. However, X4 and X5 can be anything. X4 can be Y, N, or NA; X5 can be any number 1-10. I want to use Python to make all variations of this output. So I want something like this:Is there a way I can do this?
It's fairly easy to do if you use the  combinatoric generator in the itertools module. What you haven't said is exactly what form you want the output to be in, so I've assumed (csv file-like) tab-delimited strings. Each raw row produced in the  loop is a tuple of values like  but you can readily change this as necessary (one example is shown far below).Output (with  representing a tab character):If you instead wanted to save all the variations in a list, that could be done like this:
Why not something like:and if you want your column names you can use pandas and make a DataFrame:
You can use the  function of the  module.Here is a sample code:
