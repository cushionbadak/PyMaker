This question already has an answer here:Learning Regular Expressions [closed]                    1 answer                Can someone explain why some people use this kind of symbols in their code? it's kind of confusing for me and maybe for all the newbies out there.I am learning Python and I reached a lesson where i should build a web-crawler (spider),in the example they use only how to grab data from a specific url in a specific way i looked in the internet for a general way and found this Code with lot of symbols i know some of them but the rest i have no clue here is a chunk of the code i found with symbolswhat does symbols like this ^> mean in the code i know that a stand for anchor  and what href stands for but those symbols are confusing
They are regular expressions and you should probably not be parsing HTML using them.
These symbols, when used inside a string don't have a particular meaning in python.However, they mean something while used in strings passed to modules that handle regular expressions like re.
Other answers have already alluded to the fact that the use of the 'symbols' (read: operators) are for defining regular expressions. For the line in question:For regular expressions, using the  character inside a set definition, i.e.  indicates a match only if the character is NOT 'a', 'b', 'c' or 'd'.See https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html for more information on regular expressions and their usage in Python.
