I have this code:It works fine because it extracts all the files but how do I extract all the  files in the archive that the user specifies.  
To extract just the MP3 files from a ZIP archive, you could do the following:The list of files inside the ZIP file can be obtained using the  function. With this you can filter just those files ending with an  extension. The  function lets you pass a list of all of the files you want to extract (it defaults to all files).
You could get a list of the names of the members in the list, and only extract those ending with the suffix .
