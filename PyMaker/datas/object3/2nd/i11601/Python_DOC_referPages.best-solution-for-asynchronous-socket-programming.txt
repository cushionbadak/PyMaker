Recently I've started working on Python socket server which handles raw UTF input from Java's streams and sends the result back on all of the currently connected servers, and that works fine, but I'm so pumped and worried about thread usage: you see, I'm using about 2 threads per each connection and I'm worried that CPU will die out that way soon, so, I need a better solution now so that my server could handle hundreds of connections. I have two ideas for that:Using a non-blocking IOHaving a fixed amount of thread pools (i.e.  as it called in Java) I have no idea which one is gonna work better, so I'd appreciate your advice and ideas.Thanks!
I would advise not to invent a bicycle and to use some framework for async/streaming processing. For example Tornado.Also if you can consider using Go language - a lot of developers (including me) are switching from Python to Go for this kind of  tasks. It's designed from ground up to support async processing.
