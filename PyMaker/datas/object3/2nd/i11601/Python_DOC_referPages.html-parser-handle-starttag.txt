The HTMLParser class isn't designed to be used out of the box.  The idea is that you make your own class that inherits from HTMLParser and override the methods that you want to use.  In practice this means adding your 'handle_starttag' function to a class, like this:There's a problem with handle_starttag though: now that it's inside a class, the names  and  are not defined.  You can fix this by making them attributes of your parser after you've created it, like this:and prefix them in the handle_starttags method with , so that the Python interpreter looks for these attributes in your parser.  So your code should end up looking like this:
The problem here is that you are never modifying your  list. You define the  function - which appends to the list - but then never call it.
