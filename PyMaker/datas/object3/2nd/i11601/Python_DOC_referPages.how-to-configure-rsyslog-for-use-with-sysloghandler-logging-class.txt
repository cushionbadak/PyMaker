In order to write log messages of "myapp" into , I use SysLogHandler.problem"myapp" runs well, no error, but nothing gets logged,  remains empty.logging configurationRelevant parts of the logging configuration file:logging testHere is how I try to write a log in the main script of "myapp":I have added some  to  to see what's happening and I get:rsyslog configuration (relevant parts; TCP and UDP syslog receptions are disabled)::rsyslog testAccording to  output, it looks like  is listening to  (or am I wrong?):I don't put the whole  output since it's a bit long, but the mentionning"local" lines:I don't understand what I am missing. rsyslog's documentation matching the version I use (7.4.4) seems outdated and I can't find my way in it. Not sure that's the place to find how to fix my problem.EDITS:It's not possible to define a "personal" facility, like "myapp" (even if it's defined in , so I changed to use the 'local5' one.

It's possible to modify them. Anyway, from my python script, I decided to only send the message to log and let  format the output. So finally, the relevant parts of my logging configuration file are:And I added a customized template in :and accordingly modified :I also want to mention that the documentation provided by the matching package ( for ubuntu) matches the installed version, of course, and provides hints I hadn't found in the online documentation.
