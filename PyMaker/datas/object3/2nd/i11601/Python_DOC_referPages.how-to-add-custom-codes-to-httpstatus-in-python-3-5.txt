My HTTP client uses the Python requests library to access an API proxied by CloudFlare. The client converts the numerical response status code to an  enum instance. Simplified ...The CloudFlare proxy service can return some unofficial 5xx HTTP status codes: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#CloudFlare. These cause  to raise a  because codes such as 522 (Connection Timed Out) are not members of the  enum defined in Python's .How can I add the unoffical CloudFlare status codes to the  enum? Or, how can I load the  enum members into some other enum along with the unoffical CloudFlare status codes?The Python 3.5  documentation, https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html, describes restrictions that have thwarted me thus far.Section 8.13.9: Subclassing an enumeration is allowed only if the  enumeration does not define any members.Section 8.13.14.2: The most interesting thing about  members is  that they are singletons.  creates them all while it is  creating the  class itself, and then puts a custom   in place to ensure that no new ones are ever instantiated by returning  only the existing member instances.
The new aenum library1 has an  function that is capable of adding new members to an existing enumeration.Example usage:1 The aenum library is from the author/coauthor of the enum34 backport and the Python 3.4  data type.
