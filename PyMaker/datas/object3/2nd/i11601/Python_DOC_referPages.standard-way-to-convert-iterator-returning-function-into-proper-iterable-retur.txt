To avoid confusion, let me define:proper iterable: an iterable object that is not an iterator.Q: Does Python's Standard Library already provide a way to convert an "iterator-returning function" into a "proper iterable-returning function"?I thought I'd seen this somewhere, but now I can't find it.  In particular, I scanned through the docs for , but did not spot it.FWIW, this homegrown implementation seems to work:...but the one-time  class in there looks clumsy to me.  I'm sure an implementation of such a thing from the Standard Library would be a lot better.@NikitaTry this:There is a difference between the values returned by  and .  My question is: does the Standard Library already provide something analogous to ?
It doesn't make sense - "iterator-returning function" into an "iterable returning function". If a function is returning an iterator, then it's already returning an iterable, because iterators are iterables as they are required to have  method.From the docs:iterableAn object capable of returning its members one at a time. Examples of  iterables include all sequence types (such as list, str, and tuple)  and some non-sequence types like dict, file objects, and objects of  any classes you define with an () or () method.  Iterables can be used in a for loop and in many other places where a  sequence is needed (zip(), map(), ...). When an iterable object is  passed as an argument to the built-in function iter(), it returns an  iterator for the object. This iterator is good for one pass over the  set of values. When using iterables, it is usually not necessary to  call iter() or deal with iterator objects yourself. The for statement  does that automatically for you, creating a temporary unnamed variable  to hold the iterator for the duration of the loop. See also iterator,  sequence, and generator.iteratorAn object representing a stream of data. Repeated calls to the  iteratorâ€™s () method (or passing it to the built-in function  next()) return successive items in the stream. When no more data are  available a StopIteration exception is raised instead. At this point,  the iterator object is exhausted and any further calls to its  () method just raise StopIteration again. Iterators are required to have an () method that returns the iterator object itself so every iterator is also iterable and may be used in most places where other iterables are accepted. One  notable exception is code which attempts multiple iteration passes. A  container object (such as a list) produces a fresh new iterator each  time you pass it to the iter() function or use it in a for loop.  Attempting this with an iterator will just return the same exhausted  iterator object used in the previous iteration pass, making it appear  like an empty container.UPD: What I mean is...(Showing by steps to compare)Case 1:;,  is  with ;,  is iterator returned by ;, returns some value dependent on .Case 2:;,  is iterator equal to , which has  (per iterator protocol);,  is iterator returned by , because calling  on iterator returns itself, so  returns ;, returns some value dependent on .As you can see, nothing really changes, except for additional complications on the preparation step.May be you could provide additional information on what you are trying to achieve by such 'wrapping', to understand the real issue.As per your question, I can't think of any library function, that would turn iterator into iterable, because it already is. If you are trying to duplicate iterators may be take a look at .UPD2:So, now I see, that the goal is to convert single-pass iterator to multi-pass iterator...My answer to:"does the Standard Library already provide something analogous to  to_iterable_maker?"is "No". But the closest is , which can help you clone a single iterator into several, that you can use after. Regarding your example:Another common way to get iterable from iterator is to convert it using  or , which will allow multi-pass:Both methods described above might be heavy on memory usage, so sometimes it's not an option. In that case a solution you came to will work well. Another implemetation, which I could think of, and which is a little bit more object-oriented, but otherwise not much different from yours:the use is the same:
