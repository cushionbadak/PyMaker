This question already has an answer here:Python's trigonmetric function return unexpected values                    6 answers                I was trying to develop a little console aplication for solving additions between vectors using the Cosine Law:But the, the cos in the equation returned a weird value (the angle was 60, so the  should be 1/2, right?).Also, I tried changing the  with  after reading other solutions, but it returned .Does anyone know how to solve this?
Python's trigonometric functions use radians, rather than degrees.  Fortunately, the  module includes a function to perform the conversion for you:
Argument of cos() should be expressed in radians.
