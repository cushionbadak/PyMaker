I'm trying to download BVLC-trained model and I'm stuck with this errorI think it's because of the following function (complete code)Any idea how to fix this?
You are opening a file that is not UTF-8 encoded, while the default encoding for your system is set to UTF-8. Since you are calculating a SHA1 hash, you should read the data as binary instead. The  functions require you pass in bytes:Note the addition of  in the file mode.See the  documentation:mode is an optional string that specifies the mode in which the file is opened. It defaults to  which means open for reading in text mode. [...] In text mode, if encoding is not specified the encoding used is platform dependent:  is called to get the current locale encoding. (For reading and writing raw bytes use binary mode and leave encoding unspecified.)and from the  module documentation:You can now feed this object with bytes-like objects (normally bytes) using the update() method.
You didn't specify to open the file in binary mode, so  is trying to read the file as a UTF-8-encoded text file, which doesn't seem to be working.  But since we take the hash of bytes, not of strings, it doesn't matter what the encoding is, or even whether the file is text at all: just open it, and then read it, as a binary file.but
Since there is not a single hint in the documentation nor src code, I have no clue why, but using the b char (i guess for binary) totally works (tf-version: 1.1.0):For more information, check out: gfile
