SourceChanged in version 3.0: Always returns an unsigned value. To generate the same numeric value across all Python versions and platforms, use crc32(data) & 0xffffffff.But why do we need to use a bitwise and with a binary number set to all 1's? Wont the result be the same regardless (as in any binary number BITWISE ANDED with all 1's will always be the same binary number)? This seemingly arbitrary detail makes me uncomfortable.
The bitwise  forces a conversion of the value to an unsigned integer.  Consider, for example:Based on the comment you have quoted, in 3.0 Python was changed to always return an unsigned value, while in previous versions the  method may have returned a signed value.For example, in Python 2.7.11:But in Python 3.4.3:So you get different values here, but if in Python 2.7 you perform the bitwise and, you get the same value as in Python 3.4:
