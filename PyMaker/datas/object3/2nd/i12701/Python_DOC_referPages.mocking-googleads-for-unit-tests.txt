I have a service that uses the googleads library in python, I want to unit test these functions but do not know how to go about mocking this aspect.When I used PHP and Zend Framework it was pretty easy to mock clients, as I could tell what was expected to be called, and mock what was returned, but I do not know how to do this here.Could you point to a good resource to do learn more about it? Here's some example code I'd like to test (get_account_timezone):Thank you,ferminEDIT: Here's the beginning of the test, I have some questions for it though.When setting instance = AdWords(...), it is generating a real instance of my AdWords class, instead of taking the mock, I am lost as to how to proceed.Asserting that GetService is called fails too.
It is usually really easy to mock stuff in python with mock library. I do not guarantee this is the best way to test this code. Refactoring it can lead to more robust and easier to test code.You should check the documentation for exact methods of the mock library.Alternative to mock is https://pypi.python.org/pypi/doubles/1.1.3
