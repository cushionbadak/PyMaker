I don't understand how  works. Wouldn't that mean this if x is not divisible by two, return True? That's what i see in this code. I see it as  would return the opposite of if a number is divisible by 2, return True.I just don't understand how that part of the syntax works.  
Wouldn't that mean this if x is not divisible by two, return True?No, because when x is not divisible by 2 the result of  would be a nonzero value, which will be evaluated as  by Python, so its  would be .Read more about Truth value testing in python.
The modulo operator  returns the remainder of a division. If  is divisible by 2 ('even'), then the remainder is zero and  thus evaluates to zero (=False), which makes the whole expression True.
note, to add to the other answers:  does not mean "x is divisible by 2"; instead, it is the modulo operator, and returns the value  such that  is congruent to  (mod 2), which is really just the remainder of dividing  by 2. Here is a fix for your code:See also: The modulo operator, in the python language reference (under "Binary Arithmetic Operators", fourth paragraph down.
If the remainder of X / 2 is 0, then return true
Simpler and readable is for instancewhere it explicitly tells the expression must equate zero in order for the function to return .
If operation , function returns true - which means that the number is even.Operation modulo 2 returns the remainder from division by 2.Example: because  because use  because
