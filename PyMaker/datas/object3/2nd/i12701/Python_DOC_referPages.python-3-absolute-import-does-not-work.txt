I have a folder with two files: test.py and csv.py .  In test.py I haveThis imports my csv.py file instead of importing the built-in csv module.Why? I thought that absolute imports were default in Python 3?How do I force Python to load the built-in csv module?does not help.  Neither doeswhich, according to the docs, should "only perform absolute imports".Renaming csv.py is not an acceptable solution.  Also I'd rather not use the "from module import something" syntax (not that it helps in this case).(Using Python 3.4.0 on Linux Mint 17.1)
You have a top-level  module, which lives on the  path, so it is found before the built-in module. This is how absolute imports work.Move your modules into a package if you expected  to be 'local'. Move your modules into a directory with your package name, and add a  file (it can be empty). Your  module is then namespaced as  and won't be considered as a top-level module.
