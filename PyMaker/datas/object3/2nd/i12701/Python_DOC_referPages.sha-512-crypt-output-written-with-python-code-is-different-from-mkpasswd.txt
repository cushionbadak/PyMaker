Running  results in the following:I have this snippet of Python code that I thought would output the same, but isn't:It instead results in:Not sure what I am doing wrong.Another question I have is, how do I tell sha512 function to do custom rounds. It seems to take only 1 argument. 
 is a front-end to the  function. I don't think it is a straight-forward SHA512 hash here.A little research points to the specification for SHA256-crypt and SHA512-crypt, which shows the hash is applied a default 5000 times. You can specify a different number of rounds using the  switch to ;  indeed gives you the same output:The minimum number of rounds offered by the command-line tool is 1000:The algorithm is a bit more involved, requiring you to create several digests. You could instead access the C  function through the  function, and drive it the same way the  commandline does.It depends on your platform if the  method is available; the Python 3 version of the  module offers a  list that tells you what methods your platform supports. Since this use the exact same library  uses, your OS obviously does support  and Python will have access too.You need to prefix the salt with  to specify the different method. You can specify the number of rounds by adding a  string between the  string and your salt:This then produces the same output as the  command line:
You need to use :
Here is a pure python3 implementation of the  function based on the specification. This is for illustration only, always use  instead!
