I have a SQL table that contains data of the mySQL  type as follows:I then use  to read the table in:Looking at  yields:My main issue is that, when writing my  to a csv file, the data comes out all messed up, instead of essentially looking like my SQL table:I'd like to instead (obviously) store this record as a , but I can't find anything in the pandas docs that talk about a time . Does pandas lack this functionality intentionally? Is there a way to solve my problem without requiring janky data casting?Seems like this should be elementary, but I'm confounded.
found a solution, but i feel like it's gotta be more elegant than this:

Pandas does not support a  dtype seriesPandas (and NumPy) do not have a  dtype. Since you wish to avoid Pandas , you have 3 options: Pandas , Python , or Python . Below they are presented in order of preference. Let's assume you start with the following dataframe:Pandas  seriesYou can use Pandas  series and include an arbitrary date component, e.g. today's date. Underlying such a series are integers, which makes this solution the most efficient and adaptable.The default date, if unspecified, is 1-Jan-1970:You can also specify a date, such as today:Pandas  series of Python  valuesThe Python  module from the standard library supports  objects. You can convert your series to an  dtype series containing pointers to a sequence of  objects. Operations will no longer be vectorised, but each underlying value will be represented internally by a number.Pandas  series of Python  valuesConverting to strings is only recommended for presentation purposes that are not supported by other types, e.g. Pandas  or Python .
