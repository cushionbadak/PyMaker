Natural Text
I am fairly new at python, but have used regex for a while.  What am I missing here:Why does this match at the beginning of the string, but not at the end?  I am using python 2.7 on windows and linux.
You should use  instead of . According to the docs:Python offers two different primitive operations based on regular expressions:  checks for a match only at the beginning of the string, while  checks for a match anywhere in the string (this is what Perl does by default).So when you use  it's the same as using  in your regex (matches the position before the first character in the string).
