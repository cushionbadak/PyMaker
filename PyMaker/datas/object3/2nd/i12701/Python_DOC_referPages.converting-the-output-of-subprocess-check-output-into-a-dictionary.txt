I am running the command  from Python using  and collecting it in a variable.And it is giving me output as:I want to get the status of wlan from this output as  or . For that I want to convert the above string into dictionary and want to use  as a key so that I can get the value from a key and decide whether  is connected or not connected.But when I am converting it to a dictionary its giving error something like this:I am not getting what is the real problem, its with the string or something else?
Why don't simply use regex like:If it's needed to covert it to a dict, use  with some magic like this:
I am not getting what is the real problem, its with the string or something else? You can't just convert a string to a dictionary, even if the string reads like one to a human.You're going to have to parse that string and pluck the (key, value) pairs from it.The key would be e.g. "Physical address" and the value "c0:38:96:92:b7:1d"netsh has an XML output which is computer readableThe Netsh commands for the Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) enable you  The tool then exports the collected data into an XML file  that you can examine for clues to the cause of the problem.Why not use the XML output instead of fragile hacks that may stop working at the tiniest console output format change?This ought to give you a computer readable file, easily traversable with Python numerous XML tools.Forming dicts from a list of pairsValueError: dictionary update sequence element #0 has length 1; 2 is  requiredThis is because  expected a list of (key, value) pairs from which to form a dict. (key, value) has a length of 2 (it's a pair)e.g.
