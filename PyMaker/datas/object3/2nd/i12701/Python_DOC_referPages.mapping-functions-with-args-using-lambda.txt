Okay this one is confusing. My old piece of code has something like now I would like to make  -> while  stays unchanged.in , the length of arguments will be checked different operations. My questions are1) which length will be checked?  or 2) in , how should I set up the default? It was likebut now with potential multiple arguments, I don't know what to do with the initialization. I want to be able to do something like Is that even possible?
If I understand your question correctly, you're looking for variable arguments. These can be mixed with fixed arguments, provided you obey a logical ordering (fixed arguments first, then keyword arguments or variable arguments).For example, the following shows how map to a function that takes in one constant argument and one variable argument. If you would like different behaviour, please provide a concrete example of what you are trying to accomplishWe don't know how many arguments are going to be passed to  (in this trivial case, it's one or two), but the "*" notation accepts any number of objects to be passedNote I've encapsulated  in  so that it gets evaluated, as in python3 it is a generator. List comprehension may be more idiomatic in python. Also don't forget you can always use a simple for loop - an obfuscated or complex  call is far less pythonic than a clear (but several line) for-loop, imo.If, rather, you're trying to combine multiple arguments in a map call, I would recommend using the same variable argument strategy with the zip function, e.g.,In this case,  will get called first as , and then as
