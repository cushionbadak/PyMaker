I receive a namespace object from command line arguments.And I don't want to modify it.Can I do that or do you have some ideas? 
I initially proposed the custom Namespace class, but I like this idea of copying  to a NamedTuple better.NamedtupleAnother option is to copy the values from  to an immutable object/class.  A named tuple might do the job nicely.Create a namespacenow define a namedtupleYou could also get the tuple names from the Namespace itself (after parsing)create such a tuple with values from :and it is immutable:Such a namedtuple cannot be used as a Namespace, since  produces the same error. A clean way to do all of this is to wrap it all in a function:The calling code never sees the mutable , just the immutable .Custom Namespace classTo build on  answer,  can use your own  class.https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#the-namespace-objectNow  and  reference the same  object.  As long as  and  work,  can use this namespace object.Now, can you allow , but disallow ?  I think you can, but it will require a good understanding of how the latter expression works.  It may just require customizing , but I haven't studied this aspect of Python in a while.By design it is possible, and even acceptable to 'monkey patch' the  namespace - with a custom class like this.
You can redefine  in your mutable_namespace:
