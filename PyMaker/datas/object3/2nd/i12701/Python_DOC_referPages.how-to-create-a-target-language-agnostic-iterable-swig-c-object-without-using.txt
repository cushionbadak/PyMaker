I'm somewhat new to SWIG and C++, so this may be obvious, but I cannot seem to figure it out. I have a C++ collection object (in the MWE, a ), that in C++ is indexed by a , but iterates over the objects. This works in C++ using a ranged-based for loop with the implementations of  and .Here's a MWE:pantry.ipantry.cppI've also put together a short Python script:Then, depending on whether the  flag is passed to SWIG, I get the error:without :  -- which makes sense because I've chosen to index by stringswith :  -- I think this is caused by SWIG not implicitly creating methods I haven't declared, which is seems correct in this instance.How can I iterate over the collection contents without explicitly calling a method? I realize I could just make the  public and iterate over that, but my actual code is more complicated and I'd prefer not to do that. Likewise, I could implement some other  method, but I've already done the work with  and .Edit: What would be a target-language agnostic method that I could implement similar to the macros I made for  and , and what would be the correct template to add to the interface file (something like ?
You have two options to implement iterable interface:Implement  which returns an object instance having .Implement  which accepts integers or slice objects.I guess this should explain both errors as well as give a clue of how to fix.
