I'm using Python and I have two classes. I want to import a function for a class but with the ability of adding things to that function.
Basic principlesYou cannot access local variables from one function (or method) in another function. This is by design. This  is wrong. In Python 3 do . While using  as the name of the first argument in method is a strong convention,  is just an ordinary name not a reserved keyword or built-in.There are several problems here:a. The method name needs to  not .b. Don't hardwire the name of the parent class with  use .c. If you don't do anything extra in the  of , than you don't need to implement the  at all.Possible solutionFor your problem, using a dictionary with the key press names as keys and the functions for the actions as values seems useful.First define a few small helper functions: Now your main class:Names are important, therefore I use  instead of .This line  is the core of this solution. Here  is a dictionary that maps names of key press events to functions. Note  without the  because I put the function object into the dictionary rather than calling this function.Calling this function is a bit different:I use the  method of the dictionary. This returns the value for the key if the key is in it and  if not. Now  holds either a reference to the function  if the key was  or . If it is a function I call it with .An alternative here could be a -: Now, in your child class, you only need to add another key-value pair to  to extend its functionality:Make two instances and test your code:prints:
