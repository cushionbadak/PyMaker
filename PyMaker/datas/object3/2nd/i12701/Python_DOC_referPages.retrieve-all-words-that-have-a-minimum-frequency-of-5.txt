I want to retrieve all words that have a minimum frequency of 5 with NLTK and store them in the variable for future processing. Can not find anything in NLTK book. Thanks in advance.Edit: I am using this code and want to filter out words that do not appear more than 5 times.
Use the function  to get frequencies that filter them by your creteria:A frequency distribution for the outcomes of an experiment.  A      frequency distribution records the number of times each outcome of      an experiment has occurred.  For example, a frequency distribution      could be used to record the frequency of each word type in a      document.ref Here is an example how to use it:With this last, we got a list of words with their frequencies, now you should filter them by your conditions , use the  function: filter(function, iterable) Construct an iterator from those elements  of iterable for which function returns true. iterable may be either a  sequence, a container which supports iteration, or an iterator.ref
If NLTK is not to be used you can use .
