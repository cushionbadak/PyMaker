This question already has an answer here:How to print Docstring of python function from inside the function itself?                    8 answers                I have been searching for an answer for a lot of time now. Let's say I wrote a function in python and I made a brief documentation of what this function is doing. Is there any way to print the function's documentation from within main? Or from the function itself?
You can either use  or print the .  prints a more verbose description of an object while  holds only the documentation string you have defined with triple quotes  in the beginning of your function.For example, using  explicitly on the  built-in function:Additionally, since Python first compiles an object and during execution evaluates it you can call  within the function with no problems:and remember, besides functions, modules and classes have a  attribute holding their documentation.Alternatively, using  for :Will print: gives a bit more information, including the docstring.
