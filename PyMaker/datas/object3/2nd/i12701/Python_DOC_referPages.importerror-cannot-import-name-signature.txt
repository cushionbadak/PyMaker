I am tying to modify the original   to create my won version. The original code has "from .utils.fixes import signature". So I did the following in my version:but got a error:When check the sklearn source code on GitHub. I see the following code inside :Then I did  directly. Still get ""Besides how to fix this, I am also curious about why the original version can import a module that will be imported from another source? Thanks.
In python 2, the  module does not have a  method.In python 3, the  module does have a  method.This code is just trying to work with both python 2 and 3.You may want to use the  module if you are using python 2, or use  directly (for version ).
