This question already has an answer here:Why does `a == b or c or d` always evaluate to True? [duplicate]                    1 answer                I'm new to programming and am learning Python with the book Learning Python the Hard Way. I'm at exercise 36, where we're asked to write our own simple game.http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex36.html(The problem is, when I'm in the hallway (or more precisely, in 'choices') and I write 'gate' the game responds as if I said "man" of "oldman" etc.What am I doing wrong?)EDIT: I shouldn't have written 'if "oldman" or "man" in choice' but instead put 'in choice' after every option.However, next problem.. The man never stands up and cursus me, it keeps frowning. Why does the game not proceed to that elif?EDIT: FIXED IT!!Thanks for all your help :).
The problem is, when I'm in the hallway (or more precisely, in  'choices') and I write 'gate' the game responds as if I said "man" of  "oldman" etc.ExplanationWhat you were doing was being seen by Python as:Which evaluates to True if any of those 3 conditions is of a "truthy" value. A non-empty string like "oldman" and "man" evaluates to True. So that explains why your code behaved the way it did.Test if a choice is in a list of choices:You're looking forOr, at least:
Look carefully at the evaluation of your conditions:This will first evaluate if  is , which happens to be the case, and the  condition will evaluate to be .I think what you intended is:Alternatively you could use:The one caveat, is with this method it is looking for an exact match and not a substring match.
