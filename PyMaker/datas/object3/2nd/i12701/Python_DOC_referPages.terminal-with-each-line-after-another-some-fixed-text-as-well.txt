Natural Text
I'd like to have both:Lines displayed each one after another (Blah 12, Blah 13, Blah 14, etc.) like in a normal terminalFixed position information (on right) : Date + fixed text "Bonjour"It nearly works, until ~ Blah 250, when the look is destroyed! Why?http://gget.it/kcir9kmg/asds.gifWith an ANSI terminal, how to have both normal terminal behaviour (one new line for each ) + fixed position display?Note: On Windows, I use ansicon.exe to have ANSI support in Windows cmd.exe.
From the given picture: ansicon appears to be allocating a console buffer to do its work; that has a limited size (due to the Windows console, which limits the buffer size to 64 kilobytes).  Once your script reaches the end of the buffer and tries to move the cursor past the end, ansicon forces the whole buffer to scroll up.  That makes the style of update change.If your calls to  were bounded within ansicon's workspace, you would get more consistent results.Regarding the "multiple lines" for "Bonjour", this chunkis printing the date on one line, and then moving forward 4 lines, printing "Bonjour" on the same column.  It seems that there's enough space (10 columns) on the same line to do this:which would at least make the text on the right look consistent.  The scrolling from  will cause some double-spacing at times though.
