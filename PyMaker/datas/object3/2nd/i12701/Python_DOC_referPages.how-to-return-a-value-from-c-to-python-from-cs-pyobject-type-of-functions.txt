Natural Text
I was trying to pass a value by calling C file from python and then return that value from C to python again. My question is how to do this? Can it possible to use return  kind of thing?
Specify the format of the value:You can find more format unit here ( documentation).
You can use the explicit constructors for integers  or  instead.You can find functions like this for any type you can create with  and get a little type safety on top.
