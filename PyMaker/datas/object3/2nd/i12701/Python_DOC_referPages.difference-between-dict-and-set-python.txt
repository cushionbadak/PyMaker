So, I know that this,Constructs an empty dictionary. Now, I also picked up that this,Creates a set. This can easily be verified, as,While I understand what it does, I fail to see why we use the same syntax for both sets and dictionaries. I tried to find some more information about the logic behind this in the  and  sections of the manual, but sadly, I got nothing out of it.Could anyone explain to me why we do this in this way? Is it for historical reasons, or am I missing something blatantly obvious?
There was no set literals in Python 2, historically curly braces only used for dictionaries. Sets could be produced from lists (or any iterables):Python 3 introduced set literals and comprehensions (see PEP-3100) which allows to avoid intermediate lists:Empty set form, however reserved for dictionaries as backward compatibility. Check references from PEP-3100, i.e. here: [Python-3000] sets in P3K?I'm sure we can work something out --- I agree,  for empty set and   for empty dict would be ideal, were it not for backward compatibility.  I  liked the "special empty object" idea when I first wrote the PEP (i.e.,  have  be something that could turn into either a set or dict), but one  of the instructors here convinced me that it would just lead to confusion  in newcomers' minds (as well as being a pain to implement).The following message describes these rules better:I think Guido had the best solution.  Use  for empty sets, use    for empty dicts, use  for set comprehensions/displays, use    for explicit set literals, and use  for dict   literals.  We can always add / later if demand exceeds distaste.
The syntax is not the same. Dictionaries used curly braces the first and you specify key-value pairs, where the key and value are separated by a colon:Sets were added to the language later on, and the  curly brace notation only names elements, not pairs:Note that in Python 2, the interpreter echoes the object using the  callable. That's also how you specify an empty set:In Python 3, the newer  notation is used when echoing the object, unless it is empty:The  type was added to the Python language in version 2.4 (see PEP 218), the curly brace syntax for set literals was added in Python 3 and back-ported to Python 2.7.
The fact that  is used for an empty dictionary and not for an empty set has largely historical reasons. The syntax  for dictionaries has been around since the beginning of Python. The syntax  for sets was introduced with Python 2.7. Since  has been used for such a long time it will stay as the way to define an empty dictionary. If Python would have had the new set syntax since the beginning, likely an empty set would be defined with  and an empty dictionary with .
