I am fetching data from a MySQL database and writing into a CSV file.This looks like this :This works fine with normal columns. However, I have a column which is of type  and has JSON data in it.csv_writer adds extra quotes around each key value in the JSON when it creates the CSV file.i.e., if my column has this value :the output.csv file has :What I want is :How do I achieve this ?(I have to read this file again in a ruby app and recreate the json. With this extra quotes, I am not sure how do I handle that!)
To specify how the output should be formatted, you need to pass the correct formatting parameters when creating the writer, or create you own dialect and use that.In your case, you'll probably want something like this:This uses the default () dialect while overriding the supplied parameters.
