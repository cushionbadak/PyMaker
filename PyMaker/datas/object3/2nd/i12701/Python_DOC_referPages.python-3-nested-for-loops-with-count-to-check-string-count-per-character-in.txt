Here I'm asking for a word, and generating a list of all combinations for the letters in  variable, in theory (in my head) the for loop's  statement should work.The aim of the program is to list all valid anagrams from a word inputted - and checked where it only contains one of each of the letters in  - then i'll check this against a word file of real words - which I haven't got round to yet.Any help is appreciated on getting the  loop to work.
To be honest I didn't quite understood your question, but it looks like you are trying to generate anagrams of a word, which are permutations of characters.There is no need to count the letters, as python can generate the permutations directly:If you want to check if two worstrings are anagrams of each other, here are some examples:
