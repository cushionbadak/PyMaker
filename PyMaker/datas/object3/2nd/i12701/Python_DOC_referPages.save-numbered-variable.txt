This is an XY Problem in which problem X (i.e., referring to elements in a ) is much easier than problem Y (i.e., creating a series of numbered variables corresponding to elements in a ). On top of that, doing this would defeat the entire purpose of using a . It doesn't take too long to hard-code it for the five elements you showed, but the  with "many elements" you mention should not be given this treatment.A  holds several objects, generally of a homogeneous type and purpose, like inches of rainfall on each day of the year. This data structure makes it easy to store and process all of these objects together. You can also refer to them individually, by indexing.Where you are hoping to refer to the first element of  as , use instead . That is the reference that you already have for that object. You do not need to pollute the namespace with a pile of numbered references. The  type is intended precisely for this situation. Please use a .
