Here's my code:So I found out I can easily pass a class as a parameter. But the last problem is about the named argument. If you watch my code, I do a . The problem is that it's a "named" parameter, and I'd like to be able to pass it like that:And then to call it somehow like that (it doesn't work yet):For now I get this error:To be more precise, I need to call  one time with  and another time with  which, in other words, should call once  and  and I would like to know if there's a way to precise only the name of the parameter, not How to solve this?
That is extremely not recommended, but it is possible by using  function.But as I said, it is not pythonic and can easily fail. You should have it really tested in order to go ahead with this approach.My suggestion is to encapsulate into functions each situation, and call these functions according to the argument passed. But in order to answer your question, that is the way its done.
Seems like normal keyword unpacking would work . . .Of course, now  might not be the best name for the function parameter, but hopefully you get the idea.
Here's my working solution, I don't know if it's the best "pythonic" way but it works like a charm:
