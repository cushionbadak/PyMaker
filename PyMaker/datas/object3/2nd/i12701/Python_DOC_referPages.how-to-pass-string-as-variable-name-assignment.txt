I have a SDF data file which stores variables names and their values in block format.The values in side the  are names of variables (strings) corresponding to which a data block is there inside the sdf file and it can be accessed only by giving these variable names.I read the data file and variables using the following code in ipythonThe outputs of variable names is as follows:Now, I wish to use this string on the right side of an assignment e.g. If I write this line in a standard Python program, it reads the data and assigns it to electronDensity.However, in my simulations, these variables are dynamically created and their names can be found using  command as written above. I am not able to create a program line equivalent to
You can use  to evaluate an expression from a string in Python.  Here's a simple example:In your case, you can do:
Using  without argument, you can access local variables as a dictionary. Or you can also use  or .Mixing with  to get arbitrary attribute using attribute name:
Thanks for the answers. I did the following and it worked.This way, even if I don't know what are the vaiables created in every simulation run, my post-processing python-script will take care of the dynamically created variables at runtime of simulation.Thanks again.
