I have two Counter collections C1 and C2, they have similar data set but different counts (think C1 and C2 as number of apples and oranges a group of people have).I want to merge these two collections into one dict that looks likeI haven't decided what data structure to store the merged counts (perhaps list) in order to easily write them to a csv file with # of apples and oranges being separate columns. There are a lot of tricks I am not aware of in python collections, I am looking for minimal code size. Thanks.EDIT: From the answers below, I felt that my question is not as clear as I thought, let me elaborate on what exactly what I am looking for:Let me have two Counter collections c1 and c2:I want to merge these two collections into a single dict such that it looks like:Or other data structure that can be easily converted and output to csv format.
You can use  from the  module to store the merged result then you use  from the  module. What  is doing here is that it makes an iterator that returns elements from each of your "counter" and let you avoid writing a nested loop.
Using pandas:This works also if the keys of the counters are not all the same. There will be NaNs where the key only appeared in the other counter.
