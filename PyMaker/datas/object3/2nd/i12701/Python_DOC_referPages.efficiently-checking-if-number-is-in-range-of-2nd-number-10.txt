I need to write a function which checks if a number is in range of  from another number.I wrote this function:It returns  if  . This solves the problem however it feels like this code isn't very "Python Like". Is there a way to make it simpler? 
You can do 
PEP 0485 introduced the  function (and it's complex cousin  for making these sort of checks; it also checks for special values such as ,  et al. The apparent downside is, it only appears in  from what I know and it's still in it's infancy so it might get some face-lifts in the future. Basic functionality:This is a built-in (so you could use it efficiently with things like  ) that's made to check how close two numerics are and allows for greater flexibility when trying to find approximations. Internally it uses the  solutions in a similar manner presented here, take a look at the  source for yourself, it is most likely as efficient as it can get. (A version of it python can be found )For older versions of Python, you could use the solutions already pointed out or look at how  was implemented and get inspired.Note that in most cases  should be specified, unless dealing with values near . Additionally, for cases where array elements should be evaluated, the most efficient use is probably supplied by the  function.
I think the clearest way is very close to your function, with a few alterations:you check whether the number is within 1%, not within 10%you can use comparison chainingyou can directly return the result, instead of using an Like this:
