Asking for code solutions to something you should be learning yourself probably isn't a good idea.Just look up the documentation for TKinter here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.htmlAs a note, you may want to consider opening separate windows when displaying the information. When I first learned TKinter, I first practiced by printing all my data to the console with the  command before trying to force them into tables.Also, consider fleshing out the GUI and make it look like a table. Give each label a fixed length and each box a fixed length, this will make it look better.A good example of this in action is on this amazing website for learning TKinter: http://www.tkdocs.com/tutorial/firstexample.htmlJust scroll down until you find the Python implementation of the code :)
