In the program below, I have created a class called "Tv" and from this class I have instantiated two objects, which are called "vardagsrums_tv" and "koks_tv". In the main function of the program, the user can change different settings in both of the objects, e.g., volume and channel, through certain class methods I have created. So far, so good.The heart of the matter, though, is that when the user has changed these different settings (volume, channel), I want to save them to a text file, so that when the user shuts down the program and reopens it, all the settings will be as the user left them.This is my program:In the end of my main() function, you'll notice that I am experimenting on how to save the current settings to my text-file. I create a list and try to somehow get the information out of my objects "vardagsrums_tv" and "koks_tv". I thought, if you can print an object and get the settings, then you might also be able to append it to a list. Obviously it didn't work as planned, since I got an error.I hope you understand what I am trying to do: I want to save information from inside an object (vardagsrums_tv, koks_tv) to a text file, but I seem not to be able to reace the information I want.Here is the rest of program:
You should open your  file with  (append) instead of  (write) or it will overwrite the file. Then use  to then append data to this file. Make sure you close you file afterwards with .
