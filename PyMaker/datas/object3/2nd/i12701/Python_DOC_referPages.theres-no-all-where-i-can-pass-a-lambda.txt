Python doesn't have a method "all" where I can pass a lambda? Or have I missed anything? I'm aware about list comprehension, but how about this?Yes, there're the ways to check that, but there's no functional way? I want to do something like:
There's no built in function, but you can easily write it yourself by composing  with :
No, there's no  implementation which accepts a callback, because the same can be expressed using a generator expression. Using the more complex "check if all values are over 5" example for a better sample:There's no specific need to provide an alternative implementation of  here, since this pattern can handle anything you want, and Python's mantra is to have one obvious way to do things.
If you want to call  with a functionality like . It's a redundant job because  that's exactly what this functions stands for, but if you want to check the validity of an iterable items adn then use , one pythoic way is using a generator expression within  by calling the custom function on iterable items.Note that the  should returns a bool value for each item. Or at least a result which interpret as False by python.
 is the proper way to use a function with , but if you insist on doing it the 'functional way', try :
