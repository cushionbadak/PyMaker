The following code just hangs without ever printing anything:If I use get_event_loop everything works fine. Is there something I'm doing wrong or have I stumbled upon a bug?I'm using Python 3.5.1.
 documentation says:If thereâ€™s need to set this loop as the event loop for the current  context,  must be called explicitly.
