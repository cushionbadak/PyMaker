User1915011 beat me to my answer. In line with his answer and @wim's comment, I have made the following changes your  method. Changed the loop to use the  variableAdded an additional assignment to  inside the loopEnsure the loop terminates by adding Return found after the  loop to indicate success or failure.
Your looping condition is just wrong ?You change value of midpoint only once instead you should be changing it every loop iteration. You compare value with index (midpoint) and should be comparing withlist value (alist[midpoint])This is wrong:  it will always return None.
binary converters are also coolprint(list)
Here is a detailed explanation how it works:
