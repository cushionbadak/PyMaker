I am learning , and I'm trying to write a simple model.I have a function handling tasks. While handling, it goes to another remote service for data and then prints a message.My code:But this code doesn't switch the context while sleeping in:How can I fix that?
asyncio.ensure_future is not thread-safe, that's why  tasks are not started when they should be. Use loop.call_soon_threadsafe:Or asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe if you're running python 3.5.1:However, you should probably keep the use of threads to the minimum. Unless you use a library running tasks in its own thread, all the code should run inside the event loop (or inside an executor, see loop.run_in_executor).
