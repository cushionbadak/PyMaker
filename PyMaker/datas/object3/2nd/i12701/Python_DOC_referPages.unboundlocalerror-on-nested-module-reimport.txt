I get an UnboundLocalError when I reimport an already imported module in python 2.7. A minimal example isHowver, when the nested import is placed as the first statement in the function definition then everything works:Can someone please explain why the first script fails?Thanks.
This is the same as referencing global variable. It is well explained in Python FAQThis is because when you make an assignment to a variable in a scope,  that variable becomes local to that scope and shadows any similarly  named variable in the outer scope. Since the last statement in foo  assigns a new value to x, the compiler recognizes it as a local  variable. Consequently when the earlier print(x) attempts to print the  uninitialized local variable and an error results.
What's hard to understand about this situation is that when you import something inside a scope, there is an implicit assignment.  (Actually a re-assignment in this case). The fact that  exists within  means that, within ,  doesn't refer to the global  variable, it refers to a separate local variable also called .
