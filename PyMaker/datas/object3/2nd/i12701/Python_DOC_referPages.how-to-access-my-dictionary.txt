 is a key of your dictionary. You can access the keys collection in your dictionary using keys() method. Then use each key to access the associated element.
Since  is the only key you could do .But if you ever had more keys this won't work every time since dictionaries are arbitrarily ordered (in other words, have no sense of order), you will need to iterate over the  list, or simply  to print the whole keys list.
if you have more keys, you can loop like this:
It sounds like you want to see the keys of your dict (which in this example is just a single key, ).  Given a dict key, you can use that key to index into the dict to get the associated value.  Here are some examples using the values you gave:
