I'm making a program which opens and reads a csv file and sorts in following ways:Alphabetical order with each students highest score.By the highest score, highest to lowest.Average score, highest to lowest.The program should store the last 3 scores for each student. This is the part where I'm stuck at and need help with. When sorting the file alphabetically the program needs to look at each students last 3 recent scores and select the highest number. Currently, my code only sorts the file in alphabetical order. It does looks at their recent 3 scores and selects the highest one. This is where I need help with.My code already sorts the scores by highest to lowest however it prints out all the scores each student gained rather than printing their highest score out of their 3 recent score.Lastly I need help calculating the average score for each student. I'm guessing the way it should be done is by, adding Andrew's last 3 score which are 5, 4 and 3 and dividing by 3.This is my code:
I will give some code for demonstration:Here are the technicals used above:: Useful data structure when doing data-grouping work.: Powerful tool for changing/filtering iterable data.: Caculating mean value of a list.Hope it helps.
Can I suggest you look at pandas (Its part of the anacondas distribution) And with combinations of the above you should be able to do most things. For help I suggest reading DataAnalysis for Python, which explains a lot of this
