I have used both Python and C for a while. C is good in a way that i can use Windows cmd or anything like that to compile files and easily read command line arguments. However, the only thing that runs python that I know is IDLE which is like an interpreter and doesnt take command-line arguments and it's hard to work with. Is there anything like the C's cmd and a compiler for python 3.x?Thanks
However, the only thing that runs python that I know is IDLE which is  like an interpreter You can still call  from a command lineand doesnt take command-line argumentsIt's possible to read commandline arguments from  using:a compiler for python 3.xpy2exe supports Python 3And finally if you're looking to call commands from your Python code, there is a module called subprocess
if i understand your question , you can do this in python by importing cmd , osfor example :this example is for use command lines in python , however you can write your python code and call .py file in cmd by run this command :search more for other examples , also see official doc : cmd â€” Support for line-oriented command interpreters
You can use the python interpreter as a compiler too to compile your python programs.Say you have a  file which you want to compile; then you can use  to compile the file.To be true, you are not actually compiling the file, you are executing it line by line (well, call it interpreting)For command line arguments you can use  as already mentioned in the above answers.
Provided on how you have it installed, you can probably just run the python scripts as is, by typing the script file name, for example:If you have a relatively recent python installation, this will be associated with the python launcher (py.exe) and be equivalent to runningIf you only have one version of python installed this will run it with this, but the python launcher supports multiple ways to customize how it behaves with multiple versions of python.Additionally, and as stated above, you can run the script with just the python command as well.  The main difference is that running it with the python command allows you to specify exactly which installation gets ran, using the script name alone (or the py.exe version), will allow the system to select which installation gets ran.
