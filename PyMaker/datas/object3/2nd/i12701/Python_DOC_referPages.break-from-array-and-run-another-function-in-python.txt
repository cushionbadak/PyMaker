My code: I want to run  after every 3 elements of the array and then resume from the last element. 
You can use enumerate and modulo:Output:If you actually want to use  elements at a time maybe passing them to a function:Output:
However, I question some parts of your code. Here are some notes: is a python list, not an array, so the name is not the best one.Your  function simply returns the string "Exit", are you sure it does what it is supposed to do? I am printing the return value of , because simply calling it would do nothing useful. In addition, it would probably be better to write  such that it takes a list as a parameter. Lastly,  is already a built-in Python function, overriding it is a bad idea.
