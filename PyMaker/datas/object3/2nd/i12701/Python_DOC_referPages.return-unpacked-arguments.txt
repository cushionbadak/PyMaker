If you're not using Python 3.5+ with additional unpacking generalizations, you can't unpack as part of a return value. Just explicitly make the combined  through  concatenation:
In python versions prior to 3.5, simply construct a new tuple using it:In python 3.5, your current syntax would be fine.
Simple. Just don't use the star and reference as a list.The * is only used in the method definition to show that it will be a tuple of all of the rest of the arguments. Inside of the method, you reference that tuple without the star. It is just a tuple.
