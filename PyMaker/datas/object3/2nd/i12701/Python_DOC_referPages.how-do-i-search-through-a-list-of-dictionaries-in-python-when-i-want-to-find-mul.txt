For example, I have a list of dictionaries like this one:and I want to search for all dictionaries which have same values for keys  and . For example  , . The output should be:My code looks something like this:and I have written separate functions for all keys like this one: My real dictionaries have 10 keys and I don't know how to connect those separate search functions so that the output only displays dictionaries that have all same values, not all dictionaries that have any of the values entered
prints:or, a more generic solution: is a dictionary that holds the key-value combos  you are trying to match. is your list takes as arguments the dictionary and the list. is a list comprehension that collects every dictionary in your  that matches  of your key-value combos.
There may be more Pythonic ways of doing this, but simply iterating through the list for matches to key:value pairs work, using 'and' to specify that both job and hobby conditions must be met.If an item is a match, append it to a new list, and Bob's yer uncle.
