I'm writing a code that opens 3 Selenium Webdrivers. The browser loading takes a lot of time, and I want to load it parallel.I though to use threading, but how can I return the b1,b2,b3 from thread?I mean, if I have this function:Threading with it will look like:but the returned value, the browser instance, does not set into b1.How should I do this?
