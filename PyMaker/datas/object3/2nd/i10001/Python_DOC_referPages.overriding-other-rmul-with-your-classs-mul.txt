In Python, is it possible for your class's  method to override another class's  method, without making changes to the other class?This question arises since I'm writing a class for a certain type of linear operator, and I want it to be able to multiply numpy arrays using the multiplication syntax. Here is a minimal example illustrating the issue:Left multiplication works fine:But right multiplication defaults to 's version, which splits the array up and performs multiplication element-by-element (this not what is desired):In this situation, how can I make it call my own class's  on the original (unsplit) array?Answers addressing the specific case of numpy arrays are welcome but I am also interested in the general idea of overriding methods of another third party class that cannot be modified.
The easiest way to make  respect your  method is to set an :This works like expected.The problem is that  doesn't respect Pythons "Numeric" Data model. If a numpy array is the first argument and  isn't possible then it tries something like:However if the second argument has an  and it's higher than the one of the first argument only then it really uses:However since Python 3.5 (PEP-465) there is the  () operator that can utilize matrix multiplication:
