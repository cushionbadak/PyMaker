Natural Text
So I am trying to make changes to a list that is stored in a txt file. Inside the txt file there are 3 names and those 3 peoples academic majors.Iv written a program that should allow me to make changes (I think, I'm very new to all of this) but I cant get it to run for example when I input 2 to add a name and major it gives me or when I input 3 to remove a name it gives me when I input 4 I get as you can see the errors are more less the same. I cant seem to figure out what I'm doing wrong. Any ideas or examples would be appreciated. 
I fixed most of your errors and added some suggestions and explanations as comments in the code.I didn't comment on the coding style, since you are clearly a beginner. However I would suggest you have a look at some of the following concepts, ,  - the way they differ and can be used in combination to control the flow of your code (docs).s in python - you appear to have misunderstood parts of the how they actually work, hopefully the docs can clear this up.Reading and writing from and to files in the docs.Note: As I pointed out in the comment in the code, lists don't have a  function. I chose not do disclose how you could achieve the behaviour of such a -function, since this is something you should be able to figure out yourself - you have already used all functions that would allow you to do something like that.
