I have extracted an MS project file as CSV. Its quite large (40 000 lines) and I'm trying to create a Python script that can print out all the tasks that precede a task/milestone/dependency.The issue is with tasks that have multiple predecessors. I've stored these delimited by '~'.The best I can do is the following outputI can get the very left hand path, but I can't seem to come back and loop the function through the remainder of the split lists
Seems like you need a Breadth First Search. The idea is:Put the needed event id in queueWhile queue is not empty get()  id from itput all the predecessors of  in queueThus, you will visit all the predecessors of the chosen event first and all their predecessors after that and so on.
