I googling, watch tuts on youtube, but I dont find easy a understandable solution.Can you help? Best with example:How open file  How find content in specific tagSave content to another fileThank you for help. 
If you want use html.parser, take an example, you want create a parse who get all main title (h1):
You can use module  instead of  to work with xml or html. It is easier.I use module  but there are others (doc: xml)You can read from file () but in example I use string.You have to learn how to use  (ie. ) to find elements.
