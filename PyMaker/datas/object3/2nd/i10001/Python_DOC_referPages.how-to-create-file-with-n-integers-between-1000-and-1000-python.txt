My program should verify that n is a positive integer. If it isn't it should return string "Enter a positive integer."  If n is positive, it should create a file with the name given which contains n integers between -1000 and 1000 (random). I think this is how you open the file but I'm clueless and have no idea what to do next. 
Use  to extract n values from a . Wrap that in a list comprehension to convert integers to strings, adding newlines, and pass that to the  method.
Ok... The first thing would be playing with  (in Python3) or  (in Python2) to ask the user for a number. I suggest you give it a try to this, typing a few negative numbers and a then a possitive number. You can even try to type something that can't be converted to  to see the exceptions happening:(that snippet is for Python3, in Python2, you should substitute  by )Once you get your positive number in the  variable, you can use it to iterate, creating (and writing) a new entry in your file:If you don't want to use the special keyword  (which you should, and it's very worth it that you investigate what it does) you could always do:
