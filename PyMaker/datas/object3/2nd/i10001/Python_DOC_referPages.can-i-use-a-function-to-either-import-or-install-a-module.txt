This question already has an answer here:import module from string variable                    3 answers                I am running Windows 7, Python 2.7, Anaconda 4.0.0:Here is what I want to do. I want to take this code and put it in a function.This is what I have come up with but I am not able to get it to work.The error I get is "ImportError: No module named mypack".
The  statement takes the module name literally and not just as a reference to some other object. So  does not translate to , but import module mypackInstead, you should use the builtin  which takes a name/string:
