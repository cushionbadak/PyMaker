this question arises when i read the book "Python cookbook" by  David Beazley, Brian K. Jones, in page 61, 62. I summarize:Now, if just want to replace {name}, but don't want to replace {n}, define an alternative dictionary class with a  methodthenyou get the desired result:my question:why need  method to make this code work?
