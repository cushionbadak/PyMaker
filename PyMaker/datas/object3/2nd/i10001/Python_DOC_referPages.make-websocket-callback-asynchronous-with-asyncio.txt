I am trying to implement a basic websocket client using asyncio and websockets with Python 3.5.2.Basically, I want  to be a blocking call, but wait for the websocket message on a different thread.After reading some docs (I have very little exp with Python), I concluded that  passing a coroutine () was the way to go.Now, I get to run  on a different thread, but from within the coroutine I can't seem to use  or any other mechanism to make the calls synchronous. If I do it, the execution waits forever (it hangs) even for a simple .I'd like to know what I'm doing wrong.
Is there a specific reason you need to work with explicit futures?With  you can use a combination of  and  to achieve most purposes. Tasks are essentially wrapped coroutines that go about cranking themselves over in the background, independently of other async code, so you don't have to explicitly manage their flow or juggle them with other bits of code.I am not entirely sure of your end goal, but perhaps the approach elaborated below gives you something to work with:
