I want to plot real time original audio signal and fft signal.my code is,I receive packets(which are 16 bit pcm data) from android app. and minbuffersize is 3584 bytes. (buffer_size = 3584) To get time vector, I should divide size of signal by frame rate.So in bold line, i think size of signal is len(signal)(# of received packet) * buffer size/2(1792 bytes -> size of packet received). is it wrong?after check, calculated time is exact! I used stopwatch and compared the result of [(len(signal)*(buffer_size/2))/sample_rate]. both are the same.but above code results error in plotting. ax[0].plot(Time, signal)error is " x and y must have same first dimension"what should i do?,,
In the line where you call np.linespace(),  try replacing num=(buffer_size/2), by num=len(signal)The line becomes
