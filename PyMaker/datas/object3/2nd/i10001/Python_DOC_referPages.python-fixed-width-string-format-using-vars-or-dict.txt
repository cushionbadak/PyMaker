I'm working on a Python project and I'm hoping to use a few shortcuts to help format class data in a string. More specifically, I would like to be able to use something similar to  and specify the string length of each attribute that is displayed. For example:I know it's a long shot, but a couple of these classes have 30 or 40 attribs and it would make life so much easier if this is doable.Thanks.
You can nest  fields inside  fields, but only one level of nesting is permitted. Fortunately, only one level of nesting is actually needed. :)From Format String Syntax:A format_spec field can also include nested replacement fields within  it. These nested replacement fields may contain a field name,  conversion flag and format specification, but deeper nesting is not  allowed. The replacement fields within the format_spec are substituted  before the format_spec string is interpreted. This allows the  formatting of a value to be dynamically specified.output
Something like this might work:Se more details about formatting in https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#formatstrings. In case you want longer list of attributes and more dynamic formatting you can also construct format string dynamically, e.g. (untested):
