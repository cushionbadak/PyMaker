Sorry for asking very basic question. First time I am using REST API. I tried to get answer to this question on google. But I am unable to get any such.I need to login into a website using password based authentication using REST API and Python. I dont want to use selenium or some other tools for this purpose due to company policy.Any clue/idea on proceding further please?
Try to use Google chrome REST client extension or postman.
If you need to issue requests and authenticate yourself using HTTP Basic Authentication, this example from the docs should help:Use of Basic HTTP Authentication:For more complex usage scenarios I suggest using the httplib2. A great introduction to that is here.
