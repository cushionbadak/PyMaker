I create a function that compare with x and y variable. Inside the function has a lots of nested elif to compare the x and y then return integer. The problem is right now, when it runs at the certain elif statement, it didn't execute the statement although the statement is correct.
You're performing a chained equality comparison which is not doing what you think it does. The bitwise  is performed first as it has a higher priority than . Replace:With:See: Operator precedence
In Python, "&" and "and" do two different things.  "and" is what you should be using, "&" is a binary operator.ifa = 0011 1100andb = 0000 1101thena&b = 0000 1100See http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_basic_operators.htm
You should use and instead of &, as & is a bitwise and.Chaining multiple conditions in Python is generally done with an if-elif-else statement like below:In your code, if it wasn't for the return statement in each if, and the fact that you are checking the same two variables, it would be possible for two if statements to evaluate to true.Also, take a look at this: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html
