Been recently reading on casefold and string comparisons when ignoring case. I've read that the MSDN standard is to use InvariantCulture and definitely avoid toLowercase. However, casefold from what I have read is like a more aggressive toLowercase. My question is should I use casefold in Python or is there a more pythonic standard to use instead? Also, does casefold pass the Turkey Test?
1) In Python 3,  should be used to implement caseless string matching.Since Python 3.0, strings are stored as Unicode. The Unicode Standard Chapter 3.13 defines the default caseless matching as follows: A string X is a caseless match for a string Y if and only if:  toCasefold(X) = toCasefold(Y)Python's  implements the Unicode's . So it should be used to implement caseless string matching. Although, casefolding alone is not enough to cover some corner cases and to pass the Turkey Test (see Point 3).2) As of Python 3.6, casefold() cannot pass the Turkey Test.For two characters, uppercase I and dotted uppercase I, the Unicode Standard defines two different casefolding mappings.The default (for non-Turkic languages):I → i  (U+0049 → U+0069)İ → i̇  (U+0130 → U+0069 U+0307)The alternative (for Turkic languages):I → ı  (U+0049 → U+0131)İ → i  (U+0130 → U+0069)Pythons  can apply only the default mapping and fails the Turkey Test. For example, the Turkish words "LİMANI" and "limanı" are caseless equivalents, but  returns . There is no option to enable the alternative mapping.3) How to do caseless string matching in Python 3. The Unicode Standard Chapter 3.13 describes several caseless matching algorithms. The canonical casless matching would probably suit most use cases. This algorithm already takes into account all corner cases. We only need to add an option to switch between non-Turkic and Turkic casefolding. is a wrapper for Python's . If its parameter  is set to , then it applies the Turkic mapping, and if it is set to  the default mapping is used. does the canonical casless matching for  and . If the strings are Turkic words,  parameter must be set to .Examples:TrueFalseFalseTrue
