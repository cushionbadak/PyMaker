The following code is a bit from a bigger piece. lines is a 2D list and keyss is a 1D list. All element in lines is the same length as keyss.I was wondering if there was a way of writing this using dictionary comprehension? This is more of a curious question as the shown code works just fine for what I'm doing. I've been trying and couldn't find a way too. If you can could go over the syntax of how it would look a bit as well, Thanks!EDIT#1:Reading through the responses, I realized it wasn't really working. I'm trying to do a list comprehension where every element is a dictionary comprehension. I'm not entirely sure if that is possible or not. I want to make a list of dictionaries where I take every element in keyss and match index for index in a element in lines which is a list, if that makes sense.EDIT #2:I found  to work.
A dictionary comprehension creates a dictionary. You want a list comprehension:You can find the documentation on the syntax here.
Your current code doesn't create a dictionary, but if that was your intent, this can be accomplished byor the dictionary comprehension
As mentioned by eugene, it will be list comprehension and not dict comprehension. You may further simplify the code by using  as you need the from  and  list corresponding to same index. Hence, your simplified list comprehension expression should be as:
