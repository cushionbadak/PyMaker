Natural Text
How can i join these two text documents?document 1:document 2:result:explanation:document 1 and document 2 both have the same structure and they have the same number of lines. Each line starts with a number (the same number in both documents), and then we have several items in each line which are made up of a number+colon+a decimal number: example 10:0.471669these item combinations are unique, what I want to do is to merge them together: take the items from the second document for each line and put it in the corresponding line of the first document.note:the initial number at the beginning and the items from one another are separated by a single space.updatehere is my try:i get a traceback of KeyError, on the lines of the second document when the line doens't have anything to be added to the first document. It is the case in the second line of the second document in the above example.  How can I escape this exception? escape the lines which have only the key and nothing else to add?
An easier way might be to use a  of lists:Regarding the printing of the result you could add:to the top of your file, and then the Python 3  function will be available in Python 2, i.e. you can use the Python 3 print above.You asked in a comment how to print to a file (Python 3, or Python 2 after importing ):
The problem is with newline characters.At the end of each line in the file there is a newline character which will be included in the last entry of each line. The exception occurs because dat1 will have a key  and dat2 will have a key .If you have  before parsing then the code should work as expected. 
You can use  operation to get the first item of an array, like this:
In your code  in 2nd file key for empty row was '1000002\n' not 1000002, that could be the reason, this works.
You can use:doc1doc2doc1+doc2
