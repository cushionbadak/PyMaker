I have the following code with a timeout set to 60 secI don't understand why I am getting the error message of I have looked into this previous post with the same error, but the other user uses  while I am using  so I am confused why this is happening.
 class does not have a  argument in its signature:https://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.PopenYou can pass the  argument when you actually communicate though:https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen.communicate
Same reason. There is no timeout argument.List of all valid arguments for a : https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen
the other user uses  while I am using  so I am confused why this is happening. blocks until the command ends or the timeout happens.  does NOT wait for the command to finish; it returns immediately and therefore it does not accept  parameter. You could pass  to  or  methods which do wait until the process finishes or the timeout happens.
