I wrote a program that would post events using  and . This program works when I run it locally. I can post 10k events no problem. However, I SCPed the whole codebase to a remote machine and within that machine I can't post more than 15 events without getting this error:How can I debug this or find out the source of this problem?Here is the class that I created and I use the method  to run:
You cannot re-use a loop once it's closed. From AbstractEventLoop.close documentation:This is idempotent and irreversible. No other methods should be called after this one.Either remove the  call or create a new loop for each post.My advice would be to avoid those problems by running everything inside the loop and awaiting  when needed.
