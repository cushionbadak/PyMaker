Hi I am trying to match a all character between a word and next occurrence of space character. As shown in below example line.LINE ENTRY::"abcdefg city=abcd id=1234 type=abcd-efg-jkl-mno country=india""abcdefg city=abcd id=1234 type=abcd-efg country=india""abcdefg city=abcd id=1234 type=abcd-efg-jkl country=usa"If you see there are 3 lines, Line1 has type=abcd-efg-jkl-mno and country=india,Whereas Line3 has type=abcd-efg-jkl and country=usa.Now if i want to print the entire line where city=usa and country=usa, how can this be achieved using python regular expressions. I am trying using match as below.where country_name is the variable to which i am passing the input.So as soon it encounters ".*" it gives me a repeat error. Otherwise it works fine. That is i need to be able to match something like "abcd-efg-jkl-mno" after "type=". But this keeps varying. That is sometimes "type=abcd-efg-jkl"Sometimes it will be "type"abcd-efg" or just "type=abcd"But after "type=+.*" It doesn't check any further. I need to be able to match any character from "type=country=".Please advise
The  method can break apart a string on word starts:Then iterate through the list, find the variable name, mod value, etcUPDATE: if re.match
Your regular expression is a bit wrong.  is followed by a  and a . So it throws .ChangeTo
