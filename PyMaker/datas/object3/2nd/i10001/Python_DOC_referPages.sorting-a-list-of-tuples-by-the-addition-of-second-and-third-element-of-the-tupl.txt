i have a list of tuples which is :and I'm struggling about how to sort them so they can be placed like this: It should be the addition of the second and third element of the tuple , and when they are the same ex.  and  they should be sorted alphabetically. It's written in python 3.5 and I can't call any library
You can set a tuple as the key to sort your list:In this way, it will firstly sort by the sum of the last two elements of the tuple and then by the first element of the tuple.And if you like the result in descending order, as @Moses commented, you can specify the the  parameter to be :Update:To handle descending, ascending order differently, since the  here is numeric, you can negate the  as well. In this way, it will be sorted in descending order for the  but alphabetically for the first letter.
Where  is your list. If you need reversed:
Create a function that will return the sum of the items and use that function a the sort key.  I like to use operator.itemgetter() when extracting items from iterables. without operator.itemgetter
