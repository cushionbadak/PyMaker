So i have a program called lonesum(a,b,c) that needs to add the 3 numbers entered together only if they are input once. so lonesum(1,2,3) would return 6 but lonesum(1,1,3) would return 3. I have that part. What i need help with is getting a statement to work that will return an error if the user enters anything that isn't an integer i.e. lonesum(.5,2,3) will return error. so far i have this while statement which i thought would work but doesn't,: (That is the rest of my code, that is the part that works)My problem is the != doesn't work and I'm not sure what to do. Any suggestions?
Try something like this:What you want to check is if each value in (a, b, c) is of integer type. So you must check each value, not the tuple itself.The builtin function  iterates over something iterable and returns true if all of the values are true. I've created a generator expression that iterates over the tuple (a, b, c), comparing the type of each value to .  iterates over that generator expression. So if all of the values in (a, b, c) have type , it returns .
If you want the sum of all numbers that appear exactly once, there are more succinct ways to do it. Count them all, sum the ones that appear once:This implicitly raises an error if a non-numeric value is passed as an argument when it tries to sum them; if you want to  an error instead of propagating the exception, make it:
