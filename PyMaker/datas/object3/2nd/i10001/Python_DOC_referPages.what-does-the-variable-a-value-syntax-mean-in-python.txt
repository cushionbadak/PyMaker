This question already has an answer here:What does //= in python do? [duplicate]                    3 answers                I came across with the code syntax  where d is a variable. This is not a part of any loop, I don't quite get the expression. Can anybody enlighten me  please?   
 is a floor division operator. The  beside it means to operate on the variable "in-place". It's similar to the  and  operators, if you've seen those before, except for this is with division.Suppose I have a variable called . I set it's value to , like this.Calling  will divide  by 2, and then assign that result to d. Since,  is 32 (32.5, but with the decimal part taken off),  becomes 32:It's the same as calling .
It divides  by 2, rounding down. Python can be run interactively, Try it.
Divides the variable with floor division by two and assigns the new amount to the variable.
