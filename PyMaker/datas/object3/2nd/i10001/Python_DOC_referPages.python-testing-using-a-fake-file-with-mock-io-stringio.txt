I'm trying to test some code that operates on a file, and I can't seem to get my head around how to replace using a real file with  and My code is pretty much the following:I have a class that can take either a list or a file, if it's a file it opens it and extracts the contents into a list, and then does what it needs to do to the resulting list. I have a working test as follows:I want to replace the call to the filesystem. I have tried replacing the file with  but I get a  from  as it's expecting either a string, bytes or int. I also tried mocking the  method like so:but I still get the same  as the  type is causing the exception before  gets a chance to return something.How can I get  to return True, when I pass it a fake file? Or is this a suggestion I should change my code?
Just mock out both  and the  call, and pass in a fake filename (you are not expected to pass in an open file, after all).The mock library includes a utility for the latter: :This causes the  test to be false (because  is a string instead), followed by the  returning , and the  call to use your mocked data from the  result.You can use the  variable to assert that  was called with the right data ( for example).
