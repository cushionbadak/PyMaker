I recently made a class. Let's say that the class is declared as below.The problem is, I want to create constant instances of the class:Unfortunately, Python won't allow me to do so, with error:Any solution for this problem?One alternative would be creating a 'static' method for the class that will return a same object each time it's called (e.g., ). But I think I would still prefer to access it using .Thanks.
You can assign to class variables right after the class has been defined.
