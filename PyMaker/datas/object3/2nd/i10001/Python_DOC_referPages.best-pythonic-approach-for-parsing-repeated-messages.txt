Natural Text
I have a text file that I am trying to parse and reformat into a .csv. The text file was created as a repeated status message every 2Hz, outputting various values. Every message has a '-----------' header, '/n' newline characters, and a '' footer.I think the best way to do this would be to only read in one 'message' at a time and be able to update my output file as I go; I'm new to Python (using Python 3.5) and I feel like everything I'm coming up with is more C++ styled.  The input data looks like this:I want to pull out things like the date/time of each message, the temperatures, the voltages, etc.  Here's my super un-Pythonic approach (note that the indentation got messed up during copy and paste...it is correct in the real code):
Use  module to parse the input. Use  module to write the output. Here is and example from the reference manual:
