the function takes a set and return a listthe set is always s = {1, 2, 4, 8, 16}for example:But when my function takesit should printBut instead, it prints:can someone tell me how to fix it? thanksI posted the error I got below to help to understand:
The  function sorts the argument and returns a list.  Modifying the input set will not affect the sorted list.If you want the iterator to reflect changes to the original set, the iterator will need to check the state of the set at each iteration and respond appropriately.
When you use , you create a sorted list from the set. That list has no connection to the original set it was created from, and will not reflect any changes to that set. You will have to keep track of changes yourself, while iterating the elements in sorted order.Keeping track of removed elements is simple: Just check whether the current element is still in the original set. Keeping track of new elements is a bit more complex. You could use the  module and create a heap from the set, instead of a sorted list, then you can add new elements to that heap while iterating it. To find new elements, create a copy of the original set and compare the two in each iteration. Also, according to your test cases, you will have to check whether the current element is smaller than the previous, and skip it in this case.This works for all your test cases (re-initialization of  and  not shown):
