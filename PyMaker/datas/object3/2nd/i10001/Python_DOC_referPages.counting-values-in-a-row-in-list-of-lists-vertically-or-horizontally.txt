I'm writing a function that counts the number of occurrences of a specific value of a list of lists in a row whether horizontal or vertical. Then it just needs to return the value of how many times it occurred. Here's an exampleFor this list of lists, the function should return 3 for e as it appears 3 times in a row, 2 for A, and 3 for X. Thank you for your timeMy code so far:
You can try the following if you don't mind changing things a little bit:This uses a combination of recursion and one of python's powerful  methods (). The idea is to count the number of symbols until you hit a list that does not contain that symbol. Also, it tries to make sure that it only counts the occurrences of the symbol if said symbol is in the list of lists.Using it:As you can see, if the symbol does not exist it returns .Edit:If you don't wish to import the  function from , you can use the approximate definition provided in the documentation. But just keep in mind that it is not as optimized as the  method:Also,  should be available to you directly if you are using . However, you can define a function to reduce a list of lists into one list as follows:Instead of using , just replace it with  after it's been defined.I hope this helps.
This is actually quite a messy problem to solve with basic principles, and will be especially hard if you've just started learning programming. Here's a concise but more advanced solution:Then  is:
