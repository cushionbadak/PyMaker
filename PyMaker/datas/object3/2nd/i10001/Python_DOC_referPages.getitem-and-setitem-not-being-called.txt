I have the following class definition:The get and set methods don't seem to be being called. I'm initialising with:If I try to then execute , I get the error:If I try to execute , I get:Why are my custom methods not being called, and how do I fix it?
You are misunderstanding what  does or accidentally used it where you should have used . You are returning the  object itself by returning : is called as a static method on the class and is expected to produce a new instance in the method.Because you returned the type object (the class),  and  are looked up on  (the default metaclass) (see Special method lookup), which fails.You probably wanted to use  there instead;  is called on an already-created instance: doesn't need to return anything (and what it returns is ignored anyway), so you can drop the  line altogether.If you feel you must use  (perhaps because you are subclassing an immutable type), then at the very least create an instance with :but using  instead is just simpler.
