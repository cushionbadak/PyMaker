I am working on an assignment for school. These are my first attempts with Python. We are supposed to copy Juliet and Romeo into a new file but only with act and scene indications, keeping only Juliet and Romeos partitions. Here are my two issues: for some reason, sometimes it copies the title of the scene twice. Second issue, whenever J or R speaks, the partition must be shrunk to one line. Cannot seem to find my way into the problem.Any help will be greatly appreciated.my clean version, duplicity of indication 
you can combine conditions with . That should eliminate the duplicates. Then, you may want to accumulate utterances of Romeo and Julia until neither of them says anything anymore, and then write the collected utterances to the file:
My assumption is that scene title is copied twice because there is either Juliet or Romeo in it. For the second issue, You should use temporary string and append multiple lines the character has to it. When You reach empty line, You should write line to the file and reset temporary string to empty string.
Following up on @Fejsâ€™s comment, to prevent the duplicates, use else/elif:We are not sue of the format of your input file or what you mean by partition on one line, so additional information there will help.
