First of all, I'm a Python beginner and learning to use Odoo now. I have been trying roundup the result using Python Code in Salary Rule.Payroll\Configuration\Salary RulesI found out there is a math function of math.ceil() to roundup the result. So I code the code below:But I couldn't get it to work. Did I import the math library correctly?
Unfortunately you can't import python modules there, an alternative is to use the inbuilt  function in pythonHere i just specified to round the result to 2 digits but it can be anything you want
