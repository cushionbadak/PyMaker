I am struggling with a problem that didn't seem to be a big deal in the beginning. I am creating aa class and a sub Subclass and whenever I want to change a value in subclass it should automatically update all the other methods in the class and subclass whenever I do that. Let me give you an example. The value that's supposed to be changed is  in the  method. As you can see I need  to be changed as well within  and  because the  method in  calls does methods. How do I do that? When I call the  method I get the shift value, if I then call the  method and call  again it shows me the updated  value. So I tried to update  and  with the get-Method instead of shift but that doesn't change anything. What am I missing here? Thanks!
In  just call those other two methods.You could define  and  without an argument, other than , and just use  in those methods - you would still have to call them but you wouldn't have to pass them anything, and you couldn't mess it up by passing those methods an erroneous value from your program. You could make access to  a property/attribute using the  decorator - you won't have to call it and you rid yourself of getter's and setter's - you would need to rename  to something like  or  everywhere else in  the program.like:Then you access it with .
