I'm trying to compare pairs of students in a database table.My database table is as follows:I compare a pair of students at a time and if they have similar edu code I input them to a list with their id's as 1 if not 0.My code is as follows:This prints the output according to the way I wanted as follows:But I don't know whether this is the most efficient way of comparing database records in python. Any suggestions for improvements are welcome.
One way would be to use  and to create a dictionary where it has a list of student numbers for each “edu” number. So that the result is similar to this:The basic idea is that you iterate over each entry in the table and add the student's number to the “edu” number in the resulting dict:The reason for  is that it automatically creates a new dictionary entry (in this case of an empty list) when it is requested but doesn't exist. So you don't need to check  and then add an empty list, because  does that for you.To convert this result in a list like yours, you can go through each student again and get their “edu” number and then use the numbers in the  to get a list of that:This assumes that  only contains valid entries. There is no need to additionally count them in a separate SQL query if you already have all entries.
