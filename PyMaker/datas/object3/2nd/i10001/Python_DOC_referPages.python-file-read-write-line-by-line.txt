I am studying python file I/O. I made a simple program(main.py). My goal is read line by line and write line by line.below are my  filewhen I run python programpython main.pyThen, result is ...That is not the same as I expected.So I modified the main.pyHowever my program diged into infinite loop.picture of infinite loopTo solve this problem what should I do?The result I expected is the following.
The print function will automatically add a new line character. So will print content of variable msg followed by a new lineIf you do not want python to print the trailing new line, you have to add a comma to the end. This will print msg without the trailing newline. And if msg already has a new line which is the case when reading new lines from a file, you will see a single new line in place of double new lines.If you are using python 3 where print is called as a function, you can specify the end argument. See https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print
First of all, use a  statement to open the file so that you don't need to close it explicitly. Second, don't use a  loop for this; you can iterate over a file directly. Third, use the  method to remove any trailing whitespace from line you read (or  to remove only trailing newlines):
In addition to the answers above; You can also use .splitlines()
