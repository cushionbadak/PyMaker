Natural Text
I have made a Secret language that I would to be able to put full words into the input and get the output as the list says the letters should be. Let's say for example I input "AB" I would like the output to be "QW".
You're inputting two letters, but your test conditions only contain one character each. You should iterate on the input string using a  and test each character in the string one at a time:You can also improve your code by using a mapping instead of the  as this will help you accommodate new translations more easily:Notice how the dictionary's  method was used to return the default  when the mapping does not contain the character.
You are reinventing the wheel, use . To use , you need to first create a dictionary that can be used to map the original character to the new character. This transition table can be made using . Now that we have the table ready, we just need to pass it to . Now we get the desired result.
