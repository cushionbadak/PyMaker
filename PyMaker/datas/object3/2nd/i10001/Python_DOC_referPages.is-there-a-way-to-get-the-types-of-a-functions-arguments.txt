Let's say we have a function  that is part of the public API of a python module.Is there any way to query the types of  and  that the function expects?I know that I can get the number of arguments and their default values via the  module, but is there any type information available?
Python is a dynamically typed language, so no; a function should document their expectations instead.Python 3.5 and newer support optional type hinting; if the library uses type hints, then you can query this information with the  function to access that information programatically.Generally, Python functions should accept objects that implement expected functionality, not specific types. If your function iterates over a sequence to extract strings, then it should be documented as accepting (in type hinting terms) a  object, not a list or tuple or other specific type.
