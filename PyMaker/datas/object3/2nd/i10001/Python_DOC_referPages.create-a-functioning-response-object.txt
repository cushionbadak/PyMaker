For testing purposes I'm trying to create a Response() object in python but it proves harder then it sounds.i tried this:but when I attempted  i got an error because the function tries to get  and  is null.So I set  but then I get an encoding error, so I have to change , but then it fails to decode the content....this goes on and on. Is there a simple way to create a Response object that's functional and has an arbitrary status_code and content?
That because the  attribute  on the  objects (on python3) has to be bytes and not unicodes.Here is how to do it:
Create a  object, rather than trying to build a real one:Providing a  ensures that the mock will complain if you try to access methods and attributes a real  doesn't have.
Just use the  library to do it for you:This has the advantage that it intercepts a real request, rather than having to inject a response somewhere.
