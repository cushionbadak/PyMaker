I'm trying to do an Insert and Update operation on my seat, without the insertion of duplicate data.My collection has the id attribute that to which I made an operating  to pass the id attribute as unique. It works because every time I try to enter new data through my code in Python, appears the message:Ok, mongoDB is not letting enter data that is already stored in the bank. But I need my code to continue running ignoring the new data already ExSite in the bank and continue to enter new ones. The working order this:Run the script - Insert command in the Bank - Error: Dup Keyand what I look for is:Run the script - Insert command in the Bank - Error: Dup Key (Ignore this key) - Continues running the script looking for new data and insertingI, tried to use the Update approach with upsert, using the command:Here we have:Status: Contains my dataId: Field in status, contains the ID of the text.The problem is: He's entering duplicate data with the same id, only now putting all under _id: ObjectId of mongoDB.How can i use an approach that I can enter new data and not re-enter data that already exist in the bank?
