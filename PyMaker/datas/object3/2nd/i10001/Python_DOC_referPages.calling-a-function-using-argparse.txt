I am trying to call the function addPXT through argparse when type -a. Its not doing that. Read another issue, there addPXT was not in colons, tried that it says addPXT is not callable.
If you are a beginner with  and , I'd recommend sticking with the default  action, which stores strings, and the boolean actions ('store_true/false').  Make sure you understand those first.That said, here is a way of using  to call different functions:define 2 functions:I define both the default and the const - and specify the functions, not their names.  Understanding the difference is important.Try the default case:Try the  commandline case:If you have more arguments (dest), you could pass  to your function, if it is defined to accept them, .The simpler boolean argument approach:or if you accept strings, maybe even choicesThe primary purpose of  is to deduce what the user wants, and issue help and error messages.  Acting on that information is largely the responsibility of the rest your code. 
You're missing a option in the add_argument to be able to reference the option.You will then need to test if the  option was passed as argument. If so, then call the function.
 will call the  object during parsing but you need to supply something that looks like the  class because the parser will use that object later. The Action doc saysYou may also specify an arbitrary action by passing an Action subclass  or other object that implements the same interface. The recommended  way to do this is to extend Action, overriding the call method and  optionally the init method.So, create an  subclass and have it call your function
