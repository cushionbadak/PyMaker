I am reading through argparse docs: https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/argparse.htmlI read through the "parents" doc for ArgumentParser and it mentioned that this is used when several parsers share common args. I am wondering, when would I need to have "several parsers" in the first place? 
The documentation is already fairly straightforward:Rather than repeating the definitions of these arguments, a single parser with all the shared arguments and passed to parents= argument to ArgumentParser can be usedOne use-case that comes to mind is when you have a lot of scripts that do different things to a database that requires a username and password to be accessed. One of the scripts alters a table, another one changes a few permissions... but all those scripts are going to need the username and password to access the database, right? You could have a "base" argument parser that expects (or parses) the username and password, and then have more specialized parsers with more arguments. For instance:Running this will result in:So you can reuse the basic\parser every time you need a username and a password.
