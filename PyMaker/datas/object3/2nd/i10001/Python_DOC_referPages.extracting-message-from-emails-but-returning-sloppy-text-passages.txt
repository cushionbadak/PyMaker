Natural Text
So I've created a method to strip an email pages source code of html, style/script tags, and new line tags:Then, I have it return everything from the instance of 'From:' in the email, all the way to the end of the email. However, after it goes through this process, I get in return a very spaced out and overall sloppy passage of text such as:My goal is to print out a clean passage of text. Is there anyway that I could do this? I've been wracking my brain with this for several hours now, and haven't come up with anything rational at all. Just looking for a push in the right direction, Thanks.
Use the module  to extract message bodies instead of hacking them apart by hand. Use the module  to format message text into nice paragraphs.  This will probably work:But take a look at the textwrap documentation for keyword options you can specify.
Regular Expressions - Strip Spaces but preserve new lines (or CRLF)
