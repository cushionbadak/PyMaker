In python, I found I can have no new lines after printing by doing: , how does this syntax where you say  work, and how and why would you want to have it in your own function declaration.Sorry if this is a duplicate, but I don't know what this syntax is called.
This syntax is called keyword arguments (or named arguments). This is explained in the official Python tutorial here: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#keyword-arguments And the print documentation is here.https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#printIf you still have questions after reading these documents, feel free to ask.
It tells the  function to end the line with an empty string, rather than a newline.https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html
