I have a list of functions:  listFunc=[g1, g2, g3].  This list is generated with the code below:  Now, I have a list of arguments ListArg = [4, 5, 6];How could I get a result list of  using  only?      I thought about using the following code:But it only gives a result of . Thanks,
This is a perfect use-case for a list comprehension with two for-clauses:This is eminently readable and eminently functional - list comprehensions were borrowed from Haskell.If you feel some deep need to use map, then you will have to approach it like this:Which is eminently unreadable and likely slower. List comprehensions win here.
If you want to use , you could do:
You can't quite do this with just , but you can nest one call in another, and use  to flatten the result.
itertools.product helpsThe only alternative to the list comprehension I could come up with is:
