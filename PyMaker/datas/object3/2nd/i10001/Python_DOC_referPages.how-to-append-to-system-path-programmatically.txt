In python how can I programmatically append to my system path? I'm aware of  and just searched the docs, I'm a little confused though. It tells me that  only appends to the  and not the actual system path. Is there a way I can programmatically append to the system path temporarily?
Just update the environment  variable: Alternately, its common for programs to keep a separate environment they use when calling other tools.
