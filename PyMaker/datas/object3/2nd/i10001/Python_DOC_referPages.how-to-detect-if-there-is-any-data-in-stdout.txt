I'm using python's  to run a python script (let's call it ), and that script is printing information to  which is redirected using . Problem is that  stops printing information but it keeps running in the background. What i want is to detect that state (when nothing is written to ). Is there any way to do so? I can simulate this behaviour with following:script2.pyNext 500 iterations nothing will happen and that's what i need to detect in order to rerun the script.
Popen.stdoutIf the stdout argument was PIPE, this attribute is a file object that provides output from the child process. Otherwise, it is None.python documentationSo you probably need to decide an amount of time to wait before you consider your processes initial output to be done. So proc.stdout.readline() then sleep(1) then rinse and repeat.
