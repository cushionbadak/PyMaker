I'm trying to use SWIG with embedded Python 3.5.2. The following is built as a Windows console app. It fails initializing the Python side SWIG module "arpy.py" when it tries to import the C++ side SWIG module "_arpy". My (probably incorrect) understanding it that the C++ side "_arpy" module should already be loaded by the SWIG module init function called from main() but this doesn't seem to be the case.arpy.i:arpy.h: generates:arpy_wrap.cxxarpy.pymain.cpp:Output:Python is running the arpy.py init code which fails using importlib.import_module on "_arpy". Calling PyInit__arpy() in main() I think should be "importing" the SWIG generated _arpy module via the CPython/C API but apparently this all doesn't work how I'm guessing.
From the examples here: (https://docs.python.org/3/extending/embedding.html)I see that to import the SWIG C++ module as a builtin you need:PyImport_AppendInittab("_arpy", &PyInit__arpy);before calling Py_Initialize()Things work as expected now.
