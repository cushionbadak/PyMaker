I am profiling a python script  using cProfile with the following command:The output I get is (only copy-pasted the top lines of the output):How can the  (4.674) be different from the  (13.598) for , since this function (ie. the whole script) is only called once? 
 is the total time spent in the function alone.  is the total time spent in the function plus all functions that this function called.The two values is going to be the same if a function never calls anything else. For example,  doesn't appear to invoke anything else:but  calls other functions, so it's  column includes the time for those calls:The  line covers all code run outside of functions, the global code; just the statements at that level took 4.674 seconds to run, but because those statements called other functions, the total cumulative time of the  code plus all function calls made is 13.598 seconds.From the documentation:tottime  for the total time spent in the given function (and excluding time made in calls to sub-functions)[...]cumtime  is the cumulative time spent in this and all subfunctions (from invocation till exit). This figure is accurate even for recursive functions.
