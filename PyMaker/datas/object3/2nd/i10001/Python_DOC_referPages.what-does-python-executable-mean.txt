I'm writting something about 'sys.prefix', related with PEP405.What does 'Python executable' mean in this specification?This PEP proposes to add a new first step to this search. If a pyvenv.cfg file is found either adjacent to the Python executable or one directory above it (if the executable is a symlink, it is not dereferenced), this file is scanned for lines of the form key = value . ...
The "Python executable" in Python documentation and specifications is either the  binary itself or a symlink to the binary. The exception is , which always returns the executable that was used to invoke the interpreter even though the documentation states "executable binary".
It just means a python script which you can call in some manner. That pyvenv is a virtual environment created by python.
