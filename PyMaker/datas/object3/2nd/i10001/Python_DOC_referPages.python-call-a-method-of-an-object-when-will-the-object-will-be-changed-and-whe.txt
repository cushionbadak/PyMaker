I am new in python, and I just find something strange:As you can see in the code, in the first time, variable "test" is a string, when I call method "replace", the value of "test" doesn't change, the second time is is a list, and the list changed after I called the method reverse().Why was that? Is it because of something different between the methods or something different between the objects or something else?
Strings are immutable. So you aren't actually changing . You are actually getting the  of the  string method. To use this modified string, you have to create a new string, or simply replace the existing string with the new value.The second example, the list is mutable, and you are performing an in place manipulation of the list. If you actually do this:  will actually be , because it doesn't return anything, it actually does it in place, which is why  list will hold the new manipulation you performed.Read this on immutable vs mutable types in Python.Also, refer to the documentation here on the Data Model to further your understanding as well. 
It depends entirely on the implementation of the method. Some methods modify the objects they're called on, some do not.
