So I have a python list (called lst in the snippet below) of urls.I want to create another list of only the /file.zip part of each url. So far I have this:and it returns the /file.zip part as expected. But my question is how can I do this for the entire list?
Assuming , your current code is very close to working optimally.The last line of the code  is where the problems lie.By calling  you are essentially getting the first character of the  string (since the  derives from the strings inside ), and then splitting it based on , which would not work. Then you have an error with the lone  after the .So, to fix this code, here is what you would do.and then, printing  would give['file.zip', 'file1.zip', ...]which is your desired output.To explain,  is getting every item inside the  list, which are strings. Then, inside the loop, the string  is being split according to the  inside it, which generates another array. But you want the final part of that string, hence the final item in the array, which can be accessed using .
You can use a list comprehension:
You can accomplish this with a list comprehension.  now looks like this:
In addition to @Wintro answer:Do you need the leading '/' in your results (/file1.zip) ? Then you have to preprend it again because  will make it disappear.I suggest that you use python builtin  or  or : https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.path.html#os.path.basenameAlso, you can use loop comprehension:
Although it may not be necessary in this case, it is always a good idea to use the proper library for these functions. In this case, that is the  module:
