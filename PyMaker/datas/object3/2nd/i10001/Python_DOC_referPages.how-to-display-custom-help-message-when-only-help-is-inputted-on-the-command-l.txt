You need to perform a check of  and see if it equals "help". In this block, you then print out your help file to the user. If  does not equal "help", continue with your current logic.An alternative is to utilize . It can automatically generate the "help" for you when you pass Using this, if you pass  to your command line, you get a helpful message like so:It will accept 2 file names. If you pass anything other than two values, it will produce an appropriate response.
