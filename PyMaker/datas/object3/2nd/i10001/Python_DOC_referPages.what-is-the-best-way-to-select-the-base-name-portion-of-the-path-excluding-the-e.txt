I would like to select the base name portion of a file path excluding the file extension.For example, if the path is something like the following:/experimental/users/nerd/wavfiles/wavfile0722.wavThen, I would like to select "wavefile0722" portion of the above path.I have been using the following statement in Python for this purpose.But I wonder whether it is a good approach or not, and if not, what would be the best way for this case.Any suggestions are welcomed. Thank you!
