I'm working on a python assignment for a class, and we are required to use the random generator to roll through the assignment(instead of going through the option recursively). It's a classic problem with a simple answer, but the random selection has to find it by chance. I can't figure out why the output is repeating the same pattern as the functions look solid. Is there an issue that causes the same movement of entities?EDIT: It outputs infinitely as posted repeating those blocks, but it should stop when all elements are in the 'west' list.Assignment:With the Farmer, Wolf, Goat, Cabbage, the Farmer must move all entities to the west side of a river. The Wolf, Goat, and Cabbage Cannot stay alone on one side.The Wolf will eat the Goat, and the Goat will eat they Cabbage if they are alone on one side (east or west).These restraints are mirrored by the forbidden[] list, and must be checked each time elements change sides of the river.Code:Output:
When you go east, you always ship an item with the farmer. After the first journey (going west), there is only one item on the west shore. Thus, the only choice to pick to accompany the farmer going east, is whatever you just shipped west. So you'll always end up with the same items on the east shore that were there initially: you simply shipped a random item back and forth between the river sides.One solution would be insert an empty item to ship. It that gets picked randomly, the farmer will just row across on his own. Which is what you want in some cases for the puzzle to be solvable.
