After doing  why is  not defined? What does  mean?If I do , then there is no problem. On using ,  must have been fetched. Then why is there an error?
What follows below is just elaborating on jonrsharpe's great comment that I think answers the question.Python's  indeed looks deceptively like it imports everything from said package, but this is not the case. The docs say:The import statement uses the following convention: if a packageâ€™s   code defines a list named , it is taken to be the list of module names that should be imported when from package import  * is encountered.So if there is an  file in the package directory (it has to, otherwise it's not gonna be imported anyway) and it contains a list named  than this list's contents are treated as module names to be imported into the calling module's namespace.What happens if  variable is not defined in ? Paraphrasing a further paragraph from the docs:If  is not defined, the statement does not import all submodules from the package into the  current namespace; it only ensures that the package has  been imported (possibly running any initialization code in  ) and then imports whatever names are defined in the package. This includes any names defined (and submodules explicitly  loaded) by . It also includes any submodules of the package  that were explicitly loaded by previous import statements.If you want a good example where understanding this is crucial, head over to video #20 introducing GUI programming with TkInter in Derek Banas's excellent Python YT series.
The official python documentation reveals the answerYou can either doOrThe second method overrides the 'original' tkinter widgets with the ttk versions. So just doing  means that you want to use the 'original' widgets.
