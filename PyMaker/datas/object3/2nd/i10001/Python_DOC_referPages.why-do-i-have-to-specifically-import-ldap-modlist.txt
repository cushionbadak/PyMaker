What is so special about  that I have to explicitly import it?  Importing  is not enough:But if I explicitly import it, then all is well:Why?  Other modules don't behave like this:
The difference between the modules  and  is this:The module  is loaded during the initialization of the  package and is therefore already present as an attribute in the  package (see The Import System: Submodules for a description about submodules):The module  on the other hand is not loaded during the initalization of the  package.
