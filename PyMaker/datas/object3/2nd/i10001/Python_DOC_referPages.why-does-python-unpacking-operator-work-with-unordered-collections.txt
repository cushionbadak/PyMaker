The Python 3 tutorial about the unpacking operator () generically speaks of a "list or tuple," while the error message for improper use says that a "sequence" is needed:Python 3's Built-in types documentation lists the following sequence types:Sequence Types — , , Text Sequence Type — Binary Sequence Types — , , Quick test:Note that set types (like  and ) and mapping types () are not included here.My question: Why are all iterable types (including a  or ) unpackable? They are not sequence types, as the  above suggests they should be, and unordered behavior leads to undefined results when unpacking for positional args:
The error message is most likely a little bug*. Anything that is an iterable is accepted during function calls; this is hidden inside the section for Calls in the Python Reference Manual:If the syntax  appears in the function call, expression must evaluate to an iterable. Elements from these iterables are treated as if they were additional positional arguments.(Emphasis mine)*Which, as of  as @sytech pointed out, was fixed in  to correspond to the correct wording in the reference manual.
This is no longer the case in (at least) Python 3.5.2 -- Probably was recognized as an issue and changed in a version later than what you're using. The message now more appropriately reads iterable instead of sequenceSee https://bugs.python.org/issue4806
