Suppose I had the following subclass that I'm using to temporarily endow  with some extra methods,and then I do something likeNow, that is all well and good until I try to open the fileand I get a complaint that  doesn't exist. Is there a way to somehowget  to pickle as a plain  so that when I later try to loadthe pickle file, I don't get this missing class error? I would like the pickle file to only refer to the built-in  type.
I think what you wanted to do is to pickle the class instance and bundle up the class description in the pickled object.   doesn't pickle a class description, but  does.And then upon loading, it just works...
