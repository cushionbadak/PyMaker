I have data like . I want to wrap this in a class so I can call  instead of having to use .I tried to do this with the following:The reason for the  and  overloading is for backwards compability so that  still works. This works for most things, however I run into problems with the following call:The error I get is How can I make my class work properly with the argument unpacking operator?
The  operator works by iterating over the object. This iteration can well be performed with only implementing , but your implementation is faulty. Instead if raising , you should throw  which signals the end of the iteration.See also https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.getitem which explicitly statesNote:  loops expect that an  will be raised for illegal indexes to allow proper detection of the end of the sequence.https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#iter states that this is called the "sequence protocol".
