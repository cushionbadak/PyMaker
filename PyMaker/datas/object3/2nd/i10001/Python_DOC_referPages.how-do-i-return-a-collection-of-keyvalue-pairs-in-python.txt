Let's say I have a data item  with two properties,  and , such that;I want to return this to a caller, but am unsure of what method to use. My ideas so far are however:A dictionary for each  placed in a list -- Have tried, the syntax to perform were a little tedious, also I got AttributeErrorA class with two properties -- I don't even know how to go about this, nor if it even worksMy code is looking something like this at the moment:
First of all - the error you are not returning a list of dicts. Just a single dict. Instead of appending your persons to the list you created, you replace the list with your persons. So if you try to iterate over it, you in fact iterate over the keys. What you wanted is probably:Second of all: to get a "class with two properties" I would recommend looking on namedtuple. https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple
zefciu is correct and I would like to expand on his idea. First of all, before dealing with a list of persons, you need to know how to work with a single person. There are three ways to represent a person: a dictionary, a class, and a namedtuple.DictionaryGiven a person name (John) and age (32), you can represent a person as:You can then access this person's name as  and age as .ClassYou can define a person class, along with an initializer as:Now, you can create and access a person object:namedtuplenamedtuple is part of the collections library, so you need to import it. Here is how to define it:To use it:Populate a List
