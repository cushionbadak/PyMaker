Currently I have a short program which can take two different files on the command line as so: $python myscript.py file1 file2This is through using the sys.arg function, as in:The other way of importing the files is by asking the user to input the file names as so:However, I would like to combine these- so that I can either specify the two files on the command line along with the program- or just open the program and then specify the files. How might I go about this? Thanks
