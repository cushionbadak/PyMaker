I am attempting to cycle through the following code:I want to convert the numbers of the first series of numbers of each line so it returns the following (converted to integers)Here is the code I have so far, which sorts everything: I am guessing I will have to loop through each line while still pulling the 0 item of the list of each line. Though not sure I am on the best workflow for this.
You have to iterate line by line, and then do  to get the first value:
will return a list of ALL numbers in that string as ints that consist of 6 digitsedit: not return, but rather y will be assigned, and then sorted =Dso really, y will be a list of all integers in that string which consist of 6 digits
Another short solution to get the number at the beginning of each line by using re.findall function (from  module) with re.MULTILINE flag:The output:
