I'm using Unix sockets to stream audio from my microphone (via an Electron NodeJS app) to a python program listening on the socket and sending the audio to PyAudio for playback.Electron app  => WAV formatting => NodeJS socket => Unix Socket => Python Socket => PyAudioI have it working, but there's a constant clicking sound when each chunk starts or ends. Where should I start debugging it? Here's the code:NodeJS app (sender):Python program (receiver):
First you should check if  causes buffer underruns. This can probably be done with the  option (see the docs).If you want a non-throwing version of the  function, you can try the sounddevice module (see its  docs).If there are underruns, that may mean that the socket doesn't provide the data fast enough. In this case, you should probably implement some buffering on the receiver side, e.g. using queue.Queue.If there are no underruns, the error is probably on the sending side ...
