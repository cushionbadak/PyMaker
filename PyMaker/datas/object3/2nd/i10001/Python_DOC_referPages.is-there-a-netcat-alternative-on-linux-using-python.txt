netcat is not available in our Linux prod environment for security reasons.I'm trying to write/read short text messages into a port for logging.Write to port on worker nodes read on logger node.netcat would do the jobIs there a way to do the same on Linux using Python?
i made you a script, save this, chmod it and make it executable. And run it. This should work for you. Ping me if you have questions.
Thank you for replies.I ended up writing my own scripts.I start netcat_reader.py on logger node. I start 2 netcat_writer.py shells on the same or different worker nodes:Result is combined log of messages from 2 reporting scripts (netcat_writer.py) accumulated on logging server:netcat_reader.py (run it in loggerhost123):netcat_writer.py (run it on reporting nodes)
I use this at work for some situations where i need to get a message from a network node. hopefully it will help you. you will need to adapt this to your needs. i wont do all the work for you but I will give you the right direction.
