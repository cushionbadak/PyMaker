I need to find out the path for a particular library in my script.I tried using :but it gives an attribute error:Is there any other way to find the path for a particular module? I do not want to use  as it gives the list of all the libraries.
You have space between underscores  in . Call it like:
You can use the both  and  if you are going to split the passed filename into components without taking into account the current directory. If you want to also consider the current directory, you have to do so explicitly.To get the dirname of the absolute path, useNote: Remove the spaces before file. As the response of @paxdiablo here, when a module is loaded in Python, __file__ is set to its name. You can then use that with other functions to find the directory that the file is located in.  
It looks like you are not examining a module, but rather a  object. You might try:caveatUsually you can use the  attribute to find out where the module is located, but as stated in the docs (you have to scroll down a bit or ctrl + f and search for ) this attribute is not present.The  attribute is not present for C modules that are statically linked into the interpreter; for extension modules loaded dynamically from a shared library, it is the pathname of the shared library file.You can however use the  module. It has the find_module function which will perform the same search that is performed when you actually import the module. This would lead to code like this:
Use  moduleAn example: - just removes the last segment in the path i.e.  - in short it returns the project root.
Actually my code was something like :    I was trying to find the module path using :It gave an error saying "module" does not exist.So I did :    and then    Then it worked !!
