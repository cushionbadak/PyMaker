I have already checked answers regarding my problem, but I couldn't find what's wrong. I am new to Python and that might be a problem. I have written this simple code to connect to a site, but I get this error:This is my code:
Quite simple, don't use  in your host declaration on . is a protocol and  is a host (or A record in a DNS server). The standard socket library doesn't know anything regarding protocols and there for requires only a host and a port number.If you want automated processes check out urllib.request or @Mego's answer using Requests which handles the connection and HTTP parsing for you.Also if you're using  which you probably should, you need to send  data when doing .There's two ways of converting your string to  data:Both does the same thing basically.Finally, in a  request you don't request  either.Instead you just send the path to the file you want to retrieve:The reason is (again) that  is a protocol descriptor and not part of the actual protocol data being sent. You also don't need the host declaration in your  request because the server that you connected to already knows which host you're on - since you're... connected to it.Instead the server expects you to supply a  header if the host is serving multiple virtual hosts.You might need a few other headers tho to be able to request actual content from certain web-servers.But this is the basic jist of things.Continue readingHere's a good start:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Client_requestIt shows you what a raw  request looks like.An in the future I recommend using your browsers built-in Network Debugger which can show raw headers, raw responses and a whole bunch of other things.
I would highly recommend you use the Requests module instead of dealing with sockets directly.To install Requests, simply run the following in a shell (you will need  on a Linux system):Then, your code is as simple as:
