This question already has an answer here:How to prettyprint a JSON file?                    7 answers                I would like to save a list of python dicts A into a JSON file B. I usedto do that. But the saved JSON file's format is like [{'a': 1, 'b': 1}, {'a':2, 'b':2}...] What I want the display is to be something like:so that others can easily read. Is there a way to do that?
You can use the  argument when using  (see end of section in link):If indent is a non-negative integer or string, then JSON array elements and object members will be pretty-printed with that indent level. An indent level of 0, negative, or "" will only insert newlines. None (the default) selects the most compact representation. Using a positive integer indent indents that many spaces per level. If indent is a string (such as "\t"), that string is used to indent each level.
