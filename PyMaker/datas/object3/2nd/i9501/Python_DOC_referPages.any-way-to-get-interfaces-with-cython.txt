My application needs to have several Cython  classes that inherit from a single base class, but yet still implement many interfaces. These interfaces would be used to do  checks on the classes to make sure they conform to certain interfaces. I know Cython doesn't support multiple inheritance, but is there any way at all to implement interface-like behavior. It seems like a rather glaring limitation in Cython and I'm sure I'm not the only person to encounter this problem. 
You do it exactly as you would in pure Python when faced with a base class that you can't change but that you want to associate with an interface: you use the abstract base classes moduleThere's two options to chose from:you either  your class as belonging to an interface ("abstract base class") like I've done for , or you give your interface a  that allows it to claim any class with the right methods like I've done for .Example:
