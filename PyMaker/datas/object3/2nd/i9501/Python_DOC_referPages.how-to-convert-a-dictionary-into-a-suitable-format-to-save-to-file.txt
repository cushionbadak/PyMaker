I am new to python - however have encountered a problemI have a file saved which looks like:I can convert this to a dictionary by using this code:There is code that allows the user to element (so dictionary now consists of a:1, b:2, c:3, d:4)However, I need to get the dictionary in the form mentioned aboveSoIs this possible?Also if some explanations could go with the answer I'd appreciate it
For what you've specified, you can loop through a dictionary's key/value pairs using the  function, and write each pair to the file:Of course, change  to your dictionary, etc - this is just an example. There are a couple of edge cases where this will not work, such as if either the key or the value contain commas. If you're looking to properly store comma-separated data, you may want to have a look at the builtin csv module.
