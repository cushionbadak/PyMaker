This question already has an answer here:How do I unload (reload) a Python module?                    18 answers                Why does it need load twice? 'reload' is not a built-in function. Right?
What does 'reload' do in this case?That depends on what  does... For example, if importing  has a side-effect, then that effect will take place again.Also note that using  in any production code is definitely something that you want to avoid. The main reason that  exists is for interactive use ...load moduleTest it out and see a bugEdit moduleReload moduleTest it out...
Best way to find out is to check the  document, which says:Python modules’ code is recompiled and the module-level code reexecuted, defining a new set of objects which are bound to names in the module’s dictionary. The init function of extension modules is not called a second time.As with all other objects in Python the old objects are only reclaimed after their reference counts drop to zero.The names in the module namespace are updated to point to any new or changed objects.Other references to the old objects (such as names external to the module) are not rebound to refer to the new objects and must be updated in each namespace where they occur if that is desired.
