The basic form of the function is as follows:My goal is to use a list of terms to create my task list:My initial thought was:This doesn't create the task list it runs the function during the list comprehension. Is there a way to use a shortcut to create the task list wihout writing every task?
Your HTTP client does not support asyncio, and you will not get the expected results.  Try this to see  does work as you expected:If you use  you get one future encapsulating all your tasks, which can be easily canceled with , here demonstrated with python 3.5+ / syntax (but works the same with  and ):And finally, if you want to use an async HTTP client, try aiohttp.  First install it with:then try this example, which uses :
this works in python 3.5 (added the new  syntax):should't your version ? and (what library is that?) is this library even made for use with ?(here is the same code with the python <= 3.4 syntax; the missing parts are the same as above):
