I am using python 2.7 and trying to search folder not file. We have specific project number for every project and evry documents goes to project folder under any project. So , we have to search the project folder if it is exist or valid.My script can find the specific folder but it takes long time (about 11 to 13 minutes to complete the process)I would like to share my script work to have some better ideas.
