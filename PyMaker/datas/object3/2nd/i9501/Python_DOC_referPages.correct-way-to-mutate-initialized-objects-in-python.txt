I have recently decided to start learning python. For most of my time I have used C++ and some things are very confusing to me.Here is my code that I have problem with (full code here: http://pastebin.com/tj3qJnvM)When I call  in  (line 61), it should initialize background so it can be used on the next line. Instead I get error saying that background is None.If I understand it correctly it's due to the fact that background was set to None and None is not mutable so it creates local variable background in Display constructor.How should I approach this situation?I know it would be best to make background a member of Display class but I want to understand how to create something similar to declaring a pointer/reference in C. And then initialize it in some function. This would be useful to pass it then to some functions.Is it possible in python or is workaround needed every time?
Fixed. I think you're looking for preserved state in class instance variables. Use  if you want to save stuff on the class. Like most languages, variables, unless specifically defined as global, will not affect anything outside their scope. I added  and removed the background variable function parameter. Additionally you haven't defined  so you're going to have problems with . It only runs because  just happens to be a built-in Python function. EDIT: nevermind, forget what I just said ^.I see your full code sample defines it.
