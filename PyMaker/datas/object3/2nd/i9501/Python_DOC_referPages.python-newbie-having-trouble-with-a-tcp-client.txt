You are probably using Python 3.X.  expected a bytes type argument but  is an unicode string. You must encode the string using  method. Similarly you would use  to receive the data:
If you are using python2.x your code is correct. As in the documentation for  python2  takes a string parameter. But if you are using python3.x you can see that  takes a bytes parameter. Thus you have to convert your string  into bytes using . So your code might look like this instead.
So I encoded the data with utf-8 as was suggested by a few people and rewrote my code which fixed the odd syntax error. Now my code works perfectly. Thank you to everyone who posted but especially to @FJSevilla. The working code is as follows:
