I'm trying to install the io module in python3.4 or in py 2.7 on my Win10 with in order to use io.StringIO with pycurl but in both cases it says:I actually want to use curl with the GET method to access a https site on spotify and process the json result...Any idea?Thanks
You do not have to explicitly install . It comes along with python bundle at the time of installing python. Within your code, just do:and it will work fine
The  module is part of Python already. It is in the standard library from Python 2.6 onwards. See the Python 2 and Python 3 versions of the documentation.In fact, there is no  package on PyPI to install (the link gives a 404 not-found error).Note that I expect pycurl to write bytestrings, not Unicode text. You probably want to use  instead here. See Pycurl and io.StringIO - pycurl.error: (23, 'Failed writing body) and the PyCurl documentation.
