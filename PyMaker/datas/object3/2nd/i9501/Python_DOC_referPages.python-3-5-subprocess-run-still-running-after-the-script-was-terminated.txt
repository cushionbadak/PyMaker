Why after I terminate a python script with  while the command  is running from this script, the control returns to the terminal session but after a few min/sec the shell command reappears in the terminal session and the shell command from  still running?I think I saw the same issue with , for example  .I tried also the below code but I got an error:error: Is there a simple way to run a shell command with  like  with  ?Thanks
the subprocess module spawns a new process. when you send the CTRL+C signal to your python code,  you are existing your python application but the subprocess is still running and your code decides not to wait for the process to finish. Try catching the Ctrl+C signal in your code, and then use Popen terminate call to end the subprocess before existing your application. Popen and subprocess docsHere is the API doc for the terminate call:Popen.TerminateEDITHere is sample demo code for python 2.7, the section of the code that prints strout doesn't apply for ping, because it will still output the ping result to the terminal, but I placed it there for reference.
