https://coderbyte.com/information/Division%20StringifiedHave the function DivisionStringified(num1,num2) take both parameters  being passed, divide num1 by num2, and return the result as a string  with properly formatted commas. If an answer is only 3 digits long,  return the number with no commas (ie. 2 / 3 should output "1"). For  example: if num1 is 123456789 and num2 is 10000 the output should be  "12,346".This is the top user's solution, not mine:What does  do? I have no idea how that would place commas in the correct positions in a large number.
The documentation says that:The ',' option signals the use of a comma for a thousands separator. For a locale aware separator, use the 'n' integer presentation type instead.So we can see that is what the  is doing in the format string.As for the , the general format of a format string is something like:Both parts are optional -- The default format spec simply  (which means format this using the  builtin).  And if the "what" part isn't specified, then python just fills in the position of the appropriate positional argument.  In this case, the  is necessary so that the format parser can pick up the format_spec part.
