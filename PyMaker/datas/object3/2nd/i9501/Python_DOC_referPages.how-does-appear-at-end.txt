I am trying to understand pos,endpos and slice which using  in Python.My Code is as following:My question: As string  is not sliced in  How does  appear at endpos ? 
The  method docs:The optional pos and endpos parameters have the same meaning as for the  method.refer to the  method, which saysThe optional parameter endpos limits how far the string will be searched; it will be as if the string is endpos characters long, so only the characters from pos to  will be searched for a match. If endpos is less than pos, no match will be found; otherwise, if rx is a compiled regular expression object,  is equivalent to .Providing an  of 4 is equivalent to slicing the string to a length of 4, so  is considered the new end of the string, and  matches there. This is a bizarre contrast to the interaction of  and , which explicitly does not work that way:the  pattern character matches at the real beginning of the string and at positions just after a newline, but not necessarily at the index where the search is to start.
