Natural Text
I'm a beginner in python and having a hard time figuring out what the problem is with my code.What i'm trying to do here is to convert a text into tuples in a list and then count the number of DTs in the list.let's say the first three lines of the txt file looks below:This was saved as "practice.txt" in the workspace.So my code looks as below:But the output shows 2 for total_DT_sum, which means it only counted DTs in the third list. Any suggestion to count all DTs?The desired output is 5(total number of DT from the three sentences above)Thanks in advance!
If it is required to store your data in a list of tuples before counting the number of , you can use  like this: is used to add each line's constructed tuples to  will return only items with  in the second position.Output:
Your error: is reset to 0 each time...In case you want to do it from scratch, the simplest way to do it would be with a  of the  on each line:result is 13, not 5 as you stated (which can be manually verified)That solution does not take into consideration word split. It means that it will find  as well if there are some.So a little more complex code does that:Counts 1 for each time splitting according to  has  on its right for each word of each line.
