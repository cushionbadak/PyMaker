I've looked on stack overflow for an answer, but they all seem to be  or  or  not supported by the buffer interface, whereas my problem is with  not being supported. What should I do? Can a dictionary not be copied to a .bin binary file? If the solution is complex (or involving modules) could you please explain to me what to do as I am new to programming.May I also add, I cannot use external modules (i.e.  or ) as I am on a work computer without permissions to install modules. I do believe there is a fix to this using the Standard Library, I just don't what what it is. I am using Python 3.4
you cannot write a dictionary on a file like that.You have to serialize the dictionary, for instance using  (or ):Or directly ( must be open in  mode, not ):Then reload it using has the advantage over : serialized file can be edited by hand since it's text. But takes more diskspace (unless zipped).
