I have installed python in my mac. When I type in terminal and then import requests and bs4 it imports it and run the program correctly.But when I run it on python file as , it gives the following error:I got the same error with both python 3.5 and python 3.6.
The issue is that you named a module  so it's confusing the importer because the logging module is also trying to import something from the standard library module . This causes an issue known as "name shadowing" where your locally defined module is loaded instead of the the standard library module.When your version of  gets imported it triggers the code which is causing your error.As an easy fix, try to rename your  module to something else.For more info on name shadowing check out the "The name shadowing trap" section of this link: http://python-notes.curiousefficiency.org/en/latest/python_concepts/import_traps.html
