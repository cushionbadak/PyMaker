This question already has an answer here:issubclass of abstract base class Sequence                    1 answer                What is the difference between a MappingView container and a Sized container? Any examples on how to implement a MappingView container? I might be misunderstanding ABCs and the docs entirely, but a MappingView container is  any container that inherits from Sized, right? If so, then why doesn't my dummy example work?
Because you don't subclass from it (virtually or otherwise).  is used as a base class for the  views.  is used for any object for which getting its size () makes sense. These s are used to check if certain objects in Python follow the interface they define. Instead of creating a custom  you can just  any new classes that conform to it. Suffice to say, you wouldn't  a class to  since it used solely as a base class to provide a default ,  and  to  views. If you have defined a new mapping type that returns custom views, simply register these views to the appropriate  views.
