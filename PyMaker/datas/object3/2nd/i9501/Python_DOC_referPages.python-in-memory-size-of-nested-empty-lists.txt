The size in memory of an object can be gotten with .As one could expect, the size of  is smaller than the size of . On my machine, I get the following sizes:Now, whatever the number of nested empty lists I have, I always get the same size:What is the reason why the size of nested empty lists seems to have an upper boundary?
The size just refers to the outermost object and not the nested ones. From the perspective of  the object size is just the size of the object plus the size of the pointers contained in the object not the objects being pointed to. You can see this from the following:If you want to get the total memory footprint you will either need to recursively find the sizes for the object or use some other memory profiling.Also if you are writing your own objects and want  to correctly return the size you can implement your own  method. For example:Results:
Reading the documentation would have taught me that when calling ,Only the memory consumption directly attributed to the object is  accounted for, not the memory consumption of objects it refers to.Since  is a container, its size, according to , is its own size plus the size of the references it contains, but not the sizes of the objects referred to.Therefore, if  has a size of , and a reference has a size of , then the size of  is , hence .Now,  is nothing more than  where  is a reference to . Hence, the size of  is the size of  plus the size of a reference, so  as well.
