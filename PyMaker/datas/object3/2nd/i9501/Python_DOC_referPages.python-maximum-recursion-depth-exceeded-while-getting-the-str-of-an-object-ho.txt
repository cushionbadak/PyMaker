A digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number. Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has two digits, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. When I call it like this:I get:RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while getting the str  of an object
It's pretty trivial to convert this to the iterative (or is that dynamic programming?) version:
I can't reproduce the problem. That being said, procure to use iteration when possible, is more efficient, as show by Wayne Werner.Now, if you do a little wikipedia search you can find that you don't even need to iterate over anything
