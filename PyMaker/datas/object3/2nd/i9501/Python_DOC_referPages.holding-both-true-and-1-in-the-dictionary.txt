In IPython 3 interactive shell:Is that because 1 and True get the same interpetation so given that set eliminates duplicates, only one of them (True) gets to stay?How can we keep both?
A set is a collection of hashables. Even though the statement  is False, the statement  is True. Because of that, they have the same hash value and cannot exist separately in a set, and you cannot keep them both in a setEDIT To make it explicit, as jme pointed out, it is because BOTH things are true - they are equal (per ) AND they have the same hash value (per ). In a perfect world, equal objects would also have the same hash value, and thankfully this is true for built-in types.
