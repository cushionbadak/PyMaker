In Python, I currently have a one element list of elements given like so:where each of the values are only separated by commas. I want to make this a list of floats, e.g likeI've tried  and , but both return errors.
 is a list with one string, so to access that string you need . That string is comma-separated, so you need to specify the delimiter: . (Otherwise,  tries to split a string on whitespace, as described in the docs.)So you end up with:
You can use  like this: takes a function ( in our case) and an iterable ( in our case this list: ).  function is called for each item of our list It is equivalent to this list comprehension:
Split the string by commas, and construct a  from each item:
Make sure you are applying your  function on a string and not the single element list. Use  to ensure that. Also, pass a separator  to the  function.
 is almost correct, except for two things. For one, you're not passing in anything to the  function, so it's not going to split anything in your string (it would split only on whitespace, which your string does not have). You want to split by commas, so you have to pass a comma to it, like .Second, seeing as  is defined by , which is a list containing a single string, you would have to refer to the string in the array with . The final code would look like this:This outputs a list of floats: If  were just a string, like , then you would simply use .
