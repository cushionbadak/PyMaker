I'm trying to call the SLURM squeue from a python script.  The command,Works fine from the command line, but fails from  with:MWE: works fine from both the command line or .Could it be failing because it requires some information about the user/group that's executing the   command and that is (somehow) lost when running via python?  What else could be causing this?
The first argument to  is either a String, or a list of Strings. If it is a single String, it will be interpreted as a filename. This is the reason for the error you get.To pass a list of Strings, it should match how a shell would pass your arguments to the process. A standard shell will split your command line by whitespace, so instead of this:You need this:Splitting the second argument at the "=" as you mentioned in your comment just confuses squeue, which would then see two arguments.
