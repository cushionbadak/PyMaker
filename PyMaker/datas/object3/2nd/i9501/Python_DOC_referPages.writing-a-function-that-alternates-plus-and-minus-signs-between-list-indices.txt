In a homework set I'm working on, I've come across the following question, which I am having trouble answering in a Python-3 function:"Write a function alternate : int list -> int that takes a list of  numbers and adds them with alternating sign. For example alternate  [1,2,3,4] = 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 = -2."Full disclosure, the question was written with Standard ML in mind but I have been attempting to learn Python and came across the question. I'm imagining it involves some combination of:splitting the list,and then concatenating the alternate plus and minus signs.
Take the sum of all the even indexed elements and subtract the sum of all the odd indexed elements. Empty lists sum to  so it coincidently handles lists of length 0 or 1 without code specifically for those cases.References:list slice examples
Not using fancy modules or operators since you are learning Python.How it works? - returns each item in the list and its index in the list starting from 1If the index is odd, then add the item. If the index is even add the negative of the item.Add everything using  bulitin.
Although this already has an accepted answer I felt it would be better to also provide a solution that isn't a one-liner.
sum = 11 (result of 3-5+7-9+11-13+15-17+19)
You could try this list comprehension:
Here is one way using  module: 
You can use cycle from itertools to alternate +/-
