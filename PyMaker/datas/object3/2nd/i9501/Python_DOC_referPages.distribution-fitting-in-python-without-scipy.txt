I am writing a python script that needs to make a distribution fit against some generated data.I found that this is possible using SciPy, or other packages having SciPy as dependency; however, due to administrative constraints, I am unable to install SciPy's dependencies (such as Blas) on the machine where the script will run.Is there a way to perform distribution fitting in Python without using SciPy or packages depending on it?EDIT: as asked in a comment, what I want to do is perform an Anderson-Darling test for normality.The alternatives I found so far (but had to disregard):statsmodel: has SciPy as dependencyR and Matlab python apis: need setup of external software, same problem for me as SciPy
Fitting the normal distribution only requires calculating mean and standard deviation.The Anderson-Darling test only requires numpy or alternatively could be rewritten using list comprehension. The critical values for the AD-test are tabulated or based on a simple approximation formula. It does not use any difficult parts of scipy like optimize or special.So, I think it should not be too difficult to translate either the scipy.stats or the statsmodels version to using pure Python or only with numpy as dependency.
