This question already has an answer here:How to find the cumulative sum of numbers in a list?                    18 answers                Given the following list:I'd like to generate a new list where each number is the sum of it and the values before it, like this:Logic: 1 has no preceding value, so it stays the same.3 is from the first value (1) added to the value of the second number in the list (2)6 is from the sum of 1 and 2 from the first two elements, plus the third value of 3.Thanks in advance!
If you'd like a numpy solution
Python has  for exactly this purpose:
Python has a function for this.Python itertools solve some problems really well you should take some time and read over them.https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html
How about an ordinary loop?
try this..
There are about a hundred different ways to do this kind of cumulative sum. Depending on what you actually want to use the result for, a less obvious or less general-purpose solution might be more time- or memory-efficientâ€”although the simple solution below is O(1) in terms of memory and O(N) in time.The most straightforward procedural approach in virtually every imperative programming language goes something like this:The Python standard library also includes a function to do just this: .
