I'm trying to force the user to input a number using try-except in python however it seems to have no effect.
Actually, if the user inputs for example a string,  yields a , not a , so catch that instead
You could try to make the input value an int , which raises  if it cannot be converted.Here's a function that should do what you want with some comments:Once defined, call the function to get input from the userYou should also be sure to except and handle  anytime you're expecting user input, because they may put in  or something else to crash your program.
