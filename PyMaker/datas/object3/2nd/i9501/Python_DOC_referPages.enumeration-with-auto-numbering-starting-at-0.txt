Is there a better way to create a long list of enumeration with auto-numbering starting at 0? The closest that I can find is:However, the above approach requires knowing the total items in the enumeration beforehand.
The documentation provides a recipe for autonumbering that can easily be adapted to start from zero:Then you can create it with arbitrary members:Alternatively, note that the functional API can take an iterable of key-value pairs: is basically an open-ended equivalent of .However, the docs also provide the reason for members generally starting with :The reason for defaulting to  as the starting number and not  is  that  is  in a boolean sense, but enum members all evaluate to  .Starting from zero may lead to confusing behaviour later on.
