I have a function which acquires 1 or 2 resources:When I'm doing this and  is False, I get an exception:How to fix that?
Quite new to Python here, but why don't you store your (res2,res1) return values in a tuple, and then go through it with a for loop?Like :And you could then check if a value is None.(Sorry if this is not THE right way, trying to learn too... :))EDIT :Of course, I guess you can then use with on each element if it is not None
Do not return , use Null Object Pattern and return dummy context manager. It may be done quickly with contextlib.contextmanager decorator.
