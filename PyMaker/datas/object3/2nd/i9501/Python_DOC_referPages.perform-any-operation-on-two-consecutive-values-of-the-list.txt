I have a listI want to "and" the two subsequent indexes of this list."Anding" the above list will give the following outputThere are two cases1 List has only even number of indexes2 List can have even or odd number of indexesCan someone please suggest an easy shortcut for both of these cases(preferably through list comprehension or maps)
For both even and odd length list, you may use  with list comprehesnion expression as:Here, you need to set the value of  parameter as / based on the behavior you need. As the document say:If the iterables are of uneven length, missing values are filled-in with .For odd length list, if you want to keep the last value of list as it is, then you have to set the  as .For just even list,  will suffice the requirement as:
One brute force way to approach this would be to just append the last item back onto the end of the list if we have an odd number of elements.  That way we get  for the last element in the output list:
You can use  with   like below:If your list length is an odd number, you can do:Then, if you want to add  for the last value:The complete code would be:Output:
