I can't quite put this all together...At the beginning of my script I have some user input to get basic information:This (and a few other user input sections) are what drive the rest of the script.I would like to be able to just pass in the variables, and use argv to set the variables, rather that use the user input section. That is more for debugging purposes. I do not want to do-away with the user input section though. Just skip if args are passed in.I think the solution revolves around argv parse and , but as I said, I can't quite put it all together.Here is an example of something I tried, which didn't quite work:
Take a look at module .
A quick hacky way to do it (i'm writing this since you want to have quick debugging) is to check the length of . If the length is more than , then you have  arguments as the first element is the file name. Let's say you have one number as your input.This solution will work if you use  to run your script. Beware if you are using something more complicated.For a more sustainable solution, please use the library . This answer might get you started.
Here is an example of an optional positional argument using .This example will use a command line argument if given.  Otherwise it will prompt the user for input.  Either way,  gets populated.
