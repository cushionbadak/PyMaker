How to explicitly declare a list as a local variable that cannot be touched from anywhere except the function its declared in?tried doesnt work
Python is the interpreted language and it hasn't such statements.Here is from the documentation:“Private” instance variables that cannot be accessed except from inside an object don’t exist in Python. However, there is a convention that is followed by most Python code: a name prefixed with an underscore (e.g. _spam) should be treated as a non-public part of the API (whether it is a function, a method or a data member). It should be considered an implementation detail and subject to change without noticeYou can notice such (one underscore) naming.It is just a convention, it just tells you SHOUDN'T touch this variable but you CAN change value of this one at the same time. It is a python). There is  as well(two underscores).More about scopes and namespaces rules you could find here Classes, namespace and scope rules. There are few interesting statements you are interested in probably  and . They are like opposites of yours.
