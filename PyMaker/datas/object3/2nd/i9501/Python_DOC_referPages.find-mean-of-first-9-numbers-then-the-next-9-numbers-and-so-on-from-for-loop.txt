I have a  loop that gives me the following output.How do I find the mean of the first 9 values, the next 9 values and so on and store them into a list like ? I have tried a lot of things but the values seem to be incorrect. What is the correct way of doing this?What I did:
Once you have the list of numbers you can calculate the average of each group of 9 numbers using list comprehensions:
Your solution is close. Start with  and check for 
I do not know what you have tried so far, but I can present you with one solution to the problem.Save all values in your for-loop to a buffer array. Use an if-statement with  inside your for-loop, which will make some portion of code execute only every 9 values. Inside the if-statement you can write the mean value of your buffer array to a different output array. Reset your buffer array inside this if-statement as well, then this process is repeated and should behave in the way you want.
Try this
since nobody used reduce so far :)
Using mean function from the statistics module of Python.This is the simplest way in which you can do it.https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.mean
One-line solution given loop output in :
Putting ideas from the other answers together, this could be the whole program:
