Executing the above code with data=None automatically sets the METHOD to GET, while setting data to anything else automatically sets the METHOD to POST.Is there a way to override this behavior?According to the docs you can use Request.method, but I'm not understanding how to reference that from 'opener'.  https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.htmlRequest.methodThe HTTP request method to use. By default its value is None, which means that get_method() will do its normal computation of the method to be used. Its value can be set (thus overriding the default computation in get_method()) either by providing a default value by setting it at the class level in a Request subclass, or by passing a value in to the Request constructor via the method argument.New in version 3.3.Changed in version 3.4: A default value can now be set in subclasses; >previously it could only be set via the constructor argument."method should be a string that indicates the HTTP request method that will be used (e.g. 'HEAD'). If provided, its value is stored in the method attribute and is used by get_method(). The default is 'GET' if data is None or 'POST' otherwise. Subclasses may indicate a different default method by setting the method attribute in the class itself."
If you use the  you can use the  argument to set the specific  you want for this request:class urllib.request.Request(url, data=None, headers={}, origin_req_host=None, unverifiable=False, method=None)However - when you use the  you can't provide the :OpenerDirector.open(url, data=None[, timeout])There is no  argument for the  method.What you can do - is create a  object and use the  to send that request:
