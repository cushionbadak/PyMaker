I have a list that represents a tic tac toe board.I have a list of win combinations that are on a nested list.I have a function that iterates the  list. If a combination from the  list exists on the  list, the function should return true.Example:This should (i think) return True, cause 3 digits from the win list are on the board list but by some reason it keeps returning false.Am I missing something on my code?Thanks
First of all, it checks only first 'win' combination () and then just returns false. Second, you can't check it using  operator like so.So if you want to check if the combination is on the board (in the same order):if the order does not matter:
There are two problems with your code: does not check whether the individual elements of  are in , but whether , as a whole, is an element of , which is not the case for any you return  as soon as the first  does not work out (assuming that the first check would work), instead of after you tested all the Instead, you can use a nested  and  to check whether for any of the winning combinations, all the elements are in the .Alternatively, since order does not matter and each of the elements should appear only once, you can use  instead (note the inner  in ) and use :
You need to dedent your return false, because you end cycle after first iteration
You need to check if elements in board match an element of win. Your current code would always return False since it checks if [4, 5, 6, 9] is in an element of win. One way to check if elements in board matches a winning combination is to intersect the sets of board wth all elements in win:
