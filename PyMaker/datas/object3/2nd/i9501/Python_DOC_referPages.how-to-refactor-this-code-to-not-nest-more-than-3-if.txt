This function in python downloads a file to AWS S3 bucket. I have a problem with the code that I want to not nest the three "If" so that the code can be more clear and readable :How to do that ? thank you
You can always invert a test and use  to skip the iteration:We can pull out the double  call; skip keys that end in  early. You only need to create directories once, outside the loop (I'd rename  to  here too). I'd use  here instead of :
I would like to suggest using some features of the standard library. Like Martijn Pieters said, you should have renamed your  variable to  or something like that because it could confuse the reader of you code if you don't:The features used are: instead of str.rsplit() or str.rpartition() because it looks like you wanted to retrieve a filename at the end of a filepath when you tried to do  argument of  so you don't have to worry about the existence of directory before you need to create it.
