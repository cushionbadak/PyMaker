I want to split error log and December with the date( i.e into two parts with error in one and date time into 2nd part.The exact names of files in the directory are : Error_Log_December_10_2016_06_19_05 PM.txtError_Log_December_15_2016_06_19_05 PM.txtaround 50 files are present like this which are to be split. Please help.
Since you already know how to remove the extension.
To split the file name between  and  you might want to look at string slicing
If the name always start with  you simply silice it like an array of characters.
