You are probably calling the wrong python.  If running  from the command line works, use  to get the full path and use it when calling , for example:(BTW - It is recommended to replace  with  or some other subprocess function)
Make sure both files are in the same folder.  Do you have more than one installation/virtualenv of python?A better option to ruse python code is defining functions and importing them:If yo are sure about calling script2 in a different process, consider using  as a somewhat better API.
