I'm new to stackoverflow and Python so sorry for the mistakes.I have  that is in this project directory.I have two classes, CardClass & CardDeckClass in the classes subdirectory.CardDeckClass uses CardClass.I'm having trouble importing CardDeckClass to So far I have tried this:The above gives me an error on the 2nd line in CardDeckClass.py: ImportError: No module named 'CardClass'Any tips or ideas on how to solve this issue? Thanks!
While DYZ's answer works, I think it's giving you very bad advice. If you add the  folder to the Python module search path, you'll now be able to find the  and  modules in two different ways. You can either get them directly by name at the top level (with e.g. ), or via the  package (with ). This ambiguity is bad because Python won't realize that the two different names should refer to the same thing. Instead, you'll get two copies of everything, which can be very confusing. For example,  would be .Instead, you should fix the import in  to import  properly. There are two ways you can do it, and which you want is a matter of style (there isn't a single right choice). You can either use an absolute import, naming the package in addition to the module name:Or alternatively you can use an explicit relative importNote the dot at the start of the module name, which tells Python to start searching within the current package.You may not have realized that by putting your  and  files in a folder you were creating a package for them. In older versions of Python (before Python 3.3), you needed to add a file named  to a folder before it could work as a package. That's no longer necessary (for the somewhat obscure reasons it was changed, see PEP 420 and the PEPs it refers to). Adding an  file is still recommended since you usually don't need your package to be a "namespace package" (if you don't know what a namespace package is, you don't need one).A final suggestion: Your module naming scheme suggests that each module you're creating has only a single class in it. That's often bad style in Python. Unlike other languages such as Java, it's quite normal for Python modules to have many classes, functions, and other things in them. Splitting up your code too much makes the imports much more complicated than they need to be. In this case, the  and  modules should almost certainly be combined, since they deal with closely related objects. It's possible that it would make most sense to combine them into your  file, though a separate  module would also be fine. There's almost certainly no need for a package here.
Normally subdirectory  is not on the default import path. If you want your class to be imported from a non-standard subdirectory, you've got to add it to the path:
