Lets say we have functions in python:while I may pass  to A, I am looking for an elegant way to pass something like  to perform .The only way I see it now is to send a list of functions  and apply them in order. Is there a better way?
Or, to compose more generally (i.e. with an arbitrary number of argument functions):(see the docs on  and  - note you don't need to import  in Python 2.x)Then:
You could make an explicit compose functionThen use it
