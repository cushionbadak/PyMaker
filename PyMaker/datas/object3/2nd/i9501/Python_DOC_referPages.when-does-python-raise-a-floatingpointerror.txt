Python documentation says that FloatingPointError is raised when a float calculation fails. But what is exactly meant here by "a float calculation"?I tried adding, multiplying and dividing with floats but never managed to raise this specific error. Instead, i got a :Can someone help me understand when a  is raised in python?
It is part of the  module. The  shouldn't be raised if you don't explicitly turn it on ().However mind the note:The  module is not built by default, and its usage is discouraged and may be dangerous except in the hands of experts.  See also the section  on limitations for more details.Update: The  module has been removed as of Python 3.7.Even with FloatingPointErrors turned on,  will never raise one. It will always raise a TypeError. A FloatingPointError will only be raised for operations that reach the point of actually performing floating-point math, like .  doesn't get that far.
You can also trigger a  within , by setting the appropriate  (or  context manager) flag.  For an example taken from the documentation:Interestingly, it also raises  when all operands are integers:The documentation notes the conditions under which the  will be raised:The floating-point exceptions are defined in the IEEE 754 standard [1]:Division by zero: infinite result obtained from finite numbers.Overflow: result too large to be expressed.Underflow: result so close to zero that some precision was lost.Invalid operation: result is not an expressible number, typically indicates that a NaN was produced.
