In Python 3, (size) has the following documentation:Read and return at most size characters from the stream as a single . If size is negative or , reads until EOF.But suppose that you  to the middle of a multi-byte UTF-8 character. What will  return?
The partial unicode character can't be decoded so python will raise a . But you can recover from the problem. The UTF-8 encoding is built to be self-healing, meaning that the first byte of the character sequence (0x00-0x7f or 0xc0-0xfd) will not appear in any other byte, so you just need to keep seeking backwards by 1 byte until the decode works.
Text streams in Python 3 don't support arbitrary seek offsets, you're only supposed to use offsets of 0, or values returned by  with  of . Everything else is undefined or unsupported behavior. See the docs for .Sure, in practice, you might get , but that is not a guarantee. As soon as you violate the API contractual requirements, it can do whatever it wants.
