I'm an absolute pandas/matplotlib beginner and I can't figure out this issue after quite a few searches.Just learned that in order to format dates (basically space them out), I need to work an additional thing called  (for figure):However, when I try to change my data  to `bar, I'm getting the following error:AttributeError: Unknown property kindIt worked perfectly when I simply didBut then  wouldn't work.I'm missing something. What is it?
Pandas DataFrames, such as , have a  method with a  parameter.So it is possible to make a plot usingNotice that  is used to tell  to draw on the matplotlib Axes, .In contrast, matplotlib Axes, such as , have a  method, but  does not have a  parameter. Instead, to make a bar plot with an Axes object, call its  method.Using the  method, you could make a bar plot using something likeNote that  is used to set the xticklabels instead of . When making a bar plot the underlying bar plot  values are integers:You can only use  when the  values are dates.Since a bar plot has a fixed number of bars, there is no advantage to using a dynamic formatter like ; you are best off simply setting the  using the  method.creates a list of  empty strings. For example,  evaluates to .is equivalent toSo  is equivalent to Python slice notation, e.g.  is explained here. For example,So in the code above,  is a sequence of strings and if we call it , then  is a new sequence which starts with  and then steps by  amount.  divides  by 2 using integer-division. begins as a list of  empty strings. With , the assignmentreplaces every 10th element (starting at ) with a date string from . is a time series.  uses the  method to format the dates into date-strings in  format.
