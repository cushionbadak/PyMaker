This question already has an answer here:removing an instance of an object in python list                    3 answers                I'm working on implementing Dijkstra's algorithm in python and I was wondering how I can remove an instance of an object from a list ? Here's a part of my code in which I get an error: "list.remove(x): x not in list".
 will remove the first item from the list where that item is equal to whatever you wanted to remove.In other words, the algorithm is to do this:The trick then is to make the  equality test pass. This is done with the  method. The default implementation is to only return  when the two items are one and the same object, so  is true.You can create a custom method for your  class:You need to decide when two  instances are equal.
