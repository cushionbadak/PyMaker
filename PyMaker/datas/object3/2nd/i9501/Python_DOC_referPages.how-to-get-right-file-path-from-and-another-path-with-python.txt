I am doing content linking check on user's upload zip file with Python's  zipfile and BeautifulSoup module. In the zip file, there is a file "a.html" and its full path in the zip file is "content/product1/component1/a.html". File 'a.html' has a  link to another HTML file. I want to know how to combine the path "content/product1/component1/a.html" with "../../product2/component2/b.html" and get the right path which is "content/product2/component2/b.html". So I can check where this file exists.I tried , but I don't get "content/product2/component2/b.html". Does anyone know how to do that?
You need to extract the path component from "content/product1/component1/a.html", join that to the "../../product2/component2/b.html" href, and then normalize the result.output
You might want to try using  (with  as the separator) and then use  on the parts you need.
