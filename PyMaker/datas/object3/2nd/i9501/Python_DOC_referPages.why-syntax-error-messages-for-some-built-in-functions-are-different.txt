I recently noticed something weird. I typed something likeAnd I obviously got an error. What is interesting is the error description - . I haven't found any other function that would give similarly detailed one. If I have for exampleI get . All user-defined functions and all built-ins I found, e. g. , , behave the same.Why are these error messages inconsistent?
Since  is a valid syntax in Python 2 but not in Python 3, this error message is more detailed than a general  because it was (and is) very popular (well, as popular as the usage of ) when one is transitioning from Python 2 to Python 3.You get the exact error when trying to  in Python 3 (as long as  is defined of course).
The difference in errors exists because  was (in ) and still is (in ) a function call. , on the other hand, was a statement in  and made into a function in .
