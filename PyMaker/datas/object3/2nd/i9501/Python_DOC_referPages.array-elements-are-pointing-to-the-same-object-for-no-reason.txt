I am solving a class project and I faced this problem (when I append a new object to the array it seems like all the elements are pointing at the same object)here is my code here is the file I'm reading from :and here is the output :I think the problem is that I'm creating new references to the same object and I keep adding them to the array as new objects but I don't know how to make sure if that is the case or I'm wrong and if that is the case how can I solve this problem ?Edit: Here is the process class :
The variables of the class process were common to each instansiation of pr. So you were crushing the values every time.PS: Don't use ; in Python. And try to use Pep8. It's a python style guide.
