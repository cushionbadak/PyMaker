I am using Selenium tests. I have a class with many functions and a setup function that runs before every function on the class:I would like to detect on setup function which function in going to run after. How can I do that?Thank you !
Unit-tests executes test functions in lexicographic order by their names.Note The order in which the various tests will be run is determined by sorting the test method names with respect to the built-in ordering for strings.https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#organizing-test-codeKeep in mind that if you care about the order of execution of tests then you've done something wrong: tests should be independent of each other and should not rely on the order they are executed in.
