I'm working on Window 10,PyCharm-Python 3.5.2What I was trying to do: If PB1(push button 1) clicked, open a new window.Problem: I get an error Since I defined Soft_Memory(), I don't see why Soft_Memory() is NoneType. Though on the editor '.connect' gets highlighted and says cannot find reference 'connect' in  'function'Codes are below. I've erased some part of the code so that its better to see. If anyone need the full code please comment.SM.pyUI.py
The  method expects a callable argument. When you write  you are making a call to that method, and the result of that call (, since you don't explicitly return anything) is what is being passed to . You want to pass a reference to the method itself.
When you write  you are calling the method by using the parenthesis. What you want is to reference the method:
The answers from @DaveyH-cks and @user3419537 are correct, you should use a reference of the method, instead of calling it:However, you might often need to pass arguments on those functions (I certainly do). On those situations, if you need to use args there's a workaround by using lambda.
