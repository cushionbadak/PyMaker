i am trying to compute the time for every loop iterations. However, i have noticed that the time required to process (anything) increases on each iteration in an incremental fashion. I am computing time by using following commands:
When you call the time.time method you are returning the amount of time in seconds based on the Unix clock system, basically the time local to the system.You are assigning the time to start_time, you are then running your 10 processes and outputting the current time minus start_time, so you are essentially working out how long it takes you to run your 10 processes.Now I believe that what you're trying to do is calculate how long each individual process takes, to do that you need to move around some of the lines in the sample code you supplied:By moving the assignment of time into the loop you will be assigning the time at which the loop starts and then outputting the individual time of each iteration rather than timing how long the entire loop takes as a whole.This would output how long each iteration takes.Please feel free to ask any questions!
Here's an example of how you could perform your timings with .Which gives you a list of the times of each loop:
