If one changes a object attribute which refers to an internal method to an external function after the object is created, self is not passed to the new function, even if the attribute (which contains a function) is called like before.The exact error which I get is:If one move the external function into the class as a internal method, Then the code works as expected. Why isn't self passed once the attribute is changed to refer to an external function? What is the proper way to call the function so that self is passed?
When Python finds  in the class dict, it invokes the descriptor protocol, calling the function's  method to produce a bound method object that will be the result of the  lookup. This bound method object knows what  should be and will automatically insert the  argument into the argument list when forwarding arguments to the underlying function. (This happens positionally, not by the  name.)When Python finds  in 's instance dict, the descriptor protocol is not invoked, and  is just the raw function.  is not injected.
Try this:The output is:  and then :
