Once i try a simple program, this message shows up:TypeError: 'in ' requires string as left operand, not tupleThat's the script:the message shows once i press run and type one of the variables. In this case, "Yeah" or "Yes".What should ii'l do?Yeah ik, im a noobie ;)
Depends on what you want to do. If you want to see if the user's input is one of the values of the tuple, switch the order in your  statement:If you want to see if the user's input contains one of the values of the tuple, that is a bit more complicated. The best way is to use list comprehension (or in this case, tuple), and the built-in  function to turn the resulting collection into a boolean:
@stybl showed you how to fix your problems, I'll explain your error.In this line you are making a tuple. a tuple is like a list except that you can't modify it after its creation.The previous code line can be written like this:In Python the parenthesis aren't necessary but the two lines are the same.So it makes no sense to check if there is a tuple (a list if you prefer) into a string.More about tuples here.
