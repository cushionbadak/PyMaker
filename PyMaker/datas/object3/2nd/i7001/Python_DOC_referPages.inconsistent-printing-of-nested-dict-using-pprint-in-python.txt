I used  to pretty print a large nested :The 2nd level list  is unfold whereas  is not. I'd like both not to be unfold, i.e. printed on the same line. Does anyone know how?
You can play with two parameters:  and  (the last one may be not available for Python 2). -- limits horizontal space.And here is description for :If compact is false (the default) each item of a long sequence will be formatted on a separate line. If compact is true, as many items as will fit within the width will be formatted on each output line.But as I understand you can't tell  anything about the structure of data and how you want specific elements to be printed.
PrettyPrinter controlsThe PrettyPrinter in the pprint module accepts various parameters to control output formatting:indent: the amount of indentation added for each recursive levelwidth: the desired output width is constrained using the width parameterdepth: the number of levels which may be printedcompact: when true, as many items as will fit within the width will be formatted on each output lineJSON alternativeThe json module itself has its own alternative to pprint using json.dumps with the  parameter set:Specific ProblemThe 2nd level list cust2.Rogers.patches is unfold whereas cust1.videotron.patches is not. I'd like both not to be unfold, i.e. printed on the same line.Neither of the above tools lets you directly solve your problem as specified.  To get exactly what you want, you will need to write some custom pretty printing code.
