I read the "Unicdoe Pain" article days ago. And I keep the "Unicode Sandwich" in mind. Now I have to handle some Chinese and I've got a listDo i need to proceed encoding before writing to file?Somehow I find out that in python2. I can do this:no unicode matter involed. :D
You don't have to do that, you could use  or  to open the file with encoding. has the same syntax.
In python3;will do just fine.
