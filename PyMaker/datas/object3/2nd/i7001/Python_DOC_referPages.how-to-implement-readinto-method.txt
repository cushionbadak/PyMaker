I would like to implement a class which inherits from RawIOBase. I'm struggling to implement the readinto method. Basically, I don't know how to alter the content of the bytearray object passed as a parameter.I've tried following (naive) approach:But this, as I suspect, will assign new  object to local variable b and it does not change content of the original .
from the docs of : Read bytes into a pre-allocated, writable bytes-like object b, and return the number of bytes read. If the object is in non-blocking mode and no bytes are available, None is returned.its a bit confusing but you need to write into the bytes-like object  (not read)Example UsageTake a look at CPython implementation of .basically its does memcpy from the object's buffer to the function input buffer.
You want to mutate the object . Looking at the docs of , something like this should work:
