I have this code, where I am trying to shift p position by value 1 and in cyclic order, for example I applied the following logic, but all I am getting is only p[0] all the time, can anyone please suggest something..
Right here you're modifying your list as you're iterating through it. That's a no-no. Try making a new list first and modifying that.I also use  here which is more idiomatic when you need both the index and the value of an iterable.Note that if you're trying for efficiency here instead of algorithm practice,  is your friend. A deque is a double-ended queue, so it supports efficient pops and inserts from the start and the end. It also has a  function that does exactly this.
A very simple way to do this:
You can do this with slicing the list.l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]Output
