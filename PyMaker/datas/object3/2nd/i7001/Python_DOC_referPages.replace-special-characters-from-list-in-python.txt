How do I replace special characters (emoticons) with a given feature.For exampleoutput desiredI know how to do it with a dict, but here I have multiple values associated to each featureThe following code will not work in this case
You could use a dictionary and a regex:
This oughta do it:So, you crate a dict, invert it and replace all the emoticons that exist in sentence.

How about this:Instead of trying to find any of the emoticons in the  to replace them, it first searches for substrings that might be emoticons and tries to replaces those only.That said, it does fail for cases with punctuation right after or before the emoticons; e.g., So all in all.. 
There are plenty of answers giving you exactly what you asked for, but sometimes I think exactly what you asked for isn't the best solution. Like tobias_k said, the cleanest solution is to map many keys to the same value, essentially "reversing" your dictionary:The above code reverses the dictionary, so now it can be used like this:
You can try using a dict, This should work as long as you only have 2 or 3 chars in your emoticons and the person uses a space... Im sure you can make it more robust but this will work for now.
Try this instead:
