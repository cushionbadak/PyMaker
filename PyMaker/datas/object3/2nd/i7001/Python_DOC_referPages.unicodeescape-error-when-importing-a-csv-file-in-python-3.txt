Backslash U () has a special meaning in string literals. String and Bytes literals in the documentation says for  the meaning is „Character with 32-bit hex value xxxxxxxx“.So you have to escape at least the backslash before the U of Users, or put an  in front of the string so no backslash has a special meaning.
