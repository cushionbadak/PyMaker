I am working on concat multiple DataFrames(DFs) into one DF with Python, after concat some sample DFs as below:I got results print out as:But what I really want the result is like below format, which based on index content, if index content are the same, the value will be put into same row under each columns, rather than starting a new row and fill in with NaN, i.e. index 'SS_1' in example. If index is unique and no data presenting under certain column, then fill in with 'NaN' is fine, i.e. index 'SS_0'/col 'Tx-TCP'.Tried with concat/merge/join/grouby etc., but haven't found a way to do that. Please help to advise and Thanks a lot in advance!

One way would be concat the dataframes on axis 1 and consolidate columns using groupby
This my additional code to fix your code 
how about this:
