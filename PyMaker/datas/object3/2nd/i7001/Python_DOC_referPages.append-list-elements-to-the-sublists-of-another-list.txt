I have two lists:&I'm having trouble appending the  elements to each  so that I can get:I think I am just slightly off, but the  method I keep trying is not working.
 is the right way to go. Are you appending to the correct sublist? Here's one way using a loop.There's probably other ways to do this, but this is the simplest. 
l1[0][1].insert(len(l1[0][1]), l2[0])You can probably do it with append also, but this works just the same.It is slower. If you are worried about performance, don't use this. But for trivial tasks, it looks nice.https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html
