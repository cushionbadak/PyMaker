In the following python code, I have a list i.e.  of two lists i.e.  and  where I inserted an item in  and then deleted it. My confusion is, when I updated ,  is automatically updated but when I deleted ,  is not updated... why?its output is:
The reason why, when you update  your object  is updated is that your list  contain a only reference on .Now, why after deleting ,  is not updated is that the keywork  doesn't delete the object on which but only delete  from the namespace.Here is a quote from the Python Language Reference on what  does :Deletion of a name removes the binding of that name from the local or  global namespace
use   instead ouput :but why ?assume we have a list :when you use this to delete list program raise an error :in this code you used  which only delete   (Deletion of a name removes the binding of that name from the local or global namespace) and don't clear the list you must use  to compeletely delete it for more detail for  ref to this
grocery_list has many references to it and the will only remove one reference while other references will exists.One way to remove all the references from a list is to use slice assignment
