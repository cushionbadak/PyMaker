For example I have array xIf I have the number 600, then how can I get the values 100 as the lower value and 1000 as the upper value. 
Assuming the input as sorted, we can use  to get the index where  could be placed in that sorted order and then simply use the index and one-off shifted index to get the lower, upper limits upon indexing, like so -Sample run -We can also use  module, which I believe could be a bit faster -
Iterate over the list; check to see if the current number is greater than the test value; if it is select this value and the previous value.enumerate() might make this easier.Assumes a sorted list.
