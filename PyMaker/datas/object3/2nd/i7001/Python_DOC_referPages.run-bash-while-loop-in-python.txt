I am trying to run a  while loop inside a  script. What I have tried so far is:I get the following error:FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directoryIs there a way to run such a while loop inside ?
The part that's tripping you up is providing the args as a list.  From the documentation:If the cmd argument to popen2 functions is a string, the command is executed through /bin/sh. If it is a list, the command is directly executed.This seems to do what you want:Notice it's specified as a string instead of a list.
