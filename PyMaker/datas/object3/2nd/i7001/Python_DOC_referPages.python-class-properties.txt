Natural Text
I am new to python and came from strongly typed language background, so i got very frustrated when i didn't recieve any type of syntax error upon the last line of this (using Beautiful Soup markup parsing) :It is just returning  as no such tag exist in document and it will work that way  with every variable name. Why aren't there an error when code is trying to access property that is not defined inside class?Is the . operator somehow redefined here?
Yes, Python is a dynamic language with overloading. This includes attribute lookup, as a commenter has already stated, meaning that it is difficult (sometimes impossible) to tell at 'compile' time whether a given attribute exists. In the case of BeautifulSoup, dynamic lookup of any string appears to be an intentional feature.Secondly, this is not a syntax error. At most, it's a bug that will cause a runtime exception ().
