My example (list a and b are always the same size):Here is my code which needs something like an otherwise condition, the c[0] is so that the code only looks through list a rather than both lists and prints out the result of list a and b that fit the condition. The else condition in this code is wrong and I cant think of an alternative:Is it possible to change the condition so that it prints only counts of 5 if there are more than 2 counts in my example? Or that it prints only counts of 2 if 7 is the initial count but there are none detected?My desired outcome:Thank you!
You need to count your elements first, then decide which ones you are selecting. Use a  object to count elements efficiently, so you can then decide what elements are to be picked:Now you know if there is an element that appears 5 times, and if there is an element that appears 7 times. You can now filter those elements by how many times they appear, without re-counting each iteration. Make your pick first, so you don't have to complicate the  logic:So if there is an element that appears 5 times, filter on those, otherwise filter on elements that only appear twice.Demo:
