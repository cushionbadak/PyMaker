I want to write function that will copy structure and content of one root folder to another one (that already contains most of files in the initial folder and function must compare files and directories and copy if it is not exists in destination folder). Name of folders are the dict.values(). My code (image) is here (debug)The problem is that when comparing folder's names, python takes random (as I see) folder in root folder (reg_CENTRSIB_NORTH) although in list (2nd line) this is the second element. So, function creates wrong folders (in destination folder reg_CENTER function create subfolders from folder reg_CENTRSIB_NORTH). What way I need to rewrite my code so that it calls folders of the same name (that are the dict.values())? I'm puzzled, any ideas?
Try this simple solution to your problem based on This is a recursive implementation: Check if the destination folder exists, if not create itLoop over every element of the source folderIf is a folder call the function on it and GOTO 1If is a file check if it exists and if it is modified: based on this copy it This should help you jsut copy what does not esist or has been modified
