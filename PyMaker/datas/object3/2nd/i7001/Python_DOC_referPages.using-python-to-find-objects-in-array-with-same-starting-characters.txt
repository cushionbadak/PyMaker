I'm new to python and would like to know if there is an easy way to search for Strings in array that have the same starting characters.for example I have a listand want to get result for everything matching the first two characterssomething like this: {'ex' : 3, 'te' : 1}I have tried working with the Counter method from collections but I cant get a result as shown above.thank you in advanced 
If you slice off the first two characters of each element you can use  for this
