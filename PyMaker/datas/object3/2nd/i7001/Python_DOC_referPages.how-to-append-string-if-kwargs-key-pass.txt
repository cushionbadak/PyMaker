do I have a better pythonic way to write the following code? What I want to do is if function passes key argument as 'a', then append some string to value else just pass empty string
Use  to get 'a' if it is given in the keyword args. And if it's not present, the default return value is :The first assignment gets  from the dict and assigns it to . Then if  is non-empty (the ), then reformat with the .Edit: I assume is that if 'a' is not provided in kwargs but is empty (), then  will also be empty and not just '//'. In your current code, if  is provided and is empty, then  becomes . If you want empty or missing 's to both result in the empty string for , then use my version. Otherwise, your version is fine - but change to  as MartinP put in the comments.
