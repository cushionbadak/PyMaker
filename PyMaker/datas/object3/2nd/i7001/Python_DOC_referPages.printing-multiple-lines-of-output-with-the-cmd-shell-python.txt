I have a simple question today.  Basically, I want to print 2 or more lines of output in the CMD shell with python.  Here is an example:Regular CMD Shell:What I want:I'm using Python 3.x fyi.  I don't even know if this is possible with typical Python libraries, thanks for your answers!Edit: Due to confusion, I've dedcided to write more in detail.  I'd like to have 2 or more live outputs while a loop or something of the matter is running.  So, for example, if I was running a clock in a  loop, I could use the carriage return function and have 2 outputs running.Edit #2: So I'm going to give you guys a situation in which I would need an answer to this question.  Basically, I made a loop that displays the current time and the time until 7:30 pm to the CMD shell using a return so it all stays neatly on one line.  However, I need it so instead of me printing all the information I need on 1 line, it does it on 2.  Here is the output:What I want it to be:Here is my code:When I try to print anything below the carriage return, it doesn't print and when I put the carriage return in the second print, the original loop prints down and not in one line.  Thanks again!
If  command blinks, you can use ANSI commands to control. First you have to enable ANSI in the windows cmd. You can use a 3rd party library such as  to do that.Once you've enabled ANSI, you can use it to move up a line and delete a line (and also add nice colors ðŸ˜‰).Up a line: Delete current line: 
You can refresh the cmd window by calling . This will clear the screen and allow you to print your updated output.
