Often I need to work offline for my python projects. How can I download PyCharm documentation for offline use?
There's an option in PyCharm: go "Settings/Tools/Python External Documentation";  BUT it seems thishas not been working with local files for a long time due to a   bug.You can start a local server and pretend it to be a docs.python.org site.Get docs archiveUnpack archive to folder named exactly "3.6"Edit your hosts file:C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts or /etc/hostsRebootRun server. Go to the dir where "3.6" folder is located and run:for linux use
