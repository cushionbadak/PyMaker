This question already has an answer here:How to make a class JSON serializable                    25 answers                New to Python, trying to define a very simple class that will hold a few values, and then get it output into JSON notation.I was hoping to see something likebut instead get an error: "TypeError: <main.Multiple object at 0x0149A3F0> is not JSON serializable"
You can serialise the  attribute of :You can also call :What to use and why:Use `__dict__` or `vars()`?For more complicated classes, consider the use of . is a Python library for serialization and deserialization  of complex Python objects to and from JSON. The standard Python  libraries for encoding Python into JSON, such as the stdlibâ€™s ,  , and , can only handle Python primitives that have a  direct JSON equivalent (e.g. s, s, ings, s, etc.).   builds on top of these libraries and allows more complex  data structures to be serialized to JSON.
