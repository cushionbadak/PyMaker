use star operator:outputs:CautionMatching 0 or more will match empty string, I'm not sure thats what you need.Suggestionif you are using  you dont need to match all  elements in one results as all resulting matches will return from .first capture the  block using .then separate each  element using  on the resulting ul textSuggestion Twouse lxml or bs4 to parse html objects, its simpler than writing your own regexes to find html elements.
Can you try to use the regexp below instead.This will work as you expect.
Take a look at the documentation for :Your RE has only one match in your string since there is only one  to match with. Since you have (one) group in your RE,  returns that group instead.If you use just  as your RE then  will find three matches and return all three:Output:
Instead of UseWill solve your problem
