I'm working on this Kata in CodeWars, and I pass all but one test, but it doesn't say what the error is.  The description says to check both lists for multiplicities.  List a2 is a list of squares of list a1.  I need to check a1 for the square root of all the items in a2, and return false if the array is empty, None, or the square root isn't in a1.I am hoping to get any tips you might have about not only function (make it more Pythonic), but error handling.  What am I missing?  Why is it not passing?  Thanks in advance.
Your can improve the code you posted as a comment:You can build sequences using a comprehension expression. You build a list by appending squares to an empty list, but you could do it like so:You create a temporary  object . However, you could build a set in the same way as the list instead:If you have a boolean expression and then return  else  you can replace it with the expression itself:Applying all these changes you can get:edit: Just to note:Empty lists evaluate as  in boolean expressions:Also,  evaluates :
