Suppose if I have a class as shown below,I want to create a dict out of all the @properties. I have tried with  and  but still the  is not showing up. How can I include  too.I want to include  and  with the returned values as the keys and values.
Use a dict comprehension that iterates over the objects attributes:If you really just want the  attributes, which is unclear in your question, you can filter for them like so:
You can get the names you want by calling  on your instance. However, the list returned by  also has a bunch of names you don't want (the names of the methods inherited from ), so we need to filter those out.outputHere's a cleaner way to do this. We loop over the  of the class object, specifically looking for items that are  instances. Then we use  to combine those names with the names from calling  on the instance of the class.outputThis way is superior to the previous technique, since that code will also include bound methods whose names don't start with , like , in its output.
