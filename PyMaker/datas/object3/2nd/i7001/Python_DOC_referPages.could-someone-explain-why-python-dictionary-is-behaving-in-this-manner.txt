This question already has an answer here:Boolean operators vs Bitwise operators                    8 answers                I am trying to create a directory with based on set of logical conditions, but it only correctly executes through second logical statement.I suspect it is because with each loop the dictionary shuffles the order, but that seems like a poor explanation. Can someone expand on this behavior?
You are using the wrong operator to do boolean testing.  is the binary bitwise operator, not the boolean logic operator. Because it has a different operator precedence you are really calculating something else:is interpreted asFor 16 of your years that'll be true, including 2001 through to 2007.Use  instead:or use comparison chaining:Put together, simplifying the last test to :
