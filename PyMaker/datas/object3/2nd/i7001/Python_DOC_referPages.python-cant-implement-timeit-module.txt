This is a basic exercise. I just don't know hot to implement the timeit module correctly. I keep recieving syntax errors
You seem to have misinterpreted the function of  - the idea is that you tell it what to actually time, and it then times it. Normally, it does the thing you're timing many, many times, so you can get a meaningful average. This means it also needs to provide a 'setup' argument, as the list should presumably be different for each test. Refer to the examples in the documentation if you need - I normally find that they're easy enough to suit to your purpose. I've implemented timeit below:Of course, if you're using IPython you can do something like this:Maybe you were expecting timeit() to tell you just how much time has passed. If so, this could be done using the  module, quite simply.On another note, I'd recommend using a different name for the argument "Laux". As you can see, SO's syntax highlighting thinks it's a class, as normally anything starting with a capital letter is a class. Laux also doesn't particularly tell me as an outsider what it is, although I can infer from the name bubblesort.
