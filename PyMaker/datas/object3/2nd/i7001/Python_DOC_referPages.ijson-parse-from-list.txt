I have a list in which each item contains JSON data, so I am trying to parse the data using  since the data load will be huge. This is what I am trying to achieve: This is the error I get:AttributeError: 'generator' object has no attribute 'read'I thought of converting the  into  and then try to parse in , but it fails and gives me the same error. Any suggestions please?since it is in list, i tried this one also .. but it is giving me the same error. 'generator' object has no attribute 'read'
I am assuming that you have a list of byte string json object that you want to parse.ijson.items(JSON, prefix) takes a readable byte object as input. That is it takes a opened file or file-like object as input. Specifically, the input should be bytes file-like objects. If you are using Python 3, you can use  module with io.BytesIO to create a in-memory binary stream. ExampleSuppose input is [b'{"id": "ab"}', b'{"id": "cd"}']
