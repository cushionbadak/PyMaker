I have a Unix timestamp which value is . This Unix timestamp value can be converted to human readable like .I have 2 following python code to convert  to . Both of them give a same result ()First methodSecond methodCould anyone answer me 2 following questions.1. The result of 2 methods are same. But at the logic view point of Python code, is there any case that may cause the difference in result?I ask this question because I see most of the python code use First method.2. As I read here, the Unix time will have a problem on 19 January, 2038 03:14:08 GMT.I run a timestamp which has a date after 19.Jan, 2038 (- ). The result is as followsFirst method: Second method: Question is: Can I use Second method to overcome the problem of "Year 2038 problem"?
Quoting the documentation:fromtimestamp() may raise OverflowError, if the timestamp is out of the range of values supported by the platform C localtime() or gmtime() functions, and OSError on localtime() or gmtime() failure. It’s common for this to be restricted to years in 1970 through 2038. Note that on non-POSIX systems that include leap seconds in their notion of a timestamp, leap seconds are ignored by fromtimestamp(), and then it’s possible to have two timestamps differing by a second that yield identical datetime objects. See also utcfromtimestamp().The second solution solves your problem:
