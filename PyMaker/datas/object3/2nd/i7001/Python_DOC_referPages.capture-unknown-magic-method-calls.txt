I have a class for which I would like to override a variety of methods such as ,  or . However, the implementation of all of these methods are identical. For example, I might have something like this:My idea was to capture the methods or magic methods, and call them after performing  (in a type of wrapper function). Is there a way to do this? Or maybe there are alternative solutions?
