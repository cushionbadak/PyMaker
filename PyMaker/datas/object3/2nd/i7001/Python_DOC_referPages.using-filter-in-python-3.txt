I am pretty much copying from the example given in online docs, but using filter() in windows-based Python 3 is perplexing me.  What is wrong here:Traceback (most recent call last):        File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>      TypeError: 'list' object is not callableTraceback (most recent call last):        File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>      TypeError: 'list' object is not callableOnline docs say to throw  in, but that clearly helps not.
First argument of  must be a function or lambda. You passed  which is a list.
Filter's documentation clearly states that it takes a function and an iterable as input. Perhaps if you want to check if a value is in both a and b, you could do something like:and then loop over f.
You are misunderstanding how  works,  needs a function that returns  for each item that you want to keep.I'm assuming  describes the things in  you want to select, then you meant something like::You can also replace  with a list comprehension:But there is a function in  that does exactly this:
Basically filter takes a function and an iterable value to filter inoutput:Confusion occurs when we call filter with NoneThe reason being When we pass filter condition as  filter function checks each value in the list and sees if they qualify the  condition.Which roughly translates to this.
