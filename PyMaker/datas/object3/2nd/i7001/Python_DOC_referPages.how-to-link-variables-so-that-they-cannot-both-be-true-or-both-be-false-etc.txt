Not sure if my question title is correct, please tell me if it isn't so.Say I have a list, dictionary or tuple of transactions, where the transactions are instances of class. I want to record whether the transaction is pending, completed or cancelled, so I create booleans (within the __init__() of the class) self.completed and self.cancelled (whether it is pending or not can be inferred from both self.completed and self.cancelled being False)Of course, a transaction cannot be any more than one of the three states at any time, so is there any library to check that only one is true at a time?I could check this every time I change one of the variables and raise an exception, but I would rather save the lines of code.I could also have a variable with a integer value of 0, 1, or 2; where 0 is pending, 1 is completed etc. However, this gets rid of the intuitive:Thank you in advance!
What you want to do is to have a single  attribute instead of 3 booleans. You can use an enum to represent the different states. You can then make 3 properties that query the  attribute:
I suppose you can do that using  like so:In this way whatever you do,  will always be opposite from .
