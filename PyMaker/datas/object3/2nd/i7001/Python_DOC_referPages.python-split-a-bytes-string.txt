So I wrote a code on Python for my scale that is hooked up to my computer via an RS232 - port. Now I got that part working with the following code:Whenever I send 'w' in bytes to the scale it sends back the value. That looks like this:It first prints the name of the com-port and on the next line the received data. However. I want to isolate the value(digits) as an int.I tried using:this gets rid of all the junk "kg  \r\n". And leaves us with just the digits. But of course, Python won't allow me to change a bytes string into an integer. It's probably a stupid beginners question, just like my other two posts but please bear with me, I have only been coding for about 2 weeks now.
You guessed that you have to convert (i.e. decode) the bytes returned by a serial binary read in to a string, that you can parse further. Using  should do here (no strange chars on sight).Then, convert to float, not int. Also, using  is more robust to changes if you know that the first field is your value:results in
