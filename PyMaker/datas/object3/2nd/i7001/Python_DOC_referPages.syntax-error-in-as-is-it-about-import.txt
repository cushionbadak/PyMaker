 is a reserved keyword (as part of the  statement, an  handler in a  statement, or an ); keywords can't be used as names.Use a different name; a common approach is to add a  after the name:However, the code you copied is not Python code:"Powerball"-style lottery written in Serpent, for prophetx's bounty.(Bold italic emphasis mine).And, from the Serpent Builder's Guide:Serpent is one of the high-level programming languages used to write Ethereum contracts. The language, as suggested by its name, is designed to be very similar to Python[.]It will fail on other issues too; all the files have  extensions, not  extensions, to indicate this is a different programming language. There are a lot of similarities with Python, but there are more differences that can't just be ignored. Use the serpent compiler instead.
