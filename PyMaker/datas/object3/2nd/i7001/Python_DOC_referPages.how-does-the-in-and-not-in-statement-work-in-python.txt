I studied predominantly in C and spent a lot of time understanding its implementation under the hood. But I've recently begun learning python. So there are a lot of quirks here different from C.How does the 'in' statement work in python? Also as a side question. 'Not' can be placed in front of a boolean expression, similar to '!' in C or it can be placed in front of the 'in' statement in python. How is this possible?How are both of these possible? Shouldn't there be a consistency in how they are evaluated? Right now, I believe that it's because Python is an interpreted language, the interpreter can just do different things based on the surrounding syntax.An explanation or link to an explanation would be super helpful, I've been unable to find anything addressing this.
You are confusing two totally unrelated pieces of syntax. One is a statement, see the  statement documentation. The  is part of the fixed grammar:The moment you use  to start a line, the  part is required, just as the  is required. And don't confuse Python's  with a C  loop; Python's is a For Each construct. As such it doesn't 'produce' an iterable, it requires an iterable as input.The other is a membership test operation, and operators are a type of expression:The operators  and  test for membership.It is meant to apply to containers (not just iterables).Both are leaning heavily on Python's OO nature, something C can't do. If you want to find equivalents in other languages, look at concepts in C++, Java or C#, not at C. takes an iterable object, something that can produce elements, one after another. C++ has an equivalent concept, in Java there are parallels in iterators and streams. only requires that the right-hand expression result supports membership testing, but Python will fall back to iteration if no explicit hooks are available for a membership test. The  in  simply inverts the result of the  operation. C++ and Java have no standard abstraction for this, different container types each implement their own spelling (in C++ most call it , e.g.  or , while Java usually picks  variations, giving you , and ). 
The  is not much different from the range based for loop introduced in c++11. The syntax in c++ is also quite similar:The statements  and  do not have much to do with each other, they simply feature the same word , but it has different meaning. You could easily imagine how one would implement a feature similar to  in c++ - for instance use std::find. An alternative is to iterate over the container and compare each element to . There can be specific overloads for certain types of containers to make this more performant of course, but important thing is that it can be implemented.
