I'm extracting spreadsheets and realise that some will be password protected, therefore some spreadsheets will not be able to be read by the code below, which is fine. I'm trying to pass these spreadsheets through the except line and I have imported BadZipfile from zipfile to try to recognise them as errors.However, the except function doesn't recognise BadZipfile as an error, and it will still raise the error in the Traceback (below). I was hoping that by leaving the except line blank, it would pass any errors and would loop over again to run the try statement on the remaining files, however it doesn't seem to recognise BadZipfile as an error. KeyError is needed as well within the except statement, as some spreadsheets don't have the index label I want to extract. Perhaps  I should pass any exceptions, as further errors may crop up from the files I haven't looped over. I would prefer to process any spreadsheets that work at this point, and reconcile the errors at a later point.Therefore, how can I ensure that BadZipfile is recognised as an error, then use the except statement to pass any errors?

first, check your stack trace. you don't have a  around where the error's being thrown.second, to catch multiple types of errors, you do  not , which just evaluates to  (read up on how  works)
From the docs page on error handling:If you wanted to do something with the error, you could useIt looks like the error is actually occurring in your  function when you call the statement  so you're not catching the error when it occurs.
