Natural Text
I have a dictionary name typecontext and I have a list named types. I want to take  five elements of types and add it to the dict typecontext. I am getting a error that set attribute has no object getitem. 
It looks like your variable  is a  object. So when you try to slice it you get your error.
Take a look at the islice function. It works with any iterable.
