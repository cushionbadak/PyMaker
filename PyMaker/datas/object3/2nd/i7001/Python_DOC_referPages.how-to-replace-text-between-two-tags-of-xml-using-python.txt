You can use  but it depends on your actual purpose of use, here is an example:
You can treat an xml file just as a text file and use the functions you would use to manipulate strings. For example:There might be many instances where you have a lot of nested tags and this simple script would not work. You could use Python's built in XML editing package ElementTree if you want to do more advanced tasks.
Try this:read file and do this operation.
