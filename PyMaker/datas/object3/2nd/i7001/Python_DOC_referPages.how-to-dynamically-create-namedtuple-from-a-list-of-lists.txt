Consider a list  variable  tNow consider a namedtuple 'Point':How do we convert the variable t to a Point?  The most obvious (to me anyways..) approach - of just providing the list as a constructor argument - does not work:
Use  to expand the contents of  as arguments to the  constructor.
More efficient solution: Use the special  alternate constructor to directly construct the  from an arbitrary iterable without creating additional intermediate s (as star-unpacking to the main constructor requires). Runs faster, less memory churn:Despite the name,  is part of the public API; it's named with a leading underscore to avoid conflicts with field names (which aren't allowed to begin with an underscore).
