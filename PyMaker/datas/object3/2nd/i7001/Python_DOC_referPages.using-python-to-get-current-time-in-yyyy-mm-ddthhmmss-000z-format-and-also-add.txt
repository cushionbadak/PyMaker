This question already has an answer here:How to add hours to current time in python                    1 answer                I'm using python and I need to get the time in a certain format that this API uses.  So I need to get current time in the format of yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.000Z and then also create a new date in the future by adding a number of days to it.  So if I could get the current time of 2017-08-19T07:00:00.000Z and add 30 days to it to get 2017-09-18T07:00:00.000Z.  What would be the easiest way to write this in python?Thanks!
