I have been coding for a few months and hit a wall.The following code simply prints a menu and runs a few shell commands and outputs these to the screen.What i'd like to do is send the output of the menu 1 options to a "workspace".I'm calling a workspace a user inputted directory whereby when a shell command is executed it saves the the std in as a file to that respective directory.I will have over 50 different command that will be executed eventually and i want them to all be neatly stored in the relative directories.Currently using Python 3.4So far my code can, request user input for a workspace, which inturn creates a relative directory.What I need to is get a file to be outputted.
You can use 's  argument to run a command and redirect its standard output to a file. The documentation statesstdin, stdout and stderr specify the executed programâ€™s standard input, standard output and standard error file handles, respectively. Valid values are PIPE, DEVNULL, an existing file descriptor (a positive integer), an existing file object, and None. [...]This means, if you pass a file object (returned by ) to , it will use this file object to redirect the standard output. Everything that the sub-process writes to its standard output is written to the file object.For example to redirect the output of the command  to a file  you can write:1 https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.call
