Formally: is a subscriptionthen you have:Assignment statements are used to (re)bind names to values and to  modify attributes or items of mutable objects:...If the primary is a mapping object (such as a dictionary), the  subscript must have a type compatible with the mappingâ€™s key type, and  the mapping is then asked to create a key/datum pair which maps the  subscript to the assigned object. This can either replace an existing  key/value pair with the same key value, or insert a new key/value pair  (if no key with the same value existed).from here Assignment statementsSo basically you are binding/mapping the recently created object to the subscript and of course, the newly created object can be referenced by  so the Python garbage collector can't touch it (reclaim it) and it is not a "dangling pointer" or to be more precise an object without any reference to it.Side note: a dangling pointer is not a term used to refer to an object without reference (how appears you were using the term) but to a reference to a nonvalid object (and this is impossible in Python).
There is no pointer in Python. There is name bound to object in Python.
