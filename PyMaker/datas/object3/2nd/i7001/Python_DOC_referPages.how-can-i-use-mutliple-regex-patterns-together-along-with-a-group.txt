This question already has an answer here:re.findall behaves weird                    2 answers                The regex I want to match is  and I am using  but it returns empty strings.I have taken 
From the  docs:scanned left-to-right, and matches are returned in the order found. If  one or more groups are present in the pattern, return a list of  groups; this will be a list of tuples if the pattern has more than one  group. Empty matches are included in the result unless they touch the  beginning of another match.Bold emphasis mine. So the bottom line is, don't use capture groups. You can make them non capturing using the  flag.
