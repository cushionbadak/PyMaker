So I wrote a buffer that would delay the inserts by a few milliseconds. However, I noticed that as soon as I ran any blocking functions like  in the for loops, it would freeze. So the prints inside the for loops will only be displayed after the loop is done. This does not happen if the buffer is disabled.For eg, if i do this in the shell:This will only print after 10 seconds.CodeThis is the most minimal version I could write according to MVCE guidelines.Here is the  file:Here is the file:The class  is needed for communication between the main thread and the interpreter. Here is a transcript as to why this was implemented.What I knowThis line is responsible for inserting the plain text . This  happens inside a . So until the multiple  is finished the  won't be processed. I thought adding a  in  would help. It doesn't. I admit I could however be wrong about this.Any help appreciated.Thanks in advance.
Your interpreter thread is blocking on the  call.  It will not be able to process any signals until this call completes.  That is why you see the delayed output.You can get the effect you're after by changing toFor some old school debugging, disconnect you're stderr handling and sprinkle some print statements around like...
