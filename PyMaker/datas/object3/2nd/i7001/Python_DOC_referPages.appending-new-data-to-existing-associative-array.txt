I've been working on Python for last few months and I encountered this problem.So, I have a dictionary which contains only keys and no values.And I want to add data which are in the list. For example, As you might guess, the order of elements inside the list corresponds to the order of keys inside the dict.I think using for loop is the solution but I couldn't come up with a good one.Extra question: The dict above is now dictionaries inside a list.And, I want to add exactly same dictionary with same keys and new values every time I get a new list of data.How do I do that?Thanks, Python friends!!
Actually you cannot do that with a dict because the order is not conserved. But you can use the class  as shown here: Python dictionary, how to keep keys/values in same order as declared?What you could do is have a list with your keys to keep track of the order:
