Natural Text
I wasn't really sure how to title my question, but my issue is this; I have my program set up to guess a number and handle exceptions. The program loops until the number is guessed, but when the program exits, my exception message shows at the same time. How can I fix this?This is my output:What is the age of my creator?31Good Guess!Numbers only! Process finished with exit code 0

Try this:Also, you should catch a specific error rather than a catch-all bare .If you want to silence any error messages, you should use  instead. From the docs:The  statement does nothing.
