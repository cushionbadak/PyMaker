I'm trying to do a script that generate a 20 digit random string. But these strings have to be unique.Imagine that I generate today 20000 random string and tomorrow 20000 other strings I need to be sure that I have 40000 different string.The problem is the amount of data I have nearly 700000 serial by day and don't know how to optimize it to be sure to have unique serial with competitive time ...Thanks you for your help.Need to be compliant to this https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/files/eudralex/vol-1/reg_2016_161/reg_2016_161_en.pdfI can't do incremental.
I agree with @bendl's comment - if you need it to be 20 digits you could just increase by one value each time you need a new string. If it doesn't have to be 20 digits, I'd say take a look at the UUID module for python: https://docs.python.org/2/library/uuid.htmlThis module creates unique IDs, could be what you're looking for. Good luck!
To ensure uniqueness you can generate string as combination of UUID and timestamp. For example
Essentially you need to create a new random string and verify it does not exist in your current list (if you can't check your current list, this can't be done).Reference https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.choices
