I am trying to check whether the given a string is a sub-string of another string, and print the index value of string where the sub-string takes place.So far I have this code. To reduce the complexity I am using single for loop.Or alternatively I was thinking about this,I know we can use  keyword to solve this, but I want to learn the logic behind it.Please help me. I am trying from a long time to solve these.

Here's a trash implementation:
