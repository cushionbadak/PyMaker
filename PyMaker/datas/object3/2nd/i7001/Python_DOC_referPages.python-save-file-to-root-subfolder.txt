I am trying to set the folder_out to the subfolder where the source .csv is found. So I have many folders and subfolders in the main Processing folder.I want to save the the .csv file in the same folder as where it has found the file.When I use the root, with pathlib, is that possible?And, I am getting now back IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'D:\Processing\DG_Boeblingen-..... etc. So it found the file, but can't write. I am in Python 2.7 and using 'wb' to write. how I set the Path and rb an wb, is using wb and rb, correct? 
You are trying to save a file in root directory for which you would need sudo prviliges so if you execute the python script as super user then you should not see this issue.
I am kind of confused as to what you are trying to do here. Are you trying to output the CSV to root? In that case I think you are using  wrong. If you look at the documentation for pathlib, there is a class called PurePath with a method called root. You can use this to return the root.Passing in  to Path will just return  as the path. You can try using  instead of  which might resolve to the root.
