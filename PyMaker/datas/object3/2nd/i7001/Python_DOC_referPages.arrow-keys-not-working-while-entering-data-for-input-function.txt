In linux, the arrow keys don't work when I try to enter data for an  function. I get escape characters. See below (when I pressed left arrow key).I have  installed (I am able to import it in the python shell).The arrow keys work fine in the interactive interpreter but not in the above case (or when I execute  from a script).What could be the reason? 
The documentation says:If the readline module was loaded, then input() will use it to provide elaborate line editing and history features.In your example, you haven't loaded the  module.  Compare the behavior of this:To this:The second example will behave as you expect (readline support is active, arrow keys work, etc) while the first example will not have readline support.On the command line, this would be:
I use linux too and for any module you have to import it.For example for the readline module I have to doThis applies to all modules even the os or sys module I have to doHowever this only applies to modules that you installed correctly. If you installed readline incorrectly not evenwill work.That means for you if you are doing it straight from the console and this applies to not only readline but every other module that you have and will get.
