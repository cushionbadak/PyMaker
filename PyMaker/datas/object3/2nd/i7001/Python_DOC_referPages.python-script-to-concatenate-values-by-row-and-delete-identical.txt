Natural Text
I am using python 2.7, and I have a text file that looks like this:I am trying to get an ouput that looks like this:Much appreciated!

The simplest solution would be to use  and . If you don't care about order you could also use s instead of .Result:In case you want to write it to another file just concatenate what I printed with  and  it to a file.
I think this could also work, although the other answer seems more sophisticated:You end up with a dictionary similar to what you requested.
