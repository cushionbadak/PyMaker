I have a small python (2.7) script that works with several threads. One of the threads will read a global list and post an https post request for each one of the entries of this list.For doing that I saw that the best way is to use python requests module. I have installed it with pip (no problem with that, it is placed in ...Python/2.7/site-packages/requests/...), but, when I import this module in my script, I get an error.I have created another script with just one line (import requests) to reproduce the error, and I get this:Python 2.7.10MacBook Pro with macOS Sierra (v 10.12)Am I doing something wrong? Didn't I installed the module in the proper way?
