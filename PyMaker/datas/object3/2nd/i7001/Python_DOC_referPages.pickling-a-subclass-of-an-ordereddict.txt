The following statements:Lead to this error:But work fine with a plain  rather than . I know in this case I don't need the , but this problem is preventing from using the multiprocessing module with a more complex subclass of  where other arguments are stored as attributes and I can't avoid having it. (I used python 3.4.6).
 overwrites  and you need to override it if you overwrite the  or  method and/or want to store additional attributes.In your case you made the argument for  mandatory (it isn't mandatory for  or ) so you need to override :This can now be pickled without problems:However if you want attributes that aren't set in your  this won't work correctly yet:To make that work you need to change the above mentioned  function as well to return a third argument. For example you could simply return the :With this the above example will work correctly.A lot of the design depends on how you want your subclass to behave. In some cases it would be better to pass the items via the second argument (the one that is passed to ). As to how you set your attributes: Sometimes it's enough to use  but in other cases it would be safer/better to use . You should definitely read the documentation of the  module and check which approach is best for you.
