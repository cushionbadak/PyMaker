Natural Text
I would like to add code formatting to a reference like this:My  defines  like this:so the link is to https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#slots ( is defined in the  section of )My goal is to format the rendered link in the style of  or similar rather than the default text style with which  renders.None of the following options work: yeilds output like...  ... yeilds output like... __slots__ ... yeilds output like... :ref:```__slots__`` <python:slots>` ...There are two separate internal links to  in this case. yeilds output like... :ref:` ``__slots__`` <python:slots>` ...Relpacing  with  or  either inside or outside the  does not help any either. In fact, it appears that nested roles are not allowed at all.I would like to have an inline role that results in something that renders with a code style and a link, like...  ...How do I get the basic  (or equivalent) to appear with the code-style formatting used by ?I am using Sphinx 1.6.3 with Python 3.6.2 in an Anaconda environment.Inverse question is here: Sphinx remove code formatting from custom code referenceA tangentially relevant question: Nested / Compounded roles: apply multiple roles to overlapping text
The  role does what you want:This is a "convenience role" that looks for cross-reference targets in the current domain as well as targets that work with .The Python domain has several specific cross-reference roles, for different types of objects.
