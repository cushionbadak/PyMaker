I have a KML file with the following structure:I want to get all the coordinates inside the coordinates tag, either into a list or into a list of lists (one for each folder).As a start, I wrote the following code:But it returns an empty list. If I try to get only the Folder names, with the code below:I also get an empty string. Why the heck doesn't the parser find the Folder tag? Any hints?Thanks in advance for any assistance you can provide.
Your root is  node not  node as you assumeWhen you do  you grab  node. In this case if you just change your code to include  as child node of root it should work.Actually only line to change should be this:
In fact, I found a fine solution here: https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/89543/get-points-from-a-kml-linestring.Modyfing my code accordingly:I have been able to retrieve all the coordinate data.Other possible solutions (not tested) can also be found here: https://programmingadvent.blogspot.com.br/2013/06/kmzkml-file-parsing-with-python.html and here: http://gsp.humboldt.edu/olm_2016/courses/GSP_318/04_3_2_Parsing_XML.htmlBest regards,
