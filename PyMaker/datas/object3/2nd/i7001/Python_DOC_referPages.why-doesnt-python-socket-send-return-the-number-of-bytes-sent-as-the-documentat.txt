According to the docs, Python's :Returns the number of bytes sent.However, when I use it, it seems to return the byte that was last sent, not the total number of bytes sent.  Consider this code:This SO post seems related, though it doesn't answer my question.What I'm expecting to see is  for every line.Solved:I got it.  This works:The reason I put  in there to begin with is because without it you get:
As the docs for  say, if the argument is an integer, then it creates a bytearray of that size.https://docs.python.org/3.1/library/functions.html#byteshttps://docs.python.org/3.1/library/functions.html#bytearrayMaybe this is what you meant to do?But even then  returns .
The confusion is how Python 2.x and Python 3.x use the  function.In Python3,  will evaluate to a 100 byte binary array filled in with zero. (API docs)This must be the version of Python you're running as this behavior is consistent with your output.In Python2,  will evaluate to .It converts the integer into a string and then assigns the bytearray to that value.Doing  on it shows that it is actually the same as the built-in object . So in Python2  behaves the same as .Also in your examples, even according to your expected Python2 behavior, the return value would not always be .It would be the length of the string, which would be the same as the number of digits in the integer, e.g.  for the case of .
