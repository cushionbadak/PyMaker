I am getting the classic codex encoding error: from the following code: the initial dataframe comes from an excel file, where the column contains both strings, special chars, and hyperlinks. I was having initial problems with this line until i added astype(str). However, further down in the code it threw the this error. My question is how do i encode to a better codex when I am having to use the str.contains function? Given the documentation on the basics of this issue, the key is to drop the str part and add encode. However, because I am using the pandas function contains, its not really possible to "just drop the str".I could create create a mapping, but I was wondering if there is a cleaner answer. Note: i did try using encode utf-8 and latin in every possible position in the above code line.
You can double str a pandas line.
