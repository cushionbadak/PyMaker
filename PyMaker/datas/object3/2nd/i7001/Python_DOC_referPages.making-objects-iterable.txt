I'm trying to iterate over each row in a list of lists, append an element from each row to a new list, then find the unique elements in the new list.I understand that I can do this easily with a for loop. I'm trying a different route because I want to learn more about classes and functions.Here's an example of the list of lists. The first row is the header:Here's my code:I get the following error:I think the answer is to try to create a method using  in my  class, but I haven't been able to get this to work. Is this the right track? If not, what's a better one?
According to the documentation for :This method should return a new iterator object that can iterate over all the objects in the container.You might try the following class definition:If you're open to trying new options, consider using Pandas:Or, if you really want to read in the CSV yourself,
As you mentioned, you'll need to implement  in . Note that this is actually the  call that's throwing the error, since it iterates through your class to enumerate the set elements.Luckily your set elements are likely just , which makes this easy to write .I would point out, however, that your  function seems a little too specialized to be top-level. It's also a bit trivial, since it's literally . I would put this in  as well.
you need to change a little
