A string contains digits split by '-' or '_', how can I get every digits in the string? I expect the output is [(1,2,3,4),(2,3,4)], but it gives [('1', '4'), ('2', '4')]
You're already using findall, so you can simplify your regex to this:In your full example you'll getThis returnsNow, if you are going to throw letters in the mix, you might as well go super simple and extract all the numbers:That will give youBut obviously, that's a different match than taking - and _ into account

It's unlikely this can be done in a single step, which requires capturing variable numbers of group at the same time; You could try this instead:
It is still not absolutely clear what the variations of the input string might be, but, given the sample string from the question, you can extract the digits this way:split by two consecutive non-digit characters ( - where  would match a non-digit character) using extract numbers from every matchDemo:
