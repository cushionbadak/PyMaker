I've read the  docs and i am trying to make a program that takes command line arguments and passes those values to variables like so:When I statically assign these values within my program it works, however I am unable to get argpase to pass strings into variables regardless of if the destination is a list or a single string.This works:This runs silently and does not work or generate an error or write a log file:
it worked for me :python ssh.py -u admin -p password -l '192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.2' -c 'uname -a',whoamioutput:note 1: you can replace -username  with -u in my code then you should type :  python ssh.py --username (and the other options)note2: you used (192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.2) and (uname -a) because there is a space in ips and (-a) in (uname -a) your program has issue to fix it you have 2 way :  1) remove space use (uname-a) or (192.168.1.1,192.168.1.2)2) use quotes ('192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.2') instead of (192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.2)
There are several problems with this code, and with how you've used it.The long option should be specified with two hyphens:Each option only populates one value in , so you shouldn't try to unpack two.  Try this instead:Values are separated on the command line by spaces, not commas, so use this:Values on the command line that have spaces in them will be split on whitespace and interpreted as separate values ("words").  To force them to be interpreted as separate words, enclose them in quotes:Alternatively, you can escape the spaces with backslashes:
Thanks everyone! Now it seems to be working correctly: 
I guess you may find your answer in the MOTW article dedicated to .I am not very experienced using this module, but from what I understand you should be using something like:
