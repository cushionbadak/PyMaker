This question already has an answer here:How to cleanly loop over two files in parallel in Python                    4 answers                I have 2 text files with data in it, and i want a loop where it goes through 1st line of each text files simultaneously then 2nd then 3rd. So i used a inner 'for' loop for both of them but it isn't looping like i want it to be instead it loops with 1st line of 1st text file with all lines in 2nd text file then 2nd line from 1st file with all lines from 2nd file. i have tried everything but none works.if i use break statement like below it start using all lines one by one of 1st text file with same 1st line of 2nd text file but if i remove that break statement then it will select same 1st line of 1st text file but with all lines of 2nd text file. here is my code:
You can do this: You can find more information about zip here.  If the files have different lengths, use itertools.zip_longest. So, you would do it like this: 
I would use only 1  loop, and a line counter.If the files are reasonably small, you can read the data using , so you do not have to , then get the minimum number of lines of the two files, and then read them one by one.Something like this:
