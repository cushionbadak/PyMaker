I have a list that looks something like this:I need to count the number of identical co-ordinates lists and return the count, 4 in this case. So far I have tried:Using which I get the most occurring element in each list. But my intention is to get a list if it's occurrence is more than 3.Expected Output:Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.
You can use  for that task:1) The inner s are converted to s because  builds a  and s being not hashable cannot be used as s.
