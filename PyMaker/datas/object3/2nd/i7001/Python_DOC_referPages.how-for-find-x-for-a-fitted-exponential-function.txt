The above code finds x values for y=50 successfully. But when I try to do the same for the fitted exponential function, I can't understand how to do that.if I add *popt then I getI assume that I need to add x value, but it's the value I'm trying to find... Anyway, adding some value instead of x, leads to another error:
I guess you need to pass  function with optimized parameters to  (i.e. with a, b and c args set to values obtained from ). In order to do so you can use functools.partial function:What we did here is basically made a new function  by partially fixing ,  and  args of your original function to be  (what's exactly why it called partial).
