When I run this program, i get the error, ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '', I feel like it's to do with the int and str conversions but I'm really not too sure, any help appreciated :)    
The bit that was tripping you up was the slice notation, as noted by others.  Here's a version that seems to do what you want:Note how the start and end positions match up.
I would rather put this in a comment but don't have enough reps, so here goes.Firstly, array slicing in Python requires you to give the numbers in a format , where a is the index of the first character you want to get and b is the index of the character upto but  NOT including which you want to get your characters, so variable MM should be .Next, to check whether something qualifies your "DDMMYY" requirement, you should probably be using )) because anyone can enter random text and get away with it if you use the str() function to convert it into a string (because I believe you are looking for integral input)Also, as mentioned in one of the comments, try putting  in the  part instead of the  part.So code will look like this:
You can use the  module to do what you want quite efficiently.This results in the usage of: is quite powerful, especially the provided , for parsing dates, and  for providing various outputs. I'd advise you to read the documentation if you plan on working with input, output and dates.  is easily extensible to more complex tasks with dates.If you're using Python2, change  to .I've also removed your  statement - it seemed to be checking MM against the definition of MM. Note that  is unecessary as you can use the power of . I've changed your  loop to just use control flow statement, rather than a variable.Also a general tip: use  or  for variables, as  is generally reserved for classes.
