I tried to make a code that would react if the input is integer or float, and if its float it would restart if the person wants it to; but the command 'break' doesnt want to work for some reason please help... (make it simple please)
You just need to wrap your code with a  loop.    
To use a break, you need it to be in a loop (while, for, ...). A break stop the execution of the loop if it's condition is met. In your casse you only have ifs, so you don't need a break as it will not check the other conditions if the first one is met.
You need to use a while loop.Set the answer to y so the loop runs at least once.If the user wants to try again they enter y and the condition will be true meaning the loop wil run again.Hope this helped!
