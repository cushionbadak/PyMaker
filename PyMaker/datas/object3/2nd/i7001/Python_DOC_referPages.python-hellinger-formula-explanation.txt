I was looking up some formulas for Hellinger's distance between distributions, and I found one (in Python) that I've never seen similar format for. I am confused how it works.I've never seen this kind of... format before. They are dividing by a for statement? I mean.. how does this even work?
I have a faible for distance measures, hence I made a notebook with some implementations of Hellinger distance. Regarding your question, the construct is called a list comrehension and the backslash is just for line continuation.Here is a possible listing without list comprehension:
