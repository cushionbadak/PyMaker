Was using the shorthand for if/else statements, and that works fine by the way.Was trying to omit the else part but got error!
Perhaps you can use:It gives you the same boolean output though, True/False.
No, the  part cannot be omitted, because an expression always has to produce a value, and a conditional expression is no exception here. Without the , what would  be set to otherwise?If you only want to set  if the condition is true, just use a regular  statement:Note that the  comparison operator already produces a boolean value, so the first expression can be simplified to:
You cannot use the conditional expression (the short-hand you are talking about) without an .Every expression in python needs to return something , this includes the conditional expression . But without the  part Python would not know what to return in case when the condition fails.
You are trying to use a conditional expression here but that’s simply not how it works. The syntax there requires the use of . It’s more like the ternary  operator in other languages.If you want to execute a statement conditionally, you have to use a normal if block:You can put that in a single line here (not recommended though)If you also want to change  to  if the condition is not true, then you best assign the result to the variable directly:And if you don’t want to overwrite ’s old value if the condition is not true, you can also do the following using Python’s  operator:This is then equivalent to the if statement above.
