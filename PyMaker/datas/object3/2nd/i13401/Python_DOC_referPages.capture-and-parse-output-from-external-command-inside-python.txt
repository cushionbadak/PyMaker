You have two questions. Pun only one question per StackOverflow question. This   addresses only the first one.To capture the stdout or stderr output from a program you can use subprocess.check_output()."Run command with arguments and return its output."Example:  When you have the output available you can ask the question how to parse it, and what you want to do with the parsed data.
