From PEP 435 on subclassing enums the following is allowed:Say I want to define  in a different manner for the  and  enums.Is there a better way to do that than something like:That looks clunky to me. 
No, there isn't.I mean, you might be able to do something like this:Or like this:But unless  etc. already exist, this may not be significantly better than what you have now (though you might be able to save a level or two of indentation, I suppose).  You can use lambdas here, but that gets ugly quite fast, and I don't recommend it except in the simplest of cases (which can often be handled with  anyway).As discussed in the comments, you can do something like this:This is rather ugly, in my opinion, but it should work in all reasonable situations, including expressions like  or .  However, it may confuse static type checkers and/or linters.
