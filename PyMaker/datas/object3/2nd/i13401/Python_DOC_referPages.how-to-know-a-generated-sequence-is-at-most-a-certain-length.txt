I want to know whether a generated sequence has fewer than 2 entries.My inefficient method is to create a list, and measure its length:Obviously, this consumes the whole generator.In my real case the generator could be traversing a large network. I want to do the check without consuming the whole generator, or building a large list.There's a recipe in the itertools documentation:This only builds a list of max length , which is better.So I could say:Is there an even more pythonic, efficient way to do it?
As of Python 3.4, generators can implement a length hint. If a generator implements this it'll be exposed through the  method.You can test for it with the  function.If it is not available, your only option is to consume elements, and your use of the  recipe is the most efficient way to do that:
The solution using  uses , builds a list and takes the length of it:To avoid creating the list we can use :This takes about 70% of the time:Wrapping it up:
