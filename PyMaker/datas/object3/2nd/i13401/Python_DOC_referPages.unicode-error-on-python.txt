So I'm trying to make a table with a csv table that has unicode characters in it:I get this error every time i try to run my program, though:How do I fix this?
Assuming you're using Python2:Of course, when you open the csv file, you will also need to decode it using the same encoding:(NB: if you used Python3, none of this would be necessary - your original example would work fine as it is).
First of all you don't need to use a list comprehension for write in csv file, secondly if you are using  you can use  module to open your file with a proper encoding and if you are using python 3.X you can use  argument in  function.Also note that since the  method used your default encoding if still you got unicode error you can use  method in  method.Python 2.X:Python 3.X :
