Is there a way to use Python 3 shutil to copy a read-only file so that the destination file does NOT receive the source file's read-only mode?I'm successfully using shutil to create a working copy of a file:But shutil has also copied the input file's read-only attribute along with the file contents. I don't want that.Obviously I can repeat the os.chmod command after the copy operation. And I know how to create a writeable copy without using shutil. But is it possible to use shutil to copy a file's contents without also copying its attributes(?)
Open the files however you like and use  to copy just the file contents from one to the other.
On my linux box with python 2.7 & python3  seems to work as well.
