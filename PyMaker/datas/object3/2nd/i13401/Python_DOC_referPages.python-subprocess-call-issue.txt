When I run the following in Python 3.2.3 in Linux it does nothing...However if I run it in the terminal it works...I haven't had an issue with using subprocess.call before. Just seems to be this one. I'm running as a superuser so it's not a sudo thing, and I've also tried putting an r in front of the string to make it a raw string.Any ideas? Thanks.
A subprocess (shell in this case) can't (normally) modify its parent environment.To set the local timezone for the script and its children in Python (on Unix):If you want to modify the environment for a single command then you could pass  parameter:
Export modifies the environment of the shell.When you run it through subprocess, a new shell is created, the environment modified and then immediately destroyed.When you run it in a shell, it modifies the environment of that shell so you can see the effect.
