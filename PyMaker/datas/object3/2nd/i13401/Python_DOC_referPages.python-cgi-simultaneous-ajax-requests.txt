So here's the deal : I'm writing a simple lightweight IRC app, hosted locally, that basically does the same job as Xchat and works in your browser, just as Sabnzbd. I display search results in the browser as an html table, and using an AJAX GET request with an on_click event, the download is launched. I use another AJAX GET request in a 1 second loop to request the download information (status, progress, speed, ETA, etc.). I hit a bump with the simultaneous AJAX requests, since my CGI handler seems to only be able to handle one thread at a time : indeed, the main thread processes the download, while requests for download status are sent too.Since I had a Django app somewhere, I tried implementing this IRC app and everything works fine. Simultaneous requests are handled properly.So is there something I have to know with the HTTP handler ? Is it not possible with the basic CGI handle to deal with simultaneous requests ?I use the following for my CGI IRC app :If it's not about theory but about my code, I can gladly post various python scripts if it helps.
A little bit deeper into the documentation:These four classes process requests synchronously; each request must be completed before the next request can be started.TL;DR: Use a real web server.
So, after further research, here's my code, whick works :
