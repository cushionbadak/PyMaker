Data File 1:data_20150801.csvData File 2data2_20150801.csvId like to merge those 2 .csv Files, to get a File That looks like:so basically I need to copy the Rows from data2_ and insert them at the right time points in data_I tried it manually with Notepad ++ but the Problem is, that sometimes there's no entry for one Minute in data2_ so I'd need to check where the missing TimeStep is and skip that point manually. I did some things in Python but I'm still a noob so I lack the experience on how to start tackling a problem like this?I'm using a mac and I found that cat command that combines .csv files in a Folder to one cvs file --> is there a way to do this line by line conserving the timestamps?
You could use Python Pandas to do this quite easily, but its probably an overengineering:I havent had the chance to test this code but it should do what you want, you may need to modify commas for tabs (depending on the file), etc.
Not being a Python expert, I would use two dictionaries, using the date-time stamp as key and a list for the other columns as data.Load one file into one dictionary, and the other file into the other. Then it's pretty simple to merge the two dictionaries using keys that are the same in both.As for reading the files, there is a standard  module that you can use.
Considering the solution that proposed the use of Pandas, I would add "index=False" on the to_csv line, turning it out inThis will remove the index column.
