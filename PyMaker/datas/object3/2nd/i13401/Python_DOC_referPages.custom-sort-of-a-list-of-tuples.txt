I only started learning Python few days ago, and I wanted to implement my little project in it. I need to sort a list of  in a descending order by the number value, but alphabetically if the number is the same for more than one tuple. So I have a list, say:This returns:But what I want to get is:In Java I just implemented a comparator for a custom tuple:But I'm not sure how to go about doing that in a  expression in Python.
Perhaps the simplest way would be have  return a tuple and multiply the score by -1. For example:This will sort the integers in descending order and then the strings in ascending order.
You can just sort based on negative shape of the number and don't use the  :
Another option is to sort them twice using operator module function . We first sort by the first element in ascending order and then sort by the second element in descending order(though this is less efficient).
