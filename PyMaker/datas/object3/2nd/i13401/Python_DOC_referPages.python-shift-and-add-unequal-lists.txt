I searched a lot about my specific case but failed to get any solutions.I need to shift B until a ends and add element to element. I wish to add these two list and store in C.NOTE : Any value in result list which is greater than max value of A should start from 1.I want output as:How should i code to get this working?
You can use itertools.cycle to create the cycle object of  and zip it with  and then loop over the pairs to calculate the sum of pairs under the condition :Demo :
You can also do that by List Comprehension:Output:
This uses  to repeat the lists,  to create lists of pairs,  to generate up to the longest list, and  to sum the pairs. It "wraps" to  (does not "Start from beginning of A" as in the comments) and because of this assumes zero will not appear in C.
