I have to print elements in a stack using classes and all:for some reason instead of printing [4,3,2,1]it print None
Your class does not define  or  method, so  uses the default representation.  If you want instances of  to be printed as lists, add the following definition to your class:
Stask class using built-insUsing lists as stack https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#using-lists-as-stacksThe list methods make it very easy to use a list as a stack, where the last element added is the first element retrieved (“last-in, first-out”). To add an item to the top of the stack, use append(). To retrieve an item from the top of the stack, use pop() without an explicit indexIf you have to provide custom interface for adding elements in stack you can add single method like this:Printing objectsHow  function behave?Lets look at documentation about  function https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#printAll non-keyword arguments are converted to strings like str() does and written to the stream, separated by sep and followed by end.What  function really does?If neither encoding nor errors is given, str(object) returns , which is the “informal” or nicely printable string representation of object. For string objects, this is the string itself. If object does not have a  method, then str() falls back to returning .This means that you  have to support  method, and if it has no such  will be used. Look at  docs if you didn't believe my words https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#reprA class can control what this function returns for its instances by defining a repr() method.Also read this answers, which describe my thoughts in different manner:Difference between __str__ and __repr__ in Python will explain practical use casesDifference between __str__ and __repr__ in Python will explain meaning of each methodSummary
See the line,  append the value and  returns . So you end up printing Your  works, because unlike , it returns a value.So, change the function definition like that:
