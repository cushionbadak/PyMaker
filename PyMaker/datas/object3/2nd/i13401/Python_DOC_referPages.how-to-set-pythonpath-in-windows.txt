I tried to run a .py file by typing  in the command prompt of windows 10. It then saidFrom what I saw through a google search, the solution may be to change the  env variable. However, I had  set to  for both the user and system variables, but I still get the same error in the command promptI also read http://bugs.python.org/issue11288, and tried to change all  system variable which originally pointed to  and changed it to  but that didn't solve the problemI then followed https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#python-launcher-for-windows, but when I type  it says , but for  I get a popup saying  and also,  says , but changing  to  gives the same error I said beforeEven if I set  AND  user variables to , along with the  system variable to , but the error was the same as before
For some reason by typing only the "py" file name in the command prompt it worked for me. So I typed myScript.py  and it ran correctly. Before this I typed "python myScript.py" and it produced the same error that you experienced. I have the environment variables set  and . I hope this helps.
