Trying to get this to post the following 3 lines as a result.  Nothing more, nothing less.The product of the numbers  through  is: The product of the first  numbers divisible by  is: The product of the numbers  through  is: Start is where the sequence starts, number is where it ends, and space is the space between the numbers ( is every number,  is even numbers only, etc).I am a beginner to this, and need some assistanceThis is what I have s far, but I'm not sure what to define findproduct as.  I was thinking something along the lines of making a loop and setting  to  but I still have no idea where to take this:
 gets you the numbers you need given the ,  and . Your s appear to be inclusive (where  is exclusive on ) so you'd need to adjust, but that's not too hard:That gets you the set of numbers you want the product of. You can do this the obvious way with an accumulator loop:or get clever with built-ins to one-line it (ignoring imports at the top of the file):The spelled out loop has some mild advantages; you could add a test to it for  and break out of the loop early should that occur; if a zero appears anywhere in the input, you're not going to end up with a non-zero product anyway. Of course, in Python 3, where  is a more powerful object, you could pre-check for 0 in the  and avoid the work even more efficiently:
