As I am using Python 2.6 I am trying to create custom Enum class. What I need is to store string with the enum object. Something like:The problem is that my 'Parameters' class is not iterable...From another file I need to be able to iterate among PARAMs:Unfortunately, for my solution I have error: .
Above will not work because  is class and it is not iterable. and  are class variables in above case.We have to do something like this:[Edit 1]:Create number of objects by for loop with range function code:[Edit 2]:Get values from the User by  function and type conversion from the string to integerDemo: Note:use  in Python 2.xuse  in Python 3.x[Edit 3]: Hardcode values by Instance variables method.Define class in  file Import  class in  fileOutput:
Use the backported  module (documentation):which prints:Parameters.PARAM1 = (0, 'some msg 1')Parameters.PARAM2 = (1, 'some msg 2')
