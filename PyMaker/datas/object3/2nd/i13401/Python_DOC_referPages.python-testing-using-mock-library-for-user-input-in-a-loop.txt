I am trying to use mock library for testing a piece of the code. In this code, the user raw input is accepted in a for loop as shown below. I have written the test case  that can feed a single user input value for the tray number. But, for every iteration within the for loop, it just takes this same value (5) as expected.  Question is: How to feed different values for each iteration? for example, specific values of 5, 6, and 7 for the tray numbers for i=0, 1 and 2 respectively. 
You can use the  parameter with an iterable to provide return values:See the docs:If side_effect is an iterable then each call to the mock will return the next value from the iterable.
Turns out I was reinventing the wheel. Use the  parameter instead. Leaving a modified version of this here anyway, in case somebody wants to do something fancy.To use a different function instead use the  keyword argument of however this means that values are entirely random, which is not desirable for a test because it means the test is not deterministic and can fail or not entirely by chance. Additionally you may want the input() function to emit generated non-random values, such as a sequence of commands or similar. For this, I think the easiest way would be a generator function.
