I don't think that they're functions, and I can't use  to get an answer (it will raise an error).What are they called? Could I define something similar?
 and  are statements. They are not objects, so they don't have a type. Statements form the syntax of the language, objects form the datamodel the syntax operates on.See the Simple Statements reference page for their documentation. There are also Compound Statements; statements that contain groups of more statements. Because both  and  are statements, their names are also reserved keywords, which means you cannot use them to create identifiers. All words used in statements are keywords*, but not all keywords are (part of) statements.You cannot define your own statements in Python itself, you'd have to extend the language implementation itself (so extend the Python grammar, tokenizer, parser, AST model and interpreter).* with the current exception being the words  and  which are temporarily not keywords outside of coroutines to help transition existing code to Python 3.5; making them keywords now would potentially break too much existing code that doesn't yet use coroutines anyway. See the PEP 492 transition plan; the plan is to make them keywords in Python 3.7.
