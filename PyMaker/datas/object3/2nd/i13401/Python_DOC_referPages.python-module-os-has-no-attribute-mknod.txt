I want to create a new file in Python for that I am using  command, but getting error as:I am using windows and attributes other than  are working.
 offers functionality that is closely related to the OS you're using. If most other attributes can be accessed from  (meaning you haven't got a  file in the current dir masking the standard module) an  will 99% signal an unsupported function on your Operating System.This is what the case is with  on Windows. Creating named pipes in  has, as far as I can understand, very different semantics.Either way, if you are trying to use  to create named pipes you'd probably be better using  (again, only  supported) . If you're using it to create ordinary files, don't, use  which is portable.
