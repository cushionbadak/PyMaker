I'm finding that python is modifying my path in problematic ways -- in particular, it's pre-pending the path to my github development folder, which results in the wrong libraries being loaded. In my terminal session, if I run  I get:Which is perfect. But when I launch python from that same terminal session (either as  or ) and check my PATH from within python, I'm getting:Where are these coming from and how do I stop them?Thanks!
 has nothing to do with the Python module search path; that environment variable is used by your shell to find executables, instead.You need to look at the  variable here.If that variable doesn't contain your extra elements, start Python with the  command line switch to disable loading ; it may be that the extra elements are set by a  file. Also see the  module documentation:A path configuration file is a file whose name has the form  and exists in one of the four directories mentioned above; its contents are additional items (one per line) to be added to . 
While  seems like it may be used by Python, what you actually want to look at is your  -- which is used by the import machinery and logic.You should look into using ironments to control the pathing of Python module lookups.
