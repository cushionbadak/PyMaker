Have the user guess a number but give hints when there wrong as shown below. Need help fixing errors and actually having it output information as for is giving blanks and errors. Thanks.
Try these following codes:If you want to return some string, you don't need use  function. can't be use like that. For more infoPython need indent right? :)If you define a function, you should call it like . For more info
Your else statements are unnecessary and don't know if you pasted your code wrong, but your spacing is all off. Also, you are returning a string but never printing it so that is why you are never seeing it. You want to put a print before calling your function. The following code works:
Ok, I fixed a few things: Instead of using  , try elif instead, as it's a lot less confusing.And also, the indentation in the example you game was off, which made it all the more difficult to read. Try copying and pasting the code into the question box, then highlighting it, and pressing the  button.
you forgot to catch and print the return string. Be very careful about indentation in python 
To make your code more "pythonic" the function can be written as: is a comparisaion function it returns ,  or  depeding if the first argument is smaller, equal or bigger than the second. This value can then be used as an index for the tuple. On  and  it will return the first or second item (indexes start at 0 not at 1). Negative indexes are counted from the end backwards, so  is the last item. Using this you can just put in the return value for  as the last item.Additionally I corrected your indentation (should be 4 spaces) and the functions name to fit the typical Python coding style.
