I am new on python (and even programing!), so I will try to be as clear as I can to explain my question. For you guys it could be easy, but I have not found a satisfactory result on this yet.Here is the problem:I have an array with both negative and positive values, say:I would like to sum ONLY the negative values that are continuous, i.e. only sum(-1, -6, -6), sum(-5, -2, -1, -4) and so on. I have tried using numpy.where, as well as numpy.split based on the condition.For example: However, as you can expect, I just got the summation of all negative values in the array instead. In this case  sum(-1, -6, -6, -5, -5, -2, -1, -4)Could guys share with me an aesthetic and efficient way to solve this problem? I will appreciate any response on this.Thank you very much  
Here's a vectorized NumPythonic solution -You can also use  to get , like so -You can also get the count of negative numbers in each "island" with a little tweak to existing code -Sample run -
You can use  module, here with using  you can grouping your items based on those sign then check if it meet the condition in  function so it is contains negative numbers then yield the sum else yield it and at last you can use  function to chain the result :Or as a more pythonic way use a list comprehension :
you can flag negative values .... and do this with plain pythonoutputprint(temp)[-1, -6, -6, -5, -2, -1, -4]with intertools i would do just thatsum of negatives -25 number of summed 7
