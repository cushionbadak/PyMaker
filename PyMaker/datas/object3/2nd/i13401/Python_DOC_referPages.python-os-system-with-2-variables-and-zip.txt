Sry, my english skills are very low.My problem :I want start a EXE with the "os.system" function.It works...So...now. This Code starts the Python EXE and starts my TEST GUI.But what is to do...when the "TEST GUI.py" is in a ZIP File ?I want to start the Python.exe with the "TESTGUI.py".I dont wanna extract the zip file before.
You can import Python modules from a zip file as if it was a directory.For example, if you have  inside  (just one file, no folders - a simplest case):you can call it with single shell call as follows:Let me explain it line by line: - call Python with a piece of code as an argument - import necessary packages - this is where magic happens. ZIP file can be added to  just like an ordinary folder! - since Python now sees TEST_GUI.py via  environment variable, we can import it. - we call the  function, and it does whatever we want.Using  for the same script is straightforward:However, I recommend you to get rid of  and use subprocess module instead.
This can be done by including a file in the zip archive which acts as the entry point to your program.  For example given that creatfile.py contains:and contains:Then, after putting them in writefile.zip, running causes test1.txt to be created in the current working directory with 'hello world' written to it.Showing this in IPython:
