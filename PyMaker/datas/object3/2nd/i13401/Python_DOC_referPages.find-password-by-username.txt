I already have this code. Now I want to change the code, that when someone types in his username, he has to fill in the right password which belongs to the username.So when the username is ''John'' then I want only the password which belongs to "John" as the right password.
I am supposing your csv will be like this:Just one note before the solution. You are importing the CSV module of Python and you did not use it in your code, such a silly import, just use it.The solution is simple In this way you only read the file once and you will use the CSV Module.I'm supposing the format of your CSV if it is another format is easy to change the implementation of this solution. If you need some help with the CSV Module the documentation is here, for python2 and python3Explanation of what you are doing wrong.When you do the following sentence:You are opening the file, read all the file then split the file by  character, with this you would obtain the following list  and the last step you do there, is select the second element with , the result of this would be the string . But the statement does not finish here, there is another split that would give you the list .So you are comparing that the username is admin or is in the list . The same happens when you try to compare the password, but this time you select the third element.
