What's the motivation behind having my unit test classes inherit from , rather than object Does it matter if I'm using Nose (or PyTest) instead of ?
If you don't inherit from , the testing framework won't know that you want those classes to be test cases.  So when you try to run your tests, nothing will happen!
Inheriting from unittest.TestCase lets you use method like:setUp / tearDown to prepare the testsasssertEquals and many more assertionsWhen you use pytest, you can write tests directly as functions (no need to subclass anything). You can achieve the same set up / tear down pattern by using fixtures, and write assertions using the assert statement since  features a powerful assertion introspection.nose also provide similar features (test functions with a with_setup decorator).
