I was messing around just trying to make a script that deletes items by ".zip" extension.Whenever I run the script I get:cities1000.zip is obviously a file in my downloads folder.What did I do wrong here?  Is the issue that os.remove requires the full path to the file?  If this is the issue, than how can I do that in this current script without completely rewriting it.
You can set the path in to a  variable, then use  for your .
For this operation you need to append the file name on to the file path so the command knows what folder you are looking into.You can do this correctly and in a portable way in python using the  command.For example:
Alternate approach that avoids join-ing yourself over and over: Use  module to join once, then let it give you back the paths directly.
Prepend the directory to the filenameEDIT: or change the current working directory using .
The dirname is not included in the os.listdir output.  You have to attach it to reference the file from the list returned by said function.
