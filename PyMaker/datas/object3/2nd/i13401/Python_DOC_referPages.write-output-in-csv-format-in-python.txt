I have written a Python script to scrape some products, so far i am able to get everything i need but i am stuck at how to save these values in csv.Here is my Python code:and please do tell me how to improve my code, I am pretty new to python. Before i wrote this script i used scrappy which was very fast (took 1 minute to do all) but I want to use python-3 (which takes at least 5-7 minutes). Though time is not the main issue. Saving elements in csv is important.
Use the  library.
As an alternative to csv, you could always download pandas... populate the dictionary ...granted there are existing solutions that don't require you to download anything, but I certainly find pandas convenient, and it's particularly handy at organizing data quickly :^)
