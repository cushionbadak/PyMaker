Suppose I have two lists:Now, c will contain values of the sum of a_ and b_Get the 5 largest elements in cAnd then return what a_ and b_ indices generated those largest sums.My idea was to track something like So, the question is to what indices of a_ and b_ returns the k largest a_+b_.And then search for largest a_+b_But I am wondering if there is a better way to do this.ThanksEdit: The answer to above is:5 and so on
A brute force method
Using , you can keep the original indices of each element.  You would then need to specify the key to be the result of the sum.The below will generate a list of tuples, which contains a's index, b's index, and the sum in that order.
Based on @donkopotamus's code, but should require far less memory, and less CPU time as well if the inputs lists  and  are sufficiently large. It's just using generator expressions and  for the purpose they were made for:
