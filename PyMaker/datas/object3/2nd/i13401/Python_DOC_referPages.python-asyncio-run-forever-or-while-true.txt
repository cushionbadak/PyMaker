Should I replace  in my code (without asyncio) or should I use asyncio event loop to accomplish the same result.Currently I work on some kind "worker" that is connected to zeromq, receive some data and then performs some request (http) to external tool(server). Everything is written in normal blocking IO. Does it makes sense to use asyncio event loop to get rid of ?In future it might be rewritten fully in asyncio, but now I'm afraid to start with asyncio.i'm new with asyncio and not all part of this library are clear for me :)Thx :)
If you want to start writing asyncio code with a library that doesn't support it, you can use BaseEventLoop.run_in_executor. This allows you to submit a callable to a ThreadPoolExecutor or a ProcessPoolExecutor and get the result asynchronously. The default executor is a thread pool of 5 threads. Example:
