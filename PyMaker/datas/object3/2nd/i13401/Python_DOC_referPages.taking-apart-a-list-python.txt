If I have a list like:How would I write code in python that takes this list and finds the number of consecutive positive numbers and then makes a list that has lists of each of those consecutive numbers in it.for example this example of x would return a number 4 and it would also return:I wrote this to find all the zeros but I do not know where to go from there: 
You do not need to find out the indices of zeroes before-hand. You can simply keep another temporary list holding the values that are positive (greater than 0) since the last time 0 was encountered. And then when you encounter a 0 , append that temporary list to the result list, and change that temporary list to a new list. Example -Demo -
There is no need to fine the zeros. You can simply loop over your list and put the positive numbers in a temporary list until you encounter with a zero, but as a more pythonic approach for such tasks you can use itertools.groupby :If you want to do it without  module you can use following function which works based on preceding explanation and yields the temp list every time it encounter a zero, and at last returns a generator contains list of positive numbers which you can convert it to a list by calling the  function :Demo:
