I have a small class which is as follows :I have a parameter variable which can be only M or F.To ensure it is only that, I do the following :Now I have a class which contains all the States in USA as follows:Like the example above,my parameter now is AL.However, since there are 50 states in the USA,I cannot practically use the tuple with 50 variables like I used above.Is there a better way of doing this ? I did read about isinstance but it did not give me the expected results.
You could use the  property which composes a class, for example:Or as you're searching for the values use :As Peter Wood points out, the  built-in can also be used to retrieve the :The  property is used as a namespace for classes and so will return all methods, magic methods and private properties on the class as well, so for robustness you might want to modify your search slightly to compensate.In your case, you might want to use a ,  such as:UpdateThis clearly answer's the OPs question, but readers may also be interested in the  library in Python 3, which would quite possibly be a better container for data such as this.
Why don't you use a dictionary? Its a lot simpler and lookups will be easier as well.
I would suggest using Enum to define both  and .Enum if part of the standard library on . If you are on  use enum34, install with .  Then you can check if a variable is one of the states by
