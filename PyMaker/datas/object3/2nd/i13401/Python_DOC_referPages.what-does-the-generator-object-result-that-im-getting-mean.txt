I have 2 lists:I want to do the following math to it:Multiply  by  (the corresponding values from  and ), and multiply  by  (corresponding values also). I want to do that under condition that values at position  in each corresponding tuple is idential so  ==  etc. Obviously, we do the same math for remaning tuples as well. My code:Generates however some object:Can you help me fix the code?  
You need to use  or  to convert that generator expression to a  or :Working version of your code:
Considering that your  and  are defined as follows.The following list comprehension may be useful.
There are 2 issues to look at.The original code will generate the error:and  message is mentioned.     1) Let's fix the the code with minimum amount of changes by creating list comprehension:2) In the original code, the bracket after   is misplaced. If we place that bracket after the  instead of list comprehension we get generator expression. And that will cause the  message: In terms of syntax, the only difference is that one uses parenthesis instead of square brackets.Note: If needed, there are two ways to convert a generator object to the list:2a) Use asterisk (*) operator to unpack object to the list2b) Use explicitly
