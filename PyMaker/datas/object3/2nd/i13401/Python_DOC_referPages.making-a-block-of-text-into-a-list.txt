Natural Text
I am writing a Python script that enumerates all processes running on the computer. My current code does this but prints this out in a large block of text that is hard to read. How can I improve my script to have the output text in a vertical list for each process and all?*Edit: Here is the output text from the above script
 should already print with newlines, so if they're not showing up, something is more wrong than you're telling us. You could always double up the newlines if you want to split the settings apart, e.g.:If the problem is that you're running on Python 3 and the  object is a big blob, you can make  decode it to a friendly printable string for you:For the general case of line wrapping nicely (though it does nothing for paragraphs of text that are just "too big"), you might want to look at the  module; it splits a block of text up into a  of lines wrapped nicely at word boundaries so you don't have words split across lines.
 is an internal command that displays  environment variables in your case.To get environment variables in Python, use  instead.If you want to get the output of  command as a list of strings (not tested):
Disclaimer: I have not done what you are doing before but this might work.
