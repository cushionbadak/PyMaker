Say I have a function,  which has some arguments...some positional and some keyword:Is there another function I can call with  as an argument (or a method of  which I can call) that will return to me a list of the positional arguments of  as well as a list of tuples of the keyword arguments of foo along with their default values?  Specifically, calling:should returnOr something like that.  To be clear I do not want a way to figure out what values were passed to  one particular time that it was called.  Instead I want information about the function signature of  in a programatic way.  (The use case I have in mind is to automatically make a web form which will be able to submit appropriate data to serve as the arguments of a specified function.  So that if I call  in the appropriate way, it will be able to render a web form with spaces for each of the arguments of  with the default calling values pre-filled in an appropriate way.)
I think you're describing :You can also use  in 3.x:
