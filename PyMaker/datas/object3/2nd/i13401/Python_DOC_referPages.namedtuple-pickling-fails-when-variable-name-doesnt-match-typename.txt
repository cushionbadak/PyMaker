The python code below fails with the error This seems like bad behaviour of the  module, as it depends on the correctness of a variable name. Changing  to  and re-running the code allows it to complete successfully. Changing the code to the below, where a variable with  is instantiated to be the same value as , also lets the code run successfullyMy questions: is this fundamentally a  (and ) bug? It seems like  shouldn't be looking up the class definition by using the name of the variable (although, I'm not sure what else it could do). Or, instead, is this an issue with the  API? I browsed the  documentation and couldn't find anything that explicitly told me to name my   variables the same as my  argument (the first argument to the  function)
It's not a bug.  requires thatthe class definition must be importable and live in the same module as when the object was stored.From the perspective of the 's  method, the type name is  (that's what you passed it after all). So when unpickling, it will try to import the module it was declared in and look for . But since you didn't save it as , it can't find it.Without resorting to s, you can produce the exact same problem with:and trying to pickle and unpickle a ; under the hood, you've effectively done the same thing with your mismatched names for a .
