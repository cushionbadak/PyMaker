I'm trying to add a directory to PATH wit code like this:It doesn't work. If I do print  I see something like this:How should I fix this code? Is it normal to write ?
you need to append the path as a string to : is instance of  which has all the goodies like  and  etc. but you need to convert it to a regular string if you want to use is somewhere a string is expected - like .
why are you using this weird pathlib library instead of pythons perfectly good path utils?
