I tried this piece of code, but it only performs the function on the first string in the list:returns the first and last 2 characters of the given list of stringsHow would I make this function run through all of the strings in the list?
Yes, that is because you are returning the result directly , so it returns after you go through the first string itself. Instead you should put the result in the  you create and return the result at the end.And some other things -As said in the other answer, you want to check the length of the string.The length of the string should be greater than 4 , otherwise, you would end up adding some characters multiple times.Do not use names like  for variables, it ends up shadowing the builtin functions and so you would not be able to use  to create list after that.Last issue is you should call you function with your list, not  .Example -An easier way to do this -Demo -Or even list comprehension , though to me that makes it a bit less readable -Demo -
You want to check the length of the string, not the string itself. Hence, doing  doesn't do what you want it to do:Few other things:Don't name variables . It will override the built-in type.You have a tuple . A list is with square brackets.You have , and not putting in your list.And finally, you can probably shorten up your code:
There are some issues that caught my eye.You are returning immediately after the first iteration, so getting only the first element.I think you want to compare if the length is greater than 4, so do Don't use a datatype name as a variable name. Use used , don't use that. Don't return immediately, rather append to the list.Output:
