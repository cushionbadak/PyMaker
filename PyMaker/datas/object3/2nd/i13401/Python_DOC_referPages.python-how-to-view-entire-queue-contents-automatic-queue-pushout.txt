I am writing a script that uses a queue to track the last six numbers of a list of length N. In other words, as I iterate over the list of length N, I want to track the last six numbers. I thought a queue would be a good structure to do this because it would automatically push out the last 6th number as I push in a new number. My code is below:When I run this script I get the following output:However, this script never stops running. It freezes and I have to break out using ctrl+break. So after thinking, I figured out the reason why it is freezing. It freezes because when I "put" data into the queue, is doesn't automatically push ot the older data at the other end of the queue. So I guess that the queue is stuck. Am I missing something, is that not suppose to be the point of how a queue works? Do I have to call "get"? Is there anyway around having to call another function for the queue, where it will automatically push out the oldest data when new data is pushed into the queue?My second question:How can I view the entire queue like a list? So:Results in:after pushing in 5 numbers into 6 line queue.
s don't evict entries when they hit their maximum size, they block when you try to  an entry in that would exceed their maximum size (that's why your program stalls). They're designed for atomic interthread communication, so viewing their contents isn't a design goal, it's to allow -ing and -ing in a thread-safe way (with blocking when appropriate).Since you're not using the interthread hand-off with blocking features of , you don't really want a  at all, you want  with a .The stringification of a  will show the elements but it will include extra kruft; if you want it to look -like w/o the kruft, change the  to .
