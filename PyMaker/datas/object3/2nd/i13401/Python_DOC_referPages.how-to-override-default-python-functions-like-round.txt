I Want to override default round() function of python because I have to convert the result of round() function into integer. By default round() returns value in float.The code given below is returning error message.RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object.
The issue with your current code is that after you have overwritten the built-in  method, when you call  inside your own  , you are recursively calling your own function, not the built-in  function.For Python 3.x, you can use  module to access the  built-in function -For Python 2.x , it would be  module -Though I would really suggest not doing this, rather use a new name for your round function, maybe something like  or so.Please note, another thing is that your code would return the rounded number for  type, for all other types, it would return  , I am not sure if this is intentional or not, but I am guessing you would want to return back the  for other types (atleast ?) .
As already pointed out, round refers to your function not to the builtin function as you have shadowed the function and as python looks in the local, enclosing, global scope  and finally builtins in that order it see round refers to your function so your function essentially keeps calling itself until you hit a recursion limit.I would avoid shadowing the round function at all but a much simpler approach would be a  adding .5 to the number passed in and catching a TypeError:If you were going to check types, you should use , you can combine it with  to check for any numeric type:If you just wanted to check for a float type:
