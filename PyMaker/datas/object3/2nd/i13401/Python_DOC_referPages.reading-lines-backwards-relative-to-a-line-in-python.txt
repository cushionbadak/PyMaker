Natural Text
I am looping over all lines one by one using Every line is now searched for a particular string(XYZ) - I am not able to figure out how to get to couple of lines behind relative to the line where match was found for the string .I understand that this could be something trivial but couldn't make it.
You could use  to cache previous 2 lines:The advantage is that you don't need to read the whole file into memory.ExampleInputOutput
file.tell() gives current file pointer. And file.seek(pointer) sets the file pointer to given pointer. Like below code,pointer = file.tell()......file.seek(pointer) 
You need to save all readed lines or simply use  method.
