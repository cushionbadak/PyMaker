I am trying to limit the amount of tries a person has when attempting to guess the random number. I get this error code when I run the program and can't figure out what to do next. The code:
The problem is that you're assigning trysLeft in the function, so it assumes it has local (rather than global) scope. But you actually want to assign the global variable, so you need to declare that trysLeft has global scope. Change your  function to the following:For more information, see the FAQFWIW, the correct way to solve this would be to pass a variable to your function rather than use globals, but that's outside the scope of your question.
You have 3 options to fix this:Put trysLeft in a global (not a good idea)Add function trys() to your class and reference it as self.trysLeftPass the variable into the trys() function.
You need to pass  to the function for it to see it ...and then when you call  ...
Should do it!Self is referring to the instance of the class that you are currently in.Similar to  in java and  in vba.
