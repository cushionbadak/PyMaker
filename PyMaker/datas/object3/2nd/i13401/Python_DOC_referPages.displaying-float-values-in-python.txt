Here you go
Decimals and floats are different in the sense that decimals have a base of ten (0-9) whereas float have a base of two (0,1). There are two approaches to rounding (not truncating the floating point, which just cuts the number off at the indicated decimal). The .2 indicates the number of numbers post-float to printrounding notation can be placed after a colon & inside braces of format strings
One way to print the number without rounding is num=20.25099876num = num - (num % 0.0001)print numIt will print 20.2509If you want to print the value as it is , like a=20.25099876 Make it string. str(a) and print it. 
Use "c_double" instead of "c_float" to get exact values from cpp.
