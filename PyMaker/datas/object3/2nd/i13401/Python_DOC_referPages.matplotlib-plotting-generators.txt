It plots when I do (in Python 3):As far as I know, in Python 3,  returns an iterator so my code above pretty much plots over an iterator. Now my question is, why am I not able to do:When I try this, I get When you think about it, it makes sense wanting to plot over two generators. Just plot point after point. Is this possible in ?I am aware that there is a similar thread, unfortunately unanswered.
The thing is that even though  in Python 3 is not a real list, it still provides a lot more functionality than your custom generator.  In particular, it provides .  This is crucial because matplotlib converts everything to numpy arrays under the hood, and numpy arrays requre their size to be known up front.  Python 3 range objects also provide item access, so they really are pretty much like ordinary sequences.  You can see in the documentation that they are not simple generators.I'm not sure exactly what all you'd need to do to make your own custom class work here, but it's probably more trouble than it's worth.  Matplotlib needs to be able to convert your data into a numpy array, and numpy in turn needs much more information than simple "this object is iterable".  It needs to be able to know how much data there is and get it all at once.
