I'm writing a sample code for a function that will add a list of items to a dictionary. The problem is that at the end of the for loop, the backpack dictionary becomes a NoneType object. Why is that, and how do I stop my dictionary from becoming blank?
Your function modifies the  object in place, and then returns  (since it doesn't have an explicit return statement). So instead of assigning the result:You should just call the function without assigning the result back.  will be changed in place:
Don't write code which someone else has already written for you.  This performs the same operation:See  for details.
