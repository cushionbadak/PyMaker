This question already has an answer here:“Least Astonishment” and the Mutable Default Argument                    32 answers                Some days ago I ask for some function that retrieve the repetitive motif from some string (Here the link to the ask). The user @Kasramvd posted a nice function based on regex:This function, in fact, catch the repetitive motifs and also show the from/until where it take place:However, looks like this function has memory. When I used it again with other string, it show also the previous result:So, someone know how to avoid this? How to reset the function?Thanks in advance guys. =)
Don't use mutable types for function defaults.When you declare , the default value is a single  which is shared between all invocations of the function that don't override the default (and returned to the caller to boot), so any mutations made to the list within the function or by the caller will change the default for future calls. Changing to:avoids this problem; the assignment to  within the function body creates a new  each time.
