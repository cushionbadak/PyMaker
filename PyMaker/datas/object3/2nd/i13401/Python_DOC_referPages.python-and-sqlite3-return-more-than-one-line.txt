I'm trying to do a query in sqlite with python, but when I do the research in my database it's just return the last input. Like thisSo this query in sqlite browser returns three values, but in python it just return one.Does anybody know why?
I suggest you read the documentation carefully to see what you are trying to do: https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Cursor.fetchoneAlso, here is a blog post around what you are trying to do that uses 'fetchone'. You are pretty much not handling your result set properly.This isn't using the exact module you are using, but the idea is the same.http://kushaldas.in/posts/fetching-row-by-row-from-mysql-in-python.html
