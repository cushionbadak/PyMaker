I am new to Python and I have programmed a very basic program which opens a pre-made file reads it, then closes it, through normal Python syntax:However, once run, this program produces no output.Is there a problem with my syntax, or is there an error in my PyCharm installation?
This is supposed to happen.  does not print things to the screen. It returns them, just like  returns .  If you want to print things, you need to call the  function (under Python 3) or use the  statement (under Python 2).
