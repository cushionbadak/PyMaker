Can somebody explain the 2nd line ( is a class defined in the code)?
Python 2 defines a  type. Python 3 does not ( has taken this role). Trying to use the name  in Python 3 will thus raise a  exception.In other words, using the type name on a line does nothing by itself other than trigger a name lookup. If that name lookup fails, you know that the type is not available:
