I have some file path in Python under Linux and I need to figure out if it's a block device - representation of disk or partition. This information is visible when typing ls -l, e.g.I mean letter b on start of this output. Is this possible to get something like this in Python using built in libraries? Eventually I can use subprocess to fetch "ls -l" result and check if first character is correct, but i feel that there could be nicer solution for this. Unfortunately I can't find this. Thanks.
You can use the  lib using stat.S_ISBLK with os.stat:
Since 3.4  offers convenience function Path.is_block_device()
