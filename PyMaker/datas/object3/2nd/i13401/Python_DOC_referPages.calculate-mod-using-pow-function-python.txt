So, If i would like to calculate the value of 6^8 mod 5 using the pow function, what should I put in a line??In the assumption that You don't need to import it firstI know that pow is used like pow (x, y) = pow (6, 8) = 6^8and My guess is Thank you!
It's simple:  takes an optional 3rd argument for the modulus. From the docs:Return x to the power y; if z is present, return x to the power y, modulo z (computed more efficiently than . The  two-argument form pow(x, y) is equivalent to using the power operator:  .So you want:Not only is  faster & more efficient than  it can easily handle large values of  without using arbitrary precision arithmetic, assuming  is a simple machine integer.
check the docs of :does what you want. do not use ! while this will give the correct result it will be by orders of magnitude slower if you do calculations for bigger numbers.  will do the modulo operation in every step while  will first do the exponentiation in the integers (which may result in a huge number) and take the modulus only at the end.now if you are interested in numbers that are bigger than 32 bit you may want to have a look at gmpy2 for even more speed.
You can use '%' character to get the modulo value. For example  or .
