Natural Text
The documentation for the  function in the Python 2 version of shutil says,The source code for this should be considered an example rather than the ultimate tool.Exactly what does this mean? Is  intended to be a proof of concept instead of actually being used in programs? Or is this just a disclaimer that the code is messy? (This statement is not present in the Python 3 version.)
In earlier versions of the  code it had this note (introduced by Guido):XXX Consider this example code rather than the ultimate tool.This note was then removed in this commit. So there doesn't seem to be a specific reason for that note, other than that the code has organically grown from not-quite-ready to supports-what-we-need.
