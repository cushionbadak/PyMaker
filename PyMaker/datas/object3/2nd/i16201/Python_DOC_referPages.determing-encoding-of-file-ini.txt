I work with configuration file "myfile.ini" and use "codecs.open" function from "codecs" moduleIn advance i don't know "myfile.ini" encoding (it could be changed by user when he saved file)I known that there is no correct way to determine file encoding and try following:But, unfortunately it doesn't work properly.Is there any way to determine "myfile.ini" encoding or may be set permanent encoding for this file adding some script to it? 
You could try the chardet package.Another option is to use libmagic (the basis of the unix  command). There is a Python binding available as python-magic.
