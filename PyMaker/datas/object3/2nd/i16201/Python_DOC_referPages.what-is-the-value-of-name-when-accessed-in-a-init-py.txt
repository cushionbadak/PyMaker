My current understanding is that, when one writes ,  which is a package and has , will have its  automatically processed after which its resource  will be imported. If from the command prompt, I write , and in that module call , in the  which belongs to foo package, is the variable  then equal to the package name? foo in this case?
In the  module of a package,  is set to the name of the package; e.g. what the module is stored under in .For a package ,  is set to :Note that each Python module has such a  variable; even the initial script. If you run  the initial script is loaded as the  module, so *in  the name is set to ; this name does not change with what is imported by the script.
 belongs to the local scope (attribute) of the module that you call with python, ie: in this case .
