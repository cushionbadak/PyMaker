So I know from Redirecting stdout to "nothing" in python that you can suppress print statements. But is it possible to undo that command later on, so that after a certain points, print statements will indeed be printed again?For example, let's say I want to print "b" but not "a".I would do:Could someone enlighten me as to what "SOME COMMAND" would be?

The original  is always preserved in :However, the documentation does note that explictly saving the original  is preferred:It can also be used to restore the actual files to known working file  objects in case they have been overwritten with a broken object.  However, the preferred way to do this is to explicitly save the  previous stream before replacing it, and restore the saved object.
starting from python 3.4 you can do this (see ) is suppressed within the with statement. outside the  context your  is restored.and by the way: there is no need to  in your original version -  is enough as i recently learned: why does sys.stdout = None work? .
