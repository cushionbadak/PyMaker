In this case the  and  make up the block beneath the  thereby defining the code that needs to be looped infinitely. Have a look at Python tutorials regarding the  and other control flow statements, for example 3.2 First Steps Towards Programming (second bullet point).
Python uses indentation to separate different code blocks. So you need to indent the code after while statement, like you did in the class definition.So the code should look like this:
This is a recommendation for your code, as I thought the other answers were sufficient, but this can be handy.At the top where you import things into your module you have:this can be refined down to:when importing it is not 'good' to import more than one thing on one line, except with the  technique.Just a handy tip :)
