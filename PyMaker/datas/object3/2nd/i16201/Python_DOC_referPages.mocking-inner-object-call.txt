Here is my code that is under test -Here is my test - I'm trying to mock using  the  method call, however I keep getting exceptions that say . I've tried many variations and everything fails with similar exceptions.My goal is to ensure  gets called with the appropriate parameter, 1234. How can I make this happen?Alternatively, are there any other ways of achieving this? Would using  instead be more appropriate?
