So my assignment has been easy up to this point. Useing Python 3GetSale - Finds the maximum expected value of selling a stock. The expected sale value of a stock is the current profit minus the future value of the stock:Expected Sale value = ( ( Current Price - Buy Price ) - Risk * CurrentPrice ) * SharesThe GetSale function should calculate this value for each stock in the portfolio, and return the stock symbol with the highest expected sale value.We are using 3 separate dictionaries: Names, Prices and Exposure.For the GetSale I know I need to call the Prices and Exposure dictionaries to get the values for the equation; however, I have no idea how to get those values and run them. so far this is the code:I know that it must somehow be done with a loop since it will have the run the equation over and over to find the greatest Expected Sale Value and then it will return the Stock Symbol of the greatest one.P.S. I'm sorry if it isn't very clear and specific I tried to make it to the point so please forgive me its only my second post.
How do I get values from a dictionaryrun them through an equationand return the key with the greatest valueHere's where it gets interesting. You need the keys and values together for that. So let's start over.How do I get keys and values from a dictionaryrun the values through an equationand return the key with the greatest valueno, the key, not the value and key

So, you want to run the values through an equation and get the value of the greatest key? Here's a program:I'm sorry if this didn't answer your question. This is your 2nd question and this is my third answer!
