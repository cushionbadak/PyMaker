What is the most efficient way to find consecutively repeating strings in a Python list?  For example, suppose I have the list.  I want an output of something like: .Is there a built in function to accomplish this task?  I did find , but that seems to only work on numeric values.Thanks in advance for the help.
It’s funny that you should call it a group, because the function probably best-suited to this is :( is a count, by the way, since  doesn’t work on just any iterable, and  is wasteful.)Getting the index is a little more complicated; I’d just do it using a loop.
This requires state information between elements of the loop so its not easy to do with a list comprehension. Instead you can keep track of last value in a loop:Output:
