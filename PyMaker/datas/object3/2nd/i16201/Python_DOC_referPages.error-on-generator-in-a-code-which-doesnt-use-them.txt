I'm not a pyton guru, so the question could be nobby as hell...I'm trying to create a little rubiks cube simulator in python. And I got the following weird error.After some reading, I found out that error comes when trying to copy a generator but... I don't!I made a lot of deepcopy in the project due to some issue with python's passing by refI noticed the error show up in really strange situation:If I Remove two calls of rotate_clockwise function : the error disappear. And the error show ups only when those calls arme madre from function yinv. The error isn't caused directly when I make those calls, but when I try to make a deepcopy after.If I call from R() function, I don't have any issues.I give you the functions code:
In this line:… you're creating a list of generators. Because this:… is a generator expression.If you wanted this to be a list, use a list comprehension instead of a generator expression:If you wanted it to be lazy, then that means you wanted it to be a generator, which means you can't deepcopy it. You have to instead write a function that copies everything else, and recreates the generator (and maybe advances it to the same state) instead of copying it.
