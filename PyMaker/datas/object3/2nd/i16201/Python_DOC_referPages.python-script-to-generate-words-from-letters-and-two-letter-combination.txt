Natural Text
I'm looking to write a short script that will allow me to generate all possible letter combinations with the parameters I set.For example:_ _ b _ a Parameters:word = 5 letters3th, 5th letter = b, a1st letter = ph, sd, nn, mm or gh2nd, 4rd letter = any vowel (aeiouy) and rcin other words, I'm looking to write a script that would return me all 5*7*7 results.Thank you
You can create iterables for keeping the possible alternatives for each place:List comprehensionYou could use a list comprehension:Outputitertools.productAnother nice way is to use :OutputThe nice part of this second solution is that you don't have to hardcode the logic, and if needed you could just replace the iterables with others, even when you have more or less places:Output
I would approach this as follows, using  in a generator function (to avoid building the whole list unless you absolutely have to):The only trick is providing the  in an appropriate format; it must be a list of iterables, each of which provides the options for each "letter". This is easy where each option for a letter is a single character:But with your multiple-character letters you will need to supply a list or tuple:Note that in Python 3.3 onwards, this can be done in a single line with :
