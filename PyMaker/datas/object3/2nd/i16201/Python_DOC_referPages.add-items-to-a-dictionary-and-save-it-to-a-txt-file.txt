a few weeks ago i have started learning python.Now i have started to create a program to create a dictionary, add an item1 as a string, add an item2 wich consists of numbers and save it after that. But it is not working the way i want it to. It seems like the saving is not working properly it seems to be overwriting the existing items.Before posting this, i have thoroughly searched here on Stackoverflow to find a solution, but i cant get it to work.Here is my code:I hope this is not a too specific case.edit: I have edited my code, to make it less specific and made two mistakes which are fixed now.this was the code without the function.
The edited code still has errors.I rewrote the whole thing to be more pythonic.I used meaningful names and didn't call a variable  because dict is a builtin you don't want to overwrite.First we read the file. If it doesn't exist we catch the error and use an empty dictionary for the data.Second we get the new data and update the dictionary.Last we write the dictionary back to disk and create the target folder if it doesn't exist.
