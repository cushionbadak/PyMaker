I have a network resource which returns me data that should (according to the specs) be an ASCII encoded string. But in some rare occasions, I get junk data.One resource for example returns  whereas another resource, for the same key returns The first value contains a non-ASCII string. Clearly a violation of the spec, but that's unfortunately out of my control. None of us are 100% certain that this really is junk or data which should be kept.The application calling on the remote resources saves the data in a local database for daily use. I could simply do a  or  but then I would lose data which could turn out to be useful later on.My immediate reflex was to use  or  as error handler. Simply because it would result in a displayable string. But then I get the following error: The only error-handler which worked was , but this seems to be intended for filenames. On the other hand, for my intent and purpose it would work.Why are  and  not working? I don't understand the error.For example, an expected execution would be:This is a contrived example. My aim is to not lose any data. If I would use the  or  error-handler, the byte in question would essentially disappear, and information is lost.
It does not use html entities but it is a decent starting point. If not sufficient, you will have to register your own error handler using codecs.register_error I assume.For Python3:For Python 2Both producing:
For completeness, wanted to add that as of python 3.5,  works for decoding, so you no longer have to add a custom error handler.
