I would like to ask that if we are defining a child class using a base class, why would we need to initialize the arguments in the parent class in  method. I am similiar to JAVA OOP and as I remember in Java we just add the new arguments in the child class.If I am wrong about Java too, can somebody please explain the reason to do it? Isn't inheritance something supposed to be make our lives easier with programming.I mean why isn't  inside ElectricCar class is enough for this kind of inheritance?
You can invoke the overridden  method by using the  proxy object:If you are using Python 3, you can omit the class and self references:Either way, the  call gives you a proxy object on which you can look up attributes and methods on the whole chain of parent classes; it'll find the next  method in the chain, then bind it such that you can call it as a regular method.
