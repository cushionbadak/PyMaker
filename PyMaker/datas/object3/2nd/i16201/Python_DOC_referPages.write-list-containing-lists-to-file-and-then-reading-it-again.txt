(I've looked this up before and everyone says you just need to have  Else it must be a problem with the reading of a file: but how can I get python to import it as a list of lists?My code so far:
I think your problem is that  transform a string into a list of characters:You should use something like pickle to read/write data to a file.See for example this answer.Edit: In order to be able to add more recipes to your file, you canadd all your recipes to some variable and read/write all at onceFor instance something likeAnd in :You will have to change  to .add recipe to your file each time you call :read your fileload  if they existadd your recipe to write the new  to the fileAlso, check @jonrsharpe comment. You could easily use sqlite3 to avoid drawbacks of both my methods.
