Natural Text
In python.org, What's New in Python 3? it gives this example of the print function:which produces:What is the point of the  at the end of the print function? Surely the meaning is obvious without it.
The default value for  is a space. By setting it to an empty value you print without spaces between the 3 inputs.You could easily have tried this without the  argument to see the difference:Note the spaces between the , the outcome of the  expression and the .The point then is to control how  outputs the given arguments, something that was not possible in Python 2 where  is a statement.Perhaps a different example would illustrate this better:By setting the separator to a newline character I made  write all arguments out on separate lines instead.
