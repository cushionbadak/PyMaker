Natural Text
I have saved a time as It 's output is 2014-08-18 21:11:35.537000. How can this be formatted to : August 18 2014 - 21:11:35 instead?
 returns a  object. You can use its  method to convert it into a string of your desired format:
the object you're getting is a  instance. Just format it via its method :https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/datetime.html?highlight=date#datetime.datetime.strftimeupdate (thx @Ffisegyedd):possible placeholders values: https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior
