This question already has an answer here:Private members in Python                    8 answers                I have the following Python-Code. I just can't getthe instance variable to be read only. Help appreciated.Edit:The point of this question was to understand, how a property could replace the old variable. Somehow everybody just points out that Python is about being mature, andthat it is our responsibility not to use "private" variables, since they are visible in python. But nobody pointed out that you'd just turn the old variable in this case private and replace the old variable (voltage) with the propertywhich would leave the way you access attributes in this class the same, so that nobodywho uses this class has to change their code. -- like the way you access variables, sinceyou can still access the property like a variable -- e.g.:But it gives more control to the developers of this class (turn voltage to read only). I just felt that nobody did actually explain the mechanics of properties in an understandable way...-> I was not able to understand properties although I googled first.Anyways... kinda ridiculous, since it does not seem to pose any kind of difficulties now.CheersNimi
That's normal, since Python isn't a bondage & discipline language.There's no real equivalent to 'private', but sometimes attributes with two leading underscores are used, though these are inteded to avoid problems when inherating.The one leading underscore is just to avoid importing this when using a  import.
