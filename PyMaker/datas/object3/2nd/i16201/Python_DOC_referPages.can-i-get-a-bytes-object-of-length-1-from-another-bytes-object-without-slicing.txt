Is this the only way to get a byte of binary data?If I use  it throws an error:
From the  documentation:Since bytes objects are sequences of integers (akin to a tuple), for a bytes object b,  will be an integer, while  will be a bytes object of length 1. (This contrasts with text strings, where both indexing and slicing will produce a string of length 1).So  assigns an integer value to  - which as your error message points out, does not support the buffer interface.You could, instead of , write this:... relying on the fact that the  constructor, if passed a sequence (note the brackets around ), will use it to create a  object  - but that's not really any more readable, and is significantly slower (by a factor of six on my machine with Python 3.4).
