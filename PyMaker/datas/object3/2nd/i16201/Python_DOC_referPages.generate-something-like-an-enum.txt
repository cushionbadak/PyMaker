I want to emulate something like an enum, but slightly different. There are 'N' different entities within a list. The 'N' changes depending on the data. I want to assign each one of those 'N' entities a value from 1 to N. For certain entities, I want to give it them the same value. For example,I want to assign:How do I do this in a graceful manner? 
From How can I represent an 'Enum' in Python?The way I'd go about it is as follows. Just define the typical enumeration using args and then put any of your special parameters in the keyword arguments.Yields:Also, this will use 0 based indexing. If you want a base of 1, as in your example, useinstead ofTo me, it seems like quite a hassle if you have to skip values (like four) and have specially assigned values (like first) thrown in randomly. In that case, I don't think you could use this solution (or something like it). Instead, you'd probably have to find any specially assigned strings and give those values, which is going to be a lot less graceful.
Use the Python function . That is what it is there for. As in You can convert it to whatever you want. Like: etc ... The Pythonic way of going it is to create a generator by just using  where you need it. This avoids generating extra data and consuming memory, especially when your original list is very long. 
Do you mean a dict?And then  is
