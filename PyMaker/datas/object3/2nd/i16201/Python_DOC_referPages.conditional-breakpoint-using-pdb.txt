Sounds like I'm missing something extremely simple, I'm trying to set a breakpoint in my python code using:My error in the code comes after a large number of iterations..difficult to debug using print etc.I am able to print stuff when the condition hits but I would like to set brk-pt.--EDIT--Actual code:
I am not sure as to why your code isn't working, but what you can do is on your local machine, create a new file for your minimum example to see if you can do what you want to doNow running it:As you can see this worked as intended with this trivial example, it's up to you to figure out how to adapt this to your code, and/or figure out what else did you do to your code/environment that prevented that prompt from showing up.Alternatively, if you have a function that is dying in an exception and you want to know the exact line that caused it, you should use  instead.  Wrap the problematic section of code with thisWhat post_mortem would do is dump a break point right at the point where the exception happened (specifically in that stack frame), and so this allows all values to be inspected and then let you continue execution.  However I also put a raise at the end to allow the exception to continue as normal, and this is intended as execution doesn't normally from where it die but just pause at that exception handling block due to the  call.  Might as well just give up after inspecting what went wrong.  
I see you found your solution Sanjay.  But for those who arrived here looking for a means to set a conditional breakpoint with pdb read on: Instead of hard coding conditions such as , run pdb in interactive mode.  Sample code:In the shell start the script in debug mode using :The pdb shell command  breaks at line 4 when node_num is greater than 4.  
To actually use conditional breakpoints in pdb, you can do the following:b(reak) [([filename:]lineno | function) [, condition]]https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html#pdbcommand-breakEg I'm running some test code that iterates over django views. I want to break only when the particular view I'm interested in is reached:b C:\Users\powlo\project\tests\TestCase.py:350, view.view_name  == 'app.views.export'
