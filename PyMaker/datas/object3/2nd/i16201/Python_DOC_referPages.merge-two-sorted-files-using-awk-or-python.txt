I have two files depending on only 1st column value.File 1:File 2:I want to merge these two files with final sorted file as
How about using  (merge sorted files):
Your question is a good one, but I think it got down voted, because you didn't provide enough details. If I can assume that the files are already sorted by column 1, that you want the final output to be sorted by column 1 and there are no duplicate values in column 1, then this solution works:You don't need to pipe cat file1 to awk, but I just prefer to have the input file at the beginning of the command instead of at the end. I am often criticised for this redundant use of cat.Your question is tagged with Python, so here is a Python3 solution as well, which utilises heapq.merge():I found the answer, when searching for "merge sorted files in python". Among other pages this one showed up: heapq.merge() function to list of sorted files
