This is a module containing two class:When I  create an instance of , and perform a , a  happened. The error tolds me the  in  must be a , but when I perform ,  is already a string.Can someone tell me what's really wrong inside?Thx!!!
You're using a  but the variable is declared in the function's signature as :so it probably takes a different  from an outer scope (thanks to @grc - filter is a builtin function) that is not defined as a string.
