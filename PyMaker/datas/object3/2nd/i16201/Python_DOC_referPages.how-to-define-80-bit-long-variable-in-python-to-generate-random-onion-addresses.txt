I'm trying to implement some random generator of Tor .onion addresses which involves generation of 80-bit numbers to create 16-character hashes.How do I define such variable in Python?.onion format:"16-character hashes can be made up of any letter of the alphabet, and  decimal digits beginning with 2 and ending with 7, thus representing  an 80-bit number in base32."Links:Manipulating 80 bits datatype in C
You want this one-liner if you are on Python3Explanation: You grab your 80 random bits using , encode it into binary form (which you kind of have to go through the process by going through the hex encoding, then use the  function, which provides the RFC 3548 compliant method of encoding this into your target encoding of base32.Works for Python 2 also.
You can create a sequence of 10 bytes encoding an 80 bit random  number like this:updateSorry, teh above part does not take care about the encoding of the key in Base32 - without resorting to Python's string codecs (see metatoaster's answer for that) a compact and readable form is:
Since you actually need the alphanumeric representation of the 80-bit hash, just select the base-32 digits directly.I found a 15% speed-up by avoiding repeated name lookups for  and by using a list comprehension rather than passing a generator to .
