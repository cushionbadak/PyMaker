right now I have Python 3 code that takes a column of data within a CSV file and then delimits the phrases in each cell into individual words based on spaces.  What I am trying to do now is export that data back into a CSV file in Column format so that it looks like this with each cell containing one wordRight now, my code exports the data to a CSV file but instead of coming in as a column format, it comes through in rows.When I print my code in the interpreter, it comes through correctly in a column format but not when I export it!  Here is my codeDoes anyone have any ideas how to transpose the data?  Thank you!
You can useto make it written in the next row.
Since version 2.3, Python has had a builtin module for parsing csv data.  Is there any reason you can't use that?To give an answer, specifically on your code, though, here's what I notice:You're writing the data to the file appended with a comma, and printing it to the command line separately. So it shows up on the command line with one output on each line, but it's getting printed to the file as:All CSV files are slightly different, but commas generally delimit fields, while newlines delimit rows. You're getting exactly what you're outputting: one row with all of your values on it, in separate comma-delimited fields.  Try this instead:If you're in Python 3, then you can also use the print function:
I don't know what looks like, but I would say that you need to specify that you want to go to next line : However, it's weird you don't get coma in your output, hope this helps anyway.
