My program is simple. I loop for user input and add their input as an integer to a list until the user breaks the loop. Then I have some code written for analyzing the data. Next time I run the program however, the data that I added to the lists is gone. I am aware of a question nearly the same as this one, however, I couldn't make sense of the answers because I am very new to python. I'm aware of the pickle module, but I do not understand what it does. If using pickle is my best option, please explain how it works.
If all you have is a list of some simple type like integers,  is overkill. You can just write each integer to a line, like this:Then, to read it back in:Obviously this won't work if you're trying to save strings that might have newlines in them, or more complex data types that are harder to parse than just calling . In that case, you may want to look at JSON, YAML, or Pickle formats.The tutorial has a great chapter on Input and Output that covers this, and a lot more (although it assumes you've read the previous chapters, or gotten the equivalent information elsewhere, or are willing to go back and read what you've missed if you get confused).
 is actually pretty simple.  It converts python objects into a collection of unique characters that can be stored in a file. The characters are actually a mini-language of 'opcodes' that tell how to uniquely create your python object.  Anyway, before you shut down the interpreter, you save your list to a file with .Then when you start up python again, you use .If you look at , you can see how pickle is converting the list of ints to unique characters.  First using the "naive" pickle protocol, and secondly using a more compressed protocol (, which for python 2.7 is protocol ).If you look closely at the last few, you can see that you always start with , which tells me that it is protocol , and then  for tuple, or  for list…   is the integer , and so on.  I wouldn't try to directly write these strings, unless you really really know what you are doing… best to let pickle do it for you.You can see  itself for a list of many of the opcodes: https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/pickle.py#L97
