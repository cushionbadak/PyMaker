I'm trying to deliver work when a page is appended to the pages list, but my code output returns a NotImplementedError. Here is the code with what I'm trying to do:Code:Output:It's any way to pass the pool object between the processes ?Edit:I'm using Python 2.6 
In order to pickle the instance method you're trying to pass to the , Python needs to pickle the entire  object, including its instance variables. One of those instance variables is the  object itself, and  objects can't be pickled, hence the error. You can work around this by implementing  on the object, and using that to remove the  object from the instance prior to pickling: is always called prior to pickling an object, and allow you to specify exactly which pieces of the object's state should actually be pickled. Then upon unpickling,  will be called if its implemented (it is in our case), or if it's not, the  returned by  will be used as the  for the unpickled instance. In the above example, we're explicitly setting  to the  we returned in , but we could have just not implemented  and gotten the same effect.
Dano's answer is a good approach if you must pass the entire object to the process. In your case, the function you are passing to pool has no requirement for a reference to the class instance. So an alternative may be to make the function a static method using the  decorator. If the function does require reference to one or two class member variables these could be passed in as arguments for read only variables, and updated in a callback if a write is required also (of course, you will need to do this if you want to update the local class instance in any case).For example:
