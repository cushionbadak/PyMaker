I'd like to convert numbers (int, float) into strings with Python 3.  If I sort the strings alphanumerically, the result should be correct also numerically.  This is the wishlist: =>  =>  =>  => I can make sure that the numbers are smaller than 1000.  If it helps, I can also guarantee that there is at most one digit after the decimal point.I can code a function that does this.  But can this also be achieved with  magic?
You could also switch on the  intead, eg:Result:
If you need to handle floats, then you are better of with using the  method, after partitioning of the decimal value first:Here  gives us a tuple of 3 elements, with the latter two empty if there was no decimal point. This gives us the opportunity to zero-pad just the integer portion of the numbers.If you don't need to handle floating point values, then  would have been an excellent tool:but that truncates the floating point value, and for floats you'd have to use a different format string, one that varies with the number of decimals you need to include.Demo:
Running this will produce the output:
