I'm having problems finding maximum values for a list inside a list in Python.Question:  takes data from a csv file and returns the list ofpairs of array names and max power for a particular day for that array in kW.The following must be the 'answer' when are used in the interpreter for a particular date. So, in a way I have given the answer and I need to provide a code that would give me the following result for all the buildings.The following is an example of the data which is obtained when only the  is used. This is the data in the form . However, for my part I'm only concerned with the powers to create a list of maximum power for each of the buildings out the power section . However, since the data is for the whole day, I need to know how to find the max value for each element in  and also insert the string i.e. Building names in the list.
One of the ways to find the building using the most consumption for the day.
If I correctly understand your problem a solution is:Execution give this :Another solution is to create a class of object and define comparatives method of this class and then use the built-in max function.And then at execution time :
If the power-value is always the second entry in the sublist, then I would suggest using  on a generator expression like this:It should be quite fast.
To get the maximum power for all the buildings, you first have to extract the power values for all the buildings. You can do this by ing the data, getting the last element, then zipping again. Next, you have to get the maximum of all those powers per building. Use  to apply  to each of the lists. Finally, you can combine those with those generic  strings using .Or, if you have a list of building names, like , you can use another  to assign powers to buildings:Since you asked for it: You can also do the same without using  and , using some very complicated list comprehensions instead. However, I would recommend using  and .Example (same for all those variants):
