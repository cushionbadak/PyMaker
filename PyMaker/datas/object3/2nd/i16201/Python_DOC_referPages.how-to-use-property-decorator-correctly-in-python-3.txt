I have method annotated with  in  script:I use this method in another script:At last line ( method) I get exception:What is wrong in my code?
 only works on methods, not on functions. is not a method, it is a function. A  object act as a descriptor object and descriptors only work in the context of classes and instances.In your case there is no need to make  a property, really. Remove the  decorator and just use it like a function:You cannot otherwise make top-level functions act like attributes.
