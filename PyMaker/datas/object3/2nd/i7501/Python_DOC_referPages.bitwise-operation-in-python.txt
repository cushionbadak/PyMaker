There is a solution available for doing bitwise operations. But, it converts the integers in binary number and then do bitwise operations. I already have the numbers in binary format. How do I carry out the bitwise operations for these numbers?Ex. x = 10101, y = 11001I want z = x or y to be 11101.Any help is highly appreciated.
You can convert decimal  to binary  by converting it to string then  (2 => base 2):Do operation you want ( => bitwise or):Then, convert it back to decimal, using  (or   with format string  -> meaning binary representation) and :
