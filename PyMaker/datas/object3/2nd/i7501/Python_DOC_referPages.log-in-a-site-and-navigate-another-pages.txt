I have a script for Python 2 to login into a webpage and then move inside to reach a couple of files pointed to on the same site, but different pages. Python 2 let me open the site with my credentials and then create a  to keep the connection available to navigate to the other pages. Here's the code that worked in Python 2:I need to do the same thing in Python 3. I have tried with request module and urllib, but although I can establish the first login, I don't know how to keep the opener to navigate the site. I found the OpenerDirector but it seems like I don't know how to do it, because I haven't reached my goal. I have used this Python 3 code to get the result desired but unfortunately I can't get the csv file to print it.enter image description here
