The folder I want to get to is called python and is on my desktop.I get the following error when I try to get to it
You need to use a raw string, double your slashes or use forward slashes instead:In regular python strings, the  character combination signals a extended Unicode codepoint escape.You can hit any number of other issues, for any of the recognised escape sequences, such as  or  or , etc.
This syntax worked for me.
This usually happens in Python 3. One of the common reasons would be that while specifying your file path you need "\\" instead of "\". As in:For Python 2, just using "\" would work.
f = open('C:\\Users\\Pooja\\Desktop\\trolldata.csv')...Use '\\' for python program in python version 3 and above..Error will be resolved..
All the three syntax work very well.Another way is to first writepath = r'C:\user\...................' (whatever is the path for you)and then passing it to os.chdir(path)
Use this 
I had the same error.Basically, I suspect that the path cannot start either with "U" or "User" after "C:\".I changed my directory to "c:\file_name.png" by putting the file that I want to access from python right under the 'c:\' path.In your case, if you have to access the "python" folder, perhaps reinstall the python, and change the installation path to something like "c:\python". Otherwise, just avoid the "...\User..." in your path, and put your project under C:.
