I have this dictionary:And a list:What am i doing now is this:In other words i want to count how many times each site appears in the list and on which position. This works but in the given example it will return something like:while i would want it to be:How can i achieve this? I can use a variable, initiate it with var=0 and then +=1 and use it as an artificial index but is there a more "pythonic" way of doing it?
If I rightly understand your question, you already have  dictionary and you're seeking enumerate operator.And your code will be like below:
You could do something like this:You essentially replace your  values with a list-comprehension that compares the  entry to the  entry. If the result of the comparison is  you convert that ean value to an eger (, ).If the items in  are very limited in comparison to the  keys you can do this instead:This way, you loop and edit only those s in your  that appear in your . Also notice that you loop over a  constructed from the elements of  to ignore its duplicates (  is edited once, not as many times as it appears on ).
If I understand your problem correctly, you could just iterate over  and create  as needed :It requires only one pass over  and should be really fast.If you have a list of interesting urls, you could use this variant:
