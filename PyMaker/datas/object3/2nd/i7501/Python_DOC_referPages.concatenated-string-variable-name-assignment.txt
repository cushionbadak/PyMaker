I'm a python noob, and I want to assign a value to a variable with a name wgich is concatenated. I tried searching and do trial and error. This is one of my attempts.
Non-Recommended Method #1Using .The  function returns a dictionary of all variables available to you in global namespace. If you wish to do the same thing inside a function, you can do the same thing with  instead.Note that there is no way to even access these variables if you don't know what names they could have at runtime. Non-Recommended Method #2You can use the  builtin function:If you want to access this variable, you'd need to use  again, since you're working with variable named variables. and its sister function  will execute any valid python code passed to it. Just remember to never allow any user input to be executed by them, as it would pose a serious security threat.The Recommended MethodUsing a  to store your "variable" names variables. Use the first two methods only if you know what you are doing. In all other instances, a dictionary is the safest route to take:With the first two methods, creating the variables is easy enough. But accessing them at runtime if you don't know how they were created can be a pain.
There is the built-in type of a  (dictionary) that handles dynamic keys (names). It is also used internally for all kind of stuff, like all the variables and attributes, so you should try it as well:You can also build keys dynamically:will create a key b['a1'].See more features at https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict .
