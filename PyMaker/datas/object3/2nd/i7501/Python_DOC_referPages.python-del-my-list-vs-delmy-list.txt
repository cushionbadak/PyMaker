I have created a list in PythonNow if I want to delete the list, I would like to use the  operator likeThis works fine and is probably the general way of using it. But somewhere I stumbled upon an unusual syntaxAnd this does the same thing! And now I am kind of confused how del actually works. I can understand the previous syntax with  being a built-in statement, but the second syntax looks like an indexing to me.
 takes a target list of names, see the reference documentation:Just like for assignments and  loops, a target list includes using  and  list and tuple syntax:So you are not subscripting , you are deleting a list of names.You can even nest them:It was simpler to re-use an existing grammar rule than to strictly limit the syntax to a comma-separated list of names.The full grammar definition is:so  is technically valid too, but the compiler special-cases that last option to be a  anyway:
It's not indexing.When eting things, you can specify more than one thing to delete at a time:You can also surround the deletion targets with brackets or parentheses:And you can do that even if there's only one deletion target:This behavior is mostly mirroring that of assignment, where the optional brackets or parentheses are useful for nested unpacking:While you're technically allowed to do something like , it's equivalent to .
