I am trying to implement a Gaussian filter. For this I am using a kernel 3x3 and an array of an image.The problem I am having is defining a sub-matrix 3x3 for each [i, j] element of the array. I wrote the details inside the code.Sorry for the long code. And thanks for any help.
There are a few issues with your code as is:You are using an image we don't have access to. Always use freely available images in examples so we can run the code. I used  here.Don't use global variables unless you really have to.Always code in english with english variable names and english comments. It makes reviews like this much easier.I did some fixes to your code below, and I guess you can see how I solved your problem. Specifically you want to use  indexing which allows you extract subsets of an array and use  to assign the result:
