I have a CSV file with a field named   that contains data in a variety of formats.Some of the formats include e.g.,  or  (month, day, year). But not all values are valid dates.I want to add a  field adjacent to the  column to filter invalid date values into. Lastly, normalize all valid date values in start_date to ISO 8601 (i.e., ). So far I was only able to load the start_date into my file, I am stuck and would appreciate ant help. Please, any solution especially without using a library would be great!
One way is to use  module, you can parse data as follows:Then parsing to your format can be done bySuppose you have table in dataframe format, you can now define parsing function and apply to column as follows:
Question: ... add a start_date_description ... normalize ... to ISO 8601This reads the File  and validates the Date String in Column  with Date Directive Patterns and returns a .  The returned  is used to update the current Row  and the updated Row  is writen to the File .Put this in a NEW Python File and run it!A missing valid Date Directive Pattern could be simple added to the Array.
