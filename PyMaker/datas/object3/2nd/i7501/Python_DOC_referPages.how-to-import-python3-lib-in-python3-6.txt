Or if this is not possible how can I use global package installed in 3.5 in my virtualenv 3.6 python.Running with global python3.5Running with python3.6 from venv
In order to use system packages inside a virtual environment, you have to use  option when creating virtual env:The same switch is available in Python3's .Much better option is (if applicable in your case) to install all packages inside your virtual env, using .
If you look at the contents of the package (using ) you'll probably see something like this:The package installs binary modules compiled for a specific python version (in this case: cpython-35m), you won't be able to use those from a python3.6 installation/venv directly because of the incompatible binary names.For that to work you'd need to symlink all the  files in the  directory to your venv and there change  to . Same for the  libraries, as those are requiered by PyQt5. And that will only work if the ABI is compatible between the two versions.A quick test with the versions mentioned above shows it works at least for simple scripts, but I can't give any guarantee.
