Natural Text
If the part in bold of this string are the seconds. 00:00:00:00.000How could I add 10 seconds to all this string formats ?The result should be:
Using  with replacement function: accept not only the replacement string as the second parameter, but can also accept replacement function as the second parameter.The function receive matched object as the parameter. The return value of the function is used as a replacemnt string. pattern is used to match last second part (which is followed by  decimal part)
You have two options that come to my mind:Find or write your own converter of string to timestamp format, then increase it by 10s and convert back.Write your own function that takes string, checks in which format it is and adds 10s shifting it to minutes if necessary.
