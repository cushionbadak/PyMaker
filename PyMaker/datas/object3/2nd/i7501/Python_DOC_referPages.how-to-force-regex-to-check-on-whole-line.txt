I'm trying to check if a string is a number, so the regex "\d+" seemed good. However that regex also fits "78.46.92.168:8000" for some reason, which I do not want, a little bit of code:And doStuff() is called when the ip adress is entered. I'm kind of confused, how does "." or ":" match "\d"?
 matches any positive number of digits within your string, so it matches the first  and succeeds.Use .Or, even better: 
 always matches from the start of the string (unlike ) but allows the match to end before the end of the string.Therefore, you need an anchor:  would work.To be more explicit, you could also use  (which is redundant) or just drop  altogether and just use .
 matches the end of the string while  matches the end of the string or just before the newline at the end of the string, and exhibits different behaviour in . See the syntax documentation for detailed information.
Change it from  to 
There are a couple of options in Python to match an entire input with a regex.Python 2In Python 2.x, you may useor - to avoid matching before the final  in the string:Or the same as above with  method requiring the use of  /  start-of-string anchor as it does not anchor the match at the start of the string:Note that  is an unambiguous string start anchor, its behavior cannot be redefined with any modifiers ( /  can only redefine the   and  behavior).Python 3All those cases described in the Python 2 section and one more useful method,  (also present in the PyPi  module):If the whole string matches the regular expression pattern, return a corresponding match object. Return  if the string does not match the pattern; note that this is different from a zero-length match.So, after you compile the regex, just use the appropriate method:
