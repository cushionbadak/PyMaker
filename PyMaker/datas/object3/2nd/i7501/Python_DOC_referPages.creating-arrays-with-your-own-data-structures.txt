From what I understand in order to initialize a array you would call something like this:where type of some sort could be anything such as an integer. My question is if there is any way for me use a data structure I have defined(Letter) and use that type when initializing an array.Here is what I tried:where I then get the following error:builtins.TypeError: array() argument 1 must be a unicode character, not typeSorry if it's a stupid question
As the documentation shows, an array can only contain basic types - integers, bytes, etc.But there doesn't seem to be any reason why you can't just use a list here.
As you can see in the docs a python  can only hold numerical values.
Python s can be used with a limited set of predefined types. You cannot use them with custom types. The first argument is indeed a single character, and it specifies which of the allowed types the array will contain. See here.
As pointed out by in the other answers, the  only works with certain pre-defined types. That means you cannot use it for types/classes you define yourself. Most of the time, there is no reason for using an array, but if you feel that you absolutely need it, you can use a :This of course requires  to be installed and all your elements will be stored as general s in the array.
