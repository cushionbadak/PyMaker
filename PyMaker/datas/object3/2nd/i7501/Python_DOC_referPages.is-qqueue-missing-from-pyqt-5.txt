I'm stumbling over a strange issue: is it possible that the QQueue class from Qt5 (http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qqueue.html) is not present in PyQt? I couldn't import it and then realized it isn't in this list of PyQt5 classes: http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt5/Is this true? If so, is there a reason? and an alternative short of implementing my own class(Reference: This commit on Github and discussion in comments)
It is obviously not possible for PyQt/PySide to support template classes, since they depend on a feature that is specific to C++.In general, you should just use the equivalent built-in python type instead (or, where applicable, whatever implementation is currently available in the standard library - e.g. queue.Queue or collections.deque).PS:Regarding  - this signal is available in PyQt-5.8.2, and has been since at least PyQt-5.3.2 (which is the oldest version I can check). The  signal is obsolete, and should not be used in new code.PPS:PyQt5 is certainly not "still in development" (but PySide for Qt5 is).
