I have a dataframe like thisI now want to select all columns of this dataframe where the entries in column  start with  followed by five numbers.From here I learned how one would do this if it started just with  without the numbers:Something like thisdoes of course not work. How would one do this properly?
Option 1 Use it as a filterOption 2Custom list comprehension using string methods Use it as a filterTiming 
You can use  and pass a regex pattern:Here the pattern evaluates to  - start with character r, and then  looks for 5 digits looks for a character pattern, not a regex pattern which is why it failsRegarding the difference between  and , they are analagous but  uses  whilst  uses  which is more strict, see the docs.editTo answer your comment add  so that it matches a specific number of characters, see related:
