This question already has an answer here:Find nearest value in numpy array                    15 answers                I have a list of some random numbers (integers and floats)I have found out the average/ mean value of the list:This outputs 10.72  .Now, I have to find the closest number to avg from the list list1 .In the above eg, from list1 the closes number to 10.72 is 9.One way is to find the difference between the avg and each element in the list, and then look for the smallest difference and then output that element producing smallest difference, But I was looking for more crisp and efficient way, please suggest me one. 
You can use built-in min() function and find minimum distance from your number
