I have a dict of int, list. What I'm trying to do is loop through `something' and if the key is present in the dict add the item to the lsit or else create a new list and add the item.This is my code.My question is two-fold.1. I get the following error,What am I missing that's leading to the error.How can I run this algorithm of checking key and adding to a list in a dict more pythonically.
You set a list first, then replace that list with the value:Drop that last line, it breaks your code.Instead of using , you could use the  method to assign an empty list when the key is missing, and at the same time return the value for the key:This one line replaces your 6  lines.You could also use a  object:andFor missing keys a list object is automatically added. This has a downside: later code with a bug in it that accidentally uses a non-existing key will get you an empty list, making matters confusing when debugging that error.
