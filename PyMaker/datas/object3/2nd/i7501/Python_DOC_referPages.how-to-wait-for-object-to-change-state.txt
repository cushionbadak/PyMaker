Inside my  handler I want to wait until task's state is changed. For now, I just check the state in an endless loop and wait. Here is an example, the  function:Is there a better way for doing that?
Just to avoid confusion: I guess you are not talking about asyncio.Task, but some variable state instead, right?In this case you have Future and synchronization primitives that allows you to wait some thing changed asynchronously. If you need to switch between two states, asyncio.Event is probably what you want. Here's little examle:Upd:More complex example that keeps  interface:
Isn't it an example of Observer design pattern? I think the Observer pattern can solve this problem. In this design pattern, we don't need to iterate infinitey to detect the change rather the task itself will inform if it has committed any change. A simple implementation could be:Output:
