I would like to get a percentage from initial values based on results, but only for result greater than 100, otherwise return initial value. At the moment there is a check for both results  and if I add a filter to generator expression , variable assignment will fail. In summary, it should skip calculation if result is less than 100 but run otherwise, so if results are (500, 0) function should return (250, 75). What would be the pythonic way to do this?
The  function returns a Boolean value, so  doesn't do what you want. As  is a subclass of  in Python, the comparison won't raise an exception in either Python 2 or Python 3.The proper way would be to use a generator expression as an argument to . Also, you could make   and  keyword arguments if they're only used in the function:Update: if you want to skip calculation if a result is less than 100, you could use a generator with a ternary operator:Or with :
