It should be like this:But a better option isOr even better, convert to lowercase directly at the input. Sidenote:If you want to compare a value with several values, you can do like this:But in this case that's not an optimal option. Just convert to lowercase before comparing.Here is complete code:And a testrun:One thing you should consider, which in this case would have made it easier for you to discover the problem, is to always add an  in case of non-valid input.
Your branch  will always be taken and you will always calculate a rectangle.  Why it does this makes more sense if you put in parentheses.If  is 'triangle' the first part evaluates to False but the second part of the or-condition evaluates to  since in Python a non-empty string in a boolean context is considered True.To get the effect you want you need to say
