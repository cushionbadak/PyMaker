I know that dicts and sets aren't ordered, so equal sets or dicts may print differently (all tests with Python 3.6.1):And I just realized that  (“pretty-print”) sorts dicts but not sets:It's documentation also says "Dictionaries are sorted by key before the display is computed". But why doesn't it also sort sets? Doesn't seem pretty to me. And is there a way to make it sort sets? Also inside nested structures, as that's a main purpose of .
This was raised in issue 27495 and it is a bug, rather than just a design choice, but apparently has not yet been resolved.Here is another example from the issue that illustrates perhaps more obviously the behavior you identify in Python 3:The same applies for  too, but note that multi-line  outputs are sorted in Python 3, for example:However, in Python 2, the output from the same original code is sorted:I think it is the inconsistency between Python 3 and Python 2, and between the single-line multi-line behavior, that makes this a bug. For s, a similar example, illustrates as you note, that the output is sorted in either Python 3 or 2, as it should be:However, for Python 3.6, it could be considered surprising that  sorts s since they are ordered now. However, since this is just an implementation detail (for now) I guess there is no obligation for  to maintain the insertion order (yet), and doing so would break 's own consistency across Python versions of always sorting s.
