Looks like you could make the from optional and the import required atthe same time ignoring the as.    https://regex101.com/r/fmoAuh/1 Explained  Or, if you want to match the as but do not want to capture anything, use this.   https://regex101.com/r/xFtey5/1Expanded  
Instead of using a regex, using the built in python library ast might be a better approach.  https://docs.python.org/2/library/ast.html  You can use it to parse python syntax.that will give you ['abc.lmn', 'abc'] and it is fairly easy to tweak if you want to pull other information.
