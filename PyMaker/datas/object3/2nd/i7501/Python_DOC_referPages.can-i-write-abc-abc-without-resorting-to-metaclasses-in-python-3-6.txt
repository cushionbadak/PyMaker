Python 3.6 added PEP 487, which adds an  method among other things.  Is it possible to write a version of  that doesn't use a metaclass?
If all you care about is the check for abstract methods, then yes. Just move the abstract method set computation to the  method:The base  implementation then uses an non-empty  set to prevent instantiation. But ABCs also support virtual subclass registration; the two hook methods this requires have to be implemented on the metaclass.
