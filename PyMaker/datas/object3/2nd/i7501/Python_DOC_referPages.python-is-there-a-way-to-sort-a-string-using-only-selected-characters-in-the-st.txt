For example, is there a way to sort the following:using only the integer that comes after "model"? I have tried to capture only these integers using  to get the integers to sort, but I'm unable to use the sorted result to locate back the original strings since there will be some duplicates, like '1' belongs to both  and  and it won't be possible to distinguish the two.Is there an elegant way to do this?EDIT: To clarify, the following strings are in a dictionary, and I'm wanting to sort such that 1 is the smallest and 13 is the largest.
a version using regex:the regular expression  captures the numbers  (greedy) after the string . in the  of  this is then converted to an .i assumed your input is in a list called  of the form:if it is just the string you presented you'd have somehow bring it into this form.a little less verbose (no named group) the very same could be achieved like this:
Given this input:You can do the following:Which results in this:But as I said in the comments, a regex solution feels more appropriate here.
