Natural Text
I'm trying to export the list generated to a csv file where each row in the website table corresponds to a new row in the file and each value is in an individual cell, such as:NAME.....ICO DATE....ICO PRICE....CURR. PRICE....24 HR ROI  Stratis.....06/20/16.......$0.007...........$7.480................+38.80%The current output looks like this:['Patientory\n05/31/17\n$0.104\n$0.274\n+46.11%\n+25.54%\nN/A']
In , each  contains the row text separated by newlines  - same as your example of the output. So appending  appends a list with a single item for the full row. Change that to:Ex:Additionally, in your writing loop, you shouldn't re-create the  for every row, just do it once before looping over .And since you have all the rows you want in , you can use  directly.
Try this code:
