I am new to Python and am not sure why you must import before you can call a module or function. Does anyone have an answer to this? And thanks in advance. An example would look like:
You must import a module in Python before you use a method from it because otherwise, the interpreter doesn't know what to do when you call a method from said module. Some functions in python, like  can be called without importing any modules, but for others like , the module isn't imported by default, so you need to import it before use.
Practically,  and  and all of those classes that you need to import are actually other Python files. They are code, written by the people that made Python, and designed to make your job easier.Think of  as just copy-and-pasting the source code from those modules to the top of your program. It just means that your code can now use all of that code, too. The reason that it is not all imported by default is thus because there would be a lot of overhead from all of those modules, when you might not even use them.Without importing, the interpreter wouldn't know what to do when you used a function from  (or any other imported module), because it wouldn't have the code to do it.Likewise, you can actually import your own code if you wanted to. So if, for example, you made a really cool implementation of a stack, you could  that code that you wrote into your other Python files so that you can also use it in those.Read more about : https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html
