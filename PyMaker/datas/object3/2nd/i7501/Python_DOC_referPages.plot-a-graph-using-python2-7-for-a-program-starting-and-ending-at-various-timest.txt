I have a program that is starting and ending at various times and I have captured the timings.  Example: The start and end times are paired together for an instance in a tuple as shown below.      I want to plot the curve for the start, end times for the program and a meaningful graph. Please provide me ideas how to do plot this in Python 2.7. I tried to run this, but get Value ErrorTest Data:  [('05:43:44', '05:59:32', '06:14:46', '06:41:16'),('05:43:51', '05:59:39', '06:41:03', '06:42:57')]* Error: 
You need to convert your data to datetime objects using the  module. Below is a complete example for the data you provided:This produces the following graph:You can better format the x axis by using :which gives:
Looks like you want to generate a best fit for plotting start times against end times. You can use matplotlib to do this:You can use polyfit to generate best fit lines/curves as desired. Hope this helps at least give a general idea of what to do, even if it's not exactly what you were looking for.
