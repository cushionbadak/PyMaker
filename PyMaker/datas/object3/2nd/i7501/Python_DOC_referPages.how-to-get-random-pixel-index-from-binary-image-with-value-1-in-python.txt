I have a binary image of large size (2000x2000). In this image most of the pixel values are zero and some of them are 1. I need to get only 100 randomly chosen pixel coordinates with value 1 from image. I am beginner in python, so please answer.  
I'd suggest making a list of coordinates of all non-zero pixels (by checking all pixels in the image), then using  on the list and taking the first 100 elements.
After importing necessary libraries like Try to send all these values into a file in this formatpositive data frame contains all the pixel positions whose value is 1.Now you can randomly select any value from  &  arrays.Note: Make sure that your pixel values will be 1 or 0. If your values are 0 and 255 then change this command
