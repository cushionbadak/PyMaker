From https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/functions.html#object does not have a , so you can’t assign arbitrary attributes to an instance of the  class.Why " does not have a "? It works for meWhy "you can’t assign arbitrary attributes to an instance of the  class"?
You are confusing the  on the type with the attribute on instances.  instances do not have a  attribute:Note that the  attribute of custom Python class instances is a descriptor; the instance itself doesn't have the attribute, it is the class that provides it (so  is returned).  may exist, but  does not. doesn't support instance attributes because it is the base for all custom Python classes, which must support not having a  attribute when defining slots instead.
