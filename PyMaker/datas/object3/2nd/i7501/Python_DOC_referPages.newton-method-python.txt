Ok, so i found this code for finding the roots of a function using the Newton method, but i need a way to insert the function as an input. I´ve tried all i know.This is for a Programming Fundamentals course, so it needs to be as simple as it gets. I´d appreciate your help very much.EDITWhat i need is to have the user insert the function. I don't want to make it part of the code.With a more clear explanation:I need to have an input prompt where i ask the user for a function (i.e. "Please insert your function: 2*x**2 + 6*x + 12")and another one for the derivative of the function (i.e. "Please insert the derivative: 4*x + 6)and have the program find the roots just like the one posted, without having them as part of the proper code. NOTE: This is the first time i post here and programming isn't my area, but i have always found the answers here. Please be patient and thanks for the help.
note that you should never ever ever use eval on untrusted user input, and never ever ever in production code should eval be used!a much better way to create user functions is to prompt them for coefficientsie
