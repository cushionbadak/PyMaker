when running  on macOS I get the errorTraceback (most recent call last):  File "/usr/local/bin/django-admin", line 2, in       from django.core import management  ImportError: No module named django.coreI checked out this question but running  won't produce any output in a python3 shell. is a symlink to .I already put  in my PYTHONPATH as suggested in other questions.Am I missing something?
Even if you make it work, it is not good practice to do what you're doing! Ideally, the only python-related binaries you would want in /usr/local/bin/ would be python, pip and virtualenv (or venv, pyvenv)...I would suggest you to delete  ONLY IF you installed it there. As far as I know, macOS only comes with python2.7 installed and not python3.6!Then open a new shell and try this:skip the first step if you already have brew installed
Check your permissions in  with an  command. If you see anything owned by , this probably needs to change. I suspect that since you installed some packages as root, the permissions are weird and it can't find the module. If this is the case, reinstall the package(s) as your own user using . Another thing you should check: as phd mentioned you need to make sure you're using the version of  you think you are. Check this by running  to tell you the location of the one you're referencing, and  to tell you which version you're using. If it's not Python 3.6, then you installed Django for a different version of Python. In this case, simply install Django for version 3.6 and you'll be on your way.For future reference, Python offers a module called  to prevent version mishaps like this. More info can be found here.
It seems like you are trying to create or work on a django project without using a python virtual environment.  I recommend reviewing the python 3 venv documenation (https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).  Then creating a virtual environment (venv) specifically for your web application.  Once you you that project's venv setup you can install django into that venv.
On MacOS, use sudo before the command:
