I have the last set of values of an iteration: (which was obtained by doing the integration of coupled ODE)Now I need to assign these values to another variables : Y1,Y2,Y3 and then use these variables in a function f(y,t) (ODEs that has to be integrated again).This is part of my code:TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for ** or pow(): 'function' and  'int'keeps showing up.The link to the complete code is here:https://pastebin.com/mdQE29N9 (might help in understanding what I am trying to achieve and the code is too lengthy to be posted here)I think the problem is with the way I have assigned the values,but am not so sure. Any help here as to what is causing this and how I am supposed to solve this would be great.
You have an error in line 57:in expression , where  is defined as a function in line 62:I'm guessing you really meant to say: .But that's not all. Line 52:No need to test for equivalence between  and  (that's what  returns). I'm not sure what you tried to achieve here, maybe this?Also, to access the last element of  (line 66), you can use a negative index:
You have a variable named H and a function named H()andChange the name of the variable or the function for something else.As @randomir says, you probably want to look at his answer tooYou can reproduce the error by simple doing:TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for ** or pow(): 'function' and  'int'
