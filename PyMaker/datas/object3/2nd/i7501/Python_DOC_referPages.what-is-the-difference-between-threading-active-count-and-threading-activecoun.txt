Working with the Python library  I came across the  function which returns the number of active threads. But the  function, which returns the exact same thing. Even their help string are exactly the same.So my question is, what is the difference?If they are exactly the same, doesn't this go against PEP 20, The Zen of Python, where it says:Could this be a backward compatibility issue?
Python basically cloned the Java API for the threading interface, and so it keeps two versions of names: those using Python's preferred underscores, and those in camelCase for backwards compatibility. The comments in the threading module say:Note regarding PEP 8 compliant names. This threading model was originally inspired by Java, and inherited the convention of camelCase function and method names from that language. Those original names are not in any imminent danger of being deprecated (even for Py3k),so this module provides them as an alias for the PEP 8 compliant names. Note that using the new PEP 8 compliant names facilitates substitution with the multiprocessing module, which doesn't provide the old Java inspired names.You can see they are just aliases for each other:At one commit, the CPython implementation actually removed the old functions, however, they reintroduced and temporarily deprecated them to avoid backwards compatibility issues. You should not use the camelCase functions for new code. Although they are not visibly deprecated right now, the camelCase functions are not explicitly documented and you should prefer the PEP8 versions.
