Natural Text
I need a regex that matches the below link patterns as follows. ->  ->  -> My regex isIt works find for the case two. But I wonder why this doesn't return  in case of occurrence of  in link.
Your regex matches the  prefix, and nothing more. It doesn't matter that the string contains more text beyond that  after the version number.You need to include anchors, to make sure you are not just matching a substring. Use  and  to anchor to the start and end of a string, so there is no room left for other strings. You need to match paths that don't include any  characters:I also escaped the dots in the hostname, you don't want to match 'any' character, you want to match literal  characters.  matches one digit (so  and  for major Python versions, but no more).Online demo: https://regex101.com/r/gL7X7o/3Python demo using Python documentation URLs:
