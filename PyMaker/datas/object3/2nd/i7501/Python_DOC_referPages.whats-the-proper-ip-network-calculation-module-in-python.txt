Natural Text
Since "The Zen of Python" tells us "There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it." I would like to ask what is the best upstream module to use for IP and/or network calculations?I found the following:  ipcalc - which seems to be maintained no more (bug issues open for >2 years)netaddr - which seems to do exactly what I want and has a great documentation (I'm using this one at the moment)ipaddress - which seems to have more or less the same functionality as netaddr (but with a more clumsy interface, telling from documentation)ipaddr - which may be something like that telling from the few words on the github repo (can't seem to find a real documentation)Maybe there are even more?I would really like to know what the community thinks is the best way to go.
May not be the best, but ipaddress is part of The Python Standard Library, so it would be definitely my first choice.
