Natural Text
I want to find the first float that appears in a string using Python 3.I looked at other similar questions but I couldn't understand them and when I tried to implement them they didn't work for my case.An example string would be
I'm pretty sure there's more elegant solution, but this one works for your specific case:Hope it helps!
You can find this using regex, notice this pattern will only return the substring if it's already in  type, i.e. decimal fomatting, so something like this:As you say you want only the first one:Edit: Added  to the pattern for it to recognize negative floats, as pistache recommended!
If you expect whitespace separated decimal floats, using  methods and removing : is used to remove the sign only on the lefthand side of the text, and the third argument to  is used to replace only one dot in the text. The exact implementation depends on the how you expect floats to be formatted (support whitespace between sign, etc).
I would use a regex. below also checks for negative values.You can use PyRegex to check the regex.
