I have a list of timestamps all converted to integers. How can I split them into separate lists of 2-second intervals?I would like to split them into intervals of 2 seconds so that I am able to print out the results of each interval.Intended output:Thanks.
You can use a simple for loop to group items spanning a maximum difference of 2:If the elements are not sorted, you can call  to do a presort before grouping.For code reuse (imports and all that), you can create a grouper class and then use  for grouping:And then the grouping is now simplified to:
You could try this - determine the range of minimum and maximum values of  and then check if each element is within the interval if 2 seconds :Returns:
