Here the  inherits the , but every time I call the parent method there is the error:.and also the object stored in the list returns a  value??
It's unclear where that error could be coming from since  is only called by the  statement at the end of your code, which wouldn't produce it (although the return value of the  method is always , since there's no explicit  statement in it).Regardless, to answer the titular question, to do that explicitly you would use the  methodâ€”but that's not the problem here which is that the  class shouldn't be a subclass of  at all, since it's not a specialization of the  class...rather it's a container of  instances.Below is reworked version of your code that shows how to separate these two classes and get most if not all of the methods working. It also now mostly follows PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code recommendations.
You shouldn't use inheritance in this case. Here's corrected version (also fixed code style):
