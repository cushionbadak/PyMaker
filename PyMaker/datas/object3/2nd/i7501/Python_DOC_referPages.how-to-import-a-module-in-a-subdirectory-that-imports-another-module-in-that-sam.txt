Imports from .. or . should work:remember to add  (empty file) inside app directory. Edit: it could be done only if using foo and bar as modules. E.g. you would not be able to run "python foo.py" or "python foo.bar". Outside of app directory, you could try the code with:(mind the lack of .py extension)
This is mainly because when run  directly, Python would use the directory where  locates as the current running directory, thus when you  directly in , Python interpreter will try to find  module in that running directory, where  doesn't exist apparently. That is the reason why relative import is needed, as answered by @Robert Szczelina.If you run  directly, the sentense  will be right.
