I've installed pip and updated it to the latest version however when I type "pip install curses" into the command prompt I get an reply stating "Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement curses (from versions: )No matching distribution found for curses"Can anyone help me please?
See http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#curses for other versions. Heed the warning: «Unicode characters are not supported.»
