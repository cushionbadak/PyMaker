I've been told that iterating over a list as such is not appropriately pythonic. How do I make this part...more pythonic. BackgroundI'm working on a problem (the last problem called hangman) assigned MIT OC. I am working on this stuff by myself. So far the material is accessible and well taught. However, since I don't have a supervisor coupled with the awareness of how bad habits can develop when doing I would really appreciate it if anyone could look at my code and see if I'm doing anything wrong - from the use of idioms or my structuring of my code. Any feedback is appreciated.Thank you all!        I have tried doing this...but I encountered trouble where if a letter appears twice in a word it isn't replaced.
