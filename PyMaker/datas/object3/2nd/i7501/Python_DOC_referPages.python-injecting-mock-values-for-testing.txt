I have a situation where I have in a Flask web app a function several layers down from the handler that I want to unit test. The function takes in a few parameters and changes them depending on reading different values from a database. Roughly like this:How can I test this function from the outside in a standalone way so that I can simulate the read_d_from_database() etc returning different values each time?
