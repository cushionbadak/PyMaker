Given that I have a target location for a multi-dimensional list. I.e. an index stored in a variable.How do I access list[target]?
If  is given as a list of indices like , you can use :Note that this won't work if you've used  as a name for your variable. Never use the names of builtins for your variables. Name it  or something more descriptive.
You can't do this directly because list[variable] will become an entry of the list; the variable must be an index.So what you need is some way to get list[variable][variable][variable]This can't be done with a simple variable sadly, even though it would be really cool.The best way to do it would be to make a recursive function to do it, which takes your list  and returns the value, as so.Then you would call it as a normal function, giving your list and target () as parameters.
