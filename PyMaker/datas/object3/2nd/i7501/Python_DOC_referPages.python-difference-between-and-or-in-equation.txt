all.I'm running a simple python program and I found when I use , it passed the test. However, if I use , it didn't.So, apparently, there are some differences between these two operators in equations. Does anyone have some idea what's going on?Thanks!
For sets (which are your operands here),  returns the union of both sets (the operands), while the  operator returns the first truthy operand (a non-empty set) or the last, if all of the operands are falsy â€” making  a short-circuit operator.Consider the following examples:Notice that with two operands, if at least one of the operands is falsy, both  and  give the same results.'s behaviour is consistent for all objects, while  would behave differently depending on how the operands implement the  or  magic methods e.g. acts as the bitwise or for integer types and [max-]union for  objects.
