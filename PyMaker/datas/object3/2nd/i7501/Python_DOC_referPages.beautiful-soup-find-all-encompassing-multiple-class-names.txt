Natural Text
I am attempting to use the beautifulsoup find_all function within a for loop to return either one of two td elements with different classes. The td elements are within an html div element. There are multiple divs which are being iterated through by the for loop and each one will hold either one of two td elements with different classes. My goal is to grab the text from within the td elements but I am having trouble finding a way to make it so both td classes are acceptable for the find_all function.I want to use one find_all to grab either of these td elements, whichever one is present within the current div element.sample html looks like this:My code looks something like this:I am getting an error: AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'contains'So I am assuming from this that when one td class is not present python is still trying to use .contains() on a None type which it doesnt like.Does anyone know of a way I can achieve this? Any help/examples are much appreciated. Thanks in advance
The function is given each  attribute value (; then whole class attribute value (unless no previous call returned for the element). But  is passed is passed argument if there no  attribute.So you need to check .Or for you case simple  should be enough:BTW, there's no  method, but  method (, membership test operator will use it):
I figured out another way to do it, probably a lot less robust that what falsetru came up with.This also works fine in my case because if class2 is not present in the div it returns []. But falsetru has the right idea
