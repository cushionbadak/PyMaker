what is the best module in python for multi thread management ?1.Create N number of threads   2.Assigning work to thread if it is free   3.Getting the status of the thread   4.killing a thread
You could use the threading module.https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#module-threadingYou could also use concurrent.futureshttps://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.htmlKeep in mind that Python doesn't support true threading because of the global interpreter lock. As a result you would typically use threading for IO bound tasks.https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLockIf you could be a little more specific with what you are trying to accomplish in # 1-4 I could give an applicable example.
