I am trying to write a program to calclulate digits of pi using the Nilakantha Series in python. Every time it runs though it will not give me more than 50 decimals. Still learning python so any help is appreciated.
You are not using the Decimal class to calculate Pi, but rather the float class.  affects Decimal, not float.If you want to use Decimal, modify your code to convert to Decimal before looping. Note that AFAIK, the value of Pi is not available as a decimal in Python, so you need to get the value from someplace else (http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/~huberty/math5337/groupe/digits.html).
