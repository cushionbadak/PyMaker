I am new to flask and python. I have a website to which users can log in. I need to improve the security.what i want to do is: when a user try many wrong passwords, I ban him further trying, ask him email and ask the user to reset password in the case the user forget the password.I reviewed documentations about flask-admin, flask-secure. Since I am new to this, don't know where to start.does flask-secure provide features to do what I want? or should I look into something also?
I'm not sure if I approve of this feature. But it could be achieved by either a field in the user table of your database or a runtime dictionary. Choose whichever gives you the level of persistence you want. When a user attempts to log in and fails you simply increment this field. And if the field reaches a certain value you lock the user or do whatever you want. Sending an email in python can be found at the docs. As for a password reset system. When a user needs to reset their password you generate a key. This can be a base64-encoded string of random bytes. This key can be stored in the user table with en expiry datetime.Now you can create a route in flask that takes this key as path- or query-parameter.So when a user needs to reset their password you can send them a unique link with this key as a path- or query-param (whichever you choose).
