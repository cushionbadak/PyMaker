I'd be surprised if this hasn't been asked yet.Let's say I have an array  and I want to check if the sequence  appears in it (which it does). Order does matter.How would I do this?
Just for fun, here is a quick (very quick) and dirty (very dirty) solution (that is somewhat flawed, so don't really use this):The RightWayâ„¢ is likely to use list.index() to find candidate matches for the first element and then verify the full match with slicing and list equality:Edit: The OP clarified in a comment that the subsequence must be in order but need not be in consecutive positions.  That has a different and much more complicated solution which was already answered here:  How do you check if one array is a subsequence of another?
Here is a good solution: As mentioned by Stefan Pochmann this can be rewritten as:
Here's a solution that works (efficiently!) on any pair of iterable objects: comes from itertools recipes.
