I was assuming that statements of the formwere only for packages and modules, but not for an object in a module, so for instance if  contains , I am not able to doHere's the perceived inconsistency: assume that  and  have the same name, for instance let's say both are called . And, in the  of  I havethen doingwill import the object , not the module .This only works if  is the same name for both the object and the module.
The official explanation can be found in the docs:The import statement first tests whether the item is defined in the package; if not, it assumes it is a module and attempts to load it. If it fails to find it, an ImportError exception is raised.It seems that  appears to think the object  from the module  is a module, which is why the  works but yields the object instead.As far as a workaround goes, if you try the , that will rename the attribute and get around the name shadowing. It should yield the result you're looking for - a path import of the module  (since Python will see type ) and not an object import of the variable .Here is some code output to help illustrate things more clearly:Here I did  in the  of  and I set the  variable to 1 in .
