Is there any case where doing:might lead to an ? All cases I've tried seem to indicate that this always works. The docs on  don't seems to state anything on the matter.  To give some context: I am trying to inject some names in  using the  hook in order to (mainly) have them available when the REPL fires up. Granted that no redefinitions of  occur (as a comment stated), this essentially boils down to if I need to wrap it in a  or not.
It probably is. Python initializes  in this file:https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Python/pylifecycle.c#L1327However please note that modules like  and  replace the  module with their own dynamically created ones to prevent collisions with their own launch scripts and to provide expected behaviour in case of runpy.runpy itself is part of the Python Standard Library and provides the implementation of the  flag which allows arbitrary modules to be executed as script.An alternative is IPython which offers the feature to execute code at the launch of a new REPL.For more details, see here: http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config/intro.html?highlight=exec_lines
