So I am working on creating a program in Python that reads a .ini file to set up some boot variables for the main program.  My only thing is, I want the program on initialization, to check if the .ini file exists, and if it doesn't, create it with a set of default values.  Kind of a preemptive bug fix on if someone accidentally deletes the file.I can't seem to find any examples anywhere of how to do this, and I'm not super experienced with Python (only been programming with it for about a week) so I'd appreciate any assistance :)EDIT: Upon further thought, I want to pursue this a bit further.Let's assume the file does exist.  How do I check it to make sure it has the appropriate sections?  If it doesn't have the appropriate sections, how would I go about deleting the file or removing the contents and rewriting the contents of the file?I'm trying to idiot proof this :P
You can use ConfigParser and the OS library, here's a quick example:Output:Linked above are the docs that are extremely useful to learn more about writing configuration files and other in-built modules.Note: I'm kind of new to python, so if anyone knows a better approach let me know I'll edit my answer!
