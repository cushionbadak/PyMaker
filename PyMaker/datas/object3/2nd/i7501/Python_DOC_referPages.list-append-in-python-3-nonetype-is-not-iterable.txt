I am trying to add every word in  to an empty list.I thought this code was okay but  returns a traceback saying File "test.py", line 13, in <module>      if i in lst:  TypeError: argument of type 'NoneType' is not iterablehere's my code:
ExplanationYou are making the same mistake twice. The first place you are making this error and the reason why you are getting the current error you are seeing is because of this: The  method actually performs the append in place. The actual return of that call is going to be , because it doesn't return anything. It doesn't need to, since it does the work on the list.So, to narrow down exactly what is going on. When you did .  will now hold . So, the next time it goes through its loop and you get here:You are checking if  is in . Since now  will hold , it is exactly here where your error message gets raised and you are seeing that .To replicate:SolutionTo solve this, you just need perform the append like:Second MistakeYou are also making the same mistake when calling  here:It is again a method that performs its work in place, therefore you just need:Extra NoteDon't forget to close your file at the end of your code (or when you are done using the file: Ideally, it is always best to use a context manager as explained in the other answer here. Since the context manager does all the "cleanup" work for you. 
Your problem is this line: does not return a new list, it works in-place and returns . That means you're only assigning  to . So when you try to use  in your next iteration, it fails. Just remove the assignment to :Note you also make the same mistake here: works in-place. Remove the assignment.Your code can also be improved in several ways:Use the context manger to open your file. This ensures that your file will always close.Since you appear to be filtering duplicates from your list, you can use a set instead to remove the duplicates, and sort the remaining words afterwards as @Julien suggested.Here is how the new code would look:
If you want to avoid the loop, you can use sets:Simply put, a set cannot have duplicates.
Hello Maxine Mou,Python 3 learning for best website,1. https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python3/2. https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/3. https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/Difference between python 2 and python 3,1. http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_python_2_3_key_diff.html2. https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-major-differences-between-Python-2-and-Python-3The close() MethodThe close() method of a file object flushes any unwritten information and closes the file object, after which no more writing can be done.Python automatically closes a file when the reference object of a file is reassigned to another file. It is a good practice to use the close() method to close a file.Syntax Your Mistake  When you write below function so it is not proper way because python is understood like as iterable object so you get error so only write lst.append(i).lst = lst.append(i)Second mistake same as first. If you are sorting the list using sort() function so don't need to store in any variable because Python is sorting in existing list. So only write .lst = lst.sort()Try this below code,I hope my answer is helpful. If any query so please comment.
