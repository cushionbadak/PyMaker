I'm trying to calculate the CRC32-C checksum value. I referred lot of online CRC calculators and lot of websites for writing my own crc checksum calculator. I'm not getting the expected result. From my research only "http://crccalc.com/" is giving my expected value. I see there are many approaches with tables, without tables.. etc Nothing seems to be working for me, I'm uploading simple approach program which i used to calculate crcI'm trying to get this working. Appreciate if somebody has solution for this
As far as I tested module to use CRC-32C (nasty mangling ceph objects), the best was , it does not require SSE4 like the most of its  implementations.http://crccalc.com/ gives the same results.Edit: calc for hex value is able to calc checksum for a hex value, just requires the value to be passed as bytes - method for large integers:
