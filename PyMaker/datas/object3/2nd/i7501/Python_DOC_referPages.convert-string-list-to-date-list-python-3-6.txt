I have a list of dates that python recognizes as . I need to be able to work this as dates, to be able to add and subtract days. The dates are of the form "29-Jun-2017"How can I have a date list instead of a String list?
 converts string to  object:Then,  will return  object:See  and  Behavior for other format codes.
The arrow module makes this type of calculation with dates especially easy.Here I create a short list of date strings which I convert to arrow dates. Having displayed these dates I use the  method to subtract two days from each date, creating a new list. Then I format this result for display.The dates contained in arrow objects are available as conventional Python dates suitable for use with datetime, for instance.
