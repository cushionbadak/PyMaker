I have a string I like to extract the number  between the first two . I tried this,But it doesn't work. What is wrong with my solution?
Are you sure you need regex?Here is a solution using split:In terms of what is wrong with your regex, "\" is a special character, so you should use "\\" for backslash (so " \\\u" instead of "\u"):Gives: 528341191030Docs:Regular expressions use the backslash character ('\') to indicate  special forms or to allow special characters to be used without  invoking their special meaning. This collides with Pythonâ€™s usage of  the same character for the same purpose in string literals; for  example, to match a literal backslash, one might have to write '\\'  as the pattern string, because the regular expression must be \, and  each backslash must be expressed as \ inside a regular Python string  literal.Or,use Raw String Notation
Well, you could always try this (not super elegant but works):
