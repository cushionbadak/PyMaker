I would like pass the variables into the function that uses range(). How do I pass variable C that has more then one number via one variable. Something like range(5, 10, 2)?Here is my example code: I tried passing it as a string and converting it to an integer as well as by using a list. Nothing worked.  
you can pass in the range like you mentioned with only a small change to the for loopor, as khelwood* mentioned, pass in a list/tuple and expand it with both output 30 which is expected
