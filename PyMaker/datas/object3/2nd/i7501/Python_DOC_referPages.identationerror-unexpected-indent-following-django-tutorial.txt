I'm following the tutorial on django on the following link:https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/intro/tutorial02/Specifically the part where its adding the str methods on both classes, but I'm getting the indent error!I used python before and after looking for a while I still can't see my error!See the image with the hidden characters of my code, what is it!? It's been driving me crazy:See the error when trying to run the python shell:So what could it be? I am legit running out of ideas.Thank you!
From the Python documentation https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.htmlIndentation is rejected as inconsistent if a source file mixes tabs and spaces in a way that makes the meaning dependent on the worth of a tab in spaces; a TabError is raised in that case.if you are consistent in your use of tabs and spaces this problem will go away.
