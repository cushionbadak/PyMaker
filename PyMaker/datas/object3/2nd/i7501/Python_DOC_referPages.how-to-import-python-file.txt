Sorry, this is definitely a duplicate, but I can't find the answer. I'm working in Python 3 and this is the structure of my app:I am in the  directory, running . How can I import functions from  in that script?I've set up  as follows:But I get the following error:If I just do  I don't see an error. Shouldn't the interpreter look in the current directory for modules?
before import your directories that need to be imported must have file  in that folder#solution 1 (import in runtime)To import a specific Python file at 'runtime' with a known name:#solution 2(add files to one of python libraries)also as you have a common library for you can run and see what directories you can put your code and use in every project.you can move your common package to one of this directories and treat it like a normal package.for example for common.py if you put it in one root directory of one of this directory you can import like  #solution 3(use relative import)and then go to parent directory and run
From the description I'm assuming you're not running this as complete python package, just as separate files.What you can do is use complete modules. This means adding empty  to directories with your code. You'll also have to change the name of  to , since it needs to be a valid module name.Assuming  is the name of your app, you should end up with:Next, you'll need a startup script for your app - this means either something simple like:Or you can add a  with a full package description. If you specify entry points and the script will be automatically created.Now that you're starting your code in context of a package, your  can do:
