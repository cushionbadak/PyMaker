Here is my task:Sample Alien Zip file found at /tmp/alien-zip-2092.zip is password protected  We have worked out they are using three digit code  Brute force the Zip file to extract to /tmpMy code so far:How do I break out of the loop after the password and extraction  is successful.
Entering a wrong password raises a ValueError (documentation)So you can put the unzip in a try block, pass over the exception if the password is bad, and break out of the loop when extraction was successful.I tested this code, note that the password has to be encoded as a byte string.If you print out the exception it reads: Bad password for file [and some file info]
try to use  to break out of a loop.
