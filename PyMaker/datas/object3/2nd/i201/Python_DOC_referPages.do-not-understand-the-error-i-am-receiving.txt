I have this function that I have significantly simplified that calculates the multiplicative and additive keys for decrypting an affine cipher and it works in some cases but there is this one case where it is throwing me an error and I am unsure why. Here is my code:When I give it this input, it outputs the correct answers which are 17 and 26:When I give it this input though, it throws me this error:It should output:
In  you putted a condition if those calculations are not prime return "A string". So that function returns a String and the  statement becomes likeWhich is not correctEither return 0 or do some  conditions to solve it
This function  returns different types for different cases.  If you don't pass the  test in the loop or the loop doesn't execute, you return a string instead.In general, this kind of behavior should instead be modeled with an exception.If it had, the failure mode would be more apparent.
