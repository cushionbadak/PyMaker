How to generate increasing permutations of a list in Python without  itertools.combinations:I'm trying to create a function that will produce all permutations of a list but limited to only sets of len(n) and only increasing from left to right. For instance, if I have list l = [2,4,5,7,9] and n=4, the results should include [2,4,5,7], [2,4,7,9], [2,5,7,9] but not [9,7,4,2], [9,4,7,2]. This is what I have done so far:test:
What you're describing is exactly what  does:This outputs:But if you do not want to actually use , you can refer to how it can be implemented in Python in the documentation:
