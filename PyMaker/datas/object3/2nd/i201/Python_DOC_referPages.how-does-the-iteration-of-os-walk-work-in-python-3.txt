According to the Python 3 docs  returns a 3-tuple. However, this does not work:Neither does this:It always yields:All the examples for  I found embed  in a for loop:Why? What exactly will be iterated here?  is a string,  and  are lists. However, most examples iterate again over  and :The inner for loops make sense to me, but I don't get what the outer for loop is for.And why does the assignment to the 3-tuple work when  is embedded in a for loop, but not without one?
 doesn't return a 3-tuple, it yields multiple 3-tuples. From the docs:For each directory in the tree rooted at directory top (including top itself), it yields a 3-tuple .For how yielding works, see What does the "yield" keyword do? (You can ignore the example code given by OP.) Technically  returns a generator that yields the 3-tuples.The outer  loop iterates over the 3-tuples. You're probably confused by the unpacking that happens in the same step. So to be clear,is effectively the same as
os.walk returns an generator not a tuple!If you want to look up values from your generator output convert it to a list:
