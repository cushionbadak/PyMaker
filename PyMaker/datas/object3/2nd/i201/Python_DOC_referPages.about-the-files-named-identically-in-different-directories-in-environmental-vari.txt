I installed both 'Python 3.7' and 'Anaconda', with adding the installation directories into environmental variable 'PATH'. And now when calling 'python' in windows' cmd, it turned out to be the 'Anaconda' one. Is there any possibility to call another one directly in cmd?Thanks a lot!
Try launching it through  from cmd. Basically the path is the installation folder of Python 3.7.
