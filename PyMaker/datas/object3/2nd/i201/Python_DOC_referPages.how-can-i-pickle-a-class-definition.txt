I am having troubles pickling a class importing a class from another module.Immagine I have a file classA.py with the definition of a class A:Then I have another file classB.py:If then I try to unpickle the created file from a  different directory with:I get the error:It works of course in the same folder in which I have the files classA.py and classB.py because the interpreter can find the definition of the two classes.So I guess I have to somehow bring the definition of the classes into the pickle file. How can I do that?Thank youStefano
It works of course in the same folder in which I have the files classA.py and classB.py because the interpreter can find the definition of the two classes.  So I guess I have to somehow bring the definition of the classes into the pickle file. How can I do that?That's not how it works. You don't "bring the definition of the classes into the pickle file" - which would make no sense since only the class qualified name is pickled (qualified name => packagename.modulename.classname)Instead, you have to make sure the modules where the classes are defined are importable when unpickling - "importable" meaning that the package or module's parent folder path is in your . You can do this in a few way (using PYTHONPATH environment variable, messing with  directly in your code - which is often a bad idea and sometimes the proper solution -, installing your module in virtualenv and activating this virtualenv, etc)NB: The current working directory is always first in your  which is why "It works of course in the same folder".
