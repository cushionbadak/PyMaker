My project structure is like this:Contents of :mod2 contains a class called classA.Inside mod1 I am importing classA like this:However I get an error saying "No module named base".Note:  works. However, I want to use the absolute path approach, but it does not work. Can anyone tell me what I am doing wrong?EDIT: I am executing the python script from the  directory. Also,  is in  (just verified).EDIT 2: I want to import the class in a similar way.
UPDATE 3: If you want to import a submodule from within the package directory, which is , you could use this (omitting the  part in the import) in the file/module ,The above solution also works with  and  scripts. Hope this helps =)UPDATE 2: I will demonstrate the same approach by executing a python script from the  directory,create a script called  under  directory following the same structure as "UPDATE 1", with the following contents:Also create a second script called  under  directory as well, with the following contents:Evaluate both scripts from your terminal like so,As demonstrated you should get the output of "hello" on your terminal.UPDATE 1: I created the same directory structure for your package like so under a directory called ,Contents of  is the same as yours.Contents of  is the same as yours,Contents of :Then using the  interpreter from the directory , I tested the following,If you are sure that  directory is in the  then you could try this,Also I suggest you change  to something more informative for your project.EDIT: I also suggest you check the "Packages" documentation on the Python website, which also discusses how to load a submodule.
