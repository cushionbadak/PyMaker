I have an array I want to iterate through. The array consists of strings consisting of numbers and signs. like this: â‚¬110.5MI want to loop over it and remove all Euro sign and also the M and return that array with the strings as ints.How would I do this knowing that the array is a column in a table?
You can use a string comprehension:which gives: 
You could just  the characters,   
This can be applied to a list as follows:If you want to apply it to the column of a table instead:
You can use a list comprehension to construct one list from another:str.translate replaces all occurrences of characters in the latter string with the first argument .
Try this 
You can call  on a string as often as you like. An initial solution could be something like this:At this point, you still have strings in your array. If you want to return them as ints, you can write  instead. But be aware that you will then lose everything after the floating point, i.e. you will end up with .
You can use Regex to do that.I didn't quite understand the second part of the question.
