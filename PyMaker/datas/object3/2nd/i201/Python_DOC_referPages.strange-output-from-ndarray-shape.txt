This must be python 3.From docsThe objects returned by dict.keys(), dict.values() and dict.items()  are view objects. They provide a dynamic view on the dictionaryâ€™s  entries, which means that when the dictionary changes, the view  reflects these changes.The issue is that  is only returning a dynamic view of the data in dictionary's values, Leading to the behaviour you see.Notice that the numpy array isn't resolving the view object into the actual integers, but rather just coercing the view into an array with To avoid this issue, consume the view to get a list, as follows:
