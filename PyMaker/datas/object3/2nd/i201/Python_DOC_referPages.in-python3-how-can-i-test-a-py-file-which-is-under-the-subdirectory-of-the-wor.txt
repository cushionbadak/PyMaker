Assume that the file hierarchy is like:In python2, I'd like to put some testing code below all the module code in submodule script file, and I can just run and check the result. Let the running root path be the WORKSPACE. e.g.in main.py, I would writeand in sub1.py:in python3, I have to write like this:when running directory is subdir, it will certainly stop with the import error...So I have to change pwd to the WORKSPACE. I don't think it's an elegant way, is there any other way to run in the subdir as an alternative?
It needs no directory name. For example, suppose in main.pyin /subdir/sub1.pyin /subdir/sub2.pyRegardless of WORKSPACE wherever I run sub1 would work
Just don't do it that way. Organize your package and use relative imports inside it, without mentioning the parent package name.If in need use subpackages. Lastly (or from the start depending on your mood), create a subpackage named  containing all your tests. Import what you want to test in your package from there, just like you import from any other place inside your package. Use the module  to write 's inside tests subpackage.From the package root execute  see here or customize the tests run and output report, see here. You probably want to study that help page for a while.Now you can run all your tests at once, albeit there are ways to select only some.
i guess you could addto your ,this way it'll get all the relative imports in that subfolder for you, no need to call the subfolder each timeand in  just
