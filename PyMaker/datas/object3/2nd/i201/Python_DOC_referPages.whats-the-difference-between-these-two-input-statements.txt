Natural Text
I've tried using these two input statements in python. Both the statements returns same output. What's the difference between using  and  ?and
The default action of method  on a string is to split on any grouping of white space:If you pass a literal space as the argument, however, the split is done differently, with only a literal space as the splitter, and with empty strings resulting from adjacent literal spaces:If the input has only single, ordinary spaces, there will be no observable difference.
