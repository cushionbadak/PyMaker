The information in the headers doesn't control where the message actually goes.  The second argument to  is the only place where this is controlled.  This value should be a list, not a comma-separated string.You'll notice that you could also add addresses which are neither in  or  (or a number of other headers which serve the same purpose) to effectively implement Maybe also look at  which saves you from having to separately convert your message to a string you can pass to .
Here  is a .Make it a list of email ids. Then it would work.
You need to convert your CSV string to a list like mentioned in the the other answer. With this answer I just wanted to demonstrate how can we use the python's amazing help function when stuck.
