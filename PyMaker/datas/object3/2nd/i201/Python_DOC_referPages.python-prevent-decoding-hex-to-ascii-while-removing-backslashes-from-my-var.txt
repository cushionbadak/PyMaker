I want to strip some unwanted symbols from my variable. In this case the symbols are backslashes. I am using a HEX number, and as an example I will show some short simple code down bellow. But I don't want python to convert my HEX to ASCII, how would I prevent this from happening.? I have some long shell codes for asm to work with later which are really long and removing  by hand is a long process. I know there are different ways like using  etc, but my whole script will be written in python. ThanksAt the end I would like it to print my var:
There are no backslashes in your variable:Take newline for example: writing  in Python will give you string with one character -- newline -- and no backslashes. See string literals docs for full syntax of these.Now, if you really want to write string with such backslashes, you can do it with  modifier:But if you want to convert a regular string to hex-coded symbols, you can do it character by character, converting it to number ( ==  --> ), then to hex (), and finally stripping the first character:
There are two problems in your Code.First the simple one: just removes one occurrence. So you should use . This will replace every backslash with "", which is the same as removing it. The second problem is pythons behavior with backslashes:To get your example working you need to append an 'r' in front of your string to indicate, that it is a raw string. . In raw strings, a backlash doesn't escape a character but just stay a backslash.
