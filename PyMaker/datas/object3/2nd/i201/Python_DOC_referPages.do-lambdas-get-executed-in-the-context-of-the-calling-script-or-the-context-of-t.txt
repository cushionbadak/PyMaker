If the following function is defined in a different file and returned and executed in a separate file, will it give the file name of where it was defined? Or where it was called?
This will use the filename where it was defined, i.e. . The import system populates the  attribute on each module object during module loading. Docs here.Note that there is no supported way to get the calling module's filename () here, that's only possible with hacks. Avoid.
As wim said, the function gets executed in such a way that  will return the name of the file the function is present in (File1.py).It is however possible to achieve what you want, although again as wim said it is a bit hacky. You can do this by looking at the frame records in the call stack using :File1.py:File2.py:Output:The first  indicates to look at the second frame in the call stack (the first frame being the location that called , the second being the location that called that), the second  gets the filename from the frame.
