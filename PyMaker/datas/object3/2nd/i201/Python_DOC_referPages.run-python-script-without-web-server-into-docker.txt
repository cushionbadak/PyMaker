I have been working with Docker previously using services to run a website made with Django.Now I would like to know how I should create a Docker to just run Python scripts without a web server and any service related with websited.An example of normal docker which I am used to work is:How should be the docker-compose.yml file?
You can easily run Python interactively without even having to build a container:If you want to have access to some code you have written within the container, simply change that to:Making a Dockerfile is unnecessary for this simple application.
Simply remove everything from your Dockerfile that has nothing to do with your script and start with something simple, likeYou do not need Docker compose for containerizing a single python script.The example is taken from this simple tutorial about containerizing Python applications: https://runnable.com/docker/python/dockerize-your-python-applicationYou can easily overwrite the command specified in the Dockerfile (via ) when starting a container from the image. Just append the desired command to your  command, e.g:
Most Linux distributions come with Python preinstalled.  Using Docker here adds significant complexity and I'd pretty strongly advise against Docker just to run a simple script.  You can use a virtual environment to isolate a particular Python package's dependencies from the rest of the system.(There is a pretty consistent stream of SO questions around getting filesystem permissions and user IDs right for scripts that principally want to interact with the host system.  Also remember that running  anything implies root-equivalent permissions.  If you don't want Docker's filesystem and user namespace isolation, IMHO it's easier to just not use Docker where it doesn't make sense.)
