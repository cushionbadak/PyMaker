Natural Text
I was just curious if there was a way to delete text from a string or only capture specific text when the string varies in info.Exmaples of the strings I'm working:I want to be able to extract the date and hour of the day separately and append them to a list. However obviously those vary and even the index of the hour can change as the day, month or hour can become > 10 which can push it back up to three spaces.
:This should solve your problem assuming the delimiter when the string come in are the same.
you can use regular expressionssomething likes this:this will print a tuple with the first item being the date and second item being the time and the third item being the PM or AM:  which you can easily parse yourselfEdit you can also use the datetime module to parse the date string:which will give you a datetime object which you can get all the information from
