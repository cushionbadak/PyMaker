Natural Text
so I am having trouble finding the index of the first vowel of a inputted string. When putting in the string "elephant" , "hello" , "spa" they work properly, however when I input "spam" it does not work, it returned the number 3 instead of 2. I am having trouble finding why it satisfies the else statement but not the initial if condition. I am also trying to put a condition that if there are no vowels in the string, then it should print out the index of the last character in the string. Below is my code:
Your code always return  if the character in position  is not a vowel. Also  didn't work and  works only because of the bug I mentioned, it returns  which is  and not the index of the vowel found. Try debug your code line by line and you'll figure it out very quickly.This could be a working code that return  if there's no vowel, else return the index of the first vowel found.EDITIf you want to return the last character if there's no vowels just change  with . Here:
You should use  to handle tracking the index for you
Either  statement jumps out of your  loop immediately, without looking at the rest of the word. Additional problem: since you start with , the function never even looks at the first character, which would be .I think your main issue is that you meant for your  statement to be executed if the  loop completed and exited without finding a vowel. As indented, though, it's part of the  statement in the  loop, and executes whenever the second character isn't a vowel. You want something more like this:And then whatever you want the function to return if the word has no vowels.
