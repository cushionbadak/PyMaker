Natural Text
I have some code that prints stuff to console using some of the  function's capabilities, e.g.In other cases I will use the  parameter to write multiple strings to a single line, i.e. My question is how could I most easily write this  formatted output to a stream, a file, or even better just collect into a single string object? If I revert to regular string formatting the syntax will be different and I'll need to re-write all my formatting.
StringIO allows you to use a string as if it were a file. Along with using  you can then do:which givesas (I think) you want. You can also use  if you want a list of strings for each line.You can also use a tempfile which may use the filesystem (but may not), with almost identical syntax:You do need to specify the  as the default gives a binary file which doesn't let you , and explicitly rewind back to the beginning before reading. (FWIW, an earlier version of my answer had  for each  but I don't think that's needed.)
