I am trying to make a complete function, that takes in an expression:Now I want to do , and then it should do Z = X + Y. It doesn't do that. I have tried doing the same with  instead of , but no luck.
It sounds like you want to pass a "formula" that computes  from  and . Rather than using  or  and running into issues with namespaces, a better way to do that is to pass in a function. As user s3cur3 commented, an easy way to do that is with a  expression:If you need more complicated logic that you can fit in a lambda, you can write out a full function if you need to:
I assume you mean to pass to your function like so (to calculate Z),If so, why not just pass to separate values (or arrays of values)? Such as,or,For a full example of this, check out Method: Stats.linregress( ) in this article (scroll down a bit).Otherwise, you could:pass the data as an array (a table of X, Y values if you will).if it is a super complex formula that will have a bunch of attributes and methods attached to it (such as including complex numbers), perhaps creating a . You could also write a function using the lambda syntax. This would give you the freedom of having an object (like I suggested above) as well as a "function" (of course they are practically synonymous). Read more in the docs.
