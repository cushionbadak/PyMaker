Natural Text

You can't use  to write to binary files.  converts arguments to  before writing to a text file object.From the  function documentation:Print objects to the text stream file, separated by sep and followed by end. [...]All non-keyword arguments are converted to strings like  does and written to the stream, separated by sep and followed by end.Bold emphasis mine. Note that the file object must be a text stream, not a binary stream.Either write to a  object wrapping your  object, call  on the  object to write  objects directly, or write to a  object and encode the resulting string value at the end.
