I have a problem with a command of python. I want my program to read a specific line from my file, and here I haven't problem. The problem is when I have to convert the line in a float (I need of float to calculate some equation). My program is:And the file coeff.txt is:that is 1.2*10^(-1)  , 6*10^(-34), 1.13*10^(-4), 6.9*10^(-16)and I get the error:ValueError: could not convert string to float: '6.00*1e-34\n'(obviously that this error is referred to each line.Can you help me, please?
Python doesn't know how to interpret  as a float. You will have to clean your data before you can actually use it.Eventually, you will want to have each line in a format like this:Looking at it closely, it seems like the only differences are the  at the end of the line, and the  in the middle.You can get rid of the newline character at the end of the string () by calling the  method, and replace  with an empty string to get to the above format.Edit: It seems like the presence of the newline character doesn't really matter - so you only need to replace the  part of your string. I'm leaving it in anyway.
Your problem is the operator *
