I've been trying to figure out how to spin up different subprocess instances and then killing them and then creating new ones. The parent python process never does, it just kills the subprocesses. I followed a lot of links on SO but I keep getting the following message once the parent python process ends:it seems interesting because I did  but I get nothing:I simply want to start a process:and kill it:the above code is essentially copied from the top answer:How to terminate a python subprocess launched with shell=Truebut I am unsure why I get this message. Am I killing the child process successfully? I plan to start and kill many of them. Note I don't know or need . I just copied that cuz thats how the answer/question I posted has it. I'd prefer to not have that parameter.according to the answer I tried:and different permutations of the above but nothing really seemed to work. Any advice?
The  warning comes from the  method of the  class.If you look at the source for that method, you'll see this comment:The solution is to ensure you call  on the child process.See the NOTES section of the man page for  for more background information.In Python, the easiest way to handle this situation is to keep track of all the  objects you have created, and ensure that something calls  on them, either directly or indirectly.Alternatively, you can install a  handler that ignores  events; then your child processes will disappear immediately, but you will now be unable to call  on them. See also How can I prevent zombie child processes? and How can I handle SIGCHLD?
