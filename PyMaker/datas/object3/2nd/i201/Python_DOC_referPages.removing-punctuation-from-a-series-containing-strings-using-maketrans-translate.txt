Natural Text
I want to remove punctuation from strings in a series.I am using python3.6 and maketrans(), translate() functions to do this. However, it does not give me the results I want. Here are two sentences before code:Here is my code:Sentences after the code:So I am wondering why  is not , it seems the code is not replacing the  with a space . Whereas in the second setences, it seems to be replacing the punctuations with spaces.I did not include in the code snippet above, but I also lowercased all of my sentences.Any suggestions on why this might be happening?Thanks
If you want to replace each punctuation character with space:Out:And there's a very good overview of other methods here:Fast punctuation removal with pandas
It's not replacing it with spaces in the second sentence. You have spaces in your original string between the punctuation characters which are simply being preserved.See https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.maketrans for details on how this works.
