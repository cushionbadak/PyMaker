I have built a lambda that collect logs from a EC2 instance and uploads them to a S3 buckets on a daily basis. The logs are stored as .gz files, and now I want to build another lambda that collects the most recently uploaded log file, unzips it, writes it to a CSV file and then pushes it back up to the s3. I've managed to collect a log file, unzip it and push it back up but I would like some directions how to target the most recent file in the s3 bucket, and how to write it to a CSV before pushing it back up.I'm using Python for my lambda, and this is how my code looks like right now:
You don't need to worry about querying the latest object in S3. Just use a S3 Event that triggers your Lambda function.This means that whenever you Lambda in invoked, it will be invoked with the last inserted object on S3, therefore the most recent.
