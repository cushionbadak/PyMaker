Natural Text
I have a structured string fed in via a socket to my Python script which is able to receive UDP syslog data from another item on my network.  This string is in the format of this:... with numerous key-value pairs in the string. (Note that  is valid where  is empty and would be interpreted as , apparently, with this firewall's syslog implementation)I for the life of me have not figured out how to properly split this out to get the key-value pairs into a dict file in Python.  Simply splitting on spaces won't work because some of the double-quoted strings contain spaces.Does anyone have a nifty way to split out the data and parse it into a dict object so I can directly reference log values in it rather than having to constantly split out specific data from the string each time with long regex, etc.?
