I have this error, when Im trying to save my form with the data. The form:View:What's wrong with it?
You've added an unexpected parameter to the  function of your form. If you're not using this form in a non-standard way, then this parameter will be filled in with  data by Django. To fix that error, you must either overwrite a section of generic view that you're using to include that extra data or pass it in another way.
