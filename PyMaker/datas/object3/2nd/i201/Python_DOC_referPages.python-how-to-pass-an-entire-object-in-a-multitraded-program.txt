I'm started a concurrent program using Python. I have a simple question:I'm using the class Thread to create several concurrent processes.I would like these threads to pass objects to each other (so I would like that a thread not only notice a certain event, but takes an object from this event (when it happens)!).How can I do this? Thanks a lot!Example of code:
You can use  to communicate between threads. There is simple example of two threads. One thread puts items on the one side of the  and the other take them. The  can be also used for multi-producer multi-consumer application (but before implementing plan how it should work).The  are only to slow it down for demonstration. There is documentation for QueueNote: Thread is not the same as a Process. Be careful with terminology you can be miss-understood.
