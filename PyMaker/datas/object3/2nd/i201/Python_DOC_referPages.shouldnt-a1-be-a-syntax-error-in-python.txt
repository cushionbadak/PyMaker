This question already has an answer here:What is this odd colon behavior doing?                    1 answer                I made a typo in my code that went completely silent syntactically.If you haven't noticed it, it's the use of  instead of  when declaring the variable .So my question is, does the python syntax : , by itself, hold any meaning ? Or should it hypothetically be considered a syntax error?
PEP-526 introduced variable annotations, which provide programmers a way to add type information to variables.  This allows, among other things, statements liketo indicate that there is a local variable of type , without initializing it.  In PEP-484 - Acceptable Type Hints, we can see that annotations "must be valid expressions that evaluate without raising exceptions", which your dictionary literal is.If you look at the Python grammar itself you can see that the  and  rules make the example you show legal.  If you're using an IDE/other type hinting tools, they should definitely complain about this, but it doesn't break the rules that Python has set up.
