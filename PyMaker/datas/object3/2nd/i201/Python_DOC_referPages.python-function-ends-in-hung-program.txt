I am very new to programming and python.  I am trying to use this code:however, whenever I do so, the program just hangs. I thought maybe it was my editor(pycharm) but I've tried running it in just the terminal as well and it's the same result.actually, I should note, in pycharm I get a keyboard interrupt error that flashes for a second then goes away. I do not get this in the terminal.I have tried just writing it out in a for loop and forgoing the function, but it's the same issue.I don't see anything that would cause this and I get no errors, just a hung program.Any help is appreciated!Also, I'm sure there is an easier way to write this, so a push in the right direction there would be great as well!!
list.append(x) adds the item 'x' to the end of the list. Your code iterates through the list 'hand,' but each time it does so it adds a new item to the end of the list. Thus, the list will never end, so neither will your  loop.Regarding an easier way to write this, it depends what you're trying to accomplish. If what you want is a list with the same items in square brackets, you might try something like this:The return() statement allows the function to produce a new list, which you can then assign to  the variable  like this:Alternately, you can change the items in your list  directly, without calling a separate function, by using enumerate(). The  function returns a list of tuples, each of which contains the index of an item in the last (starting with 0, the index of the first item) and its value. So  returns:Which means you can replace each of the items in your list  like this:And then the value of list  should be:If that's not what you wanted, let us know.
You are creating an infinite loop by appending to  within the loop.Try something like this to print the hand with braquets: You can also append to a string and return it if you'd like.
