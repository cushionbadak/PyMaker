I'm trying to use Python to loop over a long binary file filled with 8-byte records.Each record has the format (which is  in struct-formatting)Apparently each 8-byte block is getting treated as an , instead of an array of 8-bytes, then causing the  call to failHow can I read my file as a series of structures, and print them each out?
 only returns a byte string. Then  will be a single byte.The correct way of looping is:
The iter builtin, if passed a callable and a sentinel value will call the callable repeatedly until the sentinel value is returned.So you can create a partial function with functools.partial (or use a ) and pass it to , like this:
I've never used this before, but it looks like an initialization issue:You may want to look at iter_unpack() for optimization if you have adequate ram.Note that in 3.7, the default value changes from bytes to string. see near end of page https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.pack
