Natural Text
I have a pandas series that for each row a text review is present:I would like to convert this series into a unique list containing each word present in each review, for example:s = [['the', 'pizza', 'was', 'okay'...], ['i', 'love', 'this', 'place', 'my', 'fiance', 'and', 'i', 'go'...]]Expected output:s = ['the', 'pizza', 'was', 'okay'..., 'i', 'love', 'this', 'place', 'my', 'fiance', 'and', 'i', 'go'...]I have tried using  and doing some loops but I am definitely missing something. What could be a good approach to this problem?
Use list comprehension with flattening:Or use :Performance:
You can simply use:As it will add up all the lists.
