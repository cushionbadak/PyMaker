I' trying to change my variable to uppercase and I don't know what I'm getting wrong.  Sample code: When I run the above code,  is returned instead of .
Method upper() does not change the value of variable, it only returns a string where all characters are in upper case.So, you may print it directly:or change first and then print:
In Python  returns a copy of the string with upper case values, and does not mutate the original string. In fact, strings in Python are immutable anyways.Try: Source: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html""
