consider this :if  is very large number and  takes long to execute ill wait for ever for  to be called.so i want to use generators to make  start being called sooner for example :The problem with this approach is that  gets called twice for each item in the input serie, and in case manipulate is heavy operation its redundant and i want to avoid it.The next step towards the most optimal code would be :but still  will be called twice per input. whats the right way to get what i want and make sure its optimal, i.e  called once per input item?
You can use itertools.tee which uses queue under the hood to store the generated items. It will save some computational resources as manipulate will be called one per item.However, if the processing is sequential as in the example (first process genA and the genB), it will require significant auxiliary storage.
