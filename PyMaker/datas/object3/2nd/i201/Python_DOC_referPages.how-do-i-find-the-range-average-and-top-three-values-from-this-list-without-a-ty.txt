I m new to python and working on a small project:90, 75, 65, 50, 40 are the grades belowMy code:However, on running topthree I receive an error:TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not tupleHow do I avoid this?
You need to use list slicing like so:I know it says , but it takes the top three.If you want to use a list, it takes a bit more effort:You can also sort in reverse:
Assuming that you have already collected the grades into a list called :Syntax such as negative indexing and slicing is discussed further in the tutorial provided in the CPython documentation:Like strings (and all other built-in sequence type), lists can be indexed and sliced:All slice operations return a new list containing the requested elements. This means that the following slice returns a new (shallow) copy of the list:The general format for list indexing/slicing is :Note the list slices are end-exclusive, so  only returns the second entry: .
Python use  symbol for list slicing. So instead of use , use .Format for list slicing is .
