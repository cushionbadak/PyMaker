I have a fasta file that has several hundred records but I'm trying to return a table with just the first 20 records (record description, AA length, and name). My code is not working and I would like to know how to return just the first 20 records - preferably in a table format.This is my python code:
There are numerous ways to do this. The most similar to your current structure would be to add a  when the index hits 19 (that is the 20th number since counting starts at 0):However, the way I prefer style-wise is to use :Instead of printing you can insert the descriptions and lengths into a list, array or other data structure of your choosing if you want to store the table.
