I'm new to this and trying to have a loop iterate through a series of numbers until 2 different users say yes to a specific number.If both users say yes to a number, I'd like the program to print "You both picked [X]!" with X being the number, and for the loop to stop at this point. If either user says no, however, I'd like the loop to simply continue on to the next number. Why does the below code not work to achieve this?  
is being read as so  might return  or . The  and  will both essentially return .What you might want is  So we created a literal set , and we are seeing if  is in that set.
The code  gets converted to a boolean . You will need to check if the input equals each individually.
Here,  Try this: (yes i know there is probably a better way than to start the counter at -1 but it gets the job done) edit: just fixed it to work with a for instead of a while loop
I’m pretty new to this as well, but hopefully I can help by adding a perspective close to your skill level In my opinion this solution is fairly simple to understand, and very accessible to other new develops, if you were to share what you’ve made with others. 
The conditional is problematic.(user1_response == "N" or "No" or "Reject") evaluates to True only when user1_response == "N"However, if both user1 and user2 type "Y"(user1_response == "N" or "No" or "Reject") evaluates to "No"and(user2_response == "No" or "N" or "Reject") evaluates to "N"the combined statement (user1_response == "N" or "No" or "Reject") or (user2_response == "No" or "N" or "Reject") evaluates to "No"and "No" will trigger the "if" portion of the code because "No" is not equivalent to the boolean False. Therefore the "else" portion of the code will not be reached. This is one possible solution:
