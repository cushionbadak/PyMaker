Natural Text
I want to take two lists with dict value and find the specific values that appear only in first list.In this case, only compare 'name' key. would return , for instance.The  solution is not for this case.
For efficiency, we first make a  of the names in , then filter the list :Sample output:If you don't like ,  and the like, you can write the same using comprehensions:
Use  comprehension with . (BTW, what's inside your  is called ):Explanation:: gets all name from : checks if name from  doesn't exist in . (i.e. appear only in first list)
Nearly the same as the others.
