How do I know that a library, package or module exists (standard and external) that I could use to solve a given problem? For example, I have used the BeautifulSoup library to "decode" a web site while looking up some beginner practices, but I only knew BeautifulSoup exists because I saw it in a practice example and would have never known of it's existence if I didn't stumble upon it. 
All libraries in Python are managed by the "Pip Installs Packages" package manager (pip)(For more infos please refer to the Python 3.7.2 documentation â€” Installing Python Modules)Every module/lib installed in your local Python system can be listed using the  command in your system.
