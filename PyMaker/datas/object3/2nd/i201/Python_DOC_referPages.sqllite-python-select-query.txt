If for example I had this database:And a function isPrime(number) which returns a boolean true or false if the number is prime,Is there anyway for me to select numbers based on if isPrime = true;something like this.. Thanks for any help 
Assuming  is a sqlite connection object, something like:should let you call the function in SQL statements executed by that connection.
