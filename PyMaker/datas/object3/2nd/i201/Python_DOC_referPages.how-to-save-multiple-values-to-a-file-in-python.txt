So I would like to know how to save and check different values in a file. I have tried to read a fileand this to write things to a file however this overwrites anything already in the file another problem is when I want to check the values by using a for loop however that didn't work. I was wondering if there was any other way to check, read and write values to/from a file.An example of this is a login page where people can make accounts and log in and the program checks if the username and password exist.When I looked on the internet it talked about a thing called pickle but it wasn't the same thing as what I wanted from what I could see.
For your first question, you need to open the file in append mode:The '+' sign in append mode indicates that the script will create a new file if it doesn't already exist, if it does, it'll just append to it. 
You want to "append" to the file, so open it with mode  instead of .Also, do not call  inside of the  block.   will close the file for you after the block.See: https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/functions.html#open
To append data to an existing file use  for "append mode." This is in contrast to your "read" and "write" modes.
if you want to read ,write and update, you need to open file  and to check every line to match user data  .Other operations like  will help. Remember to release resources by closing file finally
