I've got this basic python3 server but can't figure out how to serve a directory.If Instead of the custom class above, I simply pass  into TCPServer():, the default functionality is to serve a directory, but I want to serve that directory and have functionality on my two GETs above.As an example, if someone were to go to localhost:8080/index.html, I'd want that file to be served to them
if you are using 3.7, you can simply serve up a directory where your html files, eg. index.html is stillfor the docs
The simple wayYou want to extend the functionality of , so you subclass it! Check for your special condition(s), if none of them apply, call  and let it do the rest.Example:The long wayTo serve files, you basically just have to open them, read the contents and send it.To serve directories (indexes), use . (If you want, you can when receiving directories first check for an index.html and then, if that fails, serve an index listing).Putting this into your code will give you:This example has a lot of error handling. You might want to move it somewhere else.The problem is this serves from your root directory. To stop this, you'll have to (easy way) just add the serving directory to the beginning of . Also check if  cause you to land higher than you want. A way to do this is Putting this inside (after the check for /up):Note you define  and use it subsequently, otherwise you will still serve from /
