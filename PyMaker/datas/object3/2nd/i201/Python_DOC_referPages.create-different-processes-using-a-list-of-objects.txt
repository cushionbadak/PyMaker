I want to execute this function without having to rewrite all the code for each process.And the code that I don't feel the need to repeat n times the next one. I need to use Process not Threads.So I decided to create a list of nodes but I don't know how to execute a process for each item (node) of the list. How can I execute a process for each item (node) of the list (sNodes).Thank you all.
You can use a :Where  is the number of processes you want.In case you want detached processes or you dont expect a result is better to simply use another loop:General tip: having a lot of processes will not speed up your code but make your processor start swaping and everything will be slower. Just in case you are looking for a code speedup instead of a logical architecture.
