Hacky but it's the quick and lazy solution.You should definitely check the version on startup. This snippet restartes the script automatically with the right version:Read up on portability between Python2.* and Python3.* here.EDIT: As suggested by @MisterMiyagi, here some changes.It now uses  instead of .It now uses  instead of .It now checks what platform the user runs so now it is portable to Linux, Windows and Appletoshwin.
