I have this code:Basically I am using a program called gromacs. As you can see I am combining  and  so I can then just use  and be able to get everything.However, the  is a mess and it has no format:All the  is were there should be a new line.What must I do in order to have a list of string were basically each string is a line of the output?In other words:Therefore, I can do things as output[i].find("2018") and other things as well.when I put:I get:It is very clear that I must do something else to get what I need but I have no idea what to do. I hope I have made myself clear.
I think you can do what you want by adding the following line before printing the output:Calling  will turn the  into a python string (), and the  turns that into a list-of-strings. is  method that decodes them into a string assuming they've been encoded in utf-8 (by default) â€” it's not documented in the  documentation (that I know of).
