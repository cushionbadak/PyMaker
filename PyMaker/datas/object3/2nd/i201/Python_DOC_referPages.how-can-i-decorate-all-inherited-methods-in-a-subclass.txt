How can I make sure that 's  was run automatically when calling  and  on an instance of the  class?
If using python3.6 or above, you can accomplish this using Simple implementation: (for the real thing you probably want a registry and , etc):Demo:Edit:In case you can't change the baseclass, you can subclass and create an Adapter class:Should provide the same result. 
There's no easy way to do what you want from within the  subclass. You either need to name each method of the base class that you want to wrap with a decorator, modify the  class after you create it (perhaps with a class decorator), or you need to redesign the base class to help you out.One relatively simple redesign would be for the base class methods to be decorated with a decorator that makes them always call a "validator" method. In the base class the validator can be a no-op, but a child class could override it to do whatever you want:
Here is my solution for this:This will only work if you want to process each function in your Base with sanity_check.
