I need to retrieve the env variable  of the parent process (the shell) that calls the python program.  doesn't belong to  inside the python process and  stores its own prompt.How can we pass this variable to the program from the shell ?I invoke the program with :  from the shell.
The python script can access all the environment variables through . Your problem is that  is not an environment variable, but only a local variable of the shell.That means that the shell does not pass it to its child in the environment (you can control that by typing  or  in your shell). So unless you manually put it in the environment before starting Python ( for sh or bash) you cannot get it in your Python script.
If value assigned to  doesn't change during runtime of your  then probably the best option is to pass it as an argument and retrieve it in you script using argparse. If the value is changing during runtime, then one of the options would be to store it in some temporary file and read it from there.
