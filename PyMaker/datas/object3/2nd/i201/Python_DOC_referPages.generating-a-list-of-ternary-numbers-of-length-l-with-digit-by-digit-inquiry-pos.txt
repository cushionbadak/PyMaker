I want to generate a list of ternary numbers of length l and save into a dictionary. Then I want the ability to compare these numbers digit by digit and do modifications too.For example if the length , the dictionary should contain numbers: .Then I want to do operations like comparing the  digit of the  entry in the dictionary with the  digit of the  entry. Like in the above list, comparing "0" of the entry "20" with "1" of the entry "21"Also I should be able to sum up the digits of the  entry of the dictionary. Like sum of the entry "11" = 2.Please suggest me a way to do the above things. I am new to coding in python.Here is my try but this doesn't give me 2 digit numbers. So a suggestion for how to go to tens place from ones place and so on, would be appreciated:
 seems to give you what you're looking for. It's often used in place of nested  loops, but has a convenient  kwarg that makes your life easier here.This produces a generator (note: not a list!) that produces all the values you're looking for from  to . To make a list, simply cast it to one.Then to compare digits, just use indexing like any 2D list.If you want to specifically output  as , you can write a function for that:then loop over your  and print each:
