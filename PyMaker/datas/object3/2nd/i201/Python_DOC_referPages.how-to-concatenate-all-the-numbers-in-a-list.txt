You can achieve concatenation in a single for loop. Try Below Code:
Is how i would make a random string
There are many different ways to solve this and also improve your code. You should definitely checkout  and list comprehensions. If you want to stick to your original code as much as possible, how about this basic solution:
You've tagged your question Python2.7. If you can use Python3 instead, you can use random.choices to make things rather simple:If you're stuck in Python2, you can implement a (simplistic)  thus:
this is a way: is just ; i select a random entry from that and join the single letters with ....actually  is better suited for that. see this answer.
