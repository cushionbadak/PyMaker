I am currently trying to convert times from UTC and the problem that i am having is that the offsets seem to be backwards. As you can see when i convert the UTC to EST, it shows an offset of -4:56 yet when i print the time, it seems to add 4:56 as opposed to the way it should be. I would really like to be able to convert a UTC time to any other timezone and have it display the local time there without the offset so the UTC here would be converted to something along the lines of 2019-03-06 9:12 EST.
I suspect that you misunderstood the method .Your original datetime is in UTCThen you changed the timezone info for the variable , and indeed it works as designed:If you print this variable, it shows the correct infoBut when you call  without any argument, then the return value is a  object in  zone; that means the method is also working as designed, returning the same point in time but expressed as localtime in  (It will be 7PM/19hs in UTC when it is 2PM/14hs in US/Eastern).You can test that yourself by calculating the difference (which will be 0):
