Natural Text
I am using groovy to call a python class, I am defaulting to None the empty arguments, but I am finding lots of problems to default to None null or empty strings ('') also.I hope there would be something in  to check if the argument is '' and change it to None in that case so further in the code I don't have to check for  and for '' just check if is not .
The type argument of  is a function that "allows any necessary type-checking and type conversions to be performed." You can abuse this:Output:
Specify the command line argument as having type  with default , for example:Then if the user omits  entirely then you will get  back. But if the user puts  on the command line with nothing after it, they will get the error argument -j/--jfile: expected one argument and they will have to supply a string value to get past this. So you should always get either  or a non-empty string.
