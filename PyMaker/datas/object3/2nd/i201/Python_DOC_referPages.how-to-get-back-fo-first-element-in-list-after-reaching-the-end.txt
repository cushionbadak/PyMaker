For instance: If I am iterating through a Python list ['a','b','c'] how do I get back to element 'a' once I have reached 'c'?
If you mean to do a loop like if your list was in circle, simply use the modulo operator :
If by "get back to element " you mean to "cycle" back through the list, Then you can use I used  as it's the same as the builtin  but for iterators as  will iterate forever otherwise. This will iterate through  4 times.
