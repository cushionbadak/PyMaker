I have a scenario where class A is initialized with parameters id,name,email,ticket. Then class B is initialized inside class A's method and the same parameters are required to be passed along and so on and so forth. Can these common attributes be set using a decorator or metaclass during class declaration.Similarly...class C and so on..I am finding it bit inappropriate sending all these repeated parameters to all the subsequent classes.

You can use a class decorator to "remember" the parameters as part of the instance, so you would be able to access them using  and :
