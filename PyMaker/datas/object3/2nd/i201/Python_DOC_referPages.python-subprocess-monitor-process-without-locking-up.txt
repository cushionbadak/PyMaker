I have the idea of creating a control panel to monitor multiple scripts and processes. Having built the interface in advance, I seem to struggle with detecting the status of subprocess commands, getting a locked-up control panel as the child process has started.There are methods such as  or  to determine whether a process is alive/finished or not,  yet those lock up the control panel for the lifetime of the child process. As seen in this block. the if clausule is never reached.How would I be able to control and monitor the new process without locking up the control panel? The idea is that the panel would be able to start/stop servers, and report on their status:At the moment, it is possible to start a subprocess and see if it did by pressing [1]. It is not however possible to terminate the same subprocess with a different if-statement [0].
Use  or, if you need to check for output, use  for stdout and  on .
I've found out how to control the subprocess via two if statements by making the process variable a global variable.As a result, the code would be as follows (rough sketch):
