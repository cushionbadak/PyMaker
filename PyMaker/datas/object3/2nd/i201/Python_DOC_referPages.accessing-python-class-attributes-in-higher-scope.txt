Still learning Python, rookie question here. I'm building a simple tkinter GUI that loads JSON data and then allows the user to select loaded data for plotting. Here's a description of my architecture and issue:1) In the GUI, I have a load button that calls a function, LoadData, to open a directory containing multiple JSON txt files2) LoadData checks to see if a certain file name exists, 'AutoPilot.txt', and if it does, another function, LoadAutopilotData, is called3) LoadAutopilotData creates an instance of the  Data class and populates it with the JSON dataAfter the functions are complete, I want to access the instance of the Data class I created in the inner scope (APtime), but I can't seem to do that. File 1 snippet:File 2 snippet:File 3 snippet:where File3 continues on to populate an instance of the Data class. The problem I'm having is that I can only access APtime in File3, and not in the 'higher' level functions. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!
What you need to do is return a value to the calling function. You can look at the tutorial section on Defining functions on the Python website to have a little more detail about that.So if we don't change your code too much this could loook like that:Solution 1: File 2 snippetSolution 1: File 3 snippetYou should see that the function  assign the value returned by the function  to the  variable (the line )After the function  process its data, it uses the statement  to make that value available to the calling function.But there are some improvement that could be done in your code. The only one I will mention is that you should read what is in the Standard Library because it could save you some work. For example, to check if a file exists, there's a function that already exists for that.So your File 2 snippet could look like that:
