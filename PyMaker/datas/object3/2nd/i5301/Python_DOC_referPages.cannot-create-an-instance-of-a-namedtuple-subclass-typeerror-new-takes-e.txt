I seem to be unable to instantiate a  subclass:When I try to create an instance, I get:I expected .There seems to be a workaround: using a class method instead of :Now  indeed returns .However, this looks ugly.Is this the only way?
Named tuples are immutable, you need to use the  method instead:(Note:  is implicitly made a static method, so you need to pass on the  argument explicitly; the method returns the newly created instance). can't be used because that is called after the instance has already been created and so would not be able to mutate the tuple anymore.Note that you should really add a  line to your subclass; a named tuple has no  dictionary cluttering up your memory, but your subclass will unless you add the  line:That way you get to keep the memory footprint of your named tuples low. See the  documentation:The action of a  declaration is limited to the class where it is defined. As a result, subclasses will have a  unless they also define  (which must only contain names of any additional slots).
