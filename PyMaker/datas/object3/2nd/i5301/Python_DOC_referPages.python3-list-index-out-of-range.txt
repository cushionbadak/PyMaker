Natural Text
I am working on a character level Recurrent Neural Network. To train the net I copied a text corpus from the internet. Here is the chunk of code that has the error in it :Basically all I am doing is converting characters to their ASCII equivalent.  is the character sequence and  is its corresponding ASCII sequence.  variable contains the number of unique character in the text corpus. The error occurs in this line :Complete source code along with text corpus : https://github.com/tanmay-edgelord/charRNNPlease ask for any information that is required in order for you to answer the question.EDITTRACEBACK upon calling function traceback.print_stack()
The issue is in  because your  range function is using SEQ_LENGTH+1.  This is what you want since you're predicting the  value in the list but it also creates an issue in that  is 1 sample too short on the last iteration of  when  splits evenly with .  Other that the data creation at the top, the only thing modified here is use  in the data creation instead of .  By truncating a single value, you assure you won't get an  type error. This is the easiest thing to do, however you could also set SEQ_LENGTH to be a value that isn't an even multiple of len(data), ie..  would work for the above example.
