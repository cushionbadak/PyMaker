So given this  array:How can I convert this into a vector of probabilities? Such that the result would be:
This essentially requires a grouping operation, which  isn't great at... but  is. You can do this with  +  + , and divide the result by the gth of . 
You can use  to first determine the frequency of each element. Then create an intermediate mapping dict which will contain key as the element and value as the frequency. Finally using  to transform the array to your desired formatAt this point the  will contains frequency of each element likeNext build a probability dict of the format , using dict comprehensionFinally using  to get your desired outputThis will produce:
[Update to a general one]How about this one using :
