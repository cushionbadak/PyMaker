Natural Text
I have data that looks like this:I need to make it look like this:Notice the extra space after the comma on the first two names.I think I need to use a regex to make this happen, but it doesn't seem to work. I've tried:but it isn't happening for me. What have I missed? I only need to change the names where there is a text character, a comma, and a text character immediately next to each other. Other names in the list are right and don't need to be changed.
 does not use regular expressions.

You will have to use  for this:This uses references to put in those two characters around the comma. You can also use lookbehinds and lookaheads for this:
