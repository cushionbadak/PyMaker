This question already has an answer here:“Least Astonishment” and the Mutable Default Argument                    32 answers                I'm fairly new at Python and i cannot wrap my head around the results im gettingUsing the code below:I was getting output:I put "print(b)" above "res=list()" and got output:What is going on? Shouldn't "b" be set to "set()" when i call the function? Im using Python 3.6
Have a look at the documentation for default parameters:The default value is evaluated only once. This makes a difference when the default is a mutable object such as a list, dictionary, or instances of most classes. When you define a function with a default parameter, the default value is only evaluated when the definition is first executed by the interpreter (the actual  statement). This is usually not a problem, except for when a mutable default value is used. That is to say, one that can be modified in place.In your case, when you modify  in your function the first time you call it, it keeps that value the next time around. To avoid this, you can do like so:Now  will always have the default value you want.
In python functions are objects and arguments are evaluated and executed once. this is a nice explanation : http://effbot.org/zone/default-values.htmin your example, it could be "fixed" by doing:
In First function call b is emptySee hereIn second function call b is already fill with elementSo this condition not run  and return empty listTry thisOutput[1, 2, 3, 4][1, 2, 3, 4]
