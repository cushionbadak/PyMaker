The question on my assignment is as follows:Write a function that takes, as an argument, a string, identified by the variable . If the string only contains digits 0 and 1, return the string formed by concatenating the argument with the string "is a binary string." Otherwise, return a string indicating the length of the argument, as specified in the examples that follow. Name this function . I am having trouble figuring out how to form a loop which searches through a string and determines whether or not the string is a binary string. I understand how to get the length of a string, I just don't understand how to figure out if it is a binary string. 
Try this !
You can use a for loop through a string the same way you can use with a list of numbers.For example:You can use:In your case, you just need to switch the number list by the string you receive as an argument like this:Look that in this case you need to compare it with the string version of the number, because you're iterating a string, so each value you receive from the for loop will be a string too.In the end, you'll probably have something like this:As you can see I am iterating through the string to check if any element of it is different than '1' and '0', if it is, I just return the length of the string, otherwise, if I checked every value in the string and everything is fine, I concatenate 'is a binary string' to the original string and return it.I hope this helps.
Try the build-in function remix without use loop.
A binary string has been defined as a string that only contains "0" or "1". So, how about checking each 'character' in the string, and if it's not a "0" or "1" you will know that the string is not a binary string.
