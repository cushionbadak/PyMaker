I want create lambda that getting zip file(which may conatained list of csv files)  from S3, unzip it and upload back to s3.since lambda is limited by memory/disk size, I have to stream it from s3 and back into it.I use python (boto3)see my code below (I'm more a java guy, new to the python...)result is, creating empty files in the bucket.for example: if file: input.zip contained files: 1.csv,2.csvi get in the bucket  2 empty csv files with the corresponding names.also, i'm not sure it indeed stream the files, or just download all the zip filethanks
You need to seek back to the beginning of the ByesIO file before uploading.
