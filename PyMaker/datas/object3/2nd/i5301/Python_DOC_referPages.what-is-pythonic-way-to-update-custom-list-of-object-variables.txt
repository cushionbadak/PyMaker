Cannot clearly understand right way to create CRUD interface for entity.For example: I've got entity  with variables ,  and .I've got basic constructor for this entity with default (nullablle) values. Trying to figure out pythonic way to create update handler for this entity, which allows me to update custom number of entity fields (for example: update name and place, without specifying date). How I see this:Use list of custom attributes in update method like , then parse  list and match them with entity using  or  functions.Its seems working (and able to find actual diff between entities, which is useful too), but looking pretty harsh.Basic version with setting all values from kwargs looks like this:If we need to check if for diff, we already got: Maybe im missing something and there are more elegant and simple solutions to this problem, or some design patterns to look for? Tnx for answers and sorry for dummy questions. UPD: One more point I see: simple  doesn't check that such variable exists. So, if  contains invalid argument name I get Attribute Error.The obvious fix for that is to create check for  but as I see it will return False if variable declared but has  value.
To check that you are only overwriting existing attributes:Output:
