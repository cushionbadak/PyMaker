This question is a little difficult to articulate with my inadequate English but I will do my best.I have a directory of xml files, each file contains xml such as:I'd like to do a String replacement on the lines which contain the  notation such as .`0 with an index notation like [0],[1], [2], ... and so forth. So the transformed xml payload should look like something below:How can I accomplish this using python? This seems fairly straight forward to do using regex but that would be difficult to do for a directory of files containing multiple files. I'd like to see an implementation using python 3.x, as I am learning it. 
In Python you can loop over all files in your directory with os.listdir and make substitutions in-place with fileinput:However, you should consider doing this from the command line with sed:The above will make the substitution for all files in the current directory, and backup with old files with .
You can use a simple regex to do that:yields
How about this:my output:
