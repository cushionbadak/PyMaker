My homework question is worded as follows:An attempt to manipulate a turtle whose window has been closed raises an error.  True  FalseMy book is worded as "raises an exception."  So is there a difference between the two wordings.  I feel like this is a trick question.
From Pep8Because exceptions should be classes, the class naming convention applies here. However, you should use the suffix "Error" on your exception names (if the exception actually is an error). Thus, "Error" is a naming convention for exceptions. However, you will find in the wild that not all Exceptions end with "Error". 
There's history to the terminology of exception vs error, but if we are talking purely Python (from https://docs.python.org/2/library/exceptions.html#exception-hierarchy):You can see that all "Errors" inherit from , which itself is a type of I would take the benefit of the doubt on this question, and assume it would raise an Error of some sort (maybe OSError?)
Be pedantic.  The object actually being raised is an exception, whether or not the circumstance is an error.
