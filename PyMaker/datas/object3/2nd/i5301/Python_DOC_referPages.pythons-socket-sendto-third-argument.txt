I'm using python socket module, and I read that you can use either 2 or 3 arguments when using  command. you can specify address and message, but you can also send flags. I was wondering what these flags are? I couldn't find any information about it. what happens when you send them? what is the default value? (when you don't specify a flag) what do they do?Thanks in advanced, sorry for the weird question, I just couldn't find it online.
As the Python documentation says, you have to go to man pages for this information.  (The flags should be variables in the  module with the same names that they have in C.)
