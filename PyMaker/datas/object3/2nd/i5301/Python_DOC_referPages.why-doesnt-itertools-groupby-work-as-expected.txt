This question already has an answer here:itertools.groupby() not grouping correctly                    3 answers                I am trying to separate a list of integers into odd and even groups.Clearly, not what I want. However, if I sort L first, using the same lambda key, it works as intended:I don't understand why presorting is necessary. It seems groupby should iterate through the integers in list, assign each a value based on key function, and then group them -- regardless of the list order.
 will group consecutive items that satisfy the key function.  See the (key, group) pairs below.  Notice at the end what happens to the adjacent even items:Here are some ways to get groups of evens and odds:See docs and this post for more on .AlternativesFor complex groupings, you may map a function and collect values in a .
Got it. I had read the docs previously and thought I understood, but clearly I did not. Here is the salient point: "It generates a break or new group every time the value of the key function changes (which is why it is usually necessary to have sorted the data using the same key function)." [Emphasis mine.]I should have re-read this before posting my question. Sorry.
