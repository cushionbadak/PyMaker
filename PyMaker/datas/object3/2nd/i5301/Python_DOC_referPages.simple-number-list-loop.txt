You forgot to add 1 to the tens digit and reset the units digit at the end of the loop. Also,  will not work the way you want here.Try this:
You could do it using . For example:Will return: You can then loop and increment a counter:
Consider using the with keyword and working with the file input context manager for opening files.You can also benefit from using python's range() function.Based on the formatting of the numbers you're dealing with, the zfill() string method also appears useful to you in order to zero pad.The benefit of using range() rather than a list when dealing with large number sets is the memory allocation. Lists will store all values in memory, while a generator (what the range function is), will only return one value at a time. Therefore, only x is in memory at any given time and can be processed through the rest of your for loop.
