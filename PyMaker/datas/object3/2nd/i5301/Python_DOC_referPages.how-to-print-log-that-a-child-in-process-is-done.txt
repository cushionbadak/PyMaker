I am using python's  to parallelize; is there a simple way to find out when each child job is done? For example, this is how I currently implement my code:What I want is  right as each child joins the parent.Why do I want this? A couple of my processes take longer than the others, so I want to see of they finished or not before all of the processes return. The easiest (but not so clean) solution is to print the message inside ; but I would rather do it in the parent module.
This is a job for concurrent.futures -https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.htmlThere are many things subtle in joining concurrent tasks, and a lot of things to improve, like having a pool of worker process that match the number of cores on you machine, and reuse those processes --The  does ll that allowign a choice of using threads or process to execute each task.So, what you want would be something like:(I used ThreadPoolExecutor in order for the example to run on the interactive interpreter here - you will want to use  instead)
