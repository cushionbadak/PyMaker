I want to emulate the behavior of  within a Python script.The compressed GZIP file is decompressed and written as a file with the same file name as the original GZIP file without the .gz extension.file.abc.gz --> file.abcIt's not obvious how to do this using the gzip library, all the examples in the docs are for compressing data arrays, and I've not yet found a good example via Google. Can anyone advise? Thanks in advance for your help.EDIT: I've tried the below using tarfile module, but unfortunately it's not working, I think since the GZIP file wasn't created with tar.
The  module provides a file-like object with the decompressed content of a gzip file; the  module provides a convenient helper for copying content from one file-like object to another.This is a simple inversion of an example given in the official documentation:Example of how to GZIP compress an existing file:
You can use the tarfile module to what you are asking.Example:
