I would like to capture the match of my regex directly in my if condition. I know it was possible in PHP, but I don't know how to do it in a Pythonic way.So I run it twice and it's not sexy at all...
You can't do in-line variable assignment while using a conditional construct in Python, you need to leverage a temp variable. In your case,  would do as you are taking the first element anyway and there is no captured group:Regarding your original example, empty list is falsey in Python, so:would do.
