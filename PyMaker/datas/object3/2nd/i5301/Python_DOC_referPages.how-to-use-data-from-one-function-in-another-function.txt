I have a question about using data from functions in another function.When I try the following:I get the following result:Why does it print out 6 instead of 36 and how can I write it such that it uses the  to calculate ?
The return value of  is summing the arguments you have passed to it i.e. .You never call the  function. Therefore, in order to use the result of  in , you need to return the result and then pass this into the  function.Note: I would advise against calling a function you write yourself  as this will shadow the built-in  function.
I don't see any trouble in your code, you get  because you are calling , but if you call  with that result:
There is a another way to implement this, calling on a feature from functional programming:We've created a composite function and now you don't have to work with nested functions. This is often useful if you have several functions feeding each other. It makes your code cleaner and easier to follow.
