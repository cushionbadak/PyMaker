So for my program I need to check a client on my local network, which has a Flask server running. This Flask server is returning a number that is able to change.Now to retrieve that value, I use the requests library and BeautifulSoup. I want to use the retrieved value in another part of my script (while continuously checking the other client). For this I thought I could use the threading module.The problem is, however, that the thread only returns it's values when it's done with the loop, but the loop needs to be infinite.This is what I got so far:Does anyone know how to return the printed values to another function here? Of course you can replace the requests.get url with some kind of API where the values change a lot.
You need a  and something listening on the queueThe  is thread safe and allows to pass values back and forth. In your case they are only being sent from the thread to a receiver.See: https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html
