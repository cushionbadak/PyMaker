Natural Text
I have to search a string for words that have a number as prefix or suffix (Example, "abc21" or "943xyz". Then, I need to split the number from the word.For example,"abc12" has to converted to "abc 12"or "12abc" has to be converted to "12 abc"However, if the number lies in between letters, for example, "a12bc", then it should be left as it is. How can we do this? Is there a simpler way than regex?
Something simple like one of these.All that's needed is to protect the boundary's with these which does 2 things:- it stops the engine from matching between like kinds (digits or alphas).- insures no bookend types.

You can try this:Output:
You can use  to insert that space:This matches digits followed by non-digits or vice-versa.The  boundaries make sure the word is matched in its entirety, so that we don't match numbers in the middle of a word.The replacement pattern  takes advantage of the fact that unmatched groups are replaced with the empty string. We know that either group 1 and 2 or group 3 and 4 will match, and the other groups will be empty, so  will always produce a valid result (without duplicating any part of the input).Examples:
