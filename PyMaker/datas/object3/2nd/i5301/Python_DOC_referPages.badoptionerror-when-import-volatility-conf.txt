I write below code and it gives me error in first line! whats wrong is with this code:the error code:i think there is some code insode conf.py witch in not support in python 3.6 .but volatility is copatible with python 3.6. so i don't know what to do :
You were right, the line:is not Python3 compatible (according to [Python]: The try statement).According to [GitHub]: volatilityfoundation/volatility - (2.6) volatility/README.txt:126+ (as it is at this point):Requirements  ============  - Python 2.6 or later, but not 3.0. http://www.python.orgNote:The stacktrace is still incomplete (missing the last line - should be ); that would have cleared things up much soonerSo, you have to run it with Python2.6+ (of course you could also modify the code (at least the part that you need) to be Python3 compatible, but I doubt that's feasible).
