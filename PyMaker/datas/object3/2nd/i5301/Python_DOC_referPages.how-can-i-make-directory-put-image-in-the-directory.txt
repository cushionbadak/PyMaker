How can I make directory & put image in the directory?I wrote the following code in :Now when I run command , find a writer for the specified extension in function  error happens. I want to make a directory  and put images made by this code in the directory. The  folder is made, so what is wrong in my code? How should I fix this? Am I wrong to write the way of putting images in the  folder?
 is a generator. The variable  will be bound to that generator. Calling  on that generator is not going to work because  expects an image file, not a generator.You need to iterate over the generator to copy each file one by one. Something like this:Note also that  is a string that represents the desination directory name. You need to specify the path of the file including the directory. Use  and  to do that.If all you are wanting to do is to copy the files from one directory to another then you should perhaps use  as there is no point in opening the image files and then writing them back out. Also, your  generator function will pass back all files, including directories, so you need to add some logic to detect image files and filter out those that are unwanted.
 accepts a single file name, but you are calling it with a (generator returning a) list of files.Try this:Because  needs to receive a filename parameter, I changed  to return a tuple, so you can use the same filename for the output, and choose which directory name you add in front.Rewriting the images seems like a very inefficient way to do this, though. Why don't you simply copy the files?
