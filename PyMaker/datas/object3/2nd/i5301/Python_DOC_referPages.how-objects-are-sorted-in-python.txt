Suppose that I have a list  of some objects.What value of an object is used to perform  if key function is not provided? Is it hash or some id?
when no key is provided,  uses exclusively the  operator, as demonstrated in this example:here I get: used the defined  (less than) operator internally, only, not equal not superior. Sorting is only performed with  operator.(commenting the  operator leads to )
Python This method sorts the list in place, using only < comparisons between  items. Exceptions are not suppressed - if any comparison operations  fail, the entire sort operation will fail (and the list will likely be  left in a partially modified state).Refer: list.sort()
