I recently came across some python code I don't understand completely. I understand that this code checks if x is a subsequence of s. Can someone explain or point me towards an article that explains what's exactly happening at . What is calling the next method of iterator ?
It’s good to start with reading the documentation for the built-in function :Return True if all elements of the iterable are true (or if the iterable is empty).That means that  is a “generator expression”: it produces values. The values it produces are of the boolean expression  (see the  operator) for all characters  in string .Here, the  operator is responsible for advancing the iterator. Note, however, that the True result is probably lucky. The iterator  can advance only once and because  contains the letters in the same sequence as they appear in , the whole expression works out to the expected result True. Reverse  and the expression is False because the iterator is exhausted.
