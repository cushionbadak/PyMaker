Here is what I am doingMy python version is How do I make it work?
You could do the formatting yourself:As was pointed out by Martijn Pieters, this will always run the string formatting, while using the logging module would cause the formatting to only be performed if the message is actually logged. 
You cannot use new-style formatting when using the logging module; use  instead of .The logging module uses the old-style  operator to format the log string. See the  method for more detail.If you really want to use  string formatting, consider using custom objects that apply the formatting 'late', when actually converted to a string:This is an approach the Python 3  module documentation proposes, and it happens to work on Python 2 too.
Martijn's answer is correct, but if you prefer to use new style formatting with logging, it can be accomplished by subclassing Logger.Then just set the logging class:
You could do also (Python 3);
