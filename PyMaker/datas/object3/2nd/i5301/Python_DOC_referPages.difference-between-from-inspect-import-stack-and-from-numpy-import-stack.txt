While implementing stack I get two import option and I was unable to get what is the difference between them?Getting output:
TL;DR: They have nothing in common.numpy.stack:A function that stacks one array on top of another.inspect.stack:A function that gives you access to the call stack of the function being executed.Actual stack data structure:In python, you can use a list as a stack (as shown in the linked document) by using  and  methods of the  type.Recapping: These three things have nothing in common, they apply to entirely different use-cases.
