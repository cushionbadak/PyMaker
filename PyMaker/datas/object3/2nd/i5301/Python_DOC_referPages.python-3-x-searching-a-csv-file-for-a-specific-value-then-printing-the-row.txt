My task is to read a csv file, find the largest value in the third column and then store the row(s) with that largest value.So far, I have been able to read the csv file and find the largest value but I am unable to search for that value and get the rows.I'm not sure what is wrong here, my notebook is giving no output or error messages. I've narrowed down the issue to the "row" section of my code. My intent is to search through the [2] element in the rows, which should be the third column, and print the rows that have a row[2] matching what I determined to be the largest value in the previous for loop.From other questions on stackoverflow, I'm also thinking my problem may be related to the use of "DictReader" and how in the first for loop I'm searching using strings and the second for loop I'm using an integer.I'm very new to python, and programming in general. I was only given the link to the documentation for CSV and we have only covered the basic data types, functions and loops. I appreciate any direction anyone can give me, thanks.
