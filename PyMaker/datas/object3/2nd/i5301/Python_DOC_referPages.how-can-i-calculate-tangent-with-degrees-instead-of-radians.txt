I am trying to make a basic tool to make my everyday easier, solving some assignments for me. Unfortunately, I can't figure out how to make it calculate in degrees when tangent is being used.My code:EDIT: Sorry for the lack of context; this is about calculating the masses of galaxies using 2 functions, the first one, line 7 to get the peculiar velocity, and the second one in lines 8-9 to get the actual mass of the considered galaxy.SOLVED: math.tan(8 * pi / 180)Thank you for all your help!
Computers work in radians. Tryto use your angle in degrees into a trig function. Or try  to get answer in degrees.
The  package has the functions  and  but under the hood these are just:Here is a wrapper you can use to make degree-using trig functions (just had it lying around somewhere, although I use  instead of )
You don't want to get in a fight with the math library. Let the math library give you an answer in radians, then multiply it's answer by  to get degrees.
