This question already has an answer here:My regex is matching too much. How do I make it stop?                    5 answers                I am using this code to split a string at , but preserving the split characters as an item in the list:I expected it to return this list:But instead I get this:Why are white spaces returned as separate items in the list?EditI was supposed to escape the backslash, not the period, so I've changed my code to this:But now I get this result:Please look at my expected result so you know what I'm trying to achieve.
To get your expected output, you'd want to use a non-greedy match, changing:to:The reason is that  will happily match as much of the string as possible (so long as it can still match the fixed anchors around it), and since your fixed anchors are so simple (a leading backslash, any characters, then trailing whitespace or  character), it will match from the first backslash to the final whitespace character.That gets output of:which is almost what you want (aside from the leading empty string, created because your regex matches at the very beginning of the string). You can manually pop it off if needed, e.g. to remove leading and trailing empty strings:Note: If your intent was to match until whitespace or end of string, not whitespace or literal , you need to change  to ; inside a character class  isn't special, so you need to use a (non-capturing) grouped alternation instead.
