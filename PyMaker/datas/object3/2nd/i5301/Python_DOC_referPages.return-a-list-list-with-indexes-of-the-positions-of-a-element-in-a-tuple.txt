Im a beginner in python and Im doing a example that needs to use functions with arguments. I  want to create a functin "findElement" that receives an element and a tuple and return a list with the indexes of the positions that the element is in the tuple. For this Im trying to create a function like:The "1" is the element and (1,2,3,4,1) is the tuple but is appearing a error. Do you know why?
A few methods are below, in my order of preference. The second uses a generator.List comprehension:Functional method with generator:Functional method without generator:
I would use  in order to get the index of the currently read element.
