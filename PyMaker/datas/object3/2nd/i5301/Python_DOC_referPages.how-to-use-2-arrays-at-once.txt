Sorry, I am not sure if I am using the correct terminology.  I have a program that cycles through the "myConnect" array of server names.  It creates a connection to each server name and runs a query.  This works fine.  But what if I have several database names on each server as well?  What is the best way to go about cycling through a list of database names as well as the server names?  Here is my working code for just server names:Should I just create another database array under myConnect?  Is there a way to group them together?  Maybe something like this?
Output:
Are you looking to iterate over myConnect and databases at the same time? If so then it might be zip.  Or are you looking to iterate over and use something like the product of the two?
