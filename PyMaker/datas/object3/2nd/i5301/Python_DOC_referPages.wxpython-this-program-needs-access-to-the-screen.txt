I'm trying to use the Python GUI  (installable via ) in the following minimal app:Running this snippet returns the following:Does anyone know how to help wx gain "access to the screen", or what a "Framework build of Python" is? I'd be grateful for any help others can offer with these questions!
This resolves the problem, but it can't be the prettiest solution:
@duhaimeThere is an installer for OSX on the official wxPython web-site.Just download it and install.You don't need to play with anaconda just to install and run such a simple application.
wxPython on Mac within a virtual environment throws this error, as explained by wxPython website here: https://wiki.wxpython.org/wxPythonVirtualenvOnMacIf you are not running it in a virtual environment and still receive this error, try running your script that uses wxpython with "pythonw" instead of "python". Ex: "pythonw hello.py"^See section "4.1.2 Running Scripts with a GUI" (on MacOS) from the following page in the Python Docs to see this python quirk explained: https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html
