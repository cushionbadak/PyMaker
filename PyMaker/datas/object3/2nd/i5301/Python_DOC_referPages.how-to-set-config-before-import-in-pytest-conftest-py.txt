In the global scope of , you create an instance  and in  logging handlers are set up.  Your problem is the anti-pattern of setting up logging handlers at import time.  Don't do that.  For apps, logging handlers should be configured at runtime (done by  or whatever).  For libraries, logging handlers should not be configured at all (with the exception of possibly adding a ) - it is up to the user of your library to decide how they want handlers configured.  Note that pytest does not require logging handlers in order to test the records logged.
