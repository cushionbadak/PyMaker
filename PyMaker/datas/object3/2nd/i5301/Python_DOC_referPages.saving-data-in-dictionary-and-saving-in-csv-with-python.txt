I'm trying to save information about traffic from an API to excel with python.Basically I can get the data once at the moment but I want it to go underneath headings and then go down a row every new iteration in the csv output; in this example the headings are traffic travel time, length in meters, departure time and traffic delay in seconds. I am basically looking at traffic data every 10 minutes / whatever time say.So how would I go about creating headers to separate columns, then having the data go below those columns, for the excel output. I assume it's to do with how I append the information to the variable i've set being data. It would look like this basically,And the script i've written so far is below.Here is an example of what the API comes out as (it's XML)Really appreciate your help - I'm very confused about how to proceed at the moment.
There are various tools in the xml and csv python libraries, and multiple ways to parse xml to csv.http://blog.appliedinformaticsinc.com/how-to-parse-and-convert-xml-to-csv-using-python/seems to have an example already written, if a bit verbose...I would recommend reading the docs on the libraries, and then using them to transform your data in the way you best see fit.https://docs.python.org/2/library/xml.htmlhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.htmlUpdate in response to OP comment:Use a while loop.
