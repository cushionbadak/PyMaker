I'm trying to create a function that will convert a given list into a given dictionary (where I can specify/assign values if I want). So for instance, if I have a list and I want to convert to a dictionary like this I know how to do this using a dictionary comprehension but I can't figure out how to make this into a more generalized function that would be able to turn any list into a dictionary. What's the best approach here?
Pass  list to  constructorHere  will yield s of element and its index. Indices will start from  (note the second argument of ). Using this expression you can define a function inline like:Invoke it like:Or a regular function
If the keys are just the index of the element in the , as in your example:
Iterate through the list and assign every value to a number (starting from ).Replace  with  if you want the dictionary to start from zero.
