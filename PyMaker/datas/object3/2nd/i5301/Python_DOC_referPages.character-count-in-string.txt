I am new to python and currently learning string operations, can anyone tell me what is wrong in this program? The function tries to print a count of each character in given string.For eg: string ="There is shadow behind you"I want to count how many times each character have come in string 
Counting characters in a string can be done with the  class like:Code:Results:
This is what you need to do. Iterate through the input string and use a hash to keep track of the counts. In python, the basic hash is a dictionary.
Just little modification in your solutionfirst you are looping wrong:-Take a look:-
Feedback on code:In these lines:The outer loop is looping over each character in , and the inner loop is looping over every character in . This is like a Cartesian product of the elements in the list, and is not necessary here. Secondly, in this line:You are accessing  by its indices, but  and  are not indices, they are the characters themselves. So treating them as indices does not work here, since characters are not valid indices for lists. If you wanted to access just the indices, you could access them with :Or if you want to access the elements and their indices, you can use . Having said this, your approach is too complicated and needs to be redone. You need to group your characters and count them. Using nested loops is overkill here. Alternative approaches:There are lots of better ways to do this such as using  and dictionaries. These data structures are very good for counting. Since it also looks like your struggling with loops, I suggest going back to the basics, and then attempt doing this problem with a dictionary.
