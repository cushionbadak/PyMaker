Here is my codeoutput **I get the correct output when I sort using sort_values. What I want to do now is convert the sorted value into a dictionary using to_dict().output**Is there a way for order to say sorted converting to the dictionary using to_dict() or is there another way I can convert the dataframe into a dictionary? I would like the dictionary format to stay the same also 
No, you can't order a Python dictionary.Python dictionaries are unordered:It is best to think of a dictionary as an unordered set of key: value pairs, with the requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary). A pair of braces creates an empty dictionary: {}. Placing a comma-separated list of key:value pairs within the braces adds initial key:value pairs to the dictionary; this is also the way dictionaries are written on output.
