My data is a file full of these strings. The first 2 elements, let's take 10 and 0, are the characteristics of a sample, for example 10-1 is a different sample.What I want is a dictionary where these 2 elements, in this case 10 and 0, are the name under that format 10-0 and 10-0 being a list explained below:Same for 2-29 it would be another element of that dictionary containing 2 lists. I referred to https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html but what I have to do is much more complex than their documentation.

In case of using  the value is an empty list . For a more complex example if you write  the default value will be a list of length 2 with 2  in it.
Try this one:t.txtProgram:Outputs:See it in action here
