I've created a new form for comments the articles on a website. When I add the new comment from django admin everything works ok, but when I try to add the new comment directly from detail page nothings happen and I'am redirecting to the page with list of articles.here are my filesmodels.py:vies.py with the function of detailsforms.pyand detail.htmlclas Wpisy in models.py
