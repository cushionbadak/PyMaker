I have a python script where I clone github repositories, and then I open the files that have a .py extension and put them all, into a different file, so I have one large file with all python scripts.The error thrown is : Probably due to a file that has is encoded with a different standard.Is there a way around this ?My ultimate goal is to have one large python file with all the clones .py files, and .c file with all the clones c files.So can I avoid the different encoded ones or is there a different way around this?
You can try to specify encoding when opening your files by using codecs.open:andP.S. You may want to read this article about dealing with Unicode: https://docs.python.org/2/howto/unicode.htmlP.P.S. As you are using Python 3, you may just add an encoding argument to your existing open function without importing codecs module:and
the file probably contains some data which is not a correct utf8. You should check which encoding do they have. It wil be harder to recover it once the files concatenated.Otherwise, try adding parameter  to the open calls, both for reading and writing. This should preserve the byte values of the input, even if it is not a correct utf8.
