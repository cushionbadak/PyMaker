I tried with the following code:Unfortunately, from the initial list composed by 252 elements, the output is the following:This is exactly the position of the first element which is not a list, but a string. Then the other string positions are registered with the same index number. Probably is due to the fact that all the strings are equal. How it is possible to obtain the correct index numbers?
You can use the enumerate() builtin function to get the index value of every string in a list. Here is an example:This will print the index of every string element in .
For variety here is another way:
