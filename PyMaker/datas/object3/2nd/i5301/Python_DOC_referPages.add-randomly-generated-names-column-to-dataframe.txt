I know how to create random string, like:However, there should be no duplicates so what I am currently just checking if the key already exists in a list, like shown in the following code:Which is okay for a small amount of keys like , however the problem does not scale well the more keys there are. So I am wondering if there is a faster way to get to the result for even more keys, like 
Basic improvements, sets and local namesUse a set, not a list, and testing for uniqueness is much faster; set membership testing takes constant time independent of the set size, while lists take O(N) linear time. Use a set comprehension to produce a series of keys at a time to avoid having to look up and call the  method in a loop; properly random, larger keys have a very small chance of producing duplicates anyway.Because this is done in a tight loop, it is worth your while optimising away all name lookups as much as possible:The  keyword argument binds the  name to a local in the function, which are faster to reference than globals, especially when attribute lookups are involved.The  partial avoids looking up attributes on modules or more locals; it is a single callable that has all the references in place, so is faster in execute, especially when done in a loop.The  loop keeps iterating only if there were duplicates produced. We produce enough keys in a single set comprehension to fill the remainder if there are no duplicates.Timings for that first improvementFor 100 items, the difference is not that big:but when you start scaling this up, you'll notice that the O(N) membership test cost against a list really drags your version down:My version is already almost twice as fast as 10k items; 40k items can be run 10 times in about 32 seconds:The list version took over 2 minutes, more than ten times as long.Numpy's random.choice function, not cryptographically strongYou can make this faster still by forgoing the  module and using  instead; this won't produce a cryptographic level randomness however, but picking a random character is twice as fast:This makes a huge difference, now 10 times 40k keys can be produced in just 16 seconds:Further tweaks with the itertools module and a generatorWe can also take the  function from the  module Recipes section to have it take care of the uniqueness, then use an infinite generator and the  function to limit the results to just the number we want:This is slightly faster still, but only marginally so:os.urandom() bytes and a different method of producing stringsNext, we can follow on on Adam Barnes's ideas for using UUID4 (which is basically just a wrapper around ) and Base64. But by case-folding Base64 and replacing 2 characters with randomly picked ones, his method severely limits the entropy in those strings (you won't produce the full range of unique values possible, a 20-character string only using  == 1 in every 99437 bits of entropy!).The Base64 encoding uses both upper and lower case characters and digits but also adds the  and  characters (or  and  for the URL-safe variant). For only uppercase letters and digits, you'd have to uppercase the output and map those extra two characters to other random characters, a process that throws away a large amount of entropy from the random data provided by . Instead of using Base64, you could also use the Base32 encoding, which uses uppercase letters and the digits 2 through 8, so produces strings with 32 ** n possibilities versus 36 ** n. However, this can speed things up further from the above attempts:This is really fast:40k keys, 10 times, in just over 4 seconds. So about 75 times as fast; the speed of using  as a source is undeniable.This is, cryptographically strong again;  produces bytes for cryptographic use. On the other hand, we reduced the number of possible strings produced by more than 90% ( is 90.5), we are no longer using the , ,  and  digits in the outputs.So perhaps we should use the  trick to produce a proper Base36 encoding; we'll have to produce our own  function:and use that:This is reasonably fast, and above all produces the full range of 36 uppercase letters and digits:Granted, the base32 version is almost twice as fast as this one (thanks to an efficient Python implementation using a table) but using a custom Base36 encoder is still twice the speed of the non-cryptographically secure  version.However, using  produces bias again; we have to produce more bits of entropy than is required for between 12 to 19 base36 'digits'. For 17 digits, for example, we can't produce 36 ** 17 different values using bytes, only the nearest equivalent of 256 ** 11 bytes, which is about 1.08 times too high, and so we'll end up with a bias towards , , and to a lesser extent,  (thanks Stefan Pochmann for pointing this out).Picking an integer below  and mapping integers to base36So we need to reach out to a secure random method that can give us values evenly distributed between  (inclusive) and  (exclusive). We can then map the number directly to the desired string.First, mapping the integer to a string; the following has been tweaked to produce the output string the fastest:Next, we need a fast and cryptographically secure method of picking our number in a range. You can still use  for this, but then you'd have to mask the bytes down to a maximum number of bits, and then loop until your actual value is below the limit. This is actually already implemented, by the  function. In Python versions < 3.6 you can use , which uses the exact same method with some extra wrapping to support a lower bound greater than 0 and a step size.Using  the function becomes:and this then is quite close to the (probably biased) base64 solution:This is almost as fast as the Base32 approach, but produces the full range of keys!
So it's a speed race is it?Building on the work of Martijn Pieters, I've got a solution which cleverly leverages another library for generating random strings:  .My solution is to generate a , base64 encode it and uppercase it, to get only the characters we're after, then slice it to a random length.This works for this case because the length of outputs we're after, (12-20), is shorter than the shortest base64 encoding of a uuid4.  It's also really fast, because  is very fast.I also made it a generator instead of a regular function, because they can be more efficient.Interestingly, using the standard library's  function was faster than 's.Here is the test output:Here is the code for :And here is the entire project.  (At commit d9925d at the time of writing).Thanks to feedback from Martijn Pieters, I've improved the method somewhat, increasing the entropy, and speeding it up by a factor of about 1/6th.There is still a lot of entropy lost in casting all lowercase letters to uppercase.  If that's important, then it's possibly advisable to use  instead, which has the characters we want, minus , , , and .The new solution reads as follows:And the test output:The new commit in my repository is 5625fd.Martijn's comments on entropy got me thinking.  The method I used with  and  makes letters SO much more common than numbers.  I revisited the problem with a more binary mind on.The idea was to take output from , interpret it as a long string of 6-bit unsigned numbers, and use those numbers as an index to a rolling array of the allowed characters.  The first 6-bit number would select a character from the range , the second 6-bit number would select a character from the range , and so on.This has a slight crushing of entropy in that the first character will be slightly less likely to contain , the second character less likely to contain , and so on, but it's so much better than before.It's slightly faster than , and slightly slower than , as shown below:I'm not entirely sure how to eliminate the last bit of entropy crushing; offsetting the start point for the characters will just move the pattern along a little, randomising the offset will be slow, shuffling the map will still have a period...  I'm open to ideas.The new code is as follows:And the full code, along with a more in-depth README on the implementation, is over at de0db8.I tried several things to speed the implementation up, as visible in the repo.  Something that would definitely help is a character encoding where the numbers and ASCII uppercase letters are sequential.
A simple and fast one:-- Edit: The below refers to a previous revision of Martijn's answer. After our discussion he added another solution to it, which is essentially the same as mine but with some optimizations. They don't help much, though, it's only about 3.4% faster than mine in my testing, so in my opinion they mostly just complicate things. --Compared with Martijn's final solution in his accepted answer mine is a lot simpler, about factor 1.7 faster, and not biased:Martijn's has a bias in the first character,  appears far too often and  far to seldom. I ran my test ten times, his most common first character was always  or  (five times each), and his least common character was always ,  or  (two, three and five times, respectively). I also checked the lengths separately, length 17 was particularly bad, his most common first character always appeared about 51500 times while his least common first character appeared about 25400 times.Fun side note: I'm using the  module that Martijn dismissed :-)My whole script:
Caveat: This is not cryptographically secure. I want to give an alternative  approach to the one in Martijn's great answer. functions aren't really optimised to be called repeatedly in a loop for small tasks; rather, it's better to perform each operation in bulk. This approach gives more keys than you need (massively so in this case because I over-exaggerated the need to overestimate) and so is less memory efficient but is still super fast.We know that all your string lengths are between 12 and 20. Just generate all the string lengths in one go. We know that the final  has the possibility of trimming down the final list of strings, so we should anticipate that and make more "string lengths" than we need. 20,000 extra is excessive, but it's to make a point:Rather than create all our sequences in a  loop, create a 1D list of characters that is long enough to be cut into 40,000 lists. In the absolute worst case scenario, all the random string lengths in (1) were the max length of 20. That means we need 800,000 characters.Now we just need to chop that list of random characters up. Using  we can get sequential starting indices for the sublists, and  will offset that array of indices by 1, to give a corresponding array of end indices.Chop up the list of random characters by the indices.Putting it all together:And  results:
Alternate approach: Uniqueness in creation rather than by testThe obvious approach to your question would be to generate random output, and then check whether it is unique. Though I do not offer an implementation, here is an alternate approach:Generate output that looks as random as possibleGenerate output that is guaranteed to be unique, and looks somewhat randomCombine themNow you have output that is guaranteed to be unique, and appears to be random.ExampleSuppose you would want to generate 999999 strings with lengths from 12 and 20. The approach will of course work for all character sets, but lets keep it simple and assume you want to use only 0-9.Generate random output with lengths from 6 to 14Randomly permute the numbers 000000 to 999999 (yes 6 digits is quite a lot to 'sacrifice' in apparent randomness, but with a larger characterset you won't need this many characters)Now combine them in a way that the uniqueness must be preserved. The most trivial way would be simple concatenation of the entities, but you can of course think of less obvious solutions. Small scale exampleGenerate randomness:sdfdsf xxer ver Generate uniquenessxdaebdCombinexdsdfdsfaexxerbdverNote that this method assumes that you have a minimum number of characters per entry, which seems to be the case in your question.
