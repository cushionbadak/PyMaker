Natural Text
I get a queryset from a model that saves the data to a . The charfield is displayed on a form as  with a  widget. The max amount of choices is 5.I want to count the number of elements in the queryset. Each queryset can vary in the amount of the elements in the list. Now, when I get  of the list, the value is 5 times the amount of elements. Is the list in the dict not a list but something else? When I create a list manually without the queryset and get  of said list, the value is correct. E.g. list with 3 elements returns 3. 
Use the ast module to convert the string list to list object and get the len
If you use a charfield to store the data, everything while being stored willl get converted to a char so you can't use len on it directly.You can use use a JSONField or ListField if your're using postgres as your db backend.If you have to use a CharField or a TextField then you'll need to first convert it back. You can create a custom field inheriting from TextField which will do it everywhere you use it or just use json.loads() after you load the data from the database
