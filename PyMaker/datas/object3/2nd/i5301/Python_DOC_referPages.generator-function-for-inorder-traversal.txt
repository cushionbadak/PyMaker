I've been working on my generator functions and expressions recently, but I'm not quite sure how I would tackle this. How could I use a generator function to yield and then later print the values in order?  I built my BST using pythons listIf I were to print the inorder traversal, I have no problem. So if I were to call  for the following function:I get this output.I would think that a generator expression would be equally as simple The problem I'm running into is getting my main to iterate through what's yielded in the function. I thought it was supposed to be something likeInstead of iterating over the entire functions yields, it simply stops the iterable seemingly before it starts. What do I need to do to make my function generator operate correctly? 
Your  implementation doesn't correctly recurse. You are only printing the current top node of your tree. That's because only calling  or  returns a generator object, you are not iterating over those generators.UseThe  expression delegates the generator to another, yielding from that sub-generator until it is done. That way you properly recurse.If you are using an older Python release (before Python 3.3), you need to manually iterate over the recursive calls:Next, you can just iterate over the  generator:although using  works too:but iteration is cleaner and stops automatically once  is raised.
