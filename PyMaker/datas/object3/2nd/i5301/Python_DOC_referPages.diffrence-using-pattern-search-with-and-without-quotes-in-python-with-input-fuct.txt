What and why it makes diffrence while using Patt_Search as  then it works  and  don't work , as i ran it and did not seen any error though.. it simply gets out..Saying that, it works without the quote and don't work with quotes .The way it works as Below:It works as below:The way it don't works as Below:Result is as below, which don't yeild any output and no error though!
If you're using , it just searches for the string literal . A string containing a variable name has nothing to do with the variable itself.
What is the purpose of this question? The first script apparently works as expected, so why not just use that?In the second script,  is a literal string, so  searches for the string  in the input line. I'm guessing that your LDAP data file does not contain the string  anywhere, hence there will not be any matches, and there will be no output nor any errors.
in the first case you're passing your input , which is found three times in the file and printed to the screen.in the second case you're searching for the string , which can't be found in the file , thus nothing gets printed to the screen. https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html
