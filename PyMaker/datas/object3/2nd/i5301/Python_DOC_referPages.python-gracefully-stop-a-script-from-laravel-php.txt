I'm looking for a way to gracefully exit from a long running python script which I launch from my Laravel app.My actual process to do so is:From Laravel set a 'script_state' to 1 in a MySql table databaseLaunch the python script via The python scripts periodically check the 'script_state' by a MySql query. If it is changed to 0 (intentionally from my Laravel app) then it gracefully exit the scriptRetrieving the  from the  and then kill could have been an option but I actually wan't the script to stop and exit gracefully.My actual config works but I'm looking for a better approach. 
Retrieving the  from the  and then kill could have been an option but I actually wan't the script to stop and exit gracefully.This is probably your best bet. You can use  to politely ask the script to exit:The  signal is a generic signal used to cause program termination. Unlike , this signal can be blocked, handled, and ignored. It is the normal way to politely ask a program to terminate.This is effectively what happens when you click the close button in a GUI application.In your Python code you can handle  using the  module with whatever cleanup logic you want, then exit:See also this Stack Overflow answer for a class that cleans up before exiting.
