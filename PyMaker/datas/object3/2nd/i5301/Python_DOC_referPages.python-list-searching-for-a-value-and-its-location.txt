I'm looking for the greatest number out of a list to then obtain the element 1 location before If anyone knows how to do this it would be very much appreciated. 
Here's one way. Note this requires structure, i.e. room, then size sequentially. I don't think that's a bad idea, since you should be using a dictionary or list of tuples anyway.
This will do it without having to traverse the list multiple times:This uses enumerate to get the indexes of  at the same time it is searching for the max.Or you can be slightly clever with zip:which relies upon using the same iterator over  to feed successive values to  (borrowed from another excellent answer). This essentially turns your flat list into a list of tuples which would be a nicer way of storing the original data, if you have that option:
Say there are 2 equal maximum numbers in the input list, it will take the first one. That will be a limitation to the solution
How about:I'd recommend changing your data format though, if you can. A dictionary mapping number to name would (or name to number) would be a lot more natural. Even a list of lists might be easier to deal with.
