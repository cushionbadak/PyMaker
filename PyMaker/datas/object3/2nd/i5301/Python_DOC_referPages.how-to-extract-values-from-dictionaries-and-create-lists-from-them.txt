I have a list of dictionaries:I would like to separate the values from the keys in each dictionary, making a list of lists like this:I have the following code to perform this...When I run this code in my app, I get:TypeError: list() takes 0 positional arguments but 1 was givenWhat's the right way to do this type of list comprehension?
That can be done with a couple of comprehensions like:Code:How?How does this work? This is a nested comprehension.  Let's go from the inside out, and start with:This creates a tuple of all of the elements in  that are specified via  in .  So, that is nice, but what the heck are ,  and ? is passed to the function, and are the keys we will look for in our dicts. is the individual values in  from . is the individual dicts in  from .The outer comprehension builds a list of the tuples discussed above:Test Code:Results:
Hi If you want to convert a list of tuples it so easy with list comprehension technique or the code which you are using it is for list of list but you expected solution looks like list of tuplesThis might help you which will give you output like this
Hi, Trey, is disordered in python, so the values in the  may be disordered too.If you want a ordered result, you may try  in python.
In Python 2.x:Python 3.x:
