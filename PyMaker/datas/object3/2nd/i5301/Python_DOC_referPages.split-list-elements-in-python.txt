I have a list,and I want to group the elements by the 'F', where the 'F' is the end of the group, so it  the list into separate groups.Like this:
This program assumes that your list elements are always single characters.  If that isn't true, you would need to work directly on the list.  I convert to a string to use the convenient str.split method, then convert each substring back into a list.
Use  with a  function:Another way is with string operations:Note that both solutions above will include any trailing items that follow the final . Not sure if that is what you want?
This is one way.
Simple but easy to follow solution:Note that this assumes empty lists (consecutive F's) should be ignored, but that's easy to remove.
