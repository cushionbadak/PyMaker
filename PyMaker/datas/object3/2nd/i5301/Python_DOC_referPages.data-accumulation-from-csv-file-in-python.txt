Natural Text
shown above is a sample csv file.First of all, My final goal is that the compile result becomes a table about number of connections between gates like below:and Now I finished making a list of the first column(out_gate)like this;  and trying to match this each data  one by one to the in_gate so, for example when out_gate 'c'-> in_gate 'b', number of connections is 8 and'c'->'a' becomes 9.I can match out_blk and in_blk in a row with its connection numbers, but hard to accumulate the connection numbers of each out_gateIs there any solution ?
In plain Python you should look at the  module for the input and a  for collecting the totals:
If you do this for large amounts of data, you should absolutely check out numpy and pandas, which both have more effective and natural methods of handling tables than native python.In case you only need a solution right now, accumulations can be done straight forwardly in pure python with :Now you can access the entries the following way:
This is a one-line high-level answer via pandas.pivot_table, if you do not wish to resort to line-by-line readers and defaultdict.
You can use :Output:
