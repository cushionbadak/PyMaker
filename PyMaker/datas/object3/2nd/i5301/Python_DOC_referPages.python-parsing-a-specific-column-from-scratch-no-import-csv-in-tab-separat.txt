I've written some code that can parse a string into tuples as such:I.e.; becomes That part works just fine. I'm struggling now, however, with figuring out how to get the values from the first column of a tab-separated-value file to become my new 's'. I.e.; for a file that looks like:There would somehow be a loop incorporated to take only the first column, producingwithout having to use Or any other module.Thanks so much!
Just open the path to the file and iterate through the records?
The following code would serve your purposeChange row.split('  ') to ('\t') or any other seperator as per the need
something like this should do what you're looking for.elements[0] contains the string that is the first column of data in the file.Edit:to end up with a list of the lists of processed data:
So this is what ended up working for me--took bits and pieces from everyone, thank you all! Note: I know it's a bit verbose, but since I'm new, it helps me keep track of everything :)
