I've created a few python scripts that I have to run every once in a while, but now I constantly have to type or search the location to the script in order to execute it. I have been looking for simple software to create an app with buttons, but without success. I have also seen "python?" scripts with an interface where you can select options with arrow keys, but also for this I have not found how it is done. Is there anyone who knows how I can make one of these that I can open the interface and select the script I want to execute? It would really save me a lot of time.
You can Tkinter to create the GUI, and for each button create a function that runs your python script like this:
I recommend using PyQt because that framework is the powerful tool for building GUI on python and for running scripts from python code as system processes you can use subprocess module. I think you know how to use Google to find tutorials =) And also you can check the official page with GUI FAQ here. Thank you!
