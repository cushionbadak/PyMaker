I have a Python script which takes a lot of arguments.I currently use a  file (read using ), but would like to allow the user to override specific arguments using command line.If I'd only have had two arguments I'd have used something like:But I don't want to do that for 30 arguments.Any easy way to take optional arguments from cmd line, and default to the  file?
Try the following, using dict.update():With this example of ini file:and would contain:
You can use a ChainMap from the  module.From the doc:A ChainMap groups multiple dicts or  other mappings together to create a single, updateable view. [...]Lookups search the underlying mappings successively until a key is  found.  [...]So, you could create a  dict containing the key-value pairs from your config file,a  dict containing the ones given on the command lineThen, create a ChainMap:When you access , arg1 will first be looked up in the  dict, and if it isn't found there,  will be returned.You can chain as many dicts as you wish, which lets you combine as many levels of defaults as you wish.
