I am curious why, if I make a list and an int and try to find it in gc.get_objects(), I found only the list. Code:Outputs only: Found: b1There's no  in  but of course I can still access it.
You can read the python documentation here:As a general rule, instances of atomic types aren’t tracked and instances of non-atomic types (containers, user-defined objects…) are.To be noticed that this is not absolutely the case. This citation is also added to avoid misleading:However, some type-specific optimizations can be present in order to suppress the garbage collector footprint of simple instances
