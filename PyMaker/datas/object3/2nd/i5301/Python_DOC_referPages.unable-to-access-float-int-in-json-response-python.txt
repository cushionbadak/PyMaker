I wish to access values from the  section of the response.I have the following JSON response.I have successfully extracted the  and  values but when i try to extract the timings using:Using the Decimal Parser as specified in the Python Docs https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html I get the error:Without the parser I get:I have tried using  and I get the same error.How can I access and return Integers and Floats from the JSONFull Traceback is:
As I mentioned, I don't understand at all why you want to parse ints and floats as decimals. But either way, that is not at all the cause of the problem you are having, since you get errors both with and without.The error traceback shows exactly what is wrong: you are trying to concatenate a string with an int or a decimal. Python doesn't let you do that; you can only concatenate strings with other strings. There are various ways you could fix this, but the best is not to concatenate. Use string interpolation instead.(Note, your attempt to fix this by doing  is not the right thing at all; it's not the key, "pushEnd", that is the problem, and anyway that's already a string; it's the value, ie the result of that lookup, that is an int. So you could do , but as I say using interpolation is better.)
