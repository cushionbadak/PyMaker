I have 2 lists I am trying to write a python script and my mapping element in  with element in  and  if someone inputs value  all the related values should populate. Eg if I enter  as input parameter the output should beif I enter  as input parameter output should beI tried python dictionaries but dictionary is not allowing duplicate keys. Is there is a way to achieve this in Python?
A rare use case for : takes an iterable of values, and an iterable of "truthy or falsy" values, returning the items from the first iterable when the second iterable provides a truthy paired value. So in this case, we want items from , when the value in  matches the provided index, which we compute on the fly with a generator expression.Mind you, for repeated lookups, a  is a better bet. Simply using:will allow you to efficiently do  as many times as needed (possibly catching  to ignore the case when the key doesn't exist, or to produce a friendlier error message).
You can simply create the dictionary out of the two lists. Might save some of your typing...
