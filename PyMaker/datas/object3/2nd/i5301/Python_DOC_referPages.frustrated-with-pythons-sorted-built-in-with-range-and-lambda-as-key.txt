I encountered something that makes no sense to me. See this use of  with  and :Which outputs this in the Python shell:Now, for the life of me, I don't get this! I've been playing around with , , and , and it doesn't make sense. For example, if you run the  bit in a for loop, you get something like this:And the  bit:But putting it all together... I don't understand how using the  this way makes the order independent of the sign.But this makes sense to me:Can someone shed some light on this?
Let's go through this step by step:The sequence you're sorting is , which is .The elements of this sequence with their corresponding keys are:Now let's sort this table by key:This means that the output of  will be , then  and  in some order, then  and  in some order, etc.   performs a stable sort, so any input elements with the same key will be output in the same order that they appear in the input; since the negatives occur before the positives in , this means that  will output  before ,  before , etc.Thus, the final output is .
