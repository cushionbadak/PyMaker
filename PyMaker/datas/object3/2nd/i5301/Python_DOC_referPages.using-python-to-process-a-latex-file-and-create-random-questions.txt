I am using python to pre-process a LaTeX file before running it through the LaTeX compiler. I have a python script which reads a  file. The  file contains some python code at the top which helps to initialize problems with randomization. Below the python code I have LaTeX code for the problem. For each variable in the LaTeX code, I use the symbol  to signify that it should be randomized and replaced before compiling. For example, I may write  to be a random integer between 1 and 10.There may be larger issues with what I'm trying to do, but so far it's working mostly as I need it to. Here is a sample  file:As you can see, removing the  and replacing it with the actual value of  is starting to become tedious. In my python script, I just replace all of the ed things in my  string.which seems to work okay. However, it seems obnoxious and ugly. My Question: Is there a better way of working between the variable identifier and the string version of the identifier? It would be great if I could simply make a python list of variable names I'm using in the .def file, and then run a simple command to update the LaTeX code. What I've done is cumbersome and painful. Thanks in advance!
Yes either  or  or . In this case I'd say .Also  would work:https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#varsIn the following fragment it's e.g used to make objects know their own name:Yet another, unnecessary complicated, solution would be to generate a .py file with the right replace statements from your .def file.
