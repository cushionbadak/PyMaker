I have several wadl files from a web application, and I need to generate a list of all valid REST endpoint URLS from that wadl file.I have tried using packages like wadlib, wadl2py and wadl2swagger, but they all give me errors saying the wadl file is not valid.The file is being generated by jasper 2.I need a list of all endpoint URLS and the valid methods/parameters for each endpoint.Any tips would be appreciated.
Basicly these files are XML files.So if the libraries didn't help you, you can try use Python XML modules to handle as XML and you can check the specification here or see the Wikipedia.I think that extracting the Resources names from theses files can be pretty simple if you have a good experience with Python.Here is an example:https://gist.github.com/klassmann/1e75d4a640bfbc766f8058f728267553
