Could someone tell me whether this idea is feasible in Python?I want to have a method and the datatype of the signature is not fixed.For example: Foo(data1, data2)      <-- Method Definition in CodeFoo(2,3)    <---- Example of what would be executed in runtimeFoo(s,t)    <---- Example of what would be executed in runtimeI know the code could work if i change the Foo(s,t) to Foo("s","t"). But I am trying to make the code smarter to recognize the command without the "" ...
singledispatch might be an answer, which transforms a function into a generic function, which can have different behaviors depending upon the type of its first argument.You could see a concrete example in the above link. And you should do some special things if you want to do generic dispatch on more than one arguments.
