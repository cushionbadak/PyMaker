I have a dict inside a list that is currently like this:I would like to regroup or reorganize it as follows:I tried using  and  as suggested here, but cannot quite get what I want.  How can I do this?
With a small loop and  you can do the grouping like this:Code:To get the other output format after grouping:Test Code:Results:
Take a look at itertools.groupby, then the following code maybe help you.Sample Output:
You will need to iterate through the old list and reformat each element into the new one
I like this kind of syntax when dealing with custom objects derived from some dictionary data:Working code: repl.it
If you want to use a , you can do this:Which gives:
Option 1Here is a standard  approach: For simplicity, if given the form , here  simply is substituted with a filtered dictionary comprehension.   is the input list of dicts.Option 2 is a third-party recipe that extends  to allow changes to the resulting groups:  Here duplicate keys are deleted from the resulting groups.  Deleting items will mutate the nested dictionaries.  To preserve some level of the former nested dicts, make deepcopies, i.e.g. see the optional line. 
in one line you can do something like this:output:
