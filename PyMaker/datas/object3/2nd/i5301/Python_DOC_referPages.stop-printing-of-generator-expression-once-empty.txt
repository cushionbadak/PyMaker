I have a fairly basic code that tests both generator functions and generator expressions. It works like a charm, but I can't figure out how to get the generator expression  to stop printing once it reaches the final value. I have tried using  for xyz being a number of different len() calls, but I've gotten an error anytime I try to use the size of my generator expression. To save you time, my question is about the final 3 lines of the python code. Code:Output:What can I do to get it to not print the  nonsense? Is there a way to limit
A for loop will exhaust the generator and catch the  for you:Using the code  doesn't make sense, because the generator expression itself will always be truthy.  
There appears to be a large amount of unnecessary code and generators which don't yield any benefit. I've cleaned it up for you below.This solution removes the need for iterating generators, and includes  to perform the counting for you.
