Natural Text
I am trying to check if today's date < date downloaded from text file online. Here is my code :The result that comes back is just this : 2018,02,14. I use .strip() in case there might be blank spaces or extra lines. I've printed out result.text after strip() and it shows the correct details. Why is it that I can't check if today < Url_date. It works fine if I enter manually a date into datetime.date(2018,02,14), but when I'm downloading the string it won't work. Any suggestions?
You pass string to  which should be each an integer.Now pass these integers to 
The arguments you pass to  are not strings as a whole. When you pass it from url, what you are actually doing isNote that you are passing only one string argument and not 3 different integers. You should split the date string using comma and then convert each into integers and then pass them as arguments to datetime.date.
Here is what your code is trying to do :But he wants to have:DoAnd then convert all the  in the  in It should be ok  :)
