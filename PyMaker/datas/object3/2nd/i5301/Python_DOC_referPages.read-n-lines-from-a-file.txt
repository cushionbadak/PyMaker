so for class we have to start out our problem doing this:Write a function that takes as its input a filename, and an integer. The file should open the file and read in the first number of lines given as the second argument. (You'll need to have a variable to use as a counter for this part).It's very basic and I figure a loop is needed but I can't figure out how to incorporate a loop into the question. What I've tried doesn't work and it's been about 3 hours and the best I can come up with ishowever that doesn't get me to what I need for the function. It's still early in my intro to python class so basic code is all we have worked with. 
There are two basic looping strategies you could use here: you could count up to , reading lines as you goyou could read lines from file, keeping track of how many you've read, and stop when you reach a certain number.The first is obviously more readable, and since  will just return an empty string if it runs out of lines, it's safe to use even if the user asks for more lines than the infile has.Here I'm also using a context manager to make sure the files are closed when I'm done with them.Here's a version without the stuff you don't recognize
