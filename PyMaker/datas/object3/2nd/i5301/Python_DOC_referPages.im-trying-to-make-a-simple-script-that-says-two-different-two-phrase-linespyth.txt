So, I'm just starting to program Python and I wanted to make a very simple script that will say something like "Gabe- Hello, my name is Gabe (Just an example of a sentence" + "Jerry- Hello Gabe, I'm Jerry" OR "Gabe- Goodbye, Jerry" + "Jerry- Goodbye, Gabe". Here's pretty much what I wrote.I'm quite sure it's a very simple fix, but as I have just started Python (Like, literally 2-3 days ago) I don't quite know what the problem would be. Here's my error messageIf anyone could help me with this, I would very much appreciate it! Other than that, I shall be searching on ways that may be relevant to fixing this.
The problem is that  requires a parameter  that indicates how many random samples you want to take. However in this case it looks like you do not need , since you already have the random integer. Note that that integer should be in the range , because the list  has only two elements.or the same behavior with , see here for an explanation.Hope this helps!
This sample method should looks like However, I am concerted you also have no idea how lists are working. Can you explain why do you using lists of strings and then adding values in them? I am losing you here.If you going to pick a pair or strings, use method described by Florian (requesting data by  value.)
k parameter tell random.sample function that how many sample you need, you should write:which means you need 3 sample from your list. the output will be something like:
