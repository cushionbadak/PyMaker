The PYTHONPATH in your terminal environment doesn't contain 'my_module'.Configure the PYTHONPATH to include the directory containing your moduleIt works in pycharm because it sets up the path for you automagically.Learn about the module search path
Another reason might be you had started your project in pycharm with virtual enviroment. If it is the case go to your projects  folder via your terminal and run  .You will see "(venv)" on leftmost in your terminal line. Then go to your project folder and runNow it should work.
