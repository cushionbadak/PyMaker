I'm having trouble with the Open() function in python. It's only taking one positional argument in some cases, and other times it's fine.In one file, this works perfectly, but in another, an error code pops up saying open only takes one argument. The file that works is on my windows machine, but it doesn't work every time. It doesn't seem to work at all on my Raspberry Pi.Is this an issue with my interpreter? If so, can anyone suggest what I can do, or if there's another way to read and write to text files?
i think it's better explained in the python docs. You can access the info on open function through the link https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open
