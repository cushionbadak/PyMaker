My socket sends the first message but nothing afterward.The output in the server:The client receives:And then it doesn't want to send anything else. I don't get the  printed anymore.My code: file: file:
The client only connects once (OK) but the server waits for an incoming connection every start of the  loop. Since there are no more connection requests by a client, the server will freeze on the second iteration.If you just want to handle a single client, move  before the  loop. If you want to handle multiple clients, the standard way is to have the server accept connections inside the  loop and spawn a thread for each client. You can also use coroutines, but that may be a bit overkill if you are just starting out.
