I am trying to run a  file as a background service in Jupiter notebook.
Ipython/Jupyter background jobs is designed to run either plain code to  (string), or function. Files and ipython magic commands is not supported.One thing you can do is to simply read file content and pass it to : is pretty much the same, but a little bit "smarter".Side note: all background machinery behind this interfaces runs in threads of the same process and share interpreter state and output. So, just keep in mind:this is not suited for computational-heavy scriptsnever run untrusted code this way â€” this applies to  overall, but in this case you can into situation when you'll never get GIL back to your "frontend" threadavoid scripts that use stdout, most probably those will clutch with your main thread
