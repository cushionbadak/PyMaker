Natural Text
I have a word list like this:They are separated by different number of '\n'What I want to do is to put these words which separate by one '\n' in an inner list, and the words which separate by more than one (could be 2,3 or more) '\n' in different inner list like this:I triedit doesn't workMy code cannot print anything when the input text isI know it is because I initialized the list as an empty one when meet a '\n'I also found another question Creating nested list from string data with two delimiters in Pythonabout creating nested list by different separators, but it cannot solve my question
You can do this with the  method. We also use  to clean up any blank spaces (or tabs) at the ends of lines. We don't have to worry about newlines, since  takes care of those.The idea is that if there are any blank lines or lines just containing whitespace, they will get converted to empty strings by the combined action of  & . So when we encounter an empty , if we have data in the  buffer we append it to the  output buffer, and create a new empty  buffer. Otherwise, we just append the current  to the  buffer. When we get to the end of the data we also need to save any data from  to .outputNote that it's easy to adapt this code to reading line by line directly from a file. You don't need to read the whole file into a list before you start work on it. Eg,
You can first split based on multiple occurences of  by using a regular expression. Assuming your input is in the variable , we can do the followingThen you can further divide each individual string based on a single This yields
You can use split with regex the multiple  ( => 2 or more  in a row) and then  each part by a single :By the way, it's preferable to use  when working with files (for a proper file closing ant context managing):
