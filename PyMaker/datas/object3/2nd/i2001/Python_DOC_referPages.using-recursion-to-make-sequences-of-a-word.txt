I was given a homework assignment to find all possible sequences of a given word. eg. if , the below code would return .However, this feels inefficient. I'm just starting to learn recursion, so I'm not sure if there is a better or more efficient way to produce these sequences?edit:I think it's necessary to add a couple things as I kept working and reading the materialDuplicates are fine, those are sorted out in a separate functionEach value is unique, so sequence 'aab' should produce two 'aa' sequences
Itertools and list comprehensions are good for breaking stuff down like this.
