I have two modules in the same package,  and .In  I have a function reading command-line args with :Now suppose in  I import  from  and use it (this works):Use:Output:Namespace(argA='A', argB='B', argC='C', argD=None)The question is: how to read arguments in  ( and/or ) additional to those of ? (I.e. have  in  contain more arguments, just for )
You'd need to use partial parsing with  to achieve what you want, and / or pass your arguments as a list, explicitly.Normally, without arguments  takes all values from  (so everything but the first element) as the input to parse. If there are elements in that list that can't be parsed, then an error message is printed and  is called; your script would exit.So if you want some arguments on  to go to one parser, and the remainder to another, you want to use  and pass the remainder to the other parser.I'd split out creating and configuring the  instances from parsing; so in  do:and in , use the same structure, but re-use the parser from :
