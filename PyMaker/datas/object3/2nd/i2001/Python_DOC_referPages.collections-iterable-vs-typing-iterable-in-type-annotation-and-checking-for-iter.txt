I found that in Python both  and  can be used in type annotation and checking for whether an object is iterable, i.e., both  and  works. My question is, what are the differences among them? And which one is preferred in which situations? 
The  is generic, so you can say what it's an iterable of in your type annotations, e.g.  for an iterable of ints.The collections iterable is an abstract base class. These can include extra mixin methods to make the interface easier to implement when you create your own subclasses.Now it so happens that  doesn't include any of these mixins, but it is part of the interface of other abstract base classes that do.So in short, you should use the typing iterable in type annotations, but the collections iterable as a superclass.
