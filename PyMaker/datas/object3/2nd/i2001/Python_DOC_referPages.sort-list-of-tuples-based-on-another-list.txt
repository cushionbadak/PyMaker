I have a list of tuples for eg.  I have another list I want to sort  on the second value of every tuple according to the order present in . The final result should be As you can see, the tuples whose second value was  are present first, then comes tuples with second value  and the lastly those which have .I wrote the following:This is pretty straight forward. But I was wondering if there is any pythonic way to get this thing done?
You can use  with an appropriate  function:
You can create a  that uses the value as key and the index given by  to sort it:Using a dict that way has the advantage of not using  on every lookup into . You would use  to avoid missing keys causing trouble and just provide a default thats sure to not be in the list so they get put at the end/front.Output:
You could also just use the sort method of the list  to sort on the second value of each tuple:If this is not sufficient and you need the second list  for the definition of the order, you can use the index method of the list:
