I can change the order to python2,3 folders in the system PATH variable. But what are other ways to do this?There should be more elegant way to change versions of python i want to run.e.g. in console:python file.py #will run python2 and after i change python command to use python3, it should be the same:python file.py #will use python3
I suppose you are trying to run your script with the correct interpreter depending on which python version was used. On Unix/Linux this is done with a so called “shebang” which is written in the very first line of the file. E.g.:If your installation of Python3 is newer than Python 3.3 you can use the python launcher for windows, which should be able to launch the correct version of Python depending on the shebang, even on window.Also see here for more informations on shebangs.
If your concern is what Python version is executed when calling  in a console, then an alias or a stub script are the two ways to go.This post will explain you how you can do this on Windows.The alias way, just like it would be on a Unix system, is to create an alias, either temporary to the session or permanent, so that  now means , or whatever version you want.The script approach consists in putting a script named  in a directory referred to in your , and have that script run the right version of Python.I highly doubt that this will affect all the batch scripts that call , but it will definitely fire the right Python when you'll type  in a console.Now, if you're concerned about what version a script is executed with, you can specify an explicit version with a shebang line, or manually select it by right-clicking the  file and clicking .
