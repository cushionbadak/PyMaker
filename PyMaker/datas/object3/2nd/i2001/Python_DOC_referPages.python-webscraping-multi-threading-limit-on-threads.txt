I have a code to retrieve search results from website.The ExtractDetails function is a big search function that searches the websites.The problem with the script is that my laptop will hang if I run this code, because it will generate 3406 threads. My questions is how to determine the optimal number of threads on particular a laptop?
The number of threads you can run concurrently depends on your machine and the number of cores the cpu has. Most machines can run 2 threads per core. An easy way to figure out what works for your machine is in the  module in Python: This function will show the maximum number of threads you can run concurrently. Hope this helps!
