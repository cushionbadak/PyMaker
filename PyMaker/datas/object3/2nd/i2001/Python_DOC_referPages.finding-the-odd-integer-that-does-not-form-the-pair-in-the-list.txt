I am given a problem to solve ! which isA non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given. The array contains an odd number of elements, and each element of the array can be paired with another element that has the same value, except for one element that is left unpaired.Write a function:that, given an array A consisting of N integers fulfilling the above conditions, returns the value of the unpaired element.the function should return 7, as explained in the example above.Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:I think I am only half way to solve the problem:but this looks like printing the wrong result..
I would go with  (moved to  in Python 3.x) in combination with :It's an, as clean as it gets,  solution.
Since there is no condition that all but one elements occur twice, I guess it could also mean 4, 6, ... , times. In this case, I would rather use  to see which integer has an odd count.
You could use "or" bitwise operator. Since all elements occur twice except one element they would cancel each other leaving the element that has occurred only once.Time complexity O(n) Space Complexity O(1).Hope this helps.
You could use "xor" bitwise operator. Since all elements occur twice except one element they would cancel each other leaving the element that has occurred only once.Or We can sum the bits in the same positions for all the numbers and take modulo with 3. The bits for which sum is not multiple of 3, are the bits of number with a single occurrence.Let us consider the example array {5, 5, 5, 8}. The 101, 101, 101, 1000Sum of first bits%3 = (1 + 1 + 1 + 0)%3 = 0Sum of second bits%3 = (0 + 0 + 0 + 0)%0 = 0Sum of third bits%3 = (1 + 1 + 1 + 0)%3 = 0Sum of fourth bits%3 = (1)%3 = 1Hence number which appears once is 1000Code:
