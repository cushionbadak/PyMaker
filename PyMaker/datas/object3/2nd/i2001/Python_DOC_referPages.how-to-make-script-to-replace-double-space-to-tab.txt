Natural Text
i need help to make a script contain two process by python:find each text in new folder and replace all double space to 1 tab and do it again to replace every double tab to 1 tab.
The  package is probably a bit more concise that what you're using. Then just open up the files, read the text in, replace what you want to replace and write it back to the same file.Be careful when editing files in place -- if you use this in the wrong place you could cause some serious damage.
