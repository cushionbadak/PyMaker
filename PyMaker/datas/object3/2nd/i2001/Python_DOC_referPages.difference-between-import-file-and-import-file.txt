Quick question, what is the difference betweenCan someone explain the difference between them? Can someone explain all kinds of importing to me?
It's the new syntax for explicit relative imports. It means import from the current package. This is the current namespace or package directory.You can use more than one dot, referring not to the current package but its parent(s). This should only be used within packages, in the main module.
There are two ways to use functions of other modules.First is importing the whole Module.Second Method is by importing the function not moduleNote some more suggestions1. you can also import module and function by using as and import it under n alias name,Example import math as ilovemaths  #importing under alias nameprint(ilovemaths.sqrt(4))    #using the function of module.You can also * to import functions but then the problem will be of conflicting names. So be specific and choose the best method to import.
