I have an API that has unit tests written inside of it. The thing is that that API can't be run as 'stand-alone' script from terminal, it has to be run from a custom framework. In that API there is a function that basicly calls  but test cases are not found if the function is ran from 'outside'. Is there a common solution for this kind of problem?
You can tell  to load the tests from a different module by passing the name of that module in as the first (or ) argument.For example, to use the current module name, use:You may want to study the code that implements this functionality;  is an alias for the  class, which uses the standard  API to discover, load and run tests. If you need more control it can be useful to just use the API directly.
