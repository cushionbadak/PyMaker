I was coding in python to find the number of times a single sub string comes in a given stringI used the predefined method of Python3 ie .count()1The thing is here when I am trying to count the number of time 'B' or 'A' or'NA' occurs it gives me the perfect result but when I am counting number of 'ANA' present it should give me 2 but gives the output as 1
 counts non-overlapping occurences. The first "ANA" shares the "A" with the second "ANA", so the output is 1 instead of 2.If you want to count overlapping occurences, see the answers to this question.
The  function counts the non-overlapping substrings. That's why you get only  as a result.This is the documentation of this function:  Return the number of non-overlapping  occurrences of substring sub in the range . Optional  arguments  and  are interpreted as in slice notation.See string.count(sub[, start[, end]])
