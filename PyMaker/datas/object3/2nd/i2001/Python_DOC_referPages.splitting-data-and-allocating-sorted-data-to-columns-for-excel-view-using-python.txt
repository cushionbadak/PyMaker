Natural Text
Hi I have a set of data as shown below(dummy data to replace school data) in a text fileI would like to tidy up the data as shown to the desired outcome below in a format ofBasically I would like to add a header from start, then allowing the data to fit into 4 columns (Timestamp, ststem, Di and message). Some of the issue that might be a problem is that on line 4 of the source data, it duplicates an additional timestamp within the system thus leading to the need of clearing it. Di field will mainly take in "D(A), D(B), D1 and D2The rest of the string will be under the field Message.  Then the finalised output will be to a excel file for data analysis. The code as shown below is what i had tried(weak in python)Due to lack of knowledge in python the code is not fully developed and i will greatly appreciate any guidance or example!Some question to ponder, do i use pandas/ dataframe? or can i just do it without pd?EDITTED: the 1st line of data updated to "D(B)1234", it shouldnt have any space between the numbers and D(B)
The code to cleanup this mess data uses partly regex, partly string interpolation. The writing of cleaned up csv uses the module csv due to need of masking inner  in text (f.e. in line wiht  ):Create demo file:Parse and write it:Read and output the written file:File-Content (masked csv) else  would corrupt your format:
