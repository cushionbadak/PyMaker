I would like to create an Alexa skill using Python to use data uploaded by sensors to Thingspeak. The cases where I only use one specific value is quite easy, the response from Thingspeak is the value only. When I want to use several values, in my case to sum up the athmospheric pressure to determine tendencies, teh response is a json object like this:I now started with The json object is a bit recursive, it is a list containing a list with an element with an array as the value.Now I am not quite sure how to iterate over the values of the key "field2" in the array. I am quite new to Python and also json. Perhaps anyone can help me out?Thanks in advance!
This has nothing to do with json - once the json string parsed by , what you get is a plain python object (usually a dict, sometimes a list, rarely - but this would be legal - a string, int, float, boolean or ).it is a list containing a list with an element with an array as the value.Actually it's a  with two keys  and . The first one has another dict for value, and the second a  of s. How to use dicts and lists is extensively documented FWIWhttps://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionarieshttps://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dicthttps://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#listshttps://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-rangeHere the values you're looking for are stored under the "field2" keys of the dicts in the "feeds" key, so what you want is:
You have a dictionary. Use key to access the valueEx:Output:
I just figured it out, it was just like expected.You have to get the  array from the dict and than iterate over the list of items and print the value to the key .
