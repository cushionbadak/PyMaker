I've created a program that generates a list of numbers of users choice, between 1 and 500. The program then writes the list to a file, reads the file, and lists all the numbers. I need to sum the numbers and show the count. Here is my code...Any help is greatly appreciated.
You can add this to your code.At first, sum is 0. The program reads each value and adds the value to sum.
If you want pythonic cryptic code, you can do this in 2 * 2 lines (+1 line of import):The first one uses the inputted value, makes it an int, uses it as "how many" parameter to random.choices() which returns as much random numbers from the given range (1,501) which are then fed into map() to make them strings so join() can make a big string of them wich is then written into the file.This reads the whole file as list of lines, strips the newlines, converts them into ints and sums them. (see Doku built-in functions for int, map, sum )Outputting the generated stuff:Sum:Outputfile:
