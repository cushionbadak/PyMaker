Each client thread has to store its own information which is used to relay information back to its respective the client. Obvious details for server creation are omitted:One suggestion I read is to create a python file and add all variables there and import it to the server, but with all other threads editing the values at the same time, things will get whacky.

Since data cannot be exchanged between a method from one class and a method from another, what is the best way to go about doing this?  
You can give your threads names using the  parameter:
