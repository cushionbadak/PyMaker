I am very new to python development and having trouble while understanding one method used in one sample, the method is:and it is being called from:Now the 2 questions are:How dict_factory(cursor, col) is being called from dict_factory without params?How dict_factory() is actually working? Does enumerate breaks the DB into the format of (c0,r0),(c0,r1) and so on?The converted DB by dict_factory is:
In the code you showed,  is not being called.  simply assigns that function to the attribute . That means you just told your database connection in which way to treat rows (as dictionaries). augments the "normal" iteration by the index of the element (it returns tuples ). If you did  then  simply holds the name of each column. Doing  instead provides tuples where the first element is the iteration index (starting at 0), i.e. . Now the function  converts a  to a . It does so by iterating over the various columns and adding key-value pairs  to the dictionary.
