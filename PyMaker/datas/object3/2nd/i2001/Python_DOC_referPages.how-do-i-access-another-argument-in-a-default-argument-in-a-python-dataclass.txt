I am trying to derive the default value of  from  and vice versa.I should be able to call the class like so:If possible, I would also like the class to raise an error when both  and  are provided.Any recommendations on how I should go about doing this?
You can use write a  method to do these validations
You'll need to use the  function of your .For example,Here, though, the user has to pass a value for both.  You can simply supply  or  or some falsy value so that it is passed over and the ValueError isn't thrown.
Would something as simple as the below work for you?At object instantiation, check if too much or too little data was provided, then define a property that will compute the value if necessary?Note that you must also take into consideration what a valid value is. In my provided example case, it is not sufficient if you consider integer  a valid , and an empty string  a valid .
