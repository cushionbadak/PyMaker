I have loads of html files that I want to merge to one single file.File path is /Desktop/Username/My_files/. This folder contains 1300 different folders, and all of these folders has message.html file.Instead of copying them one by one I want to solve this using Python.My code works if the message.html is in the folder, but is unable to read the contents of the underlying folder structure. The bolded part of the code needs changing, but how can it be corrected most easily?
If all your files are just one folder level deep, you have simply misplaced your placeholder. Use a placeholder for the unknown folder, not the file name:Note that if the filename is not constant either,  also takes several placeholders:Things are trickier if not only direct subfolders are needed. Since Python3.5,  supports a recursive placeholder:If recursive is true, the pattern "" will match any files and zero or more directories and subdirectories.In your case, this would look like this:On an older Python version, you should walk the directories yourself. The  function allows you to recursively inspect all files in subdirectories.The following provides the full path to each file with a fixed name from a base directory:You can use it in place of your glob result:
