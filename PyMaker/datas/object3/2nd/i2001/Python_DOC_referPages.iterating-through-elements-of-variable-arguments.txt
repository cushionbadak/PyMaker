I have a function  that takes a variable number scalar numbers. It preforms some math with them and outputs a scalar. As a trivial example, we'll assume  multiplies each number:I would like to have  work with lists. To do so, I made another function . It takes in a variable number of lists and makes a new one like so:Obviously, this function is just pseudocode. How can I implement ?
You can use  here:If you have large lists, you may wish to create an iterator and use  to reduce memory consumption:This may also be rewritten for greater efficiency:Alternatively, you can  for the functional equivalent:
