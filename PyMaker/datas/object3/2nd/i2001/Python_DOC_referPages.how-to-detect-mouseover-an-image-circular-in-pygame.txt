I need to zoom an image if the image detects mouseover, but I don't know the way.I think it's hard to detect it using  and the image's  because the image is a circle not a rectangle. It might detect the mouseover  though the mouse is in the corner of the image, not touching it.
You can use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the distance between the mouse and the circle center or just . If the distance is less than the radius, the mouse and the circle collide.Also, create a rect for the image which serves as the blit position and makes it easy to obtain the center point.You could also use masks for pixel-perfect collision detection or  if you're dealing with sprites.
