I have to write a Python program that creates empty dictionary of alphabetic letters. The dictionary must be populated such that when a user enters any letter, it will be appended to the dictionary as a key (capital case) and value (small case). All letters of the dictionary must be unique, which means no duplicates are allowed in the dictionary.For example:So, here's my code:But the problem is, that the program adds to dictionary not letters, but functions lower() and upper(), as I saw on pythontutor.com What can I do with it?
Try:      letter_dictionary[i.upper()] = i.lower()
As mentioned,  and  are method objects, you need to follow them with parentheses to actually apply the methods:But a regular  loop isn't required here. Even the  check isn't strictly necessary, since dictionary keys are always unique. If you want to apply a uniqueness check, just use  on your input first.So you can rewrite using a dictionary comprehension:
