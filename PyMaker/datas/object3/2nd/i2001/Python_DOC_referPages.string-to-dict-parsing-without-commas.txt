There is a weird string representation like"key1:value1:key2:value2:key3:value3...keyn:valuen"I need to create a dict and it's pretty easy to solve when you have commas, however there is only colons here and you have to split the string every second colon. Code with cycle or soemthing like that looks pretty ugly, so I wonder if you could help me with oneliner. 
You can just split on colons,  get an iterator over the tokens and  the iterator with itself. That will pair keys and values nicely:
If you are uncomfortable with iter (and schwobaseggls solutions wich I deem superior), you can use zipped list-slices in almost the same way:Output:Alternativly, you create the dict by hand:Output:
