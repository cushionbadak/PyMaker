 is a mostly-obsolete optimization of , intended solely for uses where it is immediately followed by an . It was designed back when  didn't use copy-on-write, and has been rendered almost entirely pointless by copy-on-write.Your use of  is undefined behavior; modifying variables like  or  in the child is not allowed. Almost the only thing the child is allowed to do is call one of the  functions. The details are in the man page.If your goal is to share memory between Python processes, you should do that with the  module and .If your goal is to call , go ahead and call it with , and watch your program immediately fall apart because it's impossible to call  safely from Python:
