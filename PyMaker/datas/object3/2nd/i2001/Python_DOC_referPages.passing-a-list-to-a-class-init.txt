I am trying to understand class structure.The example is a pizza order with  and .I can pass size easy enough but it wont let me passing toppings as a listI keep getting No matter how I try to evoke the  print function it just won't play nice.
There's a lot of small weird things going on with your code.First of all, fix  method (as pointed in comments), re-create your instance and it will work — this is for fixing your main issue.Minor things, but highly recommended:using [empty] list as default argument is not a good idea, until you know what you're doing. List is mutable and arguments is "bound" to function object. So changing that default value once will affect all subsequent calls.thing you're trying to achieve with  looks like mistake while implementing please, think twice (or more) when you're using . Probably it looks like a good idea, if you're experienced with languages like Java, but in python its generally a bad idea to "hide" attributes this way. This still will be available for users, while making your class hard to inherit — and non-collaborative classes isn't fun to work with. If you want to identify non-public interface — consider using single underscore (). If you not sure if this should be public — make it public. You can always make it  without breaking interface. Same applies to  methods — there's no point to have code like this, if you're retrieving attribute without having attributes. Just having  attribute and using it is fine. If you're 100% sure you don't want to make this editable after instantiation, make it
