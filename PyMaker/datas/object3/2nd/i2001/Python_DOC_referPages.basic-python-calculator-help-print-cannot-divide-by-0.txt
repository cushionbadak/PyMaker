I'm asked to code a calculator in python and here is what I have that works:Now, I just want to add a qualifier that if the user inputs a 0 as "number_2", the program prints "Error! Cannot divide by 0!!!"
Change your code from :To:
One option would be to just check if  contains zero before performing the calculation:An alternative would be to catch the  that is thrown whenever you try to divide by :
nest a  in your  judgement code segment.
We can't divide by 0.But solve this using exception handling Python exception handling see here why can't divide by zero
