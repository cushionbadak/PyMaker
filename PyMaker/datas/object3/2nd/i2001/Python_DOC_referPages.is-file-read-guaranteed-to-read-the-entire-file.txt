Natural Text
The docs for  say: Does this mean that  isn't guaranteed to always return the entire contents of a text file, even though it most likely will?If so, what would be the correct way to read an entire text file?
For "files" that are not regular files, if you have specifically turned on the mode where  doesn't try to read everything, then  might not read everything.The docs specify non-blocking mode. Non-blocking mode is a mode that can be set on a file descriptor in Unix, that only has an effect for "files" that represent sockets, pipes, or other communication devices. In non-blocking mode, if you try to read more data than is currently available, the file will give you what it has instead of waiting until enough data arrives.
Non blocking mode isn't something you'd typically use if you want the entire file, since the point of nonblocking is to get whatever data is available on the I/O you're waiting for, typically some async stream that may or may not have anything in it. If it's a plain text file, you'd do something like this:
