I am trying to create an object which can serialize and deserialize itself with a class method, without using the return statement (I do not want a static method). This is a concept of my class and a naive use case:However, once I leave the deserialization method,  (in this case, the instance ) does not keep its value.Output when run:Why is this happening? I have also tried with  just after the  in the function  but nothing seems to work, and I would like to understand why.Thanks in advance
The reason this doesn't work is that because you can't assign to self (or rather: doing that doesn't do what you think it does). If you're interested to find out what actually happens, try assigning something weird to , e.g.  (the behaviour will be unchanged).Make  a classmethod and use it as a "constructor":Then use it like this:Output:Serialized with value of: 2  Deserialized value inside deserialize function: 2  Deserialized value outside: 2
