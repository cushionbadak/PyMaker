I am using a Python library () that requires some function handlers. All these handlers functions are almost the same. The only difference is a "constant" (as in, logic is the same; only the constant used to reference some data structures is different).I would like to have a single generic function for all the handlers such that I can minimise my code or not having to add new functions when I add new types. Moreover, this enables me to have my types declared in a configuration file.In Javascript this would be possible like this:How do I do the same in Python?
You can do exactly the same thing in Python; you can create a nested function that'll have access to  as a closure:There are more ways you can bind a parameter to a callable; you could use a  to proxy the function call:or you could use a  object to bind arguments to a callable:
