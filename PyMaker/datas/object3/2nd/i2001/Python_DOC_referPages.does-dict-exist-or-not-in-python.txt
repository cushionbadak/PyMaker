The first code snippet:It prints  and the function  isn't invoked, which means the attribute exists.The second snippet:It prints  and , which means the attribute  doesn't exist.Why is   in the first case, but  in the second case?
the issue is that when you define this:you're overriding  which is supposed to return something. Since you're not returning anything, you get  for every attribute you'll try.Documentation states:This method should return the (computed) attribute value or raise an AttributeError exceptionA viable way to define it is to call  in the fallback case (in my example, I have added a small test on  which prints:In the end, the hard attribute lookup work is done with  that invokes python runtime.
