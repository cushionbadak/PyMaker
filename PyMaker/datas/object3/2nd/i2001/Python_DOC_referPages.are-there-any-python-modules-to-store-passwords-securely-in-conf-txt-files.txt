I am trying to read and write username and password in a secured manner. With my current implementation I am following AES-CBC encryption/decryption but storing the encrypted username the with random key in a config file is a security issue. I found an option that keystore is a better way of storing passwords. I have checked similar question but the information is not clear to me. Another option that I found is the keyring, it is working fine in windows but on Linux , I am getting following error. I have checked for the possible solutions but couldn't find one.Can someone suggest me any better solution or modules from python to store passwords securely? 
My implementation whas this:I made a random string and store it to a txt file then encrypt its bytes file under a key! I use two function that i have made which the  takes a file encrypt their bytes and returns an encrypted file and  does the opposite . The parameters are key : your secret keyfilein : the file that you want to encryptfileout : the output fileIV : the initialization Vector
