Json is not only useful as a communication tool for APIs, but also may be used as a markup for configuring running programs as initialization. I encountered the use of references in json schema for the purpose of reuse. Since json schema is valid json, I had expected the python json library to have the ability to expand references.What is the simplest way to expand the references in python, since python dicts cannot point to other parts of themselves (I think)? 
The json library does not support references, but jsonref does. is a library for automatic dereferencing of JSON Reference objects for Python (supporting Python 2.6+ and Python 3.3+).From the docs:
thanks to @FreshD , who led me towards YAML which can be loaded and dumped just like JSON. This is how I solved my use case, which was exact substitution to start with, but now also supports inheritance.
I never used/saw these references in json, but I know and used the in YAML also for configuration. This is a nice description how to achieve this.
