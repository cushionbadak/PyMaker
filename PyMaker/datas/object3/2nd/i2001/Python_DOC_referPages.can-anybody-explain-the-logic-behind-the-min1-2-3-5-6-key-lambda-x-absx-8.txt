This is my list: .I want to get the number that is closest to , this is the solution:Please explain what is happening in the above line.
 is absolute mathematics function which is equivalent to .example :  when  is , and when  is also .It can be written as which means for will giveHere the value returned by this lambda function is stored in  variable.ThusLastly The  function uses  as an iterable to calculate minimum value.Using the position of minimum value obtained from key it displays the value from iterable a.Thus forminimum value is 1 at position 2 and it displays value at 2 position from iterable awhich is 4.
The code is using the  builtin function, but with a  parameter. Thus, it does not return the actual minimum element of the list, but the element for which that key function is minimal, i.e. it behaves more like "arg-min" than actually "min".In the  function (defined as a  expression),  is just the absolute difference, in this case between the parameter  (a number from the list) and .That line is somewhat equivalent to, but much shorter and more readable than, this loop:
Explanation returns the smallest item in the  with respect to the . So it iterates over the , each time evaluates the  for an element , and then returns the element for which  was the smallest.Since , we thus evaluate the absolute difference between , so if , then  is , etc. So this will result in the number that is the closest to .Making this an O(log n) algorithmGiven the list is ordered, you can find this in logarithmic time with:For example:
try thisgives 4the function  will give you index of the upper limit (7)
