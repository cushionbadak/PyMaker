I would like to sort a list which includes a set such as;100.avi10000.avi10002.avi1003.avi ....I need to do some process using the files in numeric order. If I use  it does not care about the values, it sorts on the first character, second character, and so on - string sorting. I tried to use [:-4] but I tried to do this on the list not the element of the list. Because it is late when I have the element. Is there any way?Thanks in advance
You can use a custom sorting function to extract the number from each element of the list and use it as the comparison key. You'd need to convert it to  to ensure it compares like number:
Since all the strings of your given list are ended in  extension, you could use a slicing feature.
