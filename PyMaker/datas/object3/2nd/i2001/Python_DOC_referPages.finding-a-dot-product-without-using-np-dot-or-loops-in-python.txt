I need to write a function which:takes two NumPy arrays as argumentsreturns one number: the floating-point dot product of the two input vectorsnumpy arrays and the np.sum function are allowed, no np.dot and no loopsIn my intro class I've learned plenty about using loops when I can't use a simple function like np.dot, but this one has me confused for some reason. Any suggestions?
Ciao,a possible solution makes use of recursion
Probably considered cheating, but Python 3.5 added a matrix multiply operator that  uses to compute the dot product without actually calling :Problem solved!
