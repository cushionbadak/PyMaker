So using the following piece of code I can easily find the most recently updated file in a folder:But what if there are two or more files that have the exact same updated time? How do I get a list of such files?
The shortest code: find the latest ctime, then get all files having this latest ctime:We loop twice over the list of paths, though, and there is a risk of race condition if the ctime of the most recent file changes between the two loops: in this case, it wouldn't be found again in the second loop.We can do it in one loop, with a little bit more code, eliminating the race condition:As we can expect, this is about twice as fast (about 100 paths in the folder for the test):
Probably not the tidiest way of doing it but:
For Python 3, look like the max method can't fix your issue , as the Python 3 docs explicitly state:If multiple items are maximal, the function returns the first one encountered. This is consistent with other sort-stability preserving tools such as sorted(iterable, key=keyfunc, reverse=True)[0] and heapq.nlargest(1, iterable, key=keyfunc).You may need to use sorted command to find the multi max value
