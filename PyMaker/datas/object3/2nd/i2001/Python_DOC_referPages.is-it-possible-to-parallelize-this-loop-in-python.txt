I've been working on a program to obtain a rainbow table, using a crc32 hash.The main loop of the program is the following:So, the code does its works as I intend it to, and when it exits the loop it stores the generated rainbow table (variable rt) into memory. Well, with the current number of iterations shown in the above code, it would take several days to complete its execution, and I need to create this table, as well as others with different iterations through the loops, in order to do some tests on them.I thought that I'd be a good idea to attempt to parallelize it, but after going through the documentation on multiprocessing and lurking through some posts about it, I'm still unable to parallelize it in a correct way.Thanks in advance!
Try this:Be aware that the final break condition  may work inexactly because of the arbitrary order of the calculation tasks.
