I have these files from a capture the flag event, DEFCON 22: and many more. There will be no changes in team names but each team has multiple files that range from 00001 to 00125 and that is shown after the team name. Then the file also shows the date (Y/M/D) as 20140808. The thing that changes is the day, not year or month.I am looking for a way to dynamically open each file to read its information. I also have these teams in one directory. I want to use a wild card to get the team and the day. This is the code I have done in bash:I need to translate this to python and if possible using a dictionary. Here is what I have so far.Here is the output:
Have you tried glob?Supports filename with wildcard characters.
