I'm new to python and found some object lists while using djnago queries like I want to know how to do the same design with other objects "my own classes", is this related to operators overloading like c++ and if so , how to do this?
You can do it by implementing the special  method (and possibly also ), as described here.If the left operand has  defined, its  method is invoked. If it doesn't, or  threw , then the right operand's  is invoked.Other operators are implemented similarly, using the various special functions.
