How to get last 'n' groups after  and combine them as a dataframe. After doing  i am getting total number of groups 277. I want to combine last 12 groups and generate a dataframe.
Pandas  objects are iterables. To extract the last n elements of an iterable, there's generally no need to create a list from the iterable and slice the last n elements. This will be memory-expensive.Instead, you can use either  (as suggested by @mtraceur) or . Both work in O(n) time.Unlike a generator, a Pandas  object is an iterable which can be reused. Therefore, you can calculate the number of groups via  for a  object  and then slice  via . Or, perhaps  more idiomatic, you can use . Then use  to concatenate an iterable of dataframes:Alternatively, you can use  and specify , then concatenate as before.As described in the  docs:Once a bounded length  is full, when new items are added, a  corresponding number of items are discarded from the opposite end....  They are also useful for tracking transactions and other pools of data  where only the most recent activity is of interest.
Assuming you know the order of 
use  on lists comprehension and 
You could pass a list comprehension to :Yields:
