I have dictionary that contains point name and coordinates:I need to found distance between points of dictionary. I've already had function for process distance, but I need to iterate by dict in format:My problem that I can't correct iterate by source dict without duplicates.
The  method sounds like what you need. Given an input iterable over some elements (like, say, the keys of your dictionary), it iterates over all possible tuples of those elements without repeating any.
As @David said, you can create your dictionary like that, so I just cover the calculate distance part.the  will be your desired output.
