I am learning about strings and bytestrings in python. I don't understand why certain hexadecimal escape sequences are displayed in \XNN form and some are not?In this case, when I type s1 into the console, it prints the exact string of characters within the quotes,'A\x00B\tC', but when I type s into the console, it prints 'A1B\tC'. It is only when I print s1 that the screen shows 'AB       C'. I don't understand why certain escape characters are shown and others are not? And why does it then show when you print them?Cheers
http://www.asciitable.com/If you look at the ASCII table, you would see that some characters are printable, while others are not. In particular,  ==  (Hexadecimal 31 == Decimal 49 == ASCII Character . On the other hand  is not printable. It represents the null terminator (or )A more interesting question is: Why does  get converted to ,  gets converted to a , while  is not converted to . That I don't know.
When you type name into the interpreter, it is using the result of calling  on that name. Since  can be represented as , it uses that. Since  cannot be represented as a printable character, it falls back to using the hex escape notation.Note that:So the result of  is valid.
