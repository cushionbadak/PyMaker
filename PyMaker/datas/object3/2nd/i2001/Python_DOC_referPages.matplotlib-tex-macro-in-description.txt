I'm using  to generate  files.Based on those, I use standalone  files which only include necessary settings and the afore-built s.In this scenario, I'm getting errors when using custom tex-macros for descriptions in my plot files.Here an example  generator:that can be used in a dir with the following  file:Running this results in the following error:Please note, that this is an error generated by  and not of compiling my standalone files.Also note, that the error goes away when the  macro is provided as part of the (the line commented out) instead.I checked the  produced by this variant and indeed it uses .I'm having trouble narrowing the problem further down.Here my concrete questions:Why does  invoke  at all?I'm generating  output and thus  should not be necessary.(For the reference: I d the script above and indeed know that  is being called.)Is there a way of preserving the temporary file that  tries to compile?The error references  by (of course) that file doesn't exist afterwards.Why can't I use a macro in a label which is provided in another tex file?
tl;dr Including -files in the  of  requires absolute paths.For the future, I recommend the following  "replacement script" for purposes of debugging:Make sure to save it as , make sure it's executable, make sure  is your actual  and ensure this wrapper is found first in yout  (cf. ).When running the  generator, we preserve the final  input in the .That answers (2).Considering the output, we see:I don't know what that should be useful for. But I'm guessing  is trying to adjust the font-setup for which it tries compiling this "test" document.That (sort of) answers (1).Now the conclusion (obvious in hindsight): compiles this sample document in a temporary directory.Clearly there is no  available in this directory, so the  fails.From that point onwards it is obvious that  will not be available.Though not the cleanest solution, this can be fixed by including  via an absolute path.Working python generator to finally answer (3):(I use  and . For  we would rather fall back to os.getcwd.)
