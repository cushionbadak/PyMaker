I am trying to grab and parse multiple URLs using urllib and BeautifulSoup, but I get the following error:AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'timeout'From what I understand, the parser is telling me that I submitted a list and it is looking for a single URL. How can I process multiple URLs?Here is my code:
Your error clearly said It's because urlopen doesn't take in a list. you should nest it in a loop like this:I would suggest you to use a better module for http than , use  instead ()
