The Django debugger is .Sometimes we push the code on the server without remove  from the code.In this conditions when we request the view (that views contain ) then the page will not load and the browser will hang because of that debugger.So my Question is.Can I set a  timeORHow can I avoid  after a few minutesIt's the exception case because we always check in the code but sometimes we missed it by mistake.How can I achieve this task?Thanks in advance 
If you are using python 3.7+, you can use the builtin function . The specific effect of this function can be modified by setting the environment variable PYTHONBREAKPOINTThe default behaviour of  is to use , but you can use a third party debugger instead.If you set , the debugger() function will not do anything (immediately return)If you are not using python 3.7, you can check out this question about disabling how to disable pdb.set_trace() without stopping python program and edit the code
