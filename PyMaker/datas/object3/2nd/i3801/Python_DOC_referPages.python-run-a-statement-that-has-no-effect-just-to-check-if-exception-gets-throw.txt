I want something to happen if user input is not valid (look at the exception block):Notice how I run  even though it doesn't do anything. I do this in case the user input is not in the dictionary, it will tell the user that it is invalid input. PyCharm highlights it and tells me that . I'm just wondering if this is good practice or not.Edit: Note that I also want to print "Error: Invalid input" if the user gives invalid input for fact too. My example covers this.
I think this is more elegant and pythonic:This way we catch both possible exceptions for invalid input, and break early if It also makes your code more readable and prevents PyCharm from complaining.I disagree with some of the other commenters who suggest checking for the keys in the dictionaries and so on, you are right to use exceptions for flow control, EAFP is the Python way.
Checking for the key in table_dictionary could be a better practiceFor better readability, you can move .title() directly to the input
It can be OK to run some code just to see if it raises an exception, but often there's a better way to test if something is possible or not. In your specific case, I'd suggest testing if the key is in the dictionary using the  operator, with an ,  and  to resolve the consequences:
I would suggest doing something like this. Nothing is useless now.
