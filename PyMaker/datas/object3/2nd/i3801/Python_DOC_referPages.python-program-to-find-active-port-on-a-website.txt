My college has some ports. Something like this http://www.college.in:913I want a program to find the active ones. I mean I want those port number in which the website is working.Here is a code. But it takes a lot of time.
It might be faster to try open a socket connection to each port in the range and then only try to make a request if the socket is actually open.  But it's often slow to iterate through a bunch of ports.  if it takes 0.5 seconds for each, and you're scanning 10000 ports that's a lot of time waiting. from https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sockets.html You might also consider profiling the code and finding out where the slow parts are.
You can use python-nmap, which is similar to nmap.
