i have multiple threads doing the same job : to calculate a distance and put it in a list than each thread needs to compare it to the other threads and do a certain task.how do i make a thread wait for the others to finish the task ( and having others task to follow up joins won't work in this case) 
There's a name for what you want, it's called a .  I don't know enough about the Python ecosystem to know whether there's a ready-made one that you can just use, but here's what it is:It's an object that contains a count (initially greater than zero), and a condition variable.  It has a method, .The  method decrements the count, and then;It signals the condition variable and returns if the count became zero, orIt waits on the condition variable until the count equals zero, and then it returns.If you initialize a Barrier with count = N, and then N threads  it, none of the threads will "get past the barrier" (i.e., return from ) until all of the threads have "arrived at the barrier" (i.e., called ). often is implemented as , which is the same thing with the additional feature that it automatically resets the count to its original value when the barrier opens.Update:  There is a  class in the standard library for Python3 (v. 3.2 and later).https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#barrier-objects
