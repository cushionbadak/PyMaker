Natural Text
I'm trying to figure out why the .replace function in python isn't functioning correctly. I have spent the entire day yesterday searching for an answer but alas have not found one.I'm trying to open and read a file, copy it into a list, count the number of lines in the list and remove all the punctuation (ie , . ! ? etc). I can do everything except remove the punctuation (and I must use the .replace function instead of importing a module).The "Small text file" is:Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.Vivamus condimentum sagittis lacus? laoreet luctus ligula laoreet ut.Vestibulum ullamcorper accumsan velit vel vehicula?Proin tempor lacus arcu. Nunc at elit condimentum, semper nisi et, condimentum mi.In venenatis blandit nibh at sollicitudin. Vestibulum dapibus mauris at orci maximus pellentesque.Nullam id elementum ipsum. SuspendisseRunning the code returns the following:The Statistics are:Number of lines: 6Nullam id elementum ipsum SuspendisseSo the code DOES remove the comma and period characters but it also removes the preceding 5 lines of the text and only prints the very last line. What am I doing wrong here?
It should beWithout enumerate,
Use :Note:  returns replaced string which you need to store in the right index of list.  helps you keep track of index while iterating through the list.
