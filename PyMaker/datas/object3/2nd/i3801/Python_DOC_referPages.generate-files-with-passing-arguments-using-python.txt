I would like to generate files using python is such way.For example, I have  file. Inside it, there are 2 parameters which are actually a different path of a network, in the example below, there are 2 folders  in different path :I would like to generate or create files using python with the same content and changing only these two parameters with the corresponding number (from 1 to 20), for example, 20 of  with incrementing the number one by one. .
Read the file:Iterate through the numbers 2-20; use string formatting to construct new strings and replace  with ; write to a new file.For python versions 2.7-3.5 replace with  with f-stringsString formatting
