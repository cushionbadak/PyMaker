I have a  subclass like this:This class can be used with  and  without issues:But if I instantiate a function object with the  constructor, the function can't access any builtins:Replacing  with  or  or event  makes the code print  as expected.I don't understand where this exception is coming from. Can anyone explain this behavior? Why does it work with  but not with a function object?
Not a complete answer, but what seems to be happening is that CPython ignores the custom  when it accesses the builtins. It seems to treat  like a normal (not subclassed) dict. If the  key is actually present in the dict, then everything works correctly:The question remains why this only happens with , and not with  and .
