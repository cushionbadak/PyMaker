This question already has an answer here:Accessing the index in 'for' loops?                    23 answers                I am writing a code where program read data from file and then it readlines and if a specific word exist in list it allows the user to modify its quantity. Well the issue is how can i get the iteration number (line number) in for loop while it is searching for word in lineMy Code:for example if the word banana found on line number 3. How to edit this program to show the iteration number or index of the for loop

You can try replacing it with a while loop: is equal to the iteration and  is equal to the current line.
