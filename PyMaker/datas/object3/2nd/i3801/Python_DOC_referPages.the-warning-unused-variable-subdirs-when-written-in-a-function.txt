For a reason that I cannot resolve, my "subdirs" variable in my first for loop becomes an "unused variable" when it is written inside a function, which results in a incomplete search of my directory to achieve the goal of the function. But when it is not part of a function, it's recognized as a variable and my code is able to successfully search the entire directory and performed the desired tasks. I'm relatively new to python, please let me know how I can fix my function so "subdirs" will be recognized as a variable. Thanks a lot!

You never reference subdirs in your first code, so that's why you're getting the warning. However, that is not the reason your code doesn't work as you intended.This line is the issue:  will list all the directories in that path [1], not including the subdirectories within each directory. The variable 'subdirs' already contains that information. But you don't need it. The variable 'files' already has what you want, so you can change the line to this:[1] https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.listdir
