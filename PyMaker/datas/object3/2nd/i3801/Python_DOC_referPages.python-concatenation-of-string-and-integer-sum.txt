Here is your output:In Python, in order to print integers, they must first be converted to strings. The .format method allows you to convert the integer argument (the sum of the two leafs) to strings. You enter a place holder where you want the string {}, and then in your .format method you can specify what that integer will be. In this case, rootLeaf + leftLeaf.
Using format should handle all types easily.And in general, look in this site for many more details: https://pyformat.info/
