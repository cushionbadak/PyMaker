I have several Python classes I use for calling C-code, using . The return struct looks something like the below example.The  array is fixed size to ease the call to C (using a variable size array here is not an option). The "actual" length of the array is controlled by the  variable. For instance if  is an array of three numbers, say ,  and , and .This is all fine. The problem is when i implement  and .I want to be able to write code like thisBut the iterator does not seem to "get" that the -array is only  long. I.e. it does not seem to use  to halt the iteration. Instead it seems to iterate over the full length of .I want I know I can code but that is not what I want.Does anybody know how to fix this?
With the old-school iterator types, the only way is to raise an :For a cleaner solution, consider using the more modern iteration protocol, i.e. returning an iterator instance from an  method defined on your iterable.  That's documented here.
