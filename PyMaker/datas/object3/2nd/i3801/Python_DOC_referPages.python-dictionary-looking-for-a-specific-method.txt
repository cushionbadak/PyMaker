Let's say I have a dictionary of strings as keys and values as integers.Where keys will be distinct strings encountered and how many times they are encountered.For example:  would produce: I want to say for the variables:Â This algorithm is slow because hashing happens twice by calling the  and  method, would be faster if when python performs the hashing to check if string exists in item either increase the value by 1 if a key exists there or create the key and put value as 1.In Java the corresponding method would be:Reduces code from an  statement to just one line and skips hashing again.Just wondering if such method exists in python 3.Thanks in advance!  
I did some timing analysis using different ways to fill the dictionary. First, the setup:Now, the functions, using your approach with , or just using , or  with default, as well as  and :They all produce the same result, although the last two use a subclass of :Using  is pretty wasteful here;  is fastest, even with the  check, whereas  and  are shorter, but also slower.Note, however, that in this example text, most words occur only once, which might skew the tests. Using , we get this, making  less slow, and  the fastest.Still, personally I'd use  as the difference in running time is probably not much of a problem, it's the shortest, the intention is immediately clear, and it also provides some useful helper methods, like getting most common entries and such.
