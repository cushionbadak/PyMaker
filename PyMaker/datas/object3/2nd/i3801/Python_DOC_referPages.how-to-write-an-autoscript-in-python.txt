I got temperature, pressure, and altitude readings on my  using a sensor:The problem is, to see the results, I have to execute the  every time by myself. I am trying to automate it somehow so it will keep running itself for the time I want. Once that is automated, would like to save the results and analyze the output after some time.Is there a way I can write code for both the tasks?Thank you.
There are two things required here. First a script i.e  to log the functional behavior like  readings along with error/response during the process. Another is the script executions logs i.e a success or failure during the scheduled time and other system logs.For first job, you have to do by your self but ensure to have a  module in place to log the process flow.For Second job, you can use OS provided scheduler  for  based os. For example to execute script every minutesFor more about scheduler jobs, you can refer here
The time module is your friend here. You can set up an infinite loop with  and use  at the end of the loop (after output).
I'd use additional controller script like this:
