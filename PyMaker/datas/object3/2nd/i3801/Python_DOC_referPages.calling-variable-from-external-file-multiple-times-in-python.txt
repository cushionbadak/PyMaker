I'm trying to call variable from external file. And for that I wrote this code,But when I run my code it only calls varible  once and prints the same result. See the output of code,How can I call variable  from file  with updated value, every time it goes into loop? Please help.
This is not how  works in python. Once imported,  in cached in  as ,  pair of module name and module object. When you try to import the same  again, you simply get the already cached value back. But  is writable and deleting  key will, cause  to check for module and load again.Though Olivier's answer is the right way to approach this, for your understanding of , you can try this:OutputWould recommend to read official Python docs on The import system and The module cache, for thorough understanding.
If you assign a random value to a variable, referencing that variable does not make the value change regardless of how the value was obtained.In the same way, when you imported your module, the module code was execute and a value was assigned to . Unless the module is reloaded with  or you call  again, there is no reason for  to change value.What you might want is to make  a function that returns a random value in the desired range.
