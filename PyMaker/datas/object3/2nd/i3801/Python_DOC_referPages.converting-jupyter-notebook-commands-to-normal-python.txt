This question already has an answer here:How to run an IPython magic from a script (or timing a Python script)                    5 answers                I am currently following the Holoviews tutorial. Everything in there is done in notebooks, and makes use of the '%' syntax. I've never used notebooks (and don't particularly want to either). How can I write these lines in a normal .py file? Here's an example:I've tried a few things, such as:These all throw errors. How does that % syntax actually work? How are there no commas in that list? I just want to set the width and height of my graph normally. Thanks!
Tl;dr: If your real interest is to use  outside the jupyter notebook environment (like the OP does), see the section Outside the notebook in the holoviews documentation. Briefly, the magic  corresponds to calling the method  on some  object .If you are reading this because you are curious about 's  % "magics", read on. The "%" commands that you can use in notebooks are the so-called ipython "magics". You'll find a list of the standard ones here. So they are not available in ordinary Python, but ipython understands the  syntax and translates it to calls to the particular library. So the simplest way to get access to them, and with the same  syntax to boot, is to run  instead of .You also ask how the % syntax works. A third-party package can "register" some of its functions as custom ipython magics by using a simple decorator:See more in the documentation on defining custom magics.Finally, you are of course more interested in going from the  magics to the corresponding Python code. It seems that the  magic that's been stumping you is a method of this class: . I don't use holoviews, but it seems that something like this might be equivalent to the magic in your question:Note that you may also need to select a graphics backend, e.g. with the  keyword option.
