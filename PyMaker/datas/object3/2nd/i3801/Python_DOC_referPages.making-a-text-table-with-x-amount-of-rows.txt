Natural Text
I'm looking to make a text-based table in python. Its based on a competition where the user can select the number of rounds. As the rounds pass a score is added to a person for that round. I tried to make a table with columns for the person's name and the round. The problem is creating the columns for each round. 
as @NinjaWarrior said you need to use formatswhich givesthe  format is described here outputs  outputs  pads s to the left to form a 10-length string: outputs  pads s to the right to form a 10-length string: outputs it's the same logic for numbers: outputs 2 outputs 02 outputs 002
