I have a list that consists of both words and digits. Lets say:From this list I would like to filter all the digits and keep the words. I have imported re and found the re code for it, namely:However, I am not sure how to implement this so that I get a list like below.
No need to regex, use  :returns :
use  and string method :
You can do this quite nicely with list comprehension:If, for whatever reason, you did want to use regex to do this (maybe you have more complex filtering criteria), you could do it using something like this:
Using  + :
Like other answers suggested, you don't really need Regexes, but they can be more flexible if your requirements change in the future. For example.: start of the string: character group: negates the character group: digits 0-9 (you could use  as well): zero or more times: end of the stringIf you want all elements that don't start with a number, use  where  is any character.
I don't know exact pattern of your list element but this code should work for given example
