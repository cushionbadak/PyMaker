So, 4! is .My output is only 16 and it wants me to output 24
A few things are wrong with your program.It overwrites the input by using  as your loop variable.The loop's  does not depend on the input.The multiplied value is always  instead of being incremented from  to  in your loop.Here is the correct way to implement the factorial:Or alternatively, use the  standard library.
This finds factorial of number inputted from command line:
I recommend use math lib: https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html (cf math.factorial(x))
You inquire  from sys.argv and then overwrite it within your loop. That's one problem.Next: range(a,b) will create integers from a to b-1 (assuming stepsize is 1). So  will create .Your code does the following:It changes N to 1*4, then to 2*4, then to 3*4 (which is 12, not 16).If you want to code a factorial the hard way, you need a seperated iterator (usually indicated as ) and multiply all the way up to  times.
