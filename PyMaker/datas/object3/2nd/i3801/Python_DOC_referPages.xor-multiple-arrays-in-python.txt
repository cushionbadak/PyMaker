I'd like to combine multiple arrays in a matrix to achieve an all 0 array For example:I have this matrix where array[0] is the index of each array:If I xor arrays 3 and 4 I got an all zeros arrays or I could xor arrays 0,1,2 and 4. I don't know if it exists any library in python to calculate these things o something like that. I've been looking for it days.Any ideas how to do it?I have tried numpy library and tried to do xor methodThe problem is that this method only compares pairs of arrays. I'm looking for any combinations of arrays which do the trick.
This finds all combinations of rows with  value resulting in a zero (). For finding all combinations of rows, use .
