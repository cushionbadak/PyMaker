I am having trouble simply saving items into a file for later reading. when I savethe file, instead of listing the items as single items, it appends the data together as one long string. According to my google searches, this should not be appending the items. What am I doing wrong?Thanks in advanceCode:
Since you do not show your data or your output I cannot be sure. But it seems you are trying to use the  method like the  function, but there are important differences.Most important,  does not follow its written characters with any separator (like space by default for ) or end (like  by default for ).Therefore there is no space between your data and steps number or between the lines because you did not write them and Python did not add them.So add those. Try the linesNote that I do not know the format of your "date" that is written, so you may need to convert that to text before writing it.Now that I have the time, I'll implement @abarnert's suggestion (in a comment) and show you how to get the advantages of the  function and still write to a file. Just use the  parameter in Python 3, or in Python 2 after executing the statementUsing  you can do my four lines above in one line, since  automatically adds the space separator and newline end:This does assume that your date datum  is to be printed as text.
Try adding a newline () character at the end of your lines as you see in docs. This should solve the problem of 'listing the items as single items', but the file you create may not be greatly structured nonetheless.For further of your google searches you may want to check serialization, as well as  and  formats, covered in python standard library. You question would have befited if you gave very small example of  variable + original  is not necessary as you have a  statement, see here at SO.
