What is the use of .digest() in this statement?  Why do we use it ? I searched on google ( and documentation also) but still I am not able to figure it out.What I found is that it convert to string. Am I right or wrong?
The  method returns the actual digest the hash is designed to produce.It is a separate method because the hashing API is designed to accept data in multiple pieces:The above code creates a hashing object without passing any initial data in, then uses the  method to put chunks of data in in a loop. This helps avoid having to all of the data into memory all at once, so you can hash anything between 1 byte and the entire Google index, if you ever had access to something that large.If  produced the digest directly you could never add additional data to hash first. Moreover, there is also an alternative method of accessing the digest, as a hexadecimal string using the  method (equivalent to , but more convenient).The code you found uses the fact that the constructor of the hash object also accepts data; since that's the all of the data that you wanted to hash you can call  immediately.The module documentation covers it this way:There is one constructor method named for each type of hash. All return a hash object with the same simple interface. For example: use  to create a SHA-256 hash object. You can now feed this object with bytes-like objects (normally bytes) using the  method. At any point you can ask it for the digest of the concatenation of the data fed to it so far using the  or  methods.(bold emphasis mine).
