I have a dict structure that appears like the following:}For each rule, I derive a decision and attach it to the policy rule. I do that via a simple recursive walk of the dict. In the above sample policy, the boolean logic equates to the following:I'd like to have a function that takes this policy in and is able to derive the boolean logic in order to return the final evaluation. I know a depth-search first approach is liable to be the direction here, but am struggling with how to maintain the boolean state and know which level I am at within the structure.
