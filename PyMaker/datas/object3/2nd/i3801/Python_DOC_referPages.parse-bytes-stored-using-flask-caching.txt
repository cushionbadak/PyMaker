Flask-Cache uses the  backend provided by Werkzeug, which serializes values using . It also prepends a  for help when deserializing. You should typically not mess with these values directly, and let Flask-Caching handle it.You can use  to safely examine the representation, then  to deserialize it. Security note:  can execute arbitrary code, so make sure you understand untrusted data first using .
