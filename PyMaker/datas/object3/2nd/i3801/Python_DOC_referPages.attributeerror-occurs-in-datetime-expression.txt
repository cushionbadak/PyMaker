While following Python tutorials, I came to know about the built-in  function, which according to the official documentation:Returns a string containing a printable representation of an object. For many types, this function makes an attempt to return a string that would yield an object with the same value when passed to , otherwise the representation is a string enclosed in angle brackets that contains the name of the type of the object together with additional information often including the name and address of the object. A class can control what this function returns for its instances by defining a  method.https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#reprTo sum up, for many object types including most built-ins,  (or the equivalent   returns True, also mentioned in the above documentation. But, while executing the following code,  occurs in the last statement i.e. .Can someone explain the reason behind this behavior?
 uses  in the representation:That's the module name, followed by the class name, which is an attribute of the module:The name  in your example doesn't reference the module but the class inside the module:Use  instead, then use . calls the  method, which is not passed any information on how your code is referencing the class; so the instance can't adjust what string it generates. Even if more information was available, you wouldn't want to generate different strings anyway; do you really want to figure out what  is when someone jokingly used  somewhere?Note that the goal of  is to aid debugging, not to provide full serialisation support of data types. If you want to serialise  instances, use a proper serialisation format such as , or write your own datetime -> string and string -> datetime conversions (e.g. for JSON, perhaps use ISO8601 string conversions).
