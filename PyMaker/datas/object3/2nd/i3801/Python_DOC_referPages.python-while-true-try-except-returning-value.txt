When I try to return a value after making a variable and putting a while True, try/except commands, the variable doesn't return the value. I am trying to globalize this "starting" so that it can be used.Thanks
Right, one amendment is needed to achieve your stated aim:replace:withwhen a function is called that returns a value without an explicit place for that value to be put python in effect throws away the value.
Instead of making  global, return  value to the caller. Use of global needs to be avoided if possible. Read why it is a bad design here. To implement in better way, your caller should be modified as:Now starting time is obtained in .Similarly,Ending time is obtained in .Also  does not break out of the infinite  loop. It does nothing, but is used when a statement is required syntactically but the program requires no action.  Use a  in-place of . It exits out of the innermost loop.Read about the usage of  here.
