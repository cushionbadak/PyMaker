I am trying to log how many times a command has been used on a particular user and then write it to a file to be added to every time the command is triggered.Here's the command that i am trying to do this for I'm trying to write a number, along with the  to a json file.
The easiest way is probably to maintain a dictionary mapping users to the number of times they have been mentioned.  Then you can just use  to send that to a file.  You should note that this doesn't scale very well.  If you see yourself updating this file constantly, you should consider switching to an asynchronous database (Especially because file writes are a blocking operation).
