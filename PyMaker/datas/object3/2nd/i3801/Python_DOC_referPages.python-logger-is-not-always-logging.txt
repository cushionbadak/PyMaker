I have a problem with my logging in my python script. I run the same script multiple times (to have several simulations) using  for increased performance. In my script I'm using a logger with MemoryHandler, defined as below:and I log information using . However, I noticed that the logging is not always working. When I check different log files (I have one log sile per simulation), some log files contain data, the others are empty. There is not particular pattern in which are empty and which are not, usually it happens at random. I tried many things but it seems like I'm missing something. Does anyone has any suggestion on why Python logger might not be always working corretly? 
Without a code snippet I would guess it is caused by the multiprocessing, you mention: using Pool for increased performance.. You can check the official documentation on how to use logging module while multiprocessing.
