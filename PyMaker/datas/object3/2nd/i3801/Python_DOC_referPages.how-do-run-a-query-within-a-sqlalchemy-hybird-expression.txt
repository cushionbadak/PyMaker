Have a class Run that has a "has many" relationship to a class Tag.I need to be able to filter runs based on a function of the tags (tag_collection).Below is a snippet of my code.  In this case I am using the automapper, but I don't think that matters too much.If I get an instance of a Run,  I can make use of the  property, but when I run a query, and try to filter using the  property, I either get the Run class passed in (as self) in the  decorated  method or I end up in the  decorated  method,  which also receives the Run class.Example query:I think I need to do a query in the  decorated  method, but I don't see how to get a handle on the session.  I know about ,  but I think  needs to be an instance of the orm class not the class itself.I think I am either completely wrong about my methodology of the filtering, or I need to somehow get a handle to the session object in that  decorated  method.Is there a better way to accomplish this filtering?How do a get the session in the decorated  method?
This looks to me to be a Correlated Subquery Relationship Hybrid. When  is added as a filter, you want to update the query to addReturn that as an expression, with the  function:Note that you want to avoid using  or  here, there is no need! Just use the property directly:or use  to negate:By defining the  method for the property, you have told SQLAlchemy to use that method when accessing the property on the class, so the context is always the class there. Without defining  (or a ),  would call the  getter (the method decorated with `@hybrid_property) as a class method, so only then would that method have to then work with either an instance or a class being passed in. For some hybrid property implementations, that happens to work by virtue of how they use attributes on the context.As for the implementation of the  instance property, I'd not use  there; use the  function: stops iterating over the supplied generator expression when a match has been found.
