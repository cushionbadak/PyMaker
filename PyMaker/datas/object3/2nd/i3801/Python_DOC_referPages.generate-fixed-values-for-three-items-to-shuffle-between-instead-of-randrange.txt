This previous code worked, however, now I want to generate fixed orientations at 35, 155, and 215 degrees and also try to generate pseudo-random orientations that are 60 plus degrees apart. The problem with the current code is that the values can duplicate or be too close together. 
Numpy Random Choice can pick from a listTry this:    rand.choice([35, 155, 215])
