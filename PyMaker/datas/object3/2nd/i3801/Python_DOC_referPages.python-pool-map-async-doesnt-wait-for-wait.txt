I'm trying to run a fat function which worked pretty well with pool.apply_asyncNow, I'm trying out the pool.map_async function (with 2 arguments passed with the functools.partial method) and the program finishes immediately without any error or exceptions... Any clues on what I might be missing?
First off, you probably don't need  if you are going to immediately  on it.  If that is the case, then just use .  You can potentially also remove your  and just return the values.  But that's probably not the problem you are having.  The problem is likely that the  method doesn't raise remote exceptions.  It is likely that your  method is actually failing in the pool processes but that you aren't seeing those exceptions.  Like Blckknght mentioned, you should switch to using a  method which, as you can see here, will raise the remote exception.  Here is a simple example where the  method hides the remote process exceptions and how if you switch to  you can see them again: If you run this you will get a traceback error message like soIf you switch to using the  method then you won't see it.
