Basically my intention is to generate lists of 15 numbers, so that there are no more than 9 numbers repeated between them (variable ), generating as many lists as possible. The comparison is made with all the lists contained in , which grows with each loop as long as the condition is accepted.The problem is that all possible results can never occur, since validation / comparison is only done after generating 15 random numbers.How do you make the condition / validation / comparison to be made when you are going to generate the numbers, forcing you to search for only the possible results?
 gives you all the -length combinations of elements in . That's what you want to use here. is now an iterator (not a list, note, so if you need to read through it more than once you need to cast it explicitly) of all 15-length combinations of the numbers 1-25, and you can use A* or some other pathfinding algorithm to find the best possible solution.
