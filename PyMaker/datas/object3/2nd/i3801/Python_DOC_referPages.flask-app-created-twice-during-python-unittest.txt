I have an app.py file which creates an flask appI am trying to write an unittest for my module and below is the fileWhen i run individual test methods it is working fine. But when i run the entire test case , the create app is called again which causes issues since my create app has dependencies which needs to be called only once.Is it possible to create app only once ?
setUp gets called before each test method. Therefore, if you run the whole test case, it will be called twice (one for each test method).To run something only once for the , you could try overriding the  method (see this SO question), or setUpClass or setUpModule. YMMV depending on which python version and test runners you are using.
IMO, the problem may related with context. You should create a  method to destroy the application context you created in :
