I want to automate a task in Python with the Google API Search Place. Right now, my code with Google Maps API is returning places 'hospital' for one set of geographic coordinates. But, I have a CSV file which contains many geographic coordinates.As you can see in my code, this is not efficient because I need to change the geographic coordinates manually. For each row (geographic coordinates) in my CSV file, I want my code to read the geographic coordinates 1: Hanoi and give me results 'hospitals' for this geographic coordinates. After read row 2: Ho Chi Minh and same for all the other rows.How I can achieve that or any good examples of making tasks like this more efficient? 
Make use of Python's  library to help with reading and writing the CSV files. Also it is better to use a format string to aid with inserting your variables into you URL:The format string works using quite a powerful mini language, but at its simplest, you just need to add  as a placeholder for what you want to replace. For each  that is used, format replaces it with the matching argument when it is called, e.g.
You can use the  library included in Python's standard library for this purpose.Specifically, csv.DictReader() and csv.writer() example: example:Additionally, you could also make use of urllib.parse.urlencode() for auto generating an argument string from a dict of params and values.
