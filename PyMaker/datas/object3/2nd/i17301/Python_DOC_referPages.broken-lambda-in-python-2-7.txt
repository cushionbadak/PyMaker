I was trying something with lambdas, to better understand how they work when I ran into this behavior. I guess I will let the code speak for itselfI ran 'dis' on the functions and this is what came out:The only difference is between the LOAD_FAST and the LOAD_GLOBALWhy is it that the 'False' in func1 gets evaluated at all?On a side note, 3.3 doesn't allow this:
 and  are keywords in Python 3, you can't use them as a variables anymore . And in Python 2 they are just simple variables and you can override their value by a simple assignment.Python 2:Python 3:
Here, you named your lambda's argument . That means the  in the body refers to the argument, whatever that happens to be. It's roughly equivalent toOn the other hand,here, the argument has a more reasonable name, so  refers to the built-in variable. It's roughly equivalent toIn Python 3, you can no longer name variables .
