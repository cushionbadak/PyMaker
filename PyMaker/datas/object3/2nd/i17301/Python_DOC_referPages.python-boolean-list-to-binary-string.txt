What's the fastest way to convert a list of booleans into a binary string in python?e.g. boolList2BinString([True, True, False]) = '0b110'.Also, how would I convert that binary string into the binary literal?  Would this take more time than just converting from the boolean list to the binary literal immediatley?  How would one do this?e.g. boolList2Bin([True, True, False]) = 0b110.Thanks!
Regarding your first question, you can use a list comprehension* and a conditional expression:Regarding your second, you cannot "convert that binary string into the binary literal". As their name suggests, literals must be literally typed out:Perhaps you meant that you want the quotes removed from the output?  If so, use :*Note: I purposefully chose to use a list comprehension with  instead of a generator expression because the former is generally faster.
Convert the list to a decent binary (will be a long int):And then, if you really need a "binary string", as you put it, useto generate that string.EDITYou also can use this code:The mechanism behind it is the same as before.

actually my solution is the slowest :( ...
