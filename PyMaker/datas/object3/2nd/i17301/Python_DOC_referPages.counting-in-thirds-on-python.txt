This question already has an answer here:Split a string to even sized chunks                    6 answers                Out of curiousity, is there a way on Python that the computer/program can count in thirds without using range, but instead with slices and indices? For example, what if you had a codon like 'CAGCAGCAT'. Could python divide that string into thirds like this: CAG CAG CAT? I tried to, but I failed. If there's a way, show me how. I'm curious

You could use the grouper recipe, , to collect items without using . If  is not a multiple of 3, then the above chops off the remainder. To prevent that, use itertools.izip_longest:By the way, grouper recipe works with any iterator.  works only with strings. Moreover, the grouper recipe is faster:Also note that  may not group your string into groups of 3 characters if the string contains spaces:
You can use the list comprehension, the third parameter of range is a step:
You can use the   recipe:Or in your case, you can also use simple slices:
