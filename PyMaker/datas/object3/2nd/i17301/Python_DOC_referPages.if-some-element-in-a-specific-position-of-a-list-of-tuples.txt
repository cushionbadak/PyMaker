I have a list of tuples:I would like to make a check "if 'name2' in MyList, something like:If I would write  I would be accessing the element ('name1', 'surname1', 'age1') while what I meant is to access the element at position 0 of every tuple in the list. I guess there is a syntaxis to do that but I'm a newbie and cannot find it online myself, can anyone help me with this?  
You can use  function and a generator function, like thisHere all the elements of tuples are unpacked to  while iterating. So, we can simply check if  is in name. This is the same as writingThis will be efficient, as it yields  immediately after there is a match, rest of the items need not be checked.If you are looking for a way to compare two strings, you should be using  operator, like this
Sounds that you could benefit from using dictionaries:Then you can check for existence  and also access directly the data 
I am not sure if this is the most efficient method, but you could use this. The point is it creates a transpose of the original list. Caveat: All tuples have to be of same length to avoid data loss. EDIT: Official docs for zip.Official docs for  operator used in unpacking argument lists.
