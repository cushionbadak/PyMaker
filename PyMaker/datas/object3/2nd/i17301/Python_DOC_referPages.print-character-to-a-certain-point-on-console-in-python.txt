Is there a way to print a character to a certain point on console using Python (3)?Here's an ideal example on what I'm trying to achieve:I know it's possible in some other languages, how about Python? I don't mind if I have to use an external library.I'm on a Windows 7.
If you are on UNIX (if you are not, see below), use :Only the Python package for UNIX platforms includes the  module. But don't worry if that doesn't apply to you, as a ported version called  is available for Windows and Mac OS.
If your console/terminal supports ANSI escape characters, then this is a good non-module solution.I had to translate it slightly to get it correct, but it works. You can print a string of any length in place of a single character. Also, if you want this to execute the function multiple times repeatedly, you should do this.Then print compstring after all of print_char's have executed. This will reduce flickering from clearing the screen.
