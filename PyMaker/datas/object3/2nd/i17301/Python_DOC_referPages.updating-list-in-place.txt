For this purpose I use the following code:The output is the following:So the original list wasn't changed though list is mutable object. What is the reason of such behavior?

Using list comprehension and Above will create new list. To modify the original list, use slicing ():NOTE  returns different result from  when tehre are multiple trailing newlines:
