This probably has a very simple solution, but I'm just a beginner.What I have is:Right now it only prints the index and not the string. I'm not entirely sure what the issue is, but when I switch the ordering in the last line so that (L[i]) comes first then it prints the string but not the index. I want to print both on the same line.
In Python 3.x,  is not a statement as in Python 2.x, but rather a function. You can use it like this:Additionally,  is great for what you're trying to do:Note that you can use  as a Python 3.x-style function in Python 2 if you import it from the  package (for Python 2.6 and up):
In Python 3.x,  is a function. So, you have to pass both the values as parameters like thisWhen you say Python 3.x, accepts  as the parameter to  and considers  as a separate expression and evaluates it, but that doesn't get passed to the  function. That is why always the first element is getting printed.Apart from that, your entire statement gets evaluated to the following tupleTo understand that, try something like this, in the Python REPLWhen the inner  with  getting executed, it will return  and the next element is . In Python, when you write two expressions separated by comma, in parenthesis, they will become a tuple.You can confirm the same with Python's generated bytecodes, like thisOutput corresponds to the tuple construction and as we don't use it, it gets discarded immediately.

As others said,  is now a function, so what python is doing is interpreting the line: as a tuple. Do  instead.You'll also want to use enumerate:
