I need to run a simple C program several time, each one with different input string (let's say AAAAA... increasing size, until I get "TRUE" as output).e.g.in C I would simply use a while loop.I know in python there is the while loop as well.So the python program would be:Given that I can make the .py script executable by writingandWhat should I do to make this work?Thanks in advance
You could try something like this (see docs):The  module is preferred to the  command, since it has been "deprecated since version 2.6." See the os documentation.
You can use subprocess.check_output:
file.pyrunning file.py would execute ./program 10 times with increasing  input
Use . Here is the documentation  returns a stdout output from your C program. So, if your program prints something, use that. (In fact, it returns a tuple (0, out) for stdout). returns boolean status from program which you can use as well.So, assuming you are using stdout to capture the  output, the entire modified program looks likeI would experiment with  to see if I can read values returned by . Edit: Didn't notice that  is deprecated since 2.6 Please use  as shown in other response.
