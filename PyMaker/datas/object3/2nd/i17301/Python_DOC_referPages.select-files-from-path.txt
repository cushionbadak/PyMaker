I have files in particular path and need to select one by one base on namefile (yyyymmdd.faifb1p16m2.nc) where yyyy is year, mm is month, and dd is date. I made code like this :What should I do next if I only select files for January, and then February, and so on. Thank you.  
Two regexes:Sample data:20140131.faifb1p16m2.nc2014131.faifb1p16m2.nc201412.faifb1p16m2.nc201411.faifb1p16m2.nc20141212.faifb1p16m2.nc2014121.faifb1p16m2.nc201411.faifb1p16m2.ncThe first regex will match all 7 of those entries. The second regex will match only 1, and 5. I probably made the regexes way more complicated than I needed to. You're going to want the second regex, but I'm just listing the first as an example.As another similar solution shows you can ditch glob for os.listdir(), so:Becomes: And then the rest of the code is great. One of the great things about using glob is that you can use  which is just like glob, but as an iterator, which can help with performance when going through a directory with lots of files. One more thing, here's another stackoverflow post with an overview of python's infamous lambda feature. It's often used for the functions , , , and so on. 
You can do :It will list all file names for January.Assuming that your all files of same format as you have described in the question. 
To validate filenames, you could use  method:
