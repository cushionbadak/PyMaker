I am writing unit tests, and want to check for a call which has a function object, like so:  How do I check that the call() has all the parameters I want, without reproducing the lambda? Edit: I wanted to clarify that I am using the  library from here: http://mock.readthedocs.org/en/latest/. The  I showed above is a call on a  object, which I want to check using . 
I finally found out how to do what I want. Basically, when using , I wanted one parameter to match regardless of what it was (because I can't recreate the  every time during test). The way to do it is to use .So, in my example, this could match the call:
If you want more granularity than mock.ANY, you can make your own validator class for use in call comparisons like assert_has_calls, assert_called_once_with, etc.Which can be used like:
not sure how you're building the , but if it's some sort of :If you're overly concerned about getting input that is a callable that ISN'T a function, and feel it will fail the unit test silently:
