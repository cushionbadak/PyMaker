I want to format and print data from a dictionary with the keyword unpacking operator .The format string possibly refers to many keywords and the dictionary may not have all the required keys. For the missing keys, I would like to use the string 'N/A' as a default value.I would like a clever solution for this default-ing problem, possibly using a .Here is a first solution using a regular .I would like to avoid the explicit assignment of 'N/A' for missing keys.The following solution also uses a regular  and analyzes the format string to build the list of keywords:This solution with  is not really elegant nor robust since the syntax of format string is much more complex than the above .The following solution would be my favorite oneâ€¦ if it did not fail for an obvious reason.The problem here is that  actually unpacks the keywords in , so  does not search  for the requested keywords and thus does not give  the opportunity to provide its default value.Is there a solution to this ?Eg is there an alternative  function which would actually call  and thus get the s?
Use  and pass the  to that.
Good solution using formatter is already givenHowever you are not benefiting from keyword unpacking in this case. You are forced to specify keys you wanted to print in the format string. And dict as intended already maintains the Keyword-Value mappingso for dict like thisusing default value to dict.get()if you want Key Word management in one place (as you did with format string), I would try something like thisor thisthe benefit is, Less imports
