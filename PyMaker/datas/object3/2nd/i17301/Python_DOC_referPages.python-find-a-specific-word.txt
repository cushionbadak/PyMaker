Natural Text
I am trying to find if a string matches the word 'for'the above code outputs ['for'], but that's not what i'm looking for.Perhaps I must use re.match, but I am not sure. Any help will be appreciated!
Use  to mark the border of some word:From the docs:\b is an assertion that the current position is located at a word boundary
Do you just want to check if the string contains the word or part of it?the pythonic way to do it is:
You want to get a boolean? How about ? (By the way, an  statement would do that implicitely, so  is ok).If you don't need to use a regexp, you can also use:  (which “returns” a boolean).
If you insist on using  to check if a substring is in a string, try:If you want to check the existence of a substring in a string and return the string:If you want to check the existence of a substring in a string and return a boolean:Of course, trying to ask python in natural language is wont work:
