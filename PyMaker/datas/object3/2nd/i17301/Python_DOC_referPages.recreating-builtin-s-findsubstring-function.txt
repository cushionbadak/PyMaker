I am trying to recreate the s.find('substring') function. the two problems I am encountering are as follows:  1)The ability to find the beginning index, for example:2) Assuming the correct index has been located, I expected this code segment to indicate whether or not the entire substring is within the string:Whenever I test it independently of the main loop in idle, it does not work correctly.Here is my main code: Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, thanks mates!
Your loop should work just fine, but you are not doing anything with the  test and are not calculating the end point correctly; you want to use the length of  here, really.You could loop directly over  and add indices with the  function. You need to add the  result to  to find the endpoint, and make it print out the test; I used  here as the resulting slice should be the same string:Demo:
