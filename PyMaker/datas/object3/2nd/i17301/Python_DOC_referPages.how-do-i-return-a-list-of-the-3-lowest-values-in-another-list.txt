How do I return a list of the 3 lowest values in another list.  For example I want to get the 3 lowest values of this list:
You can use :
If you could sort,you can get frst 3 elements as below:Output:
even simpler without modules imported:hope this helps
If your lists are long, the most efficient way of doing this is via :This executes in O(N) time, unlike a full sort which would operate in O(NlogN) time. The time savings come from not performing a full sort, but only the minimal amount needed to ensure that the  lowest elements are first. Hence the output is not necessarily sorted.If you need them to be sorted, you can do that afterwards (). For a large array this will still be faster than sorting the whole thing first.Edit: Here is a comparison of the speed of ,  and :So  is 66 times faster than  for an array with a million elements, and it is 355 times faster than . This doesn't mean that you should never use  (which is very flexible), but it demonstrates how important it is to avoid plain lists when speed is important.
