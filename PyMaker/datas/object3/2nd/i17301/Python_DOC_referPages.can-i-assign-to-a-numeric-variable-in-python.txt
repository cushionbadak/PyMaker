I started working on my simple program and when I open it I get an error that says this can't assign to literal. Here's my code:
The rule for Python expressions is that names have to have to be of the form:Where:So you cannot assign a to a digit, because those are reserved for integers and other numeric types.
You can not create a variable with numbers. 
a variable name can't start with numbers; is an assignment operator, you should use  to do comparison.e.g.:
You cannot assign to a literal basically means that you cannot assign it to something that can't change. For example, open your python shell and type in . It will raise the same error. Edit your code as such: cannot be stored as a variable because it is a number. You can change the  to a , because  does not contain a value already.
