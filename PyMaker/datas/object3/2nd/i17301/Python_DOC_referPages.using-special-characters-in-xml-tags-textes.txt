Natural Text
So this question basically is the first of more to follow once I figured out what really goes on. I read a lot about encoding decoding and XML standarts, but I did not find an answer to this specific topic.My first question is in the  line. I understand, that \xe4 is the code for the letter Ã¤, so does this mean, that I have to decode every string passed to my interpreter as utf-8 in order to work properly? Because when I read special characters from a .txt file using python's readline method, they seem to be already decoded correctly. A related but slightly different question is the line . It seems not to be possible to use non-ASCII characters in XML Tags (at least not with element tree). Is this because of the XML standart or basically just another decoding/encoding problem?
You can have non-ASCII characters in element names (and element content). Use Unicode strings and it should work. At http://effbot.org/zone/element.htm#the-element-type, it says:All elements must have a tag, but all other properties are optional. All strings can either be Unicode strings, or 8-bit strings containing US-ASCII only.Demo program (tested with Python 2.7):Output (in testout.xml):The above program also works unchanged in Python 3.3+. The leading  characters are redundant, but allowed (the  syntax is restored for  objects in Python 3.3).
