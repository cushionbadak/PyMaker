Hi I am trying to print the data type of a user input and produce a table like following:ABCDEFGH = String,  1.09 = float, 0 = int, true = bool, etc.I'm using python 3.2.3 and I know I could use type() to get the type of the data but in python all user inputs are taken as strings and I don't know how to determine whether the input is a string or Boolean or integer or float. Here is that part of the code:which always returns str for string.Appreciate any help
