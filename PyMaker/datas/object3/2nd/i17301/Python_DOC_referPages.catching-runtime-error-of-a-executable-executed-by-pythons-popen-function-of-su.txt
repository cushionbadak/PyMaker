I am writing a python script which compiles and runs a C/C++ code.I want to capture runtime errors.Eg: Nzecv, Segmentation fault, Fragmentation Error etcI am using following command to execute the compiled file:I have tried few programs with runtime errors, but the errors arent reflected in stderr.After some research i found that stderr reads from return value of program.And in C and mostly all other programs, main returns custom ("return 0;") value not the error signal.Is it possible to catch runtime error signal? How should i go about implementing it?  EDIT: Can runtime error signal be captured by Terminal? HOW?If yes, ill run the corresponding shell script through python.
