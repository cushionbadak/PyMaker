I've seen the term  floating around some Python files and I can't find any documentation on it aside from a few brief descriptions about it's purpose, but they still don't provide enough information for me to get a good understanding of it. All I know is that it has something to do with importing modules, other than that I'm completely at a loss. What does it do? When is it used? How can I use it if at all?
What is ? is an attribute that is set on an imported module by its loader.  Accessing it should return the loader object itself.In Python versions before 3.3,  was not set by the built-in import machinery.   Instead, this attribute was only available on modules that were imported using a custom loader.However, this functionality changed in Python 3.3 because of PEP 0302.  Now,  is available on every module that is imported:What is a loader?A loader is an object that is returned by a finder. It uses its  method to load a module into memory.   is an example of an abstract base class for a loader.What is a finder?A finder is an object that uses its  method to try and find the loader for a module.   is an example of an abstract base class for a finder.  Note however that it is deprecated in favor of  and .How can I use it, if at all?The main use of  is for introspection.  However, there are two other common uses: may be used to gather data on a specific module's loader.In Python versions before 3.3,  could be used with  to check whether or not a module was imported with the built-in import machinery:If  had returned , it would mean that the  module was imported using a custom loader.  Since it did not, it means that the module was imported using the built-in import machinery.Note: The above test will not work in Python 3.3+ because of the changes made by PEP 0302.
