I would like to test the following codeI thought about using mock from the standard library to check if the __call__ method calls the required arguments. The problem I face is that if I create a Mock object for a bound method, it does not have a __self__ or __func__ attribute. So I tried the following code:It works, but I feel like I'm not testing properly. I'm using too much knowledge on how the class WeakBoundMethod is working, instead of testing the actual result.Is there a better way to mock a bound method? Should I make a Dummy class with a dummy method instead?
First of all: if you are using python-3.4 why don't use WeakMethod from weakref instead?Anyway mock framework is a powerful but sometimes can be an overkilled approach and force you to know too much of what you want to test: the side effect can be that your test become too much coupled to the implementation.In your case is better use real object to test it. A quite complete test of your WeakBoundMethod can be this:I hope is clear enough: I love  framework and I'm using it quite intensely but you shouldn't use it if it is not hard to create real object that can sense and report what you want to test.
