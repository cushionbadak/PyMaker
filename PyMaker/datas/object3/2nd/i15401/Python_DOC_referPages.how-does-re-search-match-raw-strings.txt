 matches successfully to . But the pattern being matched is , how is   matching to ? What happened to the backslash?
Inside a regular expression, the dot character has a special meaning, which is that it can match any character at all other than a newline (unless the / flag is used).  In this case, the backslash has the effect of escaping the dot from its special meaning and letting the regular expression engine interpret it as literally matching only a dot (and no other character).  Consider if the backslash is not there:The original string you provided as input still matches.  But now the following will also match:Because the  in  qualifies as any non-newline character, which is what  will match if unescaped with a backslash.  You can see that if we add the backslash back in, it no longer matches.More on Python's implementation of regular expressions here:Python 2.7.x: https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.htmlPython 3.4.x: https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.htmlEdited to reflect @cdarke's excellent point about newlines
