Ok I got the following problem the count result is 4 (I don't know how is that possible).The result should be instead of 4 it should be 3
You're code doesn't make much sense, you write lines like:Where you open a bracket and don't close it.Furthermore your algorithm:Doesn't make much sense: you simply count the number of words.The method you look for is:One thus adds a constraint (in case the search is case sensitive):Which checks whether  contains the word .This gives: is not counted since  is not the same as In case the search should be case-insensitive, you can use:which returns you test-case exactly (using ):
Using that kind of generator expression is a very idiomatic way to construct this function. Basically constructing a list full of s for every word in  that is also in , then returning the  of those s
