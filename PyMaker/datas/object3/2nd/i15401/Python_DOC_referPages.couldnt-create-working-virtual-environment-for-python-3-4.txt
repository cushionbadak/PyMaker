I installed Python 3.4.2 and Virtualenv 12.0.5 in my Linux Mint 17.1Then I tried creating:And also using --clear and/or -p /usr/bin/python3.4, always getting the messages:Another try was:It gave no errors on creation, but in the venv/bin file the python3.4 is a symbolic link to /usr/local/bin/python3.4. Then when I activate and install any lib using pip or pip3, then try to import it, I get the error:I always used virtualenv in Python 2.X and never got this kind of errors. Any thoughts on what am I doing wrong?Thanks!!=======EDITED=======This is the output of my partitions (fdisk -l):And also my fstab:
Is that a shared partition that you have mounted? Does the shared partition have a different filesystem then the non-shared one you tried upon? If yes, then IMO, that will definitely cause an error since you are making and compiling binaries for python on one filesystem, and so it will not work on another filesystem. As mentioned in this answer, adding to your /etc/fstab with an entry with  flag might make it work for you, i.e., you might need to add another entry for the NTFS disk here to make it automount:
I struggled with this as well so I wrote an ugly bash script to help me with this.  The only salient difference between what you do and what I do is on line 133:That is, explicitly name the instance of python and the venv tool.  ThenEditI installed Linux Mint in a VM to try and build a Python 3.4 virtual environment.  Based on the error messages I saw and this answer, I learned that I must do the following to get a complete Python 3.4 build:Without this, my Python 3.4 build did not contain pip.  Note that you probably want to install readline and other development packages. Unsolicited AdviceDo not do this as root, create a user dedicated to running your venvCreate a script to create your environmentCheck that script into your source code repoI deleted my python binaries and venvs multiple times and then recreated all of with this script to make sure that my script reproduced my environment and then stripped the identifying information and saved that on github to share it.  I should really be using a more formal tool for this like docker/puppet/chef.
