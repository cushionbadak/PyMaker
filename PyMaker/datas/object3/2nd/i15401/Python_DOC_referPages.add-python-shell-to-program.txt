I try to make game in python using pygame. It should be learning game, so I want to ask if it is possible to run python shell in game window or I have to program my own parser? 
 will open a Python interpreter in a new window, similar to typing 'python' on a command line.  But I suspect that this is not what you meant by 'in a game window'. creates "A simple framework for writing line-oriented command interpreters" (that use verb object... syntax).  It could be used for writing a text adventure game ('go east', 'open box', 'look room', etc). is specifically for Python interpreters.  It uses  and .  Idle's Shell is based on a subclass thereof defined in idlelib/PyShell.py.  It simulates the Python interactive interpreter in a tkinter window.  There is no need to re-write the parser included in ; one can tell compile to stop with the abstract syntax tree that is the output of the parser.
