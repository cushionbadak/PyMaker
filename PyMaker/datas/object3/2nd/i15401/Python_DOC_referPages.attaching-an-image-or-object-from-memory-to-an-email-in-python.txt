I have an image in memory that I've created (using numpy and PIL), and I'd like to attach it to a created email programatically. I know I could save it to the filesystem, and then reload/attach it, but it seems in-efficient: is there a way to just pipe it to the mime attachment without saving?The save/reload version:
 says that the first argument is just "a string containing the raw image data", so you don't have to  then  it from a file.If you're making it in PIL and there isn't a way to serialize it directly (there might not be, I can't recall), you can use a  (or ...whichever works with what  really wants) file-like buffer to save the file, then read it out as a string.
