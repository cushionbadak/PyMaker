To get the array of the min, average and max temperature respectively, the zip functionis good as you can see here .You can import these functions from numpy and matplotlib modules as well, and you can alter the layout (the color in the example) as follows:You can find the keyword arguments of the plot function on the matplotlib documentation or in the docstring of the function.
