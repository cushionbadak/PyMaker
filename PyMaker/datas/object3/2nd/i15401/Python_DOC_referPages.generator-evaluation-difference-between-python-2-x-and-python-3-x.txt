Test code could be listed below.In Python 2.7.8, this code below caused my machine crashed.While in Python 3.2.5.1, the code below works fine.Result isIs there anyone knowing the reason? Thanks
 returns an iterator in Python 3, but a list in Python 2.  and  are both infinite generators, thus ping them together produces an "infinite" list.As others already mentioned, you should use  instead (Python 2 only).
In Python 2,  like most other "functional" elements in the global namespace, returns a , meaning it evaluates everything at once. In Python 3 this will be a generator, evaluated on demand and thus needing less memory (although the output you provided doesn't look like memory would be a problem).
