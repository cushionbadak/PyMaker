Natural Text
I run it, it says  isn't defined. If I rewrite it  then it doesn't have this error, but then the file doesn't change. The text file is just , with the 's all lowercased. I'm trying to uppercase them and rewrite it. But can't quite seem to figure it out.
Changing  to  is correct since  yields key/value pairs.  The reason your file is not updating is because  does not work in-place.  Strings are immutable in Python, so the method always returns a new string.This means that this line:is effectively a no-op.  To fix the problem, simply reassign  to this string so that its value is updated:Also, the  line should be dedented one level:Otherwise, you will write to the file for each item in the  dictionary.Finally, you can use a with-statement to have your files be closed automatically when you are done:
This should solve your problem.I can't run it right now , please tell me if you have problems.
