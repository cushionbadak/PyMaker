If I have a list of objects acquired by some query (in this case Django models).How can I get the list of ids, so I can use it to search another model, like this:I'm pretty sure the lambda expressions should be able to do it but I can't figure it out...
If the return value of the  method is a  object, you can use  method:If it's not a  object, you can use list comprehension (This one can be used for both  and non-QuerySet one):
