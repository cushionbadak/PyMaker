Our professor told us today that we can build an iterator, e.g.  and that when we will use it, as in (for i in iteratorExample), the interpreter will call the __iter__(self) and __next__(self) methods. My questions are:If I open C:\Python folder - where can I see the code that calls these methods?In the python folder, where can I see the code of other built-in methods  (like len(), or int()?
You could look at the Python byte code disassembly, to see how -loop is implemented in Python:Even without looking at the source, we could guess that  is called by  op code and  is called in .And indeed, CPython's Python/ceval.c confirms it e.g.,  calls  that is equivalent to  that can call  method.In the python folder, where can I see the code of other built-in methods (like len(), or int()?These functions are also implemented in C (in CPython). You can see them in the CPython source repository.Built-in methods are from  module that is implemented in Python/bltinmodule.c e.g.,  calls . is a class for integers in Python. It is implemented in Objects/longobject.c (Python 3).Isn't the CPython code in the Python folder?No. The Python installation folder does not contain the source code for CPython. It may contain pure Python modules from the standard library such as Lib/fractions.py unless they are zipped or only compiled modules such as ,  files have been installed.To get the full source code, run:where  is the Mercurial executable.As an exercise, you could locate where other Python implementations such as Pypy, Jython define , , , .
You're asking for behaviour that's built into Python. In particular you're using the Python interpreter written in C which is often referred to as CPython. You can find the source of CPython here although it'll take a while to find the exact code that does ,  and the iterator protocol.
