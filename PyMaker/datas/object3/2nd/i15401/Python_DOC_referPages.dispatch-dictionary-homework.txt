 returns a function object (). You are trying to treat that object as if it was a dictionary.You want to call it instead:Your  function does not itself return another function object, so you'd not call whatever  returns.Your  route then fails with:presumably because you meant to use the  function you defined, not the built-in  function.However, even fixing that won't get you your output, because .It sounds as if you were trying to actually return a dictionary:This return value you would use like you did originally, by looking up the callable via a key, then calling it.
