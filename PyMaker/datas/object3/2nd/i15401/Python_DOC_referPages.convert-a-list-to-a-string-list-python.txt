I'm Python beginner can't get my head around. How do I change for example into  string format.This is as far as i got but it goes into newline with each number.
Using  with generator expression:
but it goes into newline with each numberThatâ€™s because you add the newline after each number instead of after each sublist . If you want that instead, you should append the newline there:But note that appending to a string is very inefficient, as it ends up creating lots of intermediary strings. Usually, you would create a list instead to which you append your string parts, and then finally join that list to convert it to a single string:And then, you can also use list expressions to make this shorter in multiple steps; first for the inner list:And you can join that list comprehension first:Then you can move the newline into the outer join, and make a new list comprehension for the outer list:And at that point, you can make it a one-liner too:As Padraic pointed out in the comments, joining on the newline character will also prevent the string from having a trailing  which you would end up if you kept adding it in the loop. Otherwise, you could have used  to get rid of it afterwards.
