In my code I use  and before that I configure with . Is it possible to keep the logging lines in the code without them doing anything?
EDIT: it seems that  is not supposed to be meant for public use. Look at Maggyero's answer for alternative solutions.Just disable the log handler and it won't write to anything anymore.Do note that every logger can have handlers so there might be more.
Using the main APIIn the logging Python library, one can completely disable logging (for all levels) for a particular logger either by:adding to it a  handler (to avoid the  handler) and setting its  attribute to  (to avoid the handlers of the parent loggers), or byadding to it a  filter.Code sample:Warning. — Contrary to the 1st solution, the 2nd solution does not disable logging from child loggers (for instance ), so one should use it only to disable logging for a single logger.Note. — Setting the logger's  attribute to  is not a 3rd solution, as it is not part of the public API. See https://bugs.python.org/issue36318. Code sample:Using the config APIAlternatively, one can get the same behaviour with the  function. Code sample:
You can use:to disable all logging calls which are at level CRITICAL or below. Effectively this disables all logging calls.You can enable the logging for all loggers again (at their own logging levels) by doing:
