Natural Text
I want my  class to work as a float when it's being added to floats or integers so I can naturally perform operations with it, but it's only working when the  is the rightmost operand. Is there a way to make it work with the operands in any order or should I override another method that I haven't learned of?Code (I guess variable names are pretty self-explanatory): returns  as it should but  raises:
The  special method only applies to when you do .  If you want to handle , you need to overload the  special method.Since they both do the same thing, you can just do:An easy way to remember this is to treat the  in  as standing for "right".  So, you use  when your class is on the right of the  operator.Also, you'll notice that I used  to do the typechecking.  Aside from being cleaner, this way is preferred by most Python programmers and is explicitly advocated in PEP 0008.
