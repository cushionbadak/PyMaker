I am looking for a simple way of checking if a nested object exists in a list. For exampleIs there a simple function that will determine if  the dict with  is in the ? I don't want to use a loop as it seems like overkill.
You could use  and a generator expression:Of course, this assumes that all dictionaries have an  key.  If not, then you could do:Update:To get the dictionary returned, use :I made  the default value to return if there is no dictionary in the list which meets the criteria.  But you can pick any other value you want.
If you want just the first  dict that contains an 3` use a regular loop :If you want all dicts use a list comp:You can use a function and return the dict:
