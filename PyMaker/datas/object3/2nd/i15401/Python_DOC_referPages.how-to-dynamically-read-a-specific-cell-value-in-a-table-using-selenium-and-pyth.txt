I am working on a automation script [using selenium and python] that should do the followingRead the table rows and columns dynamically, look for column[this is constant) which has 0 value set in any of the rows and if found click the [assign/unassign] button column in the same rowI do not want to hard-code the xpath of the column that has value "0" rather look for it dynamically and proceed .Below code is what i have written HTML file structureMy HTML file has n number of rows with columns as given above. As i mentioned , i would like to read the third column value[i.e 10 | 5] to see whether or not its 0 [consider only the first item in the third column] and then click the button[btn btn-success] in the next column.Any pointers to proceed further would be appreciated!I will provide the link to actual HTML file in the comments section 
I do not want to hard-code the xpath of the column that has value "0" re.match(pattern, string, flags=0)If zero or more characters at the beginning of string match the regular expression pattern, return a corresponding match object. Return None if the string does not match the pattern; note that this is different from a zero-length match.Note that even in MULTILINE mode, re.match() will only match at the beginning of the string and not at the beginning of each line.If you want to locate a match anywhere in string, use search() instead (see also search() vs. match()).https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#module-re======Here it is with xpath, and I think it better matches what you are trying to do, i.e. given a column, look down the rows for the value 0:The output will look like the following, depending on what text you are trying to match with the regex:But in my opinion, having to use the following in an xpath:to match a class, means that using xpath is NOT the way to do it.  The python method:...will do the same thing more succinctly and clearly.
