I am making a pygame game and I want it to recharge the cannon (its a ship warfare game) fire recharge number.I have the recharge set to 1.75 seconds (1750 in pygame time) and I figured out 5.714285714285714 is the number you must multiply 1750 by to get 10,000. By getting 10,000 I want to cap it so it only says the first 2 numbers. Like instead of saying:148833 it will say 14.Code for the variable change:If there isn't a way to cap an integer, I'll keep divided by 1000 to make it a smaller number.
Function str() returns a string from integer, and first two digits is [0:2]. Let me know if I misunderstood your question.
