Is it possible to check argparse choices in case-insensitive manner?results in:

Using  in the  is nice way of doing this, if you don't mind loosing the case information.If you want to retain the case, you could define a custom  class.  The  needs two methods,  (for testing ), and iteration (to list the choices).The help is:
Keeping the case information would also be possible with a one liner:Where choices would be the same list as passed to the choices parameter.
