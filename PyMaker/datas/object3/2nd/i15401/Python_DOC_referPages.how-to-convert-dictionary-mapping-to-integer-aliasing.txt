Dynamically setting variables is a truly terrible idea in more ways than I can count, but Python gives you enough rope to shoot yourself in the foot!  At an interactive interpreter prompt it may be less horrible than anywhere else...Works in both Python 2 and Python 3 interactive interpreters.A better approach is to keep each bunch of such names-with-values within a class, which acts as its namespace.  See http://code.activestate.com/recipes/52308-the-simple-but-handy-collector-of-a-bunch-of-named/ -- oldie, but goldie, if I say so myself:-).  Just say, e.gand the global variables will be intact but  will be  with zero risk of "namespace pollution" (the big problem with dynamically setting global variables)...
