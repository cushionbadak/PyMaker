I want to be able to match a pattern in  format to a list of strings, rather than to actual files in the filesystem. Is there any way to do this, or convert a  pattern easily to a regex?
Good artists copy; great artists steal.I stole ;) translates globs  and  to regex  and  respectively. I tweaked it not to.  This one Ã  la , both  and  work.  Glob patterns and strings found on this page pass test.  
The  module uses the  module for individual path elements.That means the path is split into the directory name and the filename, and if the directory name contains meta characters (contains any of the characters ,  or ) then these are expanded recursively.If you have a list of strings that are simple filenames, then just using the  function is enough:but if they contain full paths, you need to do more work as the regular expression generated doesn't take path segments into account (wildcards don't exclude the separators nor are they adjusted for cross-platform path matching).You can construct a simple trie from the paths, then match your pattern against that:This mouthful can quickly find matches using globs anywhere along the path:
On Python 3.4+ you can just use .On Python 3.3 or earlier (including 2.x), get  from PyPI.Note that to get platform-independent results (which will depend on why you're running this) you'd want to explicitly state  or .
While  can be used directly to check whether a pattern matches a filename or not, you can also use the  method to generate the regex out of the given  pattern:From the documenation:Return the shell-style pattern converted to a regular expression.
never mind, I found it. I want the fnmatch module.
