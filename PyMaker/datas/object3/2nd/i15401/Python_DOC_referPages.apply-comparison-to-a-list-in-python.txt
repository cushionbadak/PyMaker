This question already has an answer here:check if all elements in a list are identical                    24 answers                I am trying to compare elements of a list  for equality.A possible solution could be , or simply , but it looks rather weird.In Python, it's possible to write , with its usual "mathematical" meaning. So I thought I could, with the help of the operator module, write . However, the  function takes only two arguments. Of course,  is of no use here, since after the first test , I get a boolean, and it will fail when doing the second test, .Is there a better way than the solution above? A more... "pythonic" way?
 is pretty Pythonic.
