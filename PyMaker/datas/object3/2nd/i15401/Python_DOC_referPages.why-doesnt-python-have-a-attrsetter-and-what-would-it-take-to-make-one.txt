 provides  to make a function that retrieves a field from an object.Why isn't this included in   (or somewhere else in the standard libraries)? The only reason that I can think of is that there are edge cases where this straightforward approach will break.  In which case, what are these edge cases so that I can try to trap/avoid them?
 is designed to be used in places where a function is required as a replacement for . For example:In other words, the point of  is to create a side-effect-free function that returns a useful value, and which can be used in expressions that require a function. An , on the other hand, would only operate by side effect, and would need to return  by Python convention. Since  would not be at all useful as argument to  and similar, it is not provided. If you need , simply write a normal  loop.Also note that both of the above idioms are better expressed with a list comprehension: is rarely needed and has lost much of its appeal once it was announced that  will not be removed from Python 3 after all.
