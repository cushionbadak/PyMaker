I am solving a problem in python.I have 2 strings with numbers and I need to find out whether a number from string B is located in a string A.for example:A and B may contain any number and quantity.If the number of string B is in A I want result true or false.Unfortunately, I do not know how to do this.
You have strings, not integers, so you'd have to convert them to integers first:This uses a list comprehension to turn each result of a  method call into integers with the  function.To test if there are numbers in both sequences, you'd use sets, then test if there is an intersection:If the result is not empty, there were numbers shared between the sequences. Since non-empty sets are considered 'true', in Python, you'd convert this to a boolean with :Sets are by far the most efficient method to test for such intersections.You can do all this in one line, and a little more efficiently, with generator expressions and the  method:or perhaps a little more compact still with the  function:Demo:or breaking it down a little:
If the numbers are integers, to obtain a list of  /  entries corresponding to whether each number in  is in , try:Output: To find out if any of the numbers in  are in , then:Output:
