I have a fresh install of Python 3.4 and Pydev with Eclipse Luna.When I try to run a simple code (like ) for the first time, I see this error: I assume that the system cannot find ms950_hkscs.py but I cannot find a similar file on the internet. Does anyone know what the problem is and how this can be fixed? Thanks.
