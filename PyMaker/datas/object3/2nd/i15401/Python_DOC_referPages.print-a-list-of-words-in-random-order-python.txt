I have a project to complete from a book which was received as a Christmas present (Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner, Third Edition):Create a program that prints a list of words in random order. The program should print all the words and not repeat any.I have created the following code:I'd like to check if this code is the most efficient way of doing so, but there is no forum to check against, rather frustratingly!Is there a better way of doing this? Cheers
How about using :or  if it is okay to modify the original list:
If you want to use only the things the chapter is about, than maybe this could be one solution:
Random is module which provides you with an inbuilt method called, shuffle() , which can be used to change the elements of the list argument passed in any random order.
Other than using Python's  or  function directly as others have suggested, your solution works just fine, but it has the downside of emptying the original  list, which is probably not desirable.To that end, the following does both in-place and copy shuffle.  
import random

Random word printerimport randomWORDS = ["joy","hope","kindness","love","patience","dedication"]used = []while WORDS:    comp_choice = random.choice(WORDS)    if comp_choice not in used:        print(comp_choice,end = " ")    used.append(comp_choice)
Not elegant, but it uses only the methods which were mentioned in the book so far.
