I have an MSI file that I'm trying to extract some of the parameters specified in the Details tab on the file properties.I found the msilib where SummaryInformation.GetProperty(field) looks like the way to go, but I don't understand how to use it. how do I 'connect' it to that existing MSI file and not one that is being created?
The msi file contains both cab files and information in a database format.See this link for more info about its structre and how to view it: MSI structure answer.I never used the python msilib but by reading the documentation my guess is this:to get the db object, use something like:if you want something in the summary info then you can do something like:if the information you need is in one of the db tables then you should do a sql query against it:
