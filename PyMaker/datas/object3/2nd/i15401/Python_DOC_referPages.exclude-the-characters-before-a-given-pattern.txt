Natural Text
For this question, I am not interested in alternative pythonic methods, I am only interested in solving the Regex in my code. I can't figure out why it does not work.Let's say I have the following string:I want to get all characters, excluding all characters before the dot, except the first one before it. So, I am trying to extract the following substring:This is my code:My Regex logic is broken down as follows, the first characters  which are not one character followed by a dot followed by any number of characters , are removed.However, the Regex doesn't work, can someone help me out? 
Your current code is not working because your pattern is not matching what you think it is.  Putting  in a character set does not mean "zero or more characters".  Instead, it means the characters  or  literally.  Also,  is treated as  or , not an escaped  (since  has no special meaning in a character set).This means that your pattern is actually equivalent to:which matches:To do what you want with , you can use:Below is an explanation of what the pattern does:The important part though is the capture group. Inside the replace string,  will refer to whatever was matched by it, which in this case is the text that you want to keep. So, the code above can be seen as replacing all of the text with only that which we need.That said, it seems like it would be better to just use :
