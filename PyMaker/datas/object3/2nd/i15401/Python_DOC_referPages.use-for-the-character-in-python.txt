Natural Text
Is there some use for the  character in Python? I get an invalid syntax error when using it in variable names. Is there some syntax where it is valid?Unfortunately, what I can find on Google is mostly people asking how to implement the  operator from C, which is a different question.
From the documentation:The following printing ASCII characters are not used in Python. Their occurrence outside string literals and comments is an unconditional error:$       ?So no, there isn't really a use for  in Python.
No it's not a part of the language. The following printing ASCII characters are not used in Python. Their occurrence outside string literals and comments is an unconditional error:$       ?
