I have a template that references a form like {{ registeredteamform.team_name }}, but Django's generic class based views pass forms using the key 'form'.  Rather than changing the form name in my template (I'm dealing with a multi-form situation) I'd like to change they key of the form passed to the template.I tried extending the  method like sobut this raises the error .  So, how can I change the form key and is render_to_response the appropriate place to do this?  (I'm subclassing the ),

The  goes in the  for Python 2.7, and you don't need to pass the self at all for Python 3.Python 2.7:Python 3:If you dig into the  you will see that it is in the  that form actually gets assigned to the  key.You could add in the key the way you are now, but the  key will still be getting assigned too.I might suggest overriding the .
