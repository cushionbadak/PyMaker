 is a virtual namespace. It provides access to packages that were renamed between Python 2 and 3. As such, you shouldn't be installing anything.By importing from  the developer doesn't have to handle the case where it is located at  in Python 2, and at  in Python 3. Note that these are part of the standard library.The mapping was added to  version 1.5.0; make sure you have that version or newer.Mac comes with six version 1.4.1 pre-installed in  and this will interfere with any version you install in  (which is listed last in the sys.path).The best work-around is to use a virtualenv and install your own version of  into that, together with whatever else you need for this project. Create a new virtualenv for new projects.If you absolutely have to install this at the system level, then for this specific project you'll have to remove the  path:This will remove various OS X-provided packages from your path for just that run of Python; Apple installs these for their own needs.
