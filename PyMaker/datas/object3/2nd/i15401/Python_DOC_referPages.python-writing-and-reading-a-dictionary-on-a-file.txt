i'm trying to write a dictionary to a .txt file, and then read it from that same file again.This is what i've got so far:But when i try to run the .py it will return:I'm on a Mac by the way.As i said, i want it to write the dictionary to the file, and then read the dictionary from that same file and print it again.Could someone tell me what i'm doing wrong? Maybe give me an example of how i could make this code work?
When you read the dictionary from file the result is  and you cant tread with as a dictionary ! you can use  to convert it to dictionary :but as a more efficient way you can use  module :A “shelf” is a persistent, dictionary-like object. The difference with “dbm” databases is that the values (not the keys!) in a shelf can be essentially arbitrary Python objects — anything that the pickle module can handle. This includes most class instances, recursive data types, and objects containing lots of shared sub-objects. The keys are ordinary strings.
You could use the pickle library so you write (e.g.):Or even if you want to do it more 'pythonic':
Using  can have a possible security issue, whereby Python code can be ran upon loading the pickle. If a malicious user has replaced your pickle file with some malicious code then you're in trouble.I would suggest using Javascript Object Notation, or JSON, for writing your dictionary to a file. Python has a builtin  module which can provide loading and dumping data. The code below is a toy example which does this with a dictionary.You will now have a file  which contains your data. If you wish to re-read this in later you can use the below code:After which,  and  will contain the same information.
