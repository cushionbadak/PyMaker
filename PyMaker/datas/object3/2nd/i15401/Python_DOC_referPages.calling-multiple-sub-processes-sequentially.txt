I need to be able to call a bash command every few milliseconds and I am trying to use the sub-process to do so. I currently use:and have a timer firing the command at the times needed. My question is, if I am calling these commands through the use of , will this be opening new terminals to run each command? I want to make sure I don't run into any memory usage issues as I will be calling thousands of these commands.What is the best way to go about this?
Whatever you do, there are probably better alternatives than starting a thousand of processes in a minute whether you run out of memory or not.To run subprocesses sequentially, use  instead of .will this be opening new terminals to run each command?No, unless the command itself starts a new terminal.
To answer your question about terminals opening, that won't happen unless the underlying bash script is explicitly launching terminal tabs or something. As to your question about memory usage, that will entirely depend on what underlying scripts you are calling and whether you're doing it in a sequential or concurrent manner. I guess a little clarification may help!
