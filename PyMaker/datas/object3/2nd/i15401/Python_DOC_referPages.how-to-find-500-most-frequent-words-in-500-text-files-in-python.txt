Natural Text
I have 500 text files in one directory.I have to find 500 most frequent words in all of the text files combined.How can I achieve that?PS: I have searched a lot but could not find a solution.
Use :Of course, it will read every file found in that directory. If that's not the intended behavior, use  or  with the required pattern instead of  (see Reut's comment to my answer).
This is the most straightforward way I could think of using a dictionary for the count, with the key as the word ad the value for the count:Using collections.Counter (as Padraic suggested):
You could create a counter for each new word, and an array of words. Add each New word to the array. Compare each word In the text file(s) to the words in the array using "index of", increment the counter for the word. Or you could create one array, populate with every NEW word from the text files, use second element of the array as a counter. 
We can use Counter method from collections module.Read only text files from target directory by Iterate all files from step 1 by .Open file in read mode by  statement and  method of file object.Split content of file by  method of string and use  to create countable dictionary. Add add two counters together. https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.htmlGet most common word from the Counter by  method.code:output:-
