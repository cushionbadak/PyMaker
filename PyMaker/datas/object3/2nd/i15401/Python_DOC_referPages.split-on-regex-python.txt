I feel stupid asking such a question, but I can't get it to work. I made a trivial regex to split strings with the following format :I voluntarily let random blanks because it is legal in the format. My regex is pretty basic : , and works fine. I'm familiar enough with regexes in Java and Scala so I first checked the doc of Python to see the differences and it seems this regex is correct though it could be shorter.Yet, it does not split anything.Code :Output :Any idea why such a simple regex does not work ?
You are not using a regular expression method. Use the  module; the  function does what you want just fine:The  method doesn't take a regular expression.
