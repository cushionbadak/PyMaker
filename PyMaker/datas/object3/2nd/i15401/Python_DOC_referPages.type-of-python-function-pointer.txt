For Python 3, it turned out as a good practise for me, to hint data types for function parameters and return types. For example:This works perfectly for all simple data types and classes. But now I need to use this with a "function pointer":What must be put at the  to make clear that a function pointer is required here? I tried , because  is , but the keyword  is not defined.
I would use  to represent a function:You could also use a string literal such as , but it looks like you want an actual type object.
One approach may be to use :This is intended for all objects that implement . This is quite broad as it'll also be  for methods of instances or other objects that happen to implement . But this may be what you intend - it depends on whether you only wish to accept functions or also other callable objects.
