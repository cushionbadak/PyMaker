I am using Python's  module to test a script I am writing.The script contains a loop like this:I have no problems using  to test . But I would like to test  by overriding .I tried modifying my script so that  takes  as an optional parameter so that I can pass in a simple version from the test:It has not worked as I had hoped, are there any suggestions on how I should be doing this?
In the end I used Python's , which allows me to override  without having to adjust the original code in any way.Here is the original script, and note that  is not passed in to  as an '' parameter (which was what I tried in my earlier solutions):and here is the script I am using to test it:This works just as I had wanted:I am able to substitute functions with a simpler version of themselves that I can more easily test,I do not need to alter my original code in any way (such as I was trying -- which was effectively by passing in function pointers), the  module gives me post-coding access to the innards.Thanks to austin for his suggestion to use .BTW I am using Python 2.7 and therefore used the -installable  from PyPI.
Don't try to override  with , just use  as the default :
In your code, you shouldn't be able to overwrite  like that. If I try it, I get .But perhaps is the problem that in your actual code, you're referring to  in some other way (e.g. as a member of a module)? Then by overwriting it in your test, you're overwriting the actual , so you won't be able to use it from other tests.The correct way to do this is to overwrite the local variable with the global one, like so:
