If a have a string like  or  etc. how can I print together, the first character, then the first two characters, then the first three etc. all together?For example for a  I would like to print/return  or I have this code so far:But it prints/returns it in separate lines. I could write it manually as  but how do I make python do it as I don't know how long the string is going to be?
You shouldn't use  as a variable name, because it shadows the built-in  type. You could join the sliced strings together in your loop:It's possible to shorten your code a little using  and :or using  (Python 3.2+): approach appears to be 2 times faster than  one and about 1.5 times faster than the original loop-based solution:The code I used to time the functions is
Just use:As @abc noted, don't use  as a variable name because it's one of the default type. see https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-str-unicode-list-tuple-bytearray-buffer-xrangeE.g.: is because of slicing, see Explain Python's slice notation:Then: Lastly, join  using , see https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#string.join:To avoid extract iteration in loop, you can use  since  returns string of 0 length:
If you are using python 3 you can use this to print without a newline:So your function could be:
