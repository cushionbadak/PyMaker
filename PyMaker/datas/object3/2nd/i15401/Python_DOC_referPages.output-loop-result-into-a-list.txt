Someone please help me with this code:Is there any way to save the output into one variable? An example would be:  ?
You mean like this?
Create an empty list and then append the results of for loop to that list or you could use list comprehension.
you could also store that into a generator function, something like this:so that you will actually compute this thing only on request, i.e. during a for cycle, so you will not store in memory each agern['name'] two times.
