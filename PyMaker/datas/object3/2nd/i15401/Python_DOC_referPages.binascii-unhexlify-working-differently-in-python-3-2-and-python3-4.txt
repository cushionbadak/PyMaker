I used to work on , and the latest version of  embedded in it is .  My program takes a hex string as input, decodes it and creates a  so I can decode several information using . For example:Last week my computer crashed, so I had to build a new machine. I decided to give a try to . However, I discovered that the only version of  is . I installed  using , but I noticed that the version installed is only . When I run the exact same code as above, I get a  on the  line:I don't understand this error, what does it mean?I checked on Google but couldn't find anything: have there been any changes on  between the two versions? Do I have to change something in 3.2? I really don't see how to solve this... Maybe there is a better way to achieve that?Thanks. PS: I could go back to , or install  on , but I think my production server is a fresh install of , so with ... so I'd better target that version (and I am glad I discovered it now!).
Yes, there was a change in behavior between versions.  From the  module documentation:Note:  functions accept Unicode strings containing only ASCII characters. Other functions only accept bytes-like objects (such as ,  and other objects that support the buffer protocol).Changed in version 3.3: ASCII-only unicode strings are now accepted by the  functions.So if you want to target Python <3.3, you need to pass in either  or  objects instead of strings.
