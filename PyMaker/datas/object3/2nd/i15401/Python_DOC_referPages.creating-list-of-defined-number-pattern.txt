I want to create a list that produces the output of:and keeps going until . Having the 's in front of the digits is essential. I tried a method such as:However, for obvious reasons, the  function does not behave in the manner I would like. Do people have any suggestions on how else I could do this?
You cannot produce a list with integers that are presented with padding, no. You can produce strings with leading zeros:The  function is used to format integers to a field width of 3 characters with leading zeros to pad out the length, encoded as .Demo:
You could subclass  and overload its  method to call  on each number:Demo:To make the exact list you want, do .Note however that this does not make integers with leading zeros (as @MartijnPieters said, that is impossible).  The output is still a string. All this is doing is telling Python how to display those integers when they are outputed to the console.
