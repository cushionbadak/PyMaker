what is the default shebang is none is specified in a python script, Like below.
There is no default shebang.A shebang is not Python syntax, it is a hint used by your shell on Unix (-like) systems, to find an appropriate executable to run the script with if found in the first line and the file is executable. If the line is missing, execution usually fails as the shell may try and execute the file as shell commands instead.Some operating systems (specifically Windows) have different mechanisms in place to find the executable. For example, they can map the filename extension to the executable. In such cases any shebang lines are ignored.See Shebang (Unix) on Wikipedia, and the Python Windows FAQ for further details. Python 3 has some improved Windows execution support, see Using Python on Windows; the  launcher will actually read shebang lines in to dispatch to the right Python interpreter.
