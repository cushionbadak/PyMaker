I am making a game with Pygame that has some buttons, when touching a special button it's opening another .exe file. Im doing that with this way;But Pygame screen stays at background, I want to close that screen when the user click that button and open that .exe file. I tried this;Theorically it should be work, opened .exe file after then quit from Pygame. But this isn't working, .exe file opened succesfuly but Pygame screen still stays at the background and if I touch it, giving error Pygame stop working. How can I fix this? When that special .exe file opened, close the  Pygame screen?
 wait the program terminate; the next line  will not executed until the termination of the process. Instead of , you can use  which does not wait the program termination (or any other functionality that does not wait the process termination):
