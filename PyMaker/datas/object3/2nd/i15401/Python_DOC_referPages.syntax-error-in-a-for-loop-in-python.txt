If you want to use a range, then you need to call the  function: is not part of the Python syntax, it is just another built-in object type.
The syntax is: is a function taking an argument. And you have to specify which variable you will use to iterate ()
The range function have following syntax: range(limit 1, limit 2), you pass like argument a size of array you want.
