I have a numpy array of characters and when I write it to file it writes as:I want it to write with just the letters and without the brackets or quotations i.e. as:I have looked at numpy documentation and from what I have gathered the solution is a chararray however it looks like this is not as functional as a normal array.Any help would be great. Thanks!
You can use  method of  as:Since you have a  array, this method will be faster than .For Python3x  can be used as:
If you just have a numpy array then why not convert it to a string directly for writing to your file? You can do this using  which accepts an iterable (list, numpy array, etc).

If you use the  method to save the array to file, the default separator is the empty string .So if your array is this,then if you're using Python 2,creates a file with the following content:If you're using Python 3, you may need to explicitly cast the array to the  string type first:
In a numpy way, you can do:Using F-String (Only available for Python 3.4+)Using the default string:In both, we convert the array into a usable unicode (check the  attribute at page bottom) format of the size of the array. Which is the  of the string if you try to convert it to Note: it works with non-English letters.
