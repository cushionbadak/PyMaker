I have date strings in the form of  and want to convert it to  in Python 3. The final output I need is just as a string. I implementing my own function to do the conversion using dictionary (for month conversion) but I am wondering if there is more pythonic way of doing the same thing.

If you just want a string, your dict mapping and format would work fine, if you don't want datetime objects I don't see the point in using datetime:
