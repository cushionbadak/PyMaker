The multiprocessing module and pickling. There seems to be some pickling going on whenever you need to use the multiprocessing module that I'd like to understand better. Apparently, when items can't be pickled (for whatever reason), they can't be passed as arguments to a Process or Pool object in the multiprocessing module. Why is this? Is there a complete list or description explaining when items can't be pickled?Thanks to anyone that can help.
So  is very limited in what it can serialize.  The full list is pretty much given in the docs.. here:https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#what-can-be-pickled-and-unpickledand here:https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html#what-can-be-pickled-and-unpickled.It gets worse. Pickling doesn't really work in the interpreter, mainly because  primarily serializes by reference. It doesn't actually pickle the function or the class object, it serializes a string that is essentially their name:So, if you have built your function, class, or whatever in the interpreter, then you essentially can't pickle the object with .  It looks for the  module, and  can't find .  This is also why things fail to serialize with  in the interpreter.However, there is a good solution.  You could use a better serializer (like ), and a fork of  that leverages a better serializer.There's a decent list of sorts for what can serialize and what can't here:https://github.com/uqfoundation/dill/blob/master/dill/_objects.py-- it's not comprehensive, but most things can be serialized with .Get  and  here: https://github.com/uqfoundation
