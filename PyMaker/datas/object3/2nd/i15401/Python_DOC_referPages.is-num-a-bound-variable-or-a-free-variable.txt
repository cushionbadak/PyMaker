Is num a bound variable or a free variable?P.S. This code is written in python. There's no former code ahead of this.
From python doc : If a name is bound in a block, it is a local variable of that block, unless declared as nonlocal. If a name is bound at the module level, it is a global variable. (The variables of the module code block are local and global.) If a variable is used in a code block but not defined there, it is a free variable.Here  is defined in  and as such is bound to it.You can look to this other post from SO to have an example of free variable
