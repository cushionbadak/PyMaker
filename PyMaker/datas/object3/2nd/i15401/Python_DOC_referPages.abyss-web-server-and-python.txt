I have got Abyss web server on my windows-7 64 bit computer. I followed the instructions regarded in this official link to add python support to the server, regarding that I did not downloaded the Active Python considered in the documentation, I just used a previously installed Python 3.3 on my machine.I have wrote very simple python script:Then I saved it as  in the server's htdocs, then I tried to access  but the server returns Error 500 Internal Server Error the log line that record this error is:cgi.log:[21/Dec/2014:01:33:54 +0200]  CGI: [C:\Python33\python.exe  test.py ] URI: /test.py   Bad CGI header line [Hello]access.log:127.0.0.1 - - [21/Dec/2014:01:33:54 +0200] "GET /test.py HTTP/1.1" 500 412 "" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36  (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/39.0.2171.95 Safari/537.36"So how could I fix the CGI header line?
I found how to fix the CGI header, thanks to Himal, the idea is printing out content type followed by a blank line, then the script works fine:
