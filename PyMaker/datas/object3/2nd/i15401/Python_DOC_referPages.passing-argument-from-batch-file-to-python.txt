In your code, you're skipping the first argument twice. gets called with , skipping the first argument (program name); but then  itself uses ... skipping its first argument again.Just pass  untouched to  and you'll be fine, for example.Or, perhaps more elegantly, do call , but then, in , use !
Use argparse https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.htmlEg: In your python fileInside your bat file
