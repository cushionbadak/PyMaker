By using  to traverse the folder like this:There will throw a exception: , I want to ignore the exception and continue, and I tried this:as the comment says, the  in exception part is a syntax error. Is there a way to ignore the exception and continue to traverse?The exception is thrown from , so put the  within  can not catch the exception. The  will return a python generator, How to catch the exception within it?
Update:I originally thought that the error was being raised by the  code.  Since it is actually being raised by , you will need to do something a little different:Basically, this is taking advantage of the fact that  returns a generator object.  This allows us to call  on it and thereby have control over the iteration during each step.The  line attempts to advance the iteration.  If a  is raised, it is logged and we continue on to the next step.  If a  exception is raised, it means that we are done walking the directory tree.  So, we break the loop.Since  needs to be inside the loop, you will need to move the  block in there as well:Also, doing:has been deprecated.  You should be using the  keyword in place of :While you're at it, you should replace the generic  with the specific :You should always try to catch the most specific exception that you can.  Otherwise, you run the risk of accidentally catching an exception that you did not mean to handle.
I had a similar situation while iterating over links using Beautiful Soup. This is the code I wrote for that:An example:You can fix your code by using above code:Above code can be extended more to have callbacks per skipped exception types if needed, but it may be more pythonic to use iCodez's answer in such a case.
