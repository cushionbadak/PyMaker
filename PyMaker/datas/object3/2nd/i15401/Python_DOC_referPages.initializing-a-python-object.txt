Natural Text
I am trying to teach myself object oriented programming in Python with the book "Python 3, Object Oriented Programming", by Dusty Phillips.  On pages 54 and 55 he creates a class called Note and encourages the reader to repeat the example and import the module from the interpreter with the following commands.  However, when I do, I type the n1 = command I get the message from the interpreter "TypeError: object() takes no parameters.  Am I missing something in the implementation of this object, or did the book give a faulty example?  Mind you the example and the lines typed into the interpreter are taken exactly from the book, at least I think I made no errors in copying the lines.  This is different initialization syntax than C++, which makes me wonder if the author gave a bad example, but in the book example it looks as if he is trying to initialize with a call to the object directly and the object is supposed to recognize the text that gets passed to memo.  Also I tried to run the example in python 2.7.9 and 3.4.2 to see if this was a version issue.Interpreter linesfrom notebook import Noten1 = Note("hello first") # the code execution gets stopped here fur to the errorn2 = Note("hello again")n1.idn2.id
Maybe do what Christian said: Use  instead of . You need to have double underscores not single underscores. You can look at the Python Docs.
You are missing double underscores in the special  method. You only have single underscores. You might also consider having  explicitly inherit from , i.e. .
