I'm trying to learn what options and parameters a function has so I can use it to the fullest. For example, I want to learn what sort of arguments the default  function accepts, and perhaps some documentation on the parameters e.g. what each argument does, the options for each argument and so on. I've read around and saw that  is the method. Am I right, or is there an easier way to do this?  Anyhow, I tried it but got an error. It gave this error.Any idea why?
The only functions that  supports are those created in Python code with  or .  From the docs:Get the names and default values of a Python function's arguments.Emphasis mine.   however is not technically a Python function because it is written in C:That is why a  is raised for passing it to .Also, using  to get information about a function is only really used in metaprogramming.  If you are simply looking for documentation or usage, you should use  in the interactive interpreter as @thomas said or read the documentation online.
The best way to find about a function, is to read its docstring and see how it was implemented. This can be done by running the help() functionI.E -  shows you what can be done with the  functionOr for example -will returnYou can read more about the  function here
