I have some old code which has optparse as their argument library. It has type as choice as one of the arguments I am trying to convert my code to have argparse. What should I put in the type? If I add type = choice it throws an error:What should be the value of type here if I am using argparse?
In ,  type is just a special form of . From the  documenattion: options are a subtype of  options. The  option attribute (a sequence of strings) defines the set of allowed option arguments.You don't need to specify this as a type in ; all you need to provide is the choices. Remove the  argument altogether, or set it  if you want to be explicit.Also see the choices documentation for ; this is a lot more flexible than in  as this also allows for the choices to be of a type other than strings.
