I'm trying to read many bz2 files within a tar file, a file has the following structure:I'm able to get the filenames as follows:Which returns a list of the .bz2 files. Now I'm trying to extract them (temporarily) using:The following code to extract the json file returns an error, however. How would I go about retrieving the JSON files line by line?I've been unable to figure out how to return a buffer from the tar file instead of the current ExFileObject (how to convert it to a buffer?), any suggestions are greatly appreciated.
 expects a file name as first argument and you pass a file object (i.e. an object which has the same API as what Python returns for ).To do what you want, you'll have to read all the bytes from  yourself and call  or use  to stream the data through it.
