I am trying to make this program that asks a user for their grades and displays their grades with 2 decimals. - ex. if they got a 10/15 on their Assignment it would show Assignment 1: 66.66% In my code, it seems I am having trouble converting the numbers calculated to two decimals. These answers give the whole decimal answer, for example instead of showing 66.66% it would show 66.666667%. How would I make this into 66.66%?Thanks in advance.Edit: Also how would I take these answers and create the average percentage?
You can use the following syntax to denote that you want the formatting in two decimal points. - You can read more here.The  in this case denotes that you want the formatting in two decimal points. If you want to increase or decrease the decimal points you can adjust accordingly.
python supports percent as formatting option:note that there is no need to divide by 100 when using  as format specifier.search form  in the Format Specification Mini-Language. more information on formatting can be obtained here: https://pyformat.info/.
You probably should ask your second question as a separate question, but one implementation would be to create a pandas dataframe.
