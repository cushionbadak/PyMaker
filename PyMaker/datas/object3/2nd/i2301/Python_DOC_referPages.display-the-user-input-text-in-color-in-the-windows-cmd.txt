Natural Text
I have yet another question regarding my little console program for the windows cmd.I use colorama to color my text in the terminal which makes it look like this:Then I found out how to color the text in an -method using a little "hack" with a print without linebreak, like this:this leads to the yellow line in the picture above. But I still look for a way to color the very characters the user inputs - so here I would like to format the user input "sdffdgf..." in color as well. has anyone a solution for me or will it just not be possible with the limited windows cmd?
Removing the  line from your code runs as you wish on my machine.My colorama version .The Colorama docs state that when using  it will reset your colour and styling options immediately after the  command, this happens before you get to your input command which is why you do not get the colours in the user typed text.
https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#inputYou can pass  a string to display before the actual input of the user.You can probably get rid of the  call with this.
