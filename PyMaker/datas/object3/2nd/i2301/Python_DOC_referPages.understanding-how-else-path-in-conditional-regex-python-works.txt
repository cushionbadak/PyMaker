I tried to understand the simple regex: . My (very probably wrong) understanding of the regex above is: If there is a single "+" then it should be followed directly by three digits, else (if there is no plus) it should look for two digits.My two test sentences are:See: https://regex101.com/r/oJepMi/1/The regex finds in 1: "+333", but does not find "22" in sentence 2:.https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html mentions:(?(id/name)yes-pattern|no-pattern):  "Will try to match with yes-pattern if the group with given id or name exists, and with no-pattern if it doesnâ€™t."It seems a quiet easy tasks, but I struggle to understand.Can someone please explain how the else path concept works for python?Best regards and many thanksGiovanni
Using this kind of conditional does only make sense, if the group is optional or part of an alternation, thus it's actually possible to not match it.Change your regex to  to get this to work.Note that this will still match  out of . You'd have to add a negative lookahead to check for  it this is not intended,  e.g.  or simplier
