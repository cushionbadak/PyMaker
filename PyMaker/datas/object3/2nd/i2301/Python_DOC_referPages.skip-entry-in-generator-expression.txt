What is the best way to skip entries in a generator expression that are created using a function and another generator?In essence, I am looking for an expression that looks like this:(but the  statement obviously doesn't work in this context)Functionally, it should act like this:
A list comprehension allows to filter and then map. You want to manually  your function first.The above is for a  that yields single arguments. You can use  if it returns a  of arguments.Finally, if you also need to pass in keyword arguments, you will need to rely on a  function.Although, note that at that point, the function-style generator might be more readable.
