Natural Text
What I am trying to do is to analyse the frequency of the letters in a text. As an example, I will use here a small sentence, but all that is thought to analyse huge texts (so it's better to be efficient).Well, I have the following text:Then I created a function which counts the frequenciesAnd then I obtain ISSUES:I want to see all the letters, but some of them are not seen (Container object of 15 artists) How to expand the histogram?Then, I would like to sort the histogram, to obtain something like from thisthis
For counting we can use a  object. Counter also supports getting key-value pairs on the most common values:The  method returns a list of key-value tuples. The  is used to unpack (see this answer).Note: I haven't updated the width or color to match your result plots.
Another solution using pandas:Result:Edit: I timed my and ikkuh's solutionsUsing counter: 10000 loops, best of 3: 21.3 Âµs per loopUsing pandas groupby: 10 loops, best of 3: 22.1 ms per loopFor this small dataset, Counter is definately a LOT faster. Maybe i'll time this for a bigger set when i have time.
