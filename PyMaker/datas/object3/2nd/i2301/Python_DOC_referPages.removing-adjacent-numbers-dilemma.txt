I was writing a function to remove adjacent equivalent numbers in a list. I wrote remove_adjacent(nums) in honestly less than a minute. However I seem to be stuck in this rut where what I write is not pythonic at all. And also it is not nearly as fast as I would like. The second solution was the intended one written by Google. This is a Google basic coding problem solution doc that I have been working through I forgot where specifically I got it from however it is from Google development.I feel like my problem stems from my previous experiences with C and C++. Any thoughts on how to improve? Do I just need brute force practice? Continuous reiterations of "I wrote it like this but it is way more python to write it like this"
There is an itertools recipe for this, it looks like:
