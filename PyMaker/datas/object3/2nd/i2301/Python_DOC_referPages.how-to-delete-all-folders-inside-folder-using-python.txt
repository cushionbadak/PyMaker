Is it possible to delete all folders inside a folder without using a specific path?, Here i am moving the contents of the file then after that i want to delete if it is a dir
Yes it is, Use shutil's  method.You can also use  but that won't work if there is any content in it.If you want to check if that specific path is a directory then you can use  then run  if that returns And incase you want to keep the root folder intact then you could  that directory and calling  on each item.
As suggested by @Vineeth Sai earlier, If you want to delete all sub directories in a directory, just loop through each file with  and if the file is a directory, apply :The above also uses  to check if a file is a directory. 
If  answer is not suitable for your case, you could you  module to run  specific commands like belowThe above command is  specific, you could use windows counterpart of the same command above.Note - Here  will expand  into files/folders.  Also, note  answer is  independent, and above will be  specific. Be cautious.   P.S. - You can also run  commands using  module.
