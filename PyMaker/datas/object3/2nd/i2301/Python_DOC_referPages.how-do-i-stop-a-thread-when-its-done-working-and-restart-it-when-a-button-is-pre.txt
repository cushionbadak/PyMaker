I have an installer I am creating for a game and as of now there are two buttons. One downloads the game, and one starts the game if it detects the executable. I multi-threaded both buttons so that my GUI will not freeze when I click either button. The problem is, if I click one of the buttons, the other will not work until restarting the application. I need some way for the thread to close after its process is completed so that the thread is open for the other button to work.Here is what I have so far:
Your issue is caused by the fact that  has a value.You need to reset .Below I have adjusted your code to do that and in doing so I have renamed  to , simply because it makes what is going on more obvious and fits with python standards.
