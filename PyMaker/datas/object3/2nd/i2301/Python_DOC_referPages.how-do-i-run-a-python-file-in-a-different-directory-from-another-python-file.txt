During the course of my python program, I have generated the following string "D:\something_else.py"Lets say there are other resources in D: that something_else.py requires. How would I go about running something_else.py from my code, which let's say is being run from C:\Users\Someone\Desktop?Right now I'm using the following: This gives me an error as it's able to find only something_else.py and is unable to find the other resources that something_else.py needs which are in the same folder as something_else.py
Besides the fact that you need to be careful with "\" and instead of :prepend your string with r:you can simply set  the PYTHONPATH environment variable to point to the directory in which sit the other modules.See here for additional informations :https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONPATH
If you can have the mentioned folder as part of the project itself, you can turn that into  python package, simply by adding an empty file in the folder named If it is on some other path like "D:\some_directory\", which has  along with other dependencies, do this along with your import statements:It will add the mentioned directory to your , and then you can import anything from python files kept there, and just call the functions as usual.If you are using any IDE like PyCharm, it may still show you  for the 2nd line, as part of import checks. But the code will simply work when you run it.It's almost never a good idea to call a python script from other(), when you can just import and call functions, with a better control & error checking.
