This question already has an answer here:Zip lists in Python                    9 answers                Okay so here I have a list of weather stations, their coordinates in lat and lon all in different lists. How can I combine these so that I can figure out which stations of the list belong to a certain lat, lon area? I'll do at loop of but how do I then use that loop to find out the station, lat and lon pairs? Do I use some kind of index method?
If you know you have lists of equal lengths:To answer your second question Could the conditional statement be integrated into this? for example: i for i in lats if i < 64.5?Yes, just add a condition before printing.
You can do something like this
Create a dictionary with the stations and their coordinatesYou can use the built-in function zip() to combine these lists and then iterate over them:This will result in a dictionary with the following format:Of course this can also be written on a single lineCreating the dictionary with additional conditionsThis can be combined with some conditions, for example:or
Some good solutions here, but you may also be interested in using pandas DataFrames to manage your data:
You can use the zip() function to iterate over multiple iterables:
