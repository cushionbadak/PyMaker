I'm trying to get the  function to sort using  and then print to screen - either within  or within it's own function.It works fine when there is no  function, but I'm having difficulties working out the right syntax to pass  as a parameter to be used in 
There are several issues with your code:You need to return a value from your  functionYou need to give the  function a different name from the listYou need to actually call the  function at some pointAvoid using  as a variable name, as this is a built-in function in Python.The  function works fine, however.
