I am new to Python and i don't know much about asyncio.  I want to run this script and if the OBS software it is trying to connect to on 10.11.0.124 is not running to exit the code.  The code does this, but it take 2 minutes before it exits.  I cannot figure out why it does not exit immediately when it cannot connect to the OBS software that is not running on 10.11.0.124.
The  function has a timeout of two minutes, because it uses the  module internally and that has a default timeout of two minutes.Detailed breakdown: calls  and then s . does nothing interesting, but  s  s . has several different timeouts defined via keyword arguments. It also waits for multiple things. These are:, defined hereThis uses  which has a 60 second timeout by default.It then calls  which calls  which defaults to  which defaults to , which subclasses  which probably isn't adding any further delays. in the case of any exception being raised, which does occur.I don't understand  so I just stopped here; there's probably another 60 second delay somewhere but if not... perhaps the computer was just slow.
Thanks for the help user4815162342 and wizzwizz4!  Here is my final solution.  I ended up going with wizzwizz4's suggestion of breaking down the connection string so i could use asyncio.wait_for on it.If anyone cares the code itself is to watch OBS and when streaming is started go change the asset on Screenly OSE to display the RTMP stream.  When the streaming is stopped switch back to a different asset on Screenly OSE.
