Is it possible to print the newest file using ? example: startswith "DOG"
I dont know what do you mean by , but try this:
Making a system call such as  on every file in a directory can be slow and expensive. It's many times more efficient to use  to obtain all the information of files in a directory in one call since it is readily available during the call to obtain a directory listing.Please read PEP-471 for details.
