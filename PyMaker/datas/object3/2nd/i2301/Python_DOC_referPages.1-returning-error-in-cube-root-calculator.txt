Here's my cube root calculator:It returns following error on entering  as input:It prints expected answers for all negative integers expect  and I am unable to find reason for this behavior. It should print  as output and I don't see any reason for defining when it's being "defined" by function.Do you see what I am missing?
When you put -1 into the function, the for loop never runs.  is 0, so it never runs, therefore guess is never initialized. You may have ment to do 
If , then , and  is empty. So, no iteration happens (because there's nothing to iterate over), and the name  is never created.Also,  is not a function, it's a class.
You have to indent properly.  is only defined in the scope of the for loop, it is the index of the for loop.I indented those lines below and ran the script, I don't get the error that you got, but I also get  when running the program and I get no output if I input -1 (or any negative number).My best guess as to what you're trying to do is below. There are probably more elegant ways to write the program, and I know  statements are frowned upon for making the logic hard to follow.
