Question: How do I check condition during XML parsingWhat you are doing, is not parsing, as this line has done the parsing already:You don't need to pass , as this is the standard Parser.  Read for Reference: xml.etree.ElementTree.parseYour example code loops the  FOUR TIMES.    Every , will loop until it findes the requested Element or up to the End.You should avoid such nested coding!You can get all  Elements  by one loop, for example:Output:Comment:  cveList for each update item instead of getting all items in one list.I would like to iterate in each update and get other attributes as wellOutput:Tested with Python:2.7.9
Using  isnâ€™t right - use  And instead of  use
