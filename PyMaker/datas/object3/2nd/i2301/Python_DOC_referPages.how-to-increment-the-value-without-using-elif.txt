May be you can use  instead and use key to get the corresponding value as following:Update:If entered value or  does not exist in the dictionary, it will raise . In that case  can be used with default value of  (or other value) to return when key is not found:
Heres an efficient way.It's hard coded that the first value is 21, and that they increment by one, but for your case it will work.
