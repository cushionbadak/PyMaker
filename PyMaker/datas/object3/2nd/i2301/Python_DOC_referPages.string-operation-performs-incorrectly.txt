In  i have thisand  is thisprint returns thisthe     sher flow pst  flt plteas you can see function removes words with less than 2 characters.But, for some reason, it removed all "a" characters too. For Example, "flat" became "flt"Why? 
The variable  has And ['the', 'in', 'shear', 'flow', 'past', 'a', 'flat', 'plate']In  loop, it finds  and replaces  in  with empty or removes the character. Note: it would do same if some word was with  e.g.  to .Instead I would suggest something like  may work:
 replaces all occurrences. str.replace(old, new[, count])Return a copy of the string with all occurrences of substring old replaced by new. If the optional argument count is given, only the first count occurrences are replaced.DocumentationSo once the word "a" is reached in the input,  will remove all "a"s in the entire string. If you only want to replace words shorter than 2 characters, you could use for example list-comprehension:
