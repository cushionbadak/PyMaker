Natural Text
I would like to split each row of a csv file into multiple blocks of text and save them as separate text files (it has only 1 column, each row contains a block of text). My items_split function works perfectly fine with a defined block of text but when applied to the csv file I got the error "File "untitled.py", line 25, in items_split      idx = text_lines.index("ABC") + 1ValueError: 'ABC' is not in list"The code I used is below:For example, each row in the csv file would look like this:"MEDIA News reportABC Topic 1  dzfffa a agasgeaherhryyeshdhDemographics: 12,000 (male 16+) • 7,000 (female 16+)Topic 2fszg seez trbwtewtmytmutryrmujfcjDemographics: 10,000 (male 16+) • 5,000 (female 16+)Are you happy with this content?

"and save each as separate text files. I have run the function on text itself and it works perfectly fine. The problem is when I run it on the csv file, somehow it doesn't recognize that each row is a block of text and I have tried converting it into strings etc. in vain. 
Python has a great library for importing and reading from CSV files. never reinvent the wheelCSV Python 2.Xfrom the document a short example explaining how to read from a CSV file.CSV Python 3.xThis module works similarly except now it returns an OrderedDict[] type which makes it a bit easier to navigate the file. 
You're passing a row from csv, which is a list of columns obtained from just one line of text, to your  function, which expects a newline-delimited string of lines, so the function certainly can't find anything you expect.Since you apparently already know the topic names of each block of texts, you can instead use  to split your csv by known topic name patterns:so that the first file will have:and the second file will have:
