I am creating a new nested directory () in python:If the parent directory  did not exists (yet, 'cause I might be setting later in the code), then the code caught that as a  and moved on.However now what could also happen is  which is when the filename or extension is too long. For which I would need to take a separate action.Is there a way to distinguish between   and  (and others) so as to raise distinct ?
You could use  (inherited from OSError: [Python 3]: winerror) to differentiate between underlying errors. Something like:Of course, WindowsError 3
