I haven't found how to give type hints indication when using weakrefs.Is there a way to say that  is a  of  to , something like:?
We can find this information by consulting typeshed, a repository of type hints for the standard library and some popular 3rd party modules.Specifically, if we look at the stubs for the  module, we can see that it re-exports  from the  module. And from there, we see that  is defined to be equivalent to the  class, which is defined to be generic (and is also re-exported from ).Putting these pieces together, we can give your  variable a type hint that looks like this:Somewhat interestingly, it's also ok to do this:Basically,  is also an alias to  so we can use both types interchangeably.I would personally use , but that's mostly because I'm just so used to types starting with capital letters. (Or, if that type hint starts getting too verbose, I'd maybe define a custom type alias ).Note that the  line is available only on Python 3.7+. If you're using an older version of Python, you'll need to make your type hints be strings manually:
