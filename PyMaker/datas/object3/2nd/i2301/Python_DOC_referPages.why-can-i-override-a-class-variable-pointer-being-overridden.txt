This question already has an answer here:python class instance variables and class variables                    4 answers                I have this bit of code: Which outputs: Here "wheels" is defined as a class variable. Class variables are shared by all objects. However I can change its value for a SPECIFIC instance of that class?Now I know to modify the class variable I need to use the class name: I'm still confused as to how/why this happens. Am I creating an instance variable or am I overwriting the class variable for that instance using: -- Or something else?
You are right, you do not override the class attribute , but create an instance attribute named  for the object  and set it to 3.This can be verified using the special  attribute:
