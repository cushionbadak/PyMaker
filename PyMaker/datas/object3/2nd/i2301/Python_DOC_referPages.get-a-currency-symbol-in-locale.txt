How to get the correspondent currency symbol by a given currency alpha-3 code name using locale in python?I am doing:But I am getting problem with the locale names:locale.Error: unsupported locale setting
The documentation of  says that if given a locale argument, it should either be the name of the locale or an iterable containing both parts of the alias.So either change the line that fetches the locales to: or change the line that sets it to:(but don't do both of course :) )The first approach is better, the second might need more refinement to work with all locale aliases.More info in the documentation
