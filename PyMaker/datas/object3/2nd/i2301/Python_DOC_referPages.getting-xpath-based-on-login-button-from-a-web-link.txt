I am trying to run Selenium using python, and I was successful in starting the browser and entering user name and password, but I was not able to run xpath for login button. I am getting this error message  HTML of Login Button (It would be helpful to know any efficient way of identifying elements) : 
If you've defined somewhere dictionary  you should check whether it really looks like:UpdateNote that you've defined Submit button with  key while trying to get its value with  key
The  in python generally occurs when your key is not found. You sure 'loginButton' is in set of existing keys?From official python libraries, exception KeyErrorRaised when a mapping (dictionary) key is not found in the set of  existing keys.Please see this link.
