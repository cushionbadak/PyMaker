I am writing a script to connect to a bunch of cisco routers and run commands on them, hosts and commands are put into a text file and then read from the script. Below is the code i got, when i don't use the pool.map everything works good, but when trying to use the pool.map to spawn more process, i keep getting errors.UPDATE: After updating code i am now getting this errorUPDATE: used map instead of pool.map and below is the stack trace
