How to merge a tuple with the same keyand turn them into
The most performant approach is to use a  dictionary to store data as an expanding list, then convert back to tuple/list if needed:result:note that the converted data is probably better left as dictionary. Converting to list again loses the "key" feature of the dictionary.On the other hand, if you want to retain the order of the "keys" of the original list of tuples, unless you're using python 3.6/3.7, you'd have to create a list with the original "keys" (ordered, unique), then rebuild the list from the dictionary. Or use an  but then you cannot use  (or use a recipe)
You can use a dict to keep track of the indices of each key to keep the time complexity O(n): would become:
You can create a dictionary and loop through the list. If the item present in dictionary append the value to already existing list else assign the value to key.
Similarly to other answers, you can use a dictionary to associate each key with a list of values. This is implemented in the function  in the code snippet below.
