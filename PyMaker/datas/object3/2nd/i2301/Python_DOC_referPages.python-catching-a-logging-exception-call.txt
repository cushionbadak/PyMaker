I am trying to catch an exception that is not raised, just logged. Is there any way to do this?
I assume that exampleFunction is in some horrible third party code that you do not own, otherwise there are lots of better alternatives.What you can do:You can then do everything you want in the function. It's horrible and sensitive to import order, but I have used this and it works (scikit learn does something similarly repugnant..)
Question: I am trying to catch an exception  The Questions Title should be rewriten to "I am trying to reraise an exception"  Read Python Documentation#raiseSeems somewhat double work, but you can do it like that:Output:  Tested with Python:3.5.3
