I have  as str that I want to get the substring inside single quotes ():so I used:car  personBut when I try this approach:'car'  carSo, my question is why the pattern behaves differently in each case? I know that the former returns "all non-overlapping matches of pattern in string" and the latter match objects which might explain some difference but I would expect with the same pattern same results (even in different format). So, to make it more concrete:In the first case with  the pattern returns all substrings but in the latter case it only return the first substring.In the latter case  (which corresponds to the whole match according to the documentation) is different than  (which correspond to the first parenthesized subgroup). Why is that? returns match objects so it functions like .I know that there are similar question is SO like this one or this one but they don't seem to answer why (or at least I did not get it).
You already read the docs and other answers, so I will give you a hands-on explanationLet's first take this example from hereIf you go on this website you will find the correspondence with the previous detectionsgroup(0) is taking the full match, group(1) and group(2) are respectively Group 1 and Group 2 in the picture. Because as said here "Match.group([group1, ...])Returns one or more subgroups of the match. If there is a single argument, the result is a single string; if there are multiple arguments, the result is a tuple with one item per argument. Without arguments, group1 defaults to zero (the whole match is returned)"Now let's go back to your exampleAs said by others with  you will find ONLY the first occurrence of the pattern ["Scan through string looking for the first location where the regular expression pattern produces a match" as said here] and following the previous logic you will now understand why  will output the full match and  the Group 1. And you will understand why  is giving you error [because as you can see from the screenshot there is not a group 2 for the first occurrence in this last example]
 returns list of matches (in this particular example, first groups of matches), while  returnsonly first leftmost match.As stated in python documentation ():Return all non-overlapping  matches of pattern in string, as a list of strings. The string is  scanned left-to-right, and matches are returned in the order found. If  one or more groups are present in the pattern, return a list of  groups; this will be a list of tuples if the pattern has more than one  group. Empty matches are included in the result. gives you whole fragment of string that matches your pattern, that's why it have quotes, while  gives you first parenthesized substring of matching fragment, that means it will not include quotes because they are outside of parentheses. Check  docs for more information.
