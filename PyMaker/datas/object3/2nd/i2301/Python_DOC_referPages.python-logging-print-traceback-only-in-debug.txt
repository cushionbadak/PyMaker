I am currently loading the python logger like this:and using it e. g. like this:However, this will always print the traceback along with the error message:I do not want the traceback in the normal error output. Instead it should only print my error message and the exception info ("No such file...").What is the recommended way of showing the traceback only when the loglevel is set to ?
I'd use a combination of  and :This way, the exception itself () is always logged, but the stacktrace will only be logged if log level is debug.
Log the exception at  level instead and set .  is essentially a  call, but you can log exception tracebacks at any level:It's the  option that's important; from the documentation:If  does not evaluate as false, it causes exception information to be added to the logging message. If an exception tuple (in the format returned by ) or an exception instance is provided, it is used; otherwise,  is called to get the exception information.You perhaps want to use printing (to stdout or stderr) to communicate with the end-user:I included the system error message in the print output without the  representation.If you use a command-line argument parser like  or , then do use their user feedback API (which usually includes exiting too).You can make the logging module produce user-level messages too, but if you want a single logger call to produce debug-friendly tracebacks in a file and user-friendly output on a console, you'd have to configure separate handlers for these use-cases with the console handler using a custom  class to override the  method to alter how exceptions are shown. It's just much easier and clearer to separate logging and end-user communication.
