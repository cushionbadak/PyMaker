I am trying to log whatever is printed in console to a file(It should print in both console and in a file).i am using a command, that is logging the output to a file, but i am facing two problems: 1. Not printing the output on console, printing directly to a file. 2. If i am using sleep command it did not work.Can anyone help me in this with python codes.Here is my code
When you changed sys.stdout, you lost the ability to write to the console.This code does exactly what you told it to do. If I look at for_posterity.txt, it saysinside fun 1  inside fun 2  inside fun 1  inside fun 2  ...If you want a logging function which does both, you have to actually do both.However, when you get more advanced, you will want to use the logging module, which you can configure to write to as many or as few places as you want, and it can decide based on what's happening. https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html
Update - Added file.close() as without that it doesn't work in python 3
