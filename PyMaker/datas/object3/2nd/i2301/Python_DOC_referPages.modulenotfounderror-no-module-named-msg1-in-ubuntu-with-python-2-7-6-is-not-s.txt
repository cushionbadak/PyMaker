Whenever a script is launched from your terminal, It appends the current path of the file to  And Python only looks for modules which are in direct reach of this path. In your case, it appended to the path of the test.py, But, from the eyes of the Python interpreter,  is still  away from the directory of  that is because the  has directory only up to  and not up to  i.e, there is a gap in the directory chain.
