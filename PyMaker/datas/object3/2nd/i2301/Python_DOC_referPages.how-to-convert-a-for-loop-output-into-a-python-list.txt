I'm wondering how to convert them into a list of s479 000355 000269 000499 000289 000The desired result will like this [479 000,355 000,... ]. Also, I want to be able to perform basic with the values.I found this thread How to convert a for loop output into a list (python), but it didn't help me.

It looks like your string is meant to be a series of 6-digit numbers but both the individual number-parts, for lack of a better term, are split by spaces and the numbers themselves are split by newlines. The solution, therefore, is to remove the space in between number-parts, converting the result to an integer, like this:Putting this in a list-comprehension, we have:UPDATESince you've posted your code, I can give you a better answer.
