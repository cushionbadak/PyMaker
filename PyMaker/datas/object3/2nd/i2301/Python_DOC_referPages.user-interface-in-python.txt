I was looking up on how to write a (relatively) friendly user interface in Python for a program of mine, and as I understood I need a module called "curses". I tried to install it via the pip method, but the shell says that no matching distibution have been found for the specified module. Am I doing something wrong or what? Has the module been taken down for some reason? If so, how else can I write such an interface, given that I just need to make the arrow keys work for my program?Thanks in advance!
Curses is in the standard library. Just import it.If you're on Windows, you can try installing the unofficial wheel (with  where  is the name of the wheel file--download the one that matches your Python installation).Here's an example install for Python 2.7 64-bit.Here's a simple curses "hello world" to test it.Save to a file like  then run it likeI tested the above on my Windows machine, and it works fine.
