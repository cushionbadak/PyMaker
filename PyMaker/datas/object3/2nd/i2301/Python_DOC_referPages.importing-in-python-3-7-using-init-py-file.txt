You will have to specify what class you would like to import into the attribute  of your  file. See below the example:
If you want to have the class  directly accessible in  after you do , in the  file, put ., on the other hand, typically lists names of modules, like what you have above. You could change  to be as follows and your current  that consists of  will work:
From the python docs:if a packageâ€™s  code defines a list named , it is taken to be the list of module names that should be imported when  is encountered.This means that your  has just imported the  module into it's namespace, not the  class. Therefore this would work.
You missed one step there.Try:Or try:
 just controls what will be exported by using  in current scope.In your case,  is not in your 's scope. So it is meaningless.To solve this problem, you need to import  into 's scope, that's all.I understand that you think just by using , you can directly access the class in , but that's not true.  does nothing else but control exports in current scope.
