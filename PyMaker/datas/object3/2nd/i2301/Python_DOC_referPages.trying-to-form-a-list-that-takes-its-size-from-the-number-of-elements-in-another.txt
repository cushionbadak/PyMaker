I have been trying to form a list based on this criteria and I keep getting this error message for specifically this line below:TypeError: 'float' object cannot be interpreted as an integerThe part of the program that is causing the problems is that part above and if I can fix it I can take the error and apply it to the rest.Here is an example list that is used to fill the other three it has 20 elements and I want each list that I form to take from this list about 1/3 of its elements from different positions:And I want this code to form 3 new lists containing in for example
You cannot use float for the range() function.See: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#range(len(randnum))/3that's float!possible fix :OKAY, perhaps your should try  random With repetitionSample OutputX:  [7, 3, 18, 15, 19, 1]Y :  [6, 13, 17, 4, 14, 5]Z: [19, 2, 8, 18, 13, 17]Without repetitionSample Output[(17, 13, 15, 5, 16, 12), (14, 4, 18, 2, 19, 6), (10, 11, 7, 3, 1, 0)]
If I follow your goal, a simple approach would be to shuffle a copy of the list and then take every 3rd element starting at 0, then 1, then 2:which gives me, e.g. and you could then doif you insisted on separate named variables.(You could also simply do  to get a random permutation of the list instead, but for some reason I find this less clear than shuffling.  Not sure why.)
You could use random here but also you are going to need to make sure you don't use that random int again, my approach is append it to a  list and check that list to see if it can be used again, as far as splitting them you have  so you can use   floor division and  to help you create two lists of 7 items and one of 6 items.
