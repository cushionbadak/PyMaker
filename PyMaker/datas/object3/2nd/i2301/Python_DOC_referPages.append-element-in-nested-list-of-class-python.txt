This question already has an answer here:How to avoid having class data shared among instances?                    8 answers                this is my code:Output:Why does Basil appears in the two nested list? I didn't even affected a value in the second list! Even when I look at the pointers, everything looks good, but append keeps adding values in my other nested lists.
You are assigning  to the class, so all class instances will share the same list. You should instead assign it as an attribute of  in the  (i.e. indent 4 more spaces as ) so a new list is created for each individual class instance.
