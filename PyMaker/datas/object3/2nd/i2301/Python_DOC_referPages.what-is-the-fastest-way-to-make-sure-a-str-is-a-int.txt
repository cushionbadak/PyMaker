I'm trying to make sure a string is a int in Python 3.6, here is four ways. But I don't know which one is the fastest, or could someone give me a faster one?I tested them with , here is the result:Edit notes:After testing many times, I know this:for unsigned number,  is the fastest.for signed number, if it includesor like ,  is always slow, others depends on how to remove the sign. I'm still not sure.And the  in  is just for this
Hi an alternative could be the following one:The results on my machine are:test1: 0.798348898test2: 0.9424690370000001test3: 0.5995461930000001test4: 0.29526326800000025
I took the code and ran it a couple of times, it seems that test3 is the fastest. Even thought I cleaned up a little bit test1 and I was able to accomplish a similar speed to test3, sometimes better. Here I post your code, plus the test I added:I also compared it to the answer given before mine, I renamed his function to test5. Test4 proved to be a faster alternative. Finally, please notice that the functions are self-contained. I did this in order to run it successfully with timeit, since this is a speed test one of these functions may be picked and reverted back in order to use the parameter again. Hope this helps!
May be fastest way is to use pythonic way of checking whether it is a alphabetical string or not.isalpha will return True if a string contains only alphabetical characters. It will return False is string contains any numerical or alphanumerical charactersEDIT:
