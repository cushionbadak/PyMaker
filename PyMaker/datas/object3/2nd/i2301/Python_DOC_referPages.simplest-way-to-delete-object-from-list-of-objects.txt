I am trying to remove an item from a list. Usually pretty obvious but the problem is that those items are objects and I want to remove them by one of their attributes. Is there a more graceful way to do this than what I have below?
You can also use the built-in method . applies a  to each element of an  - if the function evaluates to , this element is in the resulting generator. If the function evaluates to  the element is skipped.The result of  is a generator, so you need to put it into a list (or use the generator result if you just need it once).Demo:Output:    
Here's a super simple way:That is, simply make a new list with the items you want.  You can assign it back to  if needed.
