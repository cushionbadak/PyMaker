I need to split a file into 2 separate arrays. What I mean is to split a  file into a username and a password arrays and then be able to call them by the same index number, to make the usernames and passwords match. So far I have :Instead of the code splitting in to 2 different variables, I want to split them into 2 different arrays.  This way I can call them by the same index number to get the user:pass combo.Thanks.
Taohidul Islam already posted a technically perfect solution, BUT: split a username:password file into a username array and a password array and then be able to call them by the same index number, to make the usernames and passwords matchThis is not the proper design. With this solution, you rely on the list staying of the same length and in the same order, which cannot be garanteed, so it's brittle at best (IOW: you can bet your ... that it WILL break). Also, to find a user and her password, you need a first sequential lookup (on the "usernames" list), then an indexed access on the second list, which is far from optimal.The correct data structure to "match" a key (here the username) with a value (here the password) is a : an unordered collection of key:value pairs with optimized key lookup (0(1) instead of 0(N) for a list), so what you really want is:
You can try this:You can read this resource to know about data structures.
Instead of a list i'd suggest a dictionnary:You could then do:
