I am writing a method to implement a bank account. It's very simple, I want the output to be the name and account type of the user. However, I am having trouble using  in my main class.OutputSo this is the desired output, but this only works when I hard-code the account type in the  method (). To clarify, I mean this line:Is there a way to do this such that if I enter  into the  parameter for accountType , it returns
This is just a guess because I'm still unsure about exactly what you're asking.Output:This way you don't have to hardcode anything or create the  attribute since it's no longer needed.
You can apply the same thing you do to the hard-coded 1 in  to  in :Even though you can now get rid of  and use , I would recommend not using the integer value in the initialization to begin with:This is much clearer than using a magic number. The update to  will accept both the enums and their values.
