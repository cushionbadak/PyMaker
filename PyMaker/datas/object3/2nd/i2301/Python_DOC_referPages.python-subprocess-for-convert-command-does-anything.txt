I have a function to convert a pdf file to a thumbnail after upload.But the subprocess command doesn't return anything. I tried to type it in a terminal but I got a subprocess-error-returned-non-zero-exit-status-1.I got no thumbnail generated. 
I think the reason you're struggling here is that you're throwing away your error message.The communicate method returns a tuple with two elements,  and . The code above (namely ) is taking the first element (stdin) but ignoring stderr.So I would suggest modifying your code to do the following;Once you've done this, if the process fails, you can print  and work out why the process failed.
