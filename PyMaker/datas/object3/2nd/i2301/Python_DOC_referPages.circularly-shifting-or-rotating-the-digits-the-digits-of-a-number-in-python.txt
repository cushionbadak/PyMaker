Suppose I have the following input:How can I get the following output?This is obtained by circularly shifting (or rotating) the digits of the input twice.I have tried the following code:but it is not producing the results I was expecting.
The  operator does a binary bitshift.It moves the binary representation of  on place to the right, discarding the rightmost (least significant) bit.Therefore you code does not result in .You probably want string rotation instead:You can also convert it back to an integer afterwards
I would convert to string to be able to slice it.
Here's the lazy man's version:
If you must stick with numbers (though I'd go with the string option first)and all together in a function
