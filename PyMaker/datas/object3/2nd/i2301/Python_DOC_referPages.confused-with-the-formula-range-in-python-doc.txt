I am studying the python range function according to the formula of the documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#range), but it does not work for certain ranges, for positive steps if it works for me, but for negative steps no.python doc says:For a negative step, the contents of the range are still determined by the formula:,but the constraints are:so,I'm tryng to use the formula to calculate So, if you note, doesn't work for the first step, because the condition is  this range should result = What I'm  doing bad?
Let's look at finding the first step for Range function's documentation: So you have , , and .In the formula ,  is always counting from 0. So the first element, .The constraints hold.  because  is 0, and , which is greater than  ().
