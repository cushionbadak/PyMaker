Say I have two lists:Now I want to create  and  by selecting 3 random indices (without replacement), while maintaining the relation between the values of  and .For example,Randomly selected indices: Therefore,Is there a method to do this without writing a for-loop which iterates 3 times to select the random indices?
You can  the lists, then pick 3 random pairs with , and finally split the pairs into separate lists again:This is what happens step by step:
Python has a sample function that does selection without replacment. You can sample from the indices and apply the sample to your inputs.
You can use:
I think I like the zip answer best but I would take this approach using list comprehension
You cannot avoid looping though you can delegate it to a function or dress it up as a list comprehension.You can loop over each list once, though.
