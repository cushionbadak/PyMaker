In a Linux directory, I have several numbered files, such as "day1" and "day2". My goal is to write a code that retrieves the number from the files and add 1 to the file that has the biggest number and create a new file. So, for example, if there are files, 'day1', 'day2' and 'day3', the code should read the list of files and add 'day4'. To do so, at least I need to know how to retrieve the numbers on the file name.
I'd use  to get all the file names, remove the "day" prefix, convert the remaining characters to integers, and take the maximum.From there, it's just a matter of incrementing the number and appending it to the same prefix:
Get all files with the  module/package (don't have the exact command handy) and then use (package) to get the numbers. If you don't want to look into regex you could remove the letters  from your string with  and convert that string with .
Glob would be good for this. It is kind of regex, but specially for file search and simpler. Basically you just use * as a wildcard, and you can select numbers too. Just google what it exactly is. It can be pretty powerful and is native to the bash shell for example. You can also see that I use pathlib here. This is a library to deal with the file system in an OOP manner. Some people like, some don't. So, a little disclaimer: Glob is not as powerful as regex. Here  for example won't be matched, but  would still be matched. You can also try , but then  would still be matched.  Off course you can also use  if you know you stay below double digits. So, if your use case requires this, you can use glob and filter down with regex.
