I'm new with oop and python. I've been trying to do a simple thing:there is class called Foo(),it contains a variable called x which is initially set to zero.now I want to give a new value to x so:now a math operation should happen to x, for instance 1 is add to x.now x is 1984,so now when I call x:also the program should check that whether or not the value given to x is negative or not.If it is negative it should return -1.I did this but it didn't work:(as I said it should do some mathematical operation on x,the operation itself is not really important)I really don't now how should I update a class variable in they I mentioned.Thank you very much for your attention.
Assuming you don't need actual class attributes (you're always constructing an instance of  to use the attribute anyway, and it's not common for class attributes to be both public and logically mutable), the correct solution is to make  a  that wraps an instance attribute, which has independent values per instance, established in the  initializer for the class:Usage is pretty simple:In case it really needs to be a class attribute and it must be accessible on instances, the solution gets ugly, as you need a metaclass to provide s on classes, and additional properties on the class itself to delegate access on instances to the class itself.Note: I strongly discourage actually doing this as anything other than an exercise:That allows the following to work:
It might help. You should refactor your class definition as below    Check for negative values
