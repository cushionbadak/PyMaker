Please forget for a moment the poor implementation or why I didn't just use a dictionary, I know there are other ways to do this (such as ) but this was my test code before and now it became my quest to find out why it's not working.This all seems fine, and I initiated a test object as follows:Now the expected outcome was , but what I got was this instead:I thought I might have messed up the  method, so I checked as follow:If they're both identical, why doesn't  work?
