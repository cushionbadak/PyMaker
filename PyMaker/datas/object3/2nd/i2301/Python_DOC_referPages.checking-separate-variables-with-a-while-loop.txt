I'm trying to check 4 separate variables for the exact same strings using separate variables with similar names. An example is below. The print functions are also an example, they're not my final goal.Can anyone suggest how I could repeat this area for all of the variables?
Remove  from or 
You can use a for loop:The  part creates a tuple containing all of the four variables. The  part then repeats your desired code for each variable, with the  variable taking on the value of each different variable each time round the loop.For more on for loops, you can take a look at the official tutorial.
