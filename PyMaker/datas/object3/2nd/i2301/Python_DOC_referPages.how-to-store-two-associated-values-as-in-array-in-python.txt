I'm currently writing a bot for my discord that will have a levelling system. To do this, I have an array called "key", which stores the user IDs, and an array named "stats", which stores the user's levels.I need to somehow merge these two arrays so that upon calling a userID, it has a specific level associated with it as well.
To elaborate on the comment given by @juanpa.arrivallaga: you're looking for a "dictionary" data structure, rather than a pair of arrays. Instead ofyou want to make a dictionary, where each  is linked to the associated value in :The way to do transmute the two lists into one dictionary is:To elaborate: the function  is a built-in function that matches two same-size arrays together into a tuple:You could also use  for any number of iterable objects, and it would group them into tuples based on index. The next part of the solution is simply to typecast that to , which is what python calls dictionaries. If you pass 2-tuples to , python will automatically associate the first element (in this case, from ) as the key, and the second element (from ) as the associated value.
