I have nested list. Now, I want to convert it into dictionary.nested list always contain only two items in my case.Anyone can tell. How to optimize the above code. Thanks in advance.
It's quite a strange data structure to have a list of dictionaries like this in my opinion, but you can do it efficiently performance-wise like this:
Using  and dictionary + list comprehension:  Here,  creates an infinite iterator taking items in a cyclic manner - .  on this iterator takes value out on each iteration.
