I have this stringand expect the following output:I tried it withBut this removes all parentheses. What am I missing?
This technically gets the result you want for this example......but I doubt it would work for all cases. Impossible to be sure given you haven't shown the task you're supposed to be completing.What this does:Parens are special characters in , so matching them outside of square brackets means escaping them: , . You want to keep what's between them, though, so you use normal (unescaped) parens around the characters between them. This assumes it's just 'word characters' you want to save; you probably need something more complex than just  here.The plus sign means you'll be matching one or more word characters. in  means when the first argument, the regex, is matched, that chunk of the string will be replaced with the matched part between the first set of parens. We only have one here.The Python  module documentation explains all this in much better detail.
