I couldn't figure out how my professor got this f in the function. The program works. factors.pySecond file: isfactor.pyThird file: testfactors.py
Let's say you have a list. A simple listCool. Now, I want to print each number on that list. Now, you can access a list item in python with brackets , where  is an index number (starts with 0, so first item is 0, second is 1, etc.). so I can do this:But that would be tedious. So we can, instead, iterate. go one by one with a  loop, which looks like thisThis means that now it goes through every single item on the list, says  and then you can do something. then it loops again, now  etc. It's a temporary variable, and it makes things much simpler, right?Now range is a built in function in python that creates a list of numbers from x to y, i.e. range(1, 10) will result in the list *So when you see  you know that now starts a loop, where each time the loop passes, f will be equal to 2, then 3, then 4... up until , which is a variable the function  recieves.Makes more sense now?*p.s. it's not exactly a list. In Python 3.x it became it's own type, I'm not getting into it, but you can read more here
Consider the following loop:Input:Output:When you call , you are actually creating a variable f and setting it to 2, running the loop, then setting f to 3, running the loop, etc. until you get to n (then the iteration stops).
