I´m using scrapy to crawl some information, but im stunned with the handle of the data. At  loop, first step is locate a "root" xpath called , then is looped. My mind says, if is the first selector, is the first selector of , then I can crawl all the data of the first selector! Instead, scrapy returns an array of all elements. I´m using selector varible as 'THIS' For example, on the first loop I expectInstead, I recived in the first loopAll the loops the same data, is not respecting current selector?WHY?I can´t make a relation between arrays because sometimes the selector has not name and/or phone and Scrapy doesnt return None or null or empty.How can I solve it?
