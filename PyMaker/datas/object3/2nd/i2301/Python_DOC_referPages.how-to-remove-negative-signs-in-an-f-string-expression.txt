Trying to make a random number generator that asks the user for a number and compare it with the generated one. How do I make it so that the compared number will not show a negative number?Let's say the number randomly generated is 63, and the user inputs 25. When the program runs, it would say You were -38 away! How would I remove the negative sign to make it say You were 38 away?
You'd do this in f strings the same way you'd do it in any other context: by calling , the absolute value function.
