I was given an assignment in university to write a program that will create user's password using their name and surname( ex: name = 'John', surname = 'Smith' => password will be 'JSomhinth', but I get “IndexError: string index out of range” mistake.
You could use  with  handling the unequal length case.Using a list-comprehension:Or using :
The issue is here:every time you go through the outer loop you will hit the inner loop on surname and increment .Since surname is shorter than name, eventually  will reach (len(name)+len(surname))/2 -1 which will make  call throw out of bounds exception if name is at least 2 chars longer than surname.In unrelated note, there is no need for inner loops, since every time they will only run once, increment global var and break, so the following code would work tooAustin's answer is the cleanest way to go about this problem though.
