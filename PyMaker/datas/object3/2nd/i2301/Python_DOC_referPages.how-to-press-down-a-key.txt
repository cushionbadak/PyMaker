Been using the pyautogui module to do most of my things, but I have come across one problem:I cannot hold down a key for a certain length of time.Does anyone know any modules that can do this, or have a solution without downloading any modules?For example (perfect for me):I go into word, and run my code. Word should just be receiving (w pressed down), with the w's slowly increasing - (after a while holding adds like 5 a half sec). 
You can use the following example:In your case you'd use the  function and a timer or equivelent to trigger .You can find more information in regards to using timers here or better yet use Timer from the threading library - especially if you want to the processing to continue.Example of using  below.In the  documentation one can note the following:NOTE: For some reason, this does not seem to cause key repeats like  would happen if a keyboard key was held down on a text field.An alternative to using the  function is to repeat the  function; in cases where  is not satisfying the behaviour required by the developer and/or user. orThe above code is not tested.
