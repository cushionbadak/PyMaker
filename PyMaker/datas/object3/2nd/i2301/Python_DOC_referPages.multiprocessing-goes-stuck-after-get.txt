Natural Text
I'm trying to understand how  works in python and having some issues.This is the example:When  function is called, the code is just stuck. What am I doing wrong?
You need to add these 2 lines inside  so now your code must look like If this is being called as an import, it will cause an infinite sequence of new processes. And adding them inside the  block works because  statement won't execute during import.
i do not have enough details to know exactly what is the problem.but i have real strong guess that putting those lines:inside a function will fix your problem.try this:tell me if it worked :)
