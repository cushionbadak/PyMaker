Which method or checking conditions is more suggested to use:Would method 3 still break The Zen of Python ("Errors should never pass silently." if there was some logging?
Method 3 is, in general, superior. The other methods introduce a race condition, where another process could create the directory after you test for its existence but before you actually try to create it.As pointed out in a comment, the  option does this for you, by simply not raising an exception if the exception is caused by a pre-existing directory (while still raising an exception for other errors).
