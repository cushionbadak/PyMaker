I'm using Spotipy for getting all the albums from an artist.I have the following Python dictionary object for each query (one per artist queried):I have the following line of code that adds all items object to the list:The problem is that I only need two of the endless keys that that returns; I only need the album title and release date. The output I would like to have is a list:
Rather than add the  list (which only contains a single album, if I understand your  query correctly), add a new dictionary with the specific values.To avoid having to call the Spotify API twice for those two items, put your query loop into a generator expression; that makes it easier to then take the resulting album dictionary and take out specific keys:Here,  is a lazily evaluating sequence of  dictionaries; these are all the albums in the  list for each artist queried. There is only 1 for each artist here, but on the off-chance there might be zero albums, or you wanted to raise the  value, I make sure to loop over the items.The generator expression in  then creates a new list object with two of the keys for each of those results.
