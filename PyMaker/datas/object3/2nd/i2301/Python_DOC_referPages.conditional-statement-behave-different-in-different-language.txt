This question already has an answer here:Chaining multiple greater than/less than operators                    6 answers                Python comparison operators chaining/grouping left to right?                    1 answer                zero is greater than or equal to zero evaluates to false                    1 answer                In C programming, the following code block return FalseBut in Python, the following block return True.Edit: Found a solution from link, it explain very well in python perspective. And in C programming perspective this answer explain my question very well.
They behave differently because that's how the languages are implemented.With C,  is evaluated left to right. There is no concept of "operator chaining" (I'll get to this shortly), so the expression is evaluated as  which is  which is  (in C, logical expressions either return 1 or 0).In python, OTOH,  evaluates to  (as specified in the documentation on comparisons), which turns out to be  in this case.
