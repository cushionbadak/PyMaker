Natural Text
I have a simple use case. I want to read a text file into a pandas file and iterate through the unique id s to plot a x-y graph.Worked for me fine at many other projects but now i get the . At first I got that is why I changed the type of id to int (see code). But that does not work either. I do not see why. Any ideas?
IMHO, your code reduces toExplanation:I'll step through the code step by step:can be deleted you don't need to open a file before you open it in a -blockBut if you open it this  way, do not forget to close it after you don't need it anymore.can be deleted1. weird usage of data10, data11 (it will not work) and StringIO (way too complicated)2. see next code lineOK if you replace  simply by , pandas is very powerful at importing files of different flavours...OK if your file doesn't have already it's own header which would fit your needs, which I'd recommend to check perhaps ...can be deleted  because your error has nothing to do with that, as I stated in my comment yesterdaycan be deleted  if you want unique values of a column in pandas, use , but you don't need to do everything manually here, as for the target you want to achieve there is :This returns a groupby-object, which indeed provides you with groupname and group data when you iterate over it, so your loop with two variables would work here:  and to be complete: your extracan be deleted, too, because this is also included in the idea behind grouping. (And btw, you didn't even use it in your code...)In the end I'd recommend you to read the very basics of Python and pandas, especially file io https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files and pandas grouping https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/groupby.html
