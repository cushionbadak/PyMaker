In the code below:When we are using ^ metacharacter and matching pattern then any whitespace character at the beginning as given below doesn't give a match even if the 'pos' argument is equal to 2, and the reason being given was that the  metacharacter ^ couldn't be matched in such cases( < is at position 2, and it cannot be matched with ^).But, when we are using $ at the end of regular expression and giving the 'end' argument there is a match? Why the difference?
You'd have to dig a little into the docs, but the answer lies there. You will find the following information in the docs for , the same description applies to  as well.The optional second parameter pos gives an index in the string where  the search is to start; it defaults to 0. This is not completely  equivalent to slicing the string; the  pattern character matches at  the real beginning of the string and at positions just after a  newline, but not necessarily at the index where the search is to  start.So, this means the SOL anchor  will match from the true beginning of the string (and not from the position dictated by . OTOH,The optional parameter endpos limits how far the string will be  searched; it will be as if the string is endpos characters long, so  only the characters from  to  will be searched for a  match.Emphasis mine. Meaning that a pattern with the EOL anchor  will actually match upto  only (unlike ).
