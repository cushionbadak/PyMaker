you do  if you want to differentiate your  based on the  you are getting. Here, you catch a  if you expect an , but get a  for example.But you can just keep it generic if you want by doing .As pointed out in Maor Refaeli's comment, you can name your exception  if you like.you can read more about python exceptions on this link right here.
You need to catch that Exception First. So here you need to catch the exception  and you can write the error return message to the variable .Which is what this code does. Or if you donot want to catch a specific Exception you could just.
You can print or return the Value error as below:OR
