Let me explain with a quick bit of code.Code:How could I make it so instead of doing:it automatically accepts, ,  or  without needing to do  so much?
You can use  to achieve this:
First of all, you shouldn't be applying  to the right hand side, which is a constant and already lowercase. You should be applying it to the variable input:There are a number of ways to check for the match you are looking for. The easiest is to use :Another way would be to explicitly check for containment in a set or tuple:This is only necessary for cases that don't fit into a simple method check, like if you wanted to add  to the list of options.If you wanted to have multiple function checks, you could use  with a generator expression:All of the tests here are properly short circuiting, just like your original expression. 
This will case-insensitively match exactly , , and :
You can just pick the first character of the input to compare with 'y'. Also note that you need to make the input lowercase. So the code becomes:
