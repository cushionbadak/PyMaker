I always use  in my Python programs.What is the type (from ) for immutable objects, the ones that could be used for a dictionary key?To put back into context, I want to write a class inherited from dictionary and I have the following codeType hints in that case are pretty useless, isn't it?Thanks
The keys of a  are hashable (see the first sentence of the docs on ), and the hashable type is , an alias for .
 refers to any type that can serve as a valid key in a  or value in a . It doesn't require true immutability (any object can define ), but in general, hashable things should be things that are "treated as immutable", since it will break things should they be mutated after insertion into a  or after being inserted as a  key.
