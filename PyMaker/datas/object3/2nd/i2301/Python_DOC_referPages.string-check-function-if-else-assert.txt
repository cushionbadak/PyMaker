Beginner here. My code should be able to check that a given number is in the form xxx-xx-xxxx. The if statement is wrong somewhere I think. Any tips welcome thank you.Error message:
The error message is telling you that you are trying to subscript the type "int". Based on what I infer you are wanting to do, slice (subscript) you variable "a", and then verify that the slice is an integer (int) which, in it's simplest for could be something like . However, this technique has some major flaws. If any of the slices can't be converted to an type "int", python will throw . You could improve this a little using a "try" "except" block:but this is pretty cumbersome, and should you ever need to evaluate something more complicated it can get really cumbersome and lot of lines of code to evaluate properly.A more concise way to validate the expression would be to use a regular expression. Regular expressions are a very concise, and a consolidated way to check values, match format, and value type (int or string only).Also, the argument value(s) your are trying to pass into your checkit function would be misinterpreted by python as a mathematical expression. You need to surround your argument values with single-quotes or double-quotes.Here is one possible way to check your desired format and value type ((Note: this example is a little contrived in order to see the assert statement in action if the assertion fails)):If you don't really need the assert statement, this could be an even shorter way of validating the values:To learn more, and get a better understanding about regular expressions, follow this link about regexpThis website might be helpful also PyRegexBy the way, to parse and validate the string as closely to the method you used in your example, you could do something like this:
