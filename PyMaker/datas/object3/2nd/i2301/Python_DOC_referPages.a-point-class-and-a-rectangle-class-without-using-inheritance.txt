I am trying to create a point class that has the data attribute of floating point values 'x' and 'y' to therefore define a location of a point in 2D space. Additionally I want to have methods of init such as it being an initialization of default values x = 0 and y = 0. And then a move function which accepts the 'x' and 'y' as a new location of the point. And finally a function which tells the distance to a point. I want this to return the Euclidian distance from this point to another point at x, y.  How would this be done?Here is the code I have so far for the above description:Could use help on this and the Eucliean distance from this point to another point at x,y. Not sure if I have the right idea so far. New to python so don't know how to test the functionality of this code. Would appreciate the help!After that part I'd to be able to define two points at two opposite corners of a rectangle and use the Points defined above without using inheritance. Any ideas on how to create this class?
You could do something like this (comments in the code):example:tests:output:And the Rectangle class could be like this:  [edited to add default  values]In , the min and max values of the x and y values of the  provided as parameters are sorted in order to determine the top left and bottom right points defining the rectangle tests:output:[Edit:] with default values for Points in Rectangle:output:
