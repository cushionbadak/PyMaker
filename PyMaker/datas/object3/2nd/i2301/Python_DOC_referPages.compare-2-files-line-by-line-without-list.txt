For this project, I want to compare two lines from separate files, character by character in Python. I can't get the program to return or print anything.  The program needs to do the following:Read the next line from each file Determine if the lines are different lengthsIf the lines are the same length compare charactersIf they match don't do anything. However, if they do match print unmatched characters(1); print line number using N: M format(2); Process next line(3).At the end print out the number of characters in the first file(1);the number of characters in the second file(2);the number of characters that do not match in lines of the same length(3);the number of lines that are not the same length(4).I believe I have all this down, however, my code never returns any values. It always ends with exit code 0 (I have referenced 2 text files to compare).For context here is all the code I have written
Your function  doesn't seem to return a base case. For example, in the place where you log that extra lines are not matching, try returning  or , or what have you.
