I'm a noob in python.  Currently, I have a list of workbook names that I am passing through the load_workbook function.  However, I have a bunch of if statements that depends on the workbook.  So I need to parse their names or find another way to do checks with the workbooks.  Heres my code:
This first part is not very pythonic indeed. In Python, you don't need indices to loop over a list. A  in Python acts as a foreach in most other languages, so this can be made shorter into Another way to improve this would be to replace all the  statements with a dict or namedtuples. If it's only the cell that changes you can easily do this with a dictMore parameters per workbookWhen you have more parameters per workbook, as for example the worksheetname, you can do that in a few waysnamedtupleIf it is a fixed number of parameters which will not change, a namedtuple is a very convenient structure:dict of dictthis works approximately the same, only this is more generic. It uses the  method which takes a default argument when the key is missing in the dictClassyou could make a MyWorkbookClass to keep the information of each workbook, but this might be overkill. A acts as a kind of mini-class with fixed members
I haven't worked with that module, but here's an alternate approach with what I do know:Assuming that your workbooks are in the same folder, you might be able to use the  module to grab a list of your filenames. Something like the following:You can then parse  and open the desired workbook by its name using the  module. Granted, indices are given differently with the functions in this module.
