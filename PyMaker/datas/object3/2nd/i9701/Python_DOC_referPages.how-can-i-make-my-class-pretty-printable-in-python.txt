Python has a pretty printer (). I would like to make my classes pretty printable. Will pretty print print my instances in a better way, if I provide a certain interface?The Python documentation in section 8.11 shows different examples, but no example how to make a user defined class pretty printable.So what interface need my classes to provide?Is there any other (maybe better) formatter?Use Case:I want to pretty print the content of ConfigParser, for which I have create an extended version called ExtendenConfigParser. So I have the possibility to add more functionality or add a matching pretty print interface.
 does not look for any hooks. The  uses a dispatch pattern instead; a series of methods on the class that are keyed on  references.You can subclass  to teach it about your class:then use the class directly to pretty print data containing  instances.  Note that this is contingent on the type having their own custom  method!You can also plug functions directly into the  dictionary;  is passed in explicitly. This is probably the better option for a 3rd-party library:See the  module source code for how the other dispatch methods are written.As always, single-underscore names like  are internal implementation details that can be altered in a future version. However, it is the best option you have here.
