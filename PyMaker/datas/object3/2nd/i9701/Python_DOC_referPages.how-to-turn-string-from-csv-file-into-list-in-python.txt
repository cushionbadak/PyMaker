I have a CSV file that contains matrix:I want to create a function that returns list of lists:this is my attempt:but I get list of lists with one string:how can i turn the lists of strings to lists of floats?
This line just takes the line as a single string and makes it into a one element list. If you want to separate it by commas, instead do:If you want to also turn them into numbers, you'll have to do:
I find it easier to read a list comprehension than a for loop.The above function opens a file (I use  to avoid leaking open file descriptors), iterates over the lines, splits each line, and converts each item into a floating-point number.
TryIf any object in mat_line isn't an integer, you will come up with an error, so I suggest you create a validation method to be absolutely sure that it is an integer.
