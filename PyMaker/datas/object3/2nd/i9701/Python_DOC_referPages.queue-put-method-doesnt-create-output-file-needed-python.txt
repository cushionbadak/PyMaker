I am writing a simple caesar cipher program in python using threads and queues. Even though my program is able to run, it doesn't create the necessary output file. Would appreciate any help, thanks! I am guessing the anomaly starts where I use the queues to store ciphered strings, here:Here is the whole code:
 can never be , as  is a method, and as such will always be  in a boolean context, therefore  will always be , you need to call the method: . Same for .Also, you should'n try to detect wheather the queue is full in this case. If it ever would be not full, then you would continut to add data until it was and then ignore the rest, or your  can increase beyond the size of  and you would continue to add 0-length data chunks.You should use a separate thread for writing to  and for reading from , then you can just let  block on .Also, you're using the same lock in your worker threads to basically serialize all computations, which defeats the purpose of threading. The problem you're dealing with is CPU bound, for which multithreading isn't going to give you any speedup in python. Have a look at the  module. Using  (or some other of the map-methods) the whole program could be simplified dramatically and give you a speed up through mutliprocessig at the same time.
