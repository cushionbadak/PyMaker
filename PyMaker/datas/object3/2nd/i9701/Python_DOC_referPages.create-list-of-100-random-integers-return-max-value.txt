Write a Python function that will take a the list of 100 random integers between 0 and 1000 and return the maximum value. (Note: there is a builtin function named max but pretend you cannot use it.)Here's what I tried:As you can see, what I'm confused about is how to correctly use the sort and pop methods to return the max value within the max function. I'm currently getting:Which is this line: Not sure how to correct this. Thanks. 
 sorts the list itself. If you want to store your sorted list in , you should use:You can also use a list comprehension to generate your first list as follows:Now, your function can be:If you still want to use the same list, you can do:Note that: I prefer to call the list  because  is a python keyword.
1) Your indentation was off2) You managed to overwrite 2 Python builtins in 4 lines of code ( and ))3)  does not return a list. It operates in place sorting the list in-place. On the contrary,  does return a list so you can either do  or .4) Your  was just wrong.See the code below:Other interesting answers (hats off to @Rob) that feature a bit of cockiness:or
I usually try to avoid using names that are have a predefined function / built-in names, this helps to avoid problems quite often. Like this it should work.
