I asked a question about a list comprehension couple days ago:Elegant way to delete items in a list which do not has substrings that appear in another listAnyway, I got a great answer to my question. It is a list comprehension:I get the idea and applied it to my work. But I'm not sure if I get the  part right. It looks like a generator expression to me but I'm not sure. I think it is better to ask this question in another post.So is it a generator expression or something else?
Yes,  is a call containing a generator expression. Generator expressions that are the only argument passed to a call can omit the parentheses. Here, that's the  function being called.From the Generator expressions reference documentation:The parentheses can be omitted on calls with only one argument.The  function (as well as the companion function  is often given a generator expression, as this allows for lazy evaluation of a series of tests. Only enough  tests are executed to determine the outcome; if there is any  test that is false,  returns early and no further tests are executed.
Let python tell you what it is:
