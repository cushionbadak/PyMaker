Natural Text
I'm trying to write to file the commit hash via Python. So I did:  But this wrote the following to file:I would like just:How may I do that?
That's just a  string. All you need to do is  it before writing it: was called to remove the trailing , you can alternatively do  if you prefer that.Also, as @torek notes, it is best to open files using the  statement which automatically closes it for you.So:
In Python 3,  returns  objects, not  strings:By default, this function will return the data as encoded bytes. The actual encoding of the output data may depend on the command being invoked, so the decoding to text will often need to be handled at the application level.However, if you're confident you'll be getting data in your platform's default encoding (safe enough, here), you can set the parameter  to :If  is , these file objects will be opened as text streams in universal newlines mode using the encoding returned by .This will also handle common whitespace annoyances like end-of-line characters (as the name implies).Here's a function that returns Git's output as a string, using :And here is an example of writing that string to a file:This uses the  syntax that was suggested in comments, and also in The Python Tutorial.  It's (unfortunately) well-hidden, appearing at the end of section 7.2.1. Methods of File Objects.
