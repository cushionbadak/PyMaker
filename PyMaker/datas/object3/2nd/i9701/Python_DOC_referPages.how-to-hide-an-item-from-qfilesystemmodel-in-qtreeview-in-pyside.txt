I cannot figure out how to hide an item or a row from ?After using  nothing happens. I've also tried With no result. How can I do it?
QFileSystemModel doesnt follow the conventional functions for removing items, I guess because it is so potentially destructive.you need to call  for each one. This will permanently delete the files. You also need to call  if it happens to be a folder.see http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qfilesystemmodel.html#removeIf you are just trying to hide the rows, then you can add a list of filters e.g. ["*.cpp", "*.h"] via QFileSystem.setNameFilters, which uses QDir::setNameFIlters. If you are doing something more specialised, then you can use . Either use it directly with a QRegExp, or subclass and implement 
As an aside: You're never supposed to call the  and  methods as the user of a model. The model itself is supposed to invoke those.This is an error in the PySide wrapper's API design. In C++, those methods are protected. Python has no concept of a protected method per se, and the implementers of PySide evidently chose to expose protected methods using unadorned names in spite of Python conventions. In Python, it might be conventional to prefix protected methods with a single underscore . The private methods use a double underscore , but that wouldn't matter since they wouldn't propagate into they Pythonic API from C++.
