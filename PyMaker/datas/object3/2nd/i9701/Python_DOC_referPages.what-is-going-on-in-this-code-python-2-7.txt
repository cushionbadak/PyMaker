I received an assignment where I had to find the sum of all prime numbers up to 2 million and the code I wrote originally took way too long to run so the teacher gave me this algorithm to check if the number is prime. However, I don't quite seem to get what's going on in the return all statement and what it has to do with prime numbers
Since I was not nice to you. Let me just make a little extra effort and explain it you.First read this:http://wiki.planetmath.org/howtofindwhetheragivennumberisprimeornotLet's see whats happening here.Step1. Check if the number is divisible by 2 and also greater than 2. If these condition fail then the number is not prime. Don't proceed any further and return false.Step2a. Calculate the square root of the number (it might be float so we convert it into int) and then add 1 to it.Step2b. Create a list starting from 3 to the value calculated in step2a with a step size of 2. So basically it will get all the odd numbers from 3 to step2a value. Why just odd? Because evens are not prime!Step2c. In this step we are iterating over the list created in 2b and dividing n by all of those numbers (by dividing here i mean taking modulus) and we are storing the results in an iterator object.Step2d. If n was divisible by any number of list from 2b, then a 0 will be stored on . And we know that a prime number is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. If we get a  then we are done, it's not a prime number.all() will return true only if all the values are non zero.Eg. I hope, now it's clear to you.
