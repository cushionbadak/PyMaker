I need the settings in the parent to contain the functions from the child.  (Every child of this parent will use that settings, but the way the functions are defined will change)Is this possible? Currently it appears to read in the undefined functions from the parent class (and thus breaks)
From the docsa metaclass derived from ABCMeta cannot be instantiated unless all of  its abstract methods and properties are overridden.I changed how you created the base class to  and received the errorSo that makes the problem more explicit. To fix the problem, just have the child classes create their own  property. Now they are bound to the concrete methods instead of the abstract methods.UPDATEThis isn't just an ABC issue. You have this problem with any subclass that overrides a property method. Here, I try to override a getter but find that I still get the parent's view:UPDATE 2The problem is that  binds the class method when it is defined. If you don't mind implementing intermediate functions, then you can let them resolve the target method at runtime after the child has overriden them. Here,  calls  at runtime and you get the child version.
