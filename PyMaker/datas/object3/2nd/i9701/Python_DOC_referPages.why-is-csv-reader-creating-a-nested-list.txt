Started learning python after lots of ruby experience. With that context in mind:I have a csv file that looks something like this:city_names.csvWith the following python script I'd like to read this into a list:city_names_reader.pyThe result surprised me:    Any idea why I'm getting a nested list rather than a 4-element list? I must be overlooking something self-evident.
A CSV file represents a table of data. A table contains both columns and rows, like a spreadsheet. Each line in a CSV file is one row in the table. One row contains multiple columns, separated by When you read a CSV file you get a list of rows. Each row is a list of columns.If your file have only one row you can easily just read that row from the list:Usually each column represent some kind of data (think "column of email addresses"). Each row then represent a different object (think "one object per row, each row can have one email address"). You add more objects to the table by adding more rows.It is not common with wide tables. Wide tables are those that grow by adding more columns instead of rows. In your case you have only one kind of data: city names. So you should have one column ("name"), with one row per city. To get city names from your file you could then read the first element from each row:In both cases you can flatten the list by using itertools.chain:
As others suggest, your file is not an idiomatic CSV file. You can simply do:
