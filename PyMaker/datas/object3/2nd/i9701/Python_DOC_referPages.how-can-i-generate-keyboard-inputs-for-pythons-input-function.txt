I have a console program written in Python. I would like to test several input combinations in an automatic test routine. The input is read via Pythons  function.How can I emulate a keyboard or any other input stream to send single characters or strings to ?Or do I need to replace input by another function, which is connected to my test cases?
You can use  to patch the output of a function (including streams).
If that is just a test case and not a "real part of big system" - meaning that you just need to pass a certain input to your command line executable ones (e.g. run test) and you are using Unix, one convenient way of doing this is using pipes:then via console:    on Windows syntax is little different - should be something likeOne other hacky-simple way to achieve same thing is to replace  with a custom stream object:One should consider using @erip 's answer if that is something bigger than a automatisation routine or testing students' home assignments against fixed set of tests, though.
