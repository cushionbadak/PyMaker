I know that java and python handle bytes differently so I am a little bit confused about how to convert byte[] to python stringI have this byte[] in java  I want to convert it to python string here is how i did  itBut I am not really sure if this is the correct way to do it.
The Java  type is a signed integer; the value ranges between -128 and 127. Python's  expects a value between 0 and 255 instead. From the Primitive Data Types section of the Java tutorial:byte: The byte data type is an 8-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -128 and a maximum value of 127 (inclusive). You need to convert from 2s compliment to an unsigned integer:However, if this is Python 3, you really want to use the  type:
String concatenation is highly inefficient.I'd recommend to do that in a generator comprehension passed to  using an empty separator:edit: the  bit is weird. It does what's requested, but nothing useful since  is signed. So you'd need two's complement as in Martijn answer that fixes the next OP problem: data validity :)It would be okay if you had some list of ASCII values in a table (and dropping  allows us to use , it's so rare to be able to use it let's not deprive us from doing so :)result:
Assuming you're using Python 3, bytes can already be initialized from a list. You'll need to convert the signed integers to unsigned bytes first.If the bytes represent text, decode it afterwards. In your example, they do not represent text encoded to UTF-8, so this would fail.
