Natural Text
So I have a csv file of arbitrary amount of columns and rows (fully rectangular so no missing cells) of which I want to turn into a dictionary.I want to have a dictionary that will follow this patternWhat I'm doing right now is reading each line. If I'm reading the first line each element becomes a key in the dictionary and maps to an empty list. Then I continue reading each line but here's where I run into the problem. I don't know how I assign the elements of each line to it's correct key (as dictionaries are random), that's assuming I know how to make generate a list of values that I can properly assign in the first place (for example, how can i make 1 go to key1, 2 go to key2 and 3 go to key3). I want to do this all without imports. Let me know what you guys think. 
 is the first row of headings.The  breaks the words into the field names gets the lines after the header row splits the row into field values converts the string entry "1" into the number 1 transposes the list of rows makes a list of key/value pairs makes the dictionarySee references at:int() documentationzip() documentationdict() documentationstr.split() documentationTutorial coverage of string slicing
