I have a csv which I am loading into a pandas dataframe.  I want to change a specific column to lose leading zeros from the month and date, and seperates the hour into another column.  For example, I have a column, called DateTime comes in like "03/17 04:00:00" or "01/01 15:00:00"  and I would like to change the column (and also I guess to concatenate 2010 to the end of the date) to a "Date" Column with "3/17/2010" and a "Time" Column with "4:00:00" or like the second example, a "Date" column with "1/1/2010" and a "time" column with "15:00:00".  I'm pretty sure I would like to do this with regex_replace, I think that would be easiest?
Keep in mind that this assumes your data is all formatted the same:
You can use  with :Similar solution with  by regex  (first  in string):Timings:Code for timings:
The  module has what you need with . You should save regex as a last resort, as it's less readable and more prone to error.classmethod datetime.strptime(date_string, format)Return a  corresponding to date_string, parsed according to format. This is equivalent to .  is raised if the date_string and format can’t be parsed by  or if it returns a value which isn’t a time tuple. For a complete list of formatting directives, see strftime() and strptime() Behavior.The documentation contains the directives, but here is an example you could implement in your code:
