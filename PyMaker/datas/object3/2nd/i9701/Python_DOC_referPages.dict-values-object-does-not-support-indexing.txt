The following is my code:I am using python 3 and I am getting an error saying:Can someone please help? Thanks in advance.
In python3.x,  doesn't return a list anymore -- it returns a  object.  You can't subscript dict_values instances.  e.g.In this case, it looks like the fix should be to stop using the indices and just iterate directly over the dictionary's items:Or, as a list-comprehension:Also note that this should be much more efficient than the corresponding python2.x code (in which you're repeatedly generating lists to simply throw them away and re-generate on the next turn of the loop).
As addition/clarification to mgilson answer:The objects returned by dict.keys(), dict.values() and dict.items()  are view objects. They provide a dynamic view on the dictionaryâ€™s  entries, which means that when the dictionary changes, the view  reflects these changes.
