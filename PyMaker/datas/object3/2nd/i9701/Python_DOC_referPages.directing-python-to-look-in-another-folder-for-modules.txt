I'm still pretty new to python so forgive me if this is extremely simple or extremely the wrong way of thinking about this. I have python 2.7 installed. From what I understand when I run the following code, it lists the directories where it looks for modules. I have another directory that appears to have a bunch of python modules I installed in it. "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages"I guess I need to do one of two things:(1) direct python to look in this additional folder for modules. How do I do that?(2) install the modules in one of the folders it is already directing to. I've been using pip to install modules, and I think pip is installing to this additional director. How do I check if pip is installing to this folder? How do I change where pip install packages to?Thanks!
This stuff is setup by .  You can find out which  by entering the interpreter with:Alternatively, import  in the interactive interpreter and check the  attribute.There's also a helpful script in  which you can run with What you want to see in the output there is your user site, something likeWhen you  a package, use , which will install modules to your user space.  Don't install stuff with .  Don't munge the  manually like the "quick fix" from jmd_dk suggests.  Do it properly. If, after reading the site documentation and PEP370, you are still having trouble setting up the user site correctly, then it is acceptable to add a line like this in your bash profile:If you have both a Python 3 and a Python 2 installation, beware that the  environment variable will be seen by both interpreters.  In this case, it is strongly recommend to enable the  separately for each interpreter (or use virtual environments) to provide adequate namespacing of installed packages.
