I have a behavioral question about Python. Coming from the C background, I understand that modules are not the same as header files. Here are two scripts:Module1.pyDriver.pyThe behavior I expected at first was for urllib to be imported along with module1 inside the driver. However, this is not the behavior that I am experiencing. Is it correct to putOr does that cause urllib to be imported twice?I read in the documentation that the I can do something likebut that seems to be too much writing
The behavior I expected at first was for  to be imported along with  inside the driver.Why should it? You've imported  inside the namespace (module dictionary) of  and not in that of . is imported but, in , try:and see that no s are raised,  is there.does that cause  to be imported twice?No, Python will see  has already been imported (by peeking inside ) and just create an entry for  in the namespace or .
