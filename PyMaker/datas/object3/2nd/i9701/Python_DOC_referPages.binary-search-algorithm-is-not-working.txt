So I wrote a binary search algorithm, yet When I do test run it does not work perfectly.Here is the code abd here is the code for calling the functionThe problem is this, I want to add list target_values into the lst correct order when I actually run the function it gives Which is weird, Its working yet it only fails in the last part of the callis there any way to fix this problem? Final list should be [1,3,4,5,6,7,8] As requested I tracked my binary search algorithm, its quiet poor quality. I hope this would help
Just change the function to return  instead:Output:The problem with original implementation was that code assumed  to be the insertion index but it could never go beyond the current list within the loop as it should when value is inserted to the end of the list.
I think I got it.  Put in the print statements I recommended.  Track especially the insertion at the end of the existing list.  I believe that you'll find that you can't drive low high enough to provoke inserting at the end of the list; the most you can get is to insert before the final element, which is just what's happening in your test.
