Natural Text
What is the Pythonic way of writing a single-line but long string in program:Additionally, the string may need to be formatted with variables:Existing Solution 1Additional trailing  characters make reformatting very difficult. Joining two lines with a  gives an error.Existing Solution 2Except for a similar problem as above, subsequent lines must be aligned at the very beginning, which gives awkward readability when the first line is indented.
For long strings where you don't want \n characters, use 'string literal concatenation':Output:This is a long stringAnd it can be formatted as well:Output:This is a formatted long string
Here's the PEP8 guideline:https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#maximum-line-lengthWrap long lines in parenthesis.Use a maximum of 72 characters per line for long lines of text.If you have any operators in your string, place the line breaks before them.Other than that, as long as you're not obscuring what's going on, it's pretty much up to you on how you want to do it.
