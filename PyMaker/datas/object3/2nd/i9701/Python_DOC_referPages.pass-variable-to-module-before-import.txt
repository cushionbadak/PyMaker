I have the following setup.  I am trying to load a module in a.py dynamically (from c.py in this case, and call it toBeLoaded).  Then I want to import another module fileB which has a class that will inherit the class toBeLoaded.anotherClass.  I know it would solve the problem if I imported c.py in b.py, but since I am loading c.py dynamically, I am not sure how to accomplish that.  It would work if I could somehow pass a variable to b.py before it is imported, but I am not sure how to do that.  Here is my current setup.  a.pyb.pyc.pyI get the following error:
Not sure if it is the cleanest way to do it.  But the problem is fixed if c.py is changed toc.py
As I said, im pretty sure you can't do so and even if you find a way you should not do it.You should consider to organize your code in another way instead of crawling yourself through the import internals. :)Edit: As your goal seems to load a config file I suggest to either:use basic data types instead of external class referencestake a look on configparseruse json
