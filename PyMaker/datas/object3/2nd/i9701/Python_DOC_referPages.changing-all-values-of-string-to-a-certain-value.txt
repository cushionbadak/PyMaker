Is there a function like  which could take in any input and give a string of zeros with the same number of characters?
This will work:or the same:
There is no such built-in function, but you can easily write a list comprehension for that:
Another way to do this (mostly for fun):Note that this only works for filling with .  If you want to fill with different characters then this method won't work.You could use  or  to fill with different characters...However, most of these are really just clever ways to do it.  They aren't faster:though, depending on your particular preferences/background, you might find one way clearer to understand than another (and that's worth something)...FWIW, my first instinct is to use the multiplication method as proposed in Selcuk's answer so that's probably what I find most easy to read and understandable...
You can use python 're' module, like following:
