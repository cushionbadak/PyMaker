Some guides mentions  ( not ) when talking about virtual environments such as the official Python tutorial. Others mentions  such as in the Hitchhiker's Guide to Python. I've tried  and I think that it worked as you can see:and these are the contents of  directory:So can  be used to create virtual environment? Does  do the same as ? Which one should better be used?
They are very much alike. The main difference is that  has been around for a long time, and can be used in most setups., on the other hand, was designed for Python3, and ships with the standard library since version .In other words,  is the classic choice, while  is a recent addition to the standard library. I suppose  will eventually replace  (as soon as Python 3 replaces Python 2 :P)
 is basically a wrapper around venv module which is part of standard library since Python 3.3 and is the recommended way of creating virtual enviromnents since then. And actually  wrapper is not so recommended. On Python >= 3.3 consider using  module directly as described in linked docs. Older Python versions should use  to create virtual environments.
Use  a tool that unifies  and  in a way similar to . You can use it to install and manage both your virtualenvs and your dependencies.
