I've been trying to run a Java program and capture it's STDOUT output to a file from the Python script. The idea is to run test files through my program and check if it matches the answers. Per this and this SO questions, using  is the way to go. In the code below, I am doing  where f is the file I opened. The resulted file is empty and I can't quite understand why. 
I checked the docs for  and they recommended using  (added in Python 3.5). The  method returns the instance of , which has a  field. I inspected it and the  was an empty string. This explained why the file  I tried to create was empty. Even though the exit code was 0 (success) from the , it didn't mean that my Java program actually got executed. I ended up fixing this bug by breaking down  into two parts. If you notice, I initially tried to  into correct directory and then execute the Java file -- all in one . I ended up removing  from  and did the  instead. The  now contained only the string to run the Java program. This did the trick. So, the code looked like this:
