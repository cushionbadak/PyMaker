Hi I am new to using pandas coming from a SAS background and I am trying to segment a continuous variable into bands using the following code. I am expecting the code to check if the value of  is within the current loops boundings and set a  accordingly.I get the following error:I think that the if condition is evaluating correctly but the error is due to assigning a new column a value of the for loops counter. Can anyone explain what is going wrong or suggest an alternative.
To avoid the , changetoThe chained comparison  is equivalent to The  operator causes the two boolean Series ,   to be evaluated in a boolean context -- i.e. reduced to a single boolean value. Pandas refuses to reduce Series to a single boolean value.Instead, to return a boolean Series, use the  operator instead of :and then to assign values to the  column where  is True, use :To bin the data in , you could remove the Python  entirely, and as DSM suggests, use :
IIUC, this should be the fix to your code:howeverI'd do this
