I know the question is not very precise, and that is because I have no idea what is going on either. I have narrowed down the problem to a couple of lines, but to me the execution seems rather weird.Obviously I changed the variable names so it's clear what I'm doing.The problem is, when I call the function , it never  returns a maze with walls. Somehow the  and  values are always identical. I do not understand how this can be as the maze with walls is assigned to  after , which at that point does not have walls. According to the debug,  also contains the walls after the third line has been executed.Please help, I'm terribly confused.
As @stephan said, the variables  and  refer to the same objects in the memory. So I changed  with , thus creating a new object different from maze. This then results in test and maze being two different mazes.
