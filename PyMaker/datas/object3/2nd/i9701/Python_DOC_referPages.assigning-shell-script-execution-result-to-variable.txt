Here is despcription of :Execute the command (a string) in a subshell. This is implemented by calling the Standard C function system(), and has the same limitations. Changes to sys.stdin, etc. are not reflected in the environment of the executed command. If command generates any output, it will be sent to the interpreter standard output stream.Which means, that your shell prints  to standard output.As for  returning :On Windows, the return value is that returned by the system shell after running command. The shell is given by the Windows environment variable COMSPEC: it is usually cmd.exe, which returns the exit status of the command run; on systems using a non-native shell, consult your shell documentation.So return code of your shell script was  and it is assigned to . So technically you are already storing result in variable.@edit:To resolve problem, you'd need to use  module which allows for more detailed manipulation of system calls.
