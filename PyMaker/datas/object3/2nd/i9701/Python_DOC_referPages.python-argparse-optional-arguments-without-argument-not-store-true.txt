This question already has an answer here:Argparse - differentiate between no options, option invoked, and option invoked with argument?                    1 answer                How do I add an optional argument which has a default value and can be called with another value or which can be called without value (and has the default one).So I have this argumentand I would like to be able to call.   if I want an automatic mode with 8 as argument, but I also want to do for example  if I want an automatic mode with 10 (or any other number) as argument.The problem is that I get expected one argument when I run with . If I don't want to specify the 8, I am also not allowed to specify the -a and then I have to run , which is not what I want.
Add  and . From the documentation:ArgumentParser objects usually associate a single command-line argument with a single action to be taken. The nargs keyword argument associates a different number of command-line arguments with a single action..... One argument will be consumed from the command line if possible, and produced as a single item. If no command-line argument is present, the value from default will be produced. Note that for optional arguments, there is an additional case - the option string is present but not followed by a command-line argument. In this case the value from const will be produced.
