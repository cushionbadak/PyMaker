I am initializing a list of dictionaries with:I want to be able to add  pairs to a certain dictionary. For example, I want to add the key value pair  to the first slot in the list.This gives me the error . How am I able to access a certain dictionary within the list to add a key value pair?
This error message suggests that the key  is a list (or contains a list).  What you're attempting will not be possible, because dict keys must be hashable in Python.  Instead, you may use a hashable sequence type for the key , such as a tuple.
