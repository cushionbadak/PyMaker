I'm trying to understand how functions work and have a basic question.  I'm trying to figure out how to set a variable into the function and don't know how.  Probably easier for me to show my code:I have a bit of code that unzips a fileI can put this into a function by defining it as:And then I can call it by typing:But the purpose of putting this into a function is so I can use it over and over again.  But when I use it a 2nd or 3rd time, the variable name won't be 'fn' but rather another variable name defined later. How can i write this function but define 'fn' as a variable and then call it later by typing Thanks
This is as simple as puting  as argument of your functionSometime, you may also want to use a default nameFurthermore, note that your file name can be a full file name, which means that it can include the path to the file you want to read. For example, if your project layout is you would have to define the full name of the file you want to read aswhich ensures the portability of your script (you don't have to worry about the operating-system dependant separator, mainly). Then you would use your function like so
The above allows you to set the name of the file as 
To be able to reuse functions, you have to make the variable elements arguments to the function, e.g.:The  returns alls the names of the archive objects, so that you can keep track of the items extracted.
