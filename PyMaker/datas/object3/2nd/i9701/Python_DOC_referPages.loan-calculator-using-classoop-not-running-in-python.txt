For some reason my program is not running. I'm trying to allow the user to change the loan amount and reprint the new loan information. I don't know what I'm doing wrong, and classes/OOP is new to me, so I'm struggling dearly as I've been doing procedural-only for the past year. I am aware that this is filled with numerous errors... but I have nowhere to begin. All the tutorials for classes online are extremely vague and theoretical, and do not broach specific examples/scenarios like the one I'm facing with.Any help would be appreciated.

The other methods are just for returning class variables, but all the initialization is done in your constructor.Also, your constructor definition is wrong, correct this line :
