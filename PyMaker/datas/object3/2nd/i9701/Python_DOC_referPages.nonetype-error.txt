I'm new to Python, I've looked at other code but have no idea how to remove the nonetype error from mine,I get this error:Heres the full code:
You get this error because the identifier  has been assigned the value . Somewhere in your code, the following line must have been executed. is the type of the singleton constant .You will get the same error if you try to do this:Python does not prevent you from overriding built-in functions with new values. Sometimes it can be useful to redefine for instance the function . But in normal circumstances it's a bad idea to use , ,  etc. as variable names, since that can cause bugs such as this one.You can reduce the likelyhood of accidentaly overwriting an identifier by using a dictionary instead of declaring a very long list of variables.You can use any string as a dictionary key without worrying about shadowing built-ins.
