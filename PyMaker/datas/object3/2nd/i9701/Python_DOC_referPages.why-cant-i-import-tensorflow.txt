I installed the tensorflow following the instructions from the tensorflow webpage, using the following commands:Then I run python and type in:I got these error messages:I have google this problem and found answers like https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/1244andhttps://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/issues/8But none of them is helpful to my problem.My python is of version 2.7.6. I was installing the CPU-only version for Linux.When I first installed tensorflow in the above-mentioned way, it worked correctly and I managed to run some tutorial examples. But today I tried to install the anaconda, which is another useful computing toolbox. When I   installed it, I found that there was no tensorflow anymore. So I installed tensorflow again using conda. But then the above-mentioned error happens. Now I have removed the anaconda, and removed the environmental path added by anaconda. But the import error stays unsolved.I'm confused about what happened. Thank you all for your kind help!!!!
This suggests that the GPU version of tensorflow is being imported. Maybe you have another version of tensorflow installed? If you install all python packages with pip you can check by listing the installed packages.
Create a .conf file in /etc/ld.so.conf.d/:Add this:Then run . Hope this brings you joy.
