I have created a cube using python in blenderI want to rotate the cube around its z-axis with a random angle between -180, 180 degrees. Is there an argument or do I need a new line of code? How do i accomplish this?Thanks! 
You can add a rotation argument to . Note that python rotation options use radians, so you may need to use You can also directly change the rotatation of the object after you have created it. After  the new object is selected and is the active object.While the above example works it is more correct to specify the rotation using a  or  object.
