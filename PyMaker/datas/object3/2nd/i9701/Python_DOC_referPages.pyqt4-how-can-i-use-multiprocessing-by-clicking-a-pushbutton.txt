I have been trying to run a command using multiprocess since the GUI freezes when using a while loop. I need to call the function inside of pyqt4 class. Or a better way to handle multiprocess will Qthread help me? I have search many tutorials, but I cannot figure out how I can do this.I tried it like this, which works fine. The problem is I cannot get the input of QeditText passed to the function if there is a way I can then it will work for what I want to do.I need to be able to get the data from this, inside the worker function, is there a way?edit: forgot the form.py here it ishttp://pastebin.com/HksuSjkt

If you however use multiTHREADING, it is a new thread, but in the same process, which means it can access the Qt string you want.The syntax is for this purpose the sameLearn more about threads here
