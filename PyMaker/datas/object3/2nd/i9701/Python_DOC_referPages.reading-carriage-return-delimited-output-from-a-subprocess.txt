I need to read output, line by line, of a program that uses carriage returns () to make its output. The program runs for a long time, so I need to read the output as the program runs. I know how to do this when each item of output appears on a new line (as detailed here), but I can't seem to get it to work with carriage returns.Here is the code I used to try and get it to work (run on a linux system)However the code simply exits immediately, printing .I want the code to print:etc. What do I need to modify to get this to work?
