Is there a python3 version of the win32com module? I am running python 3.4.4 and I tried installing the win32com module, but it is written in python2 syntax.So I thought I would sort the syntax out myself, but it proved to be a task I couldn't quite handle.Long story short: is there a python3 win32com?
If you're looking for the Win32 bindings you can find them in either of these two projects. http://docs.activestate.com/activepython/3.4/whatsincluded.html http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/Build%20220Just make sure to download the corresponding x86 or x86-64 version for the corresponding version of Python
