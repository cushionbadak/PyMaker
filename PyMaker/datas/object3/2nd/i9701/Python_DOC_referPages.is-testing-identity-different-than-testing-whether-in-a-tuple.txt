I need to check if a function written by another team returns  or .I want to check for identity, not equality. I'm unclear what type of check happens when using . Which of the following does  behave like?
No, they are not the same, because identity testing is a subset of what the  operator does.Is the same as this:From the docs: For container types such as list, tuple, set, frozenset, dict, or collections.deque, the expression x in y is equivalent to any(x is e or x == e for e in y)The in operator tests for both equality and identity, and either one being true will return . I got the impression that you're only working with boolean values and . In that limited case, the  operator will behave the same as both of your other snippets.However, you said you want identity checking. So I would suggest you use that explicitly so your code's intention and what it is expecting is clear. Furthermore, if there is a bug in the called function and it returns something other than boolean or , using the  operator can hide that bug.I would suggest your first alternative:Or if you're feeling defensive:
You want to use the identity operator (is) and not the membership operator (in):This is a "TL;DR" complement to @skrrgwasme answer :)
