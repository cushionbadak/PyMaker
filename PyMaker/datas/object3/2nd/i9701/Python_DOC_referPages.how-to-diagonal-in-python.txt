I do not understand what does the  method do. How is it calculating the angle? And why is there another method that calculates the distance?
Atan2 is simply Tan inverse trignometric function which gives the output in radians. So, it is multiplied by 180/pi to convert it into degrees.dist is for calculating Euclidean distance between x and y.And for the lt(t, angle) and rt(t, angle), i can guess that they stand for Left Turn, by t degrees and Right Turn by t degress respectively.
In high school (liceo) I studied the inverse trigonometric functions, one of them the  or simply  — its meaning being, the angle  whose tangent is equal to .  The implied limits are -infinity ≤  ≤ + infinity  and -pi/2 ≤  ≤ pi/2.So, what is ? It's a similar function that returns the angle , -pi ≤  ≤ pi, that is comprised between the unit vector in the horizontal direction and the vector , with .Why this fuction is called ? because it has TWO arguments ( has a single argument) and because you can compute  using where you have to choose the particular solution based on the signs of  and  — this logic is no difficult but someone (possibly the implementors of first FORTRAN compilers?) decided that it was a so common question that it deserved a function on its own.Another feature of  is that the overflow that follows when  is completely avoided,
