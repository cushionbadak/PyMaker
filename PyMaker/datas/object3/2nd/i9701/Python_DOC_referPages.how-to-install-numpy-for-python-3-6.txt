I am using Python 3.6b3 for a long running project, developing on Windows.For this project I also need NumPy.I've tried Python36 -m pip install numpy, but it seems that pip is not yet in the beta.What's the best way to install NumPy for Python 3.6b3?[EDIT: Added installation log, after using ensurepip]
As long as binary packages (so-called 'wheels') for 3.6 have not been released to PyPi yet, you can resort to unofficial (but working) ones available at http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/. Download the file and install it like this:
Pip itself is not part of Python.  However, since version 3.4 Python includes the  module that allows bootstrapping a pip installation.  After callingyou should be able to install numpy via pip.
Pip is always be installed in subdirectory  of the Python 3.6 install directory.Open command prompt in windows, change directory to  and input , you will see what has been installed, then input , and the numpy will be installed. 
EDIT: I misread the question, disregard this answer.Try manually downloading the wheel from pypi and installing manually.On windows, it should look something like this:
Here is the list of steps needed to be performed for installing numpy on windows. This worked for me.Set path variable for python- C:\Users\XXXXXXX\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32Download get-pip.py locallyOpen cmd and navigate to get-pip.py filerun python get-pip.py for installation of PIPset pip path in env variable path -  C:\Users\XXXXXXX\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32\Scripts;pip install numpy
You can install numpy through command prompt using pip install command. Follow the below steps:1) In your command prompt, go to the scripts folder inside your Python 3.x installation.2) Type following command on your command promptRefer the attached screenshot showing both the steps.
