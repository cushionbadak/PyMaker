Bascially what I want to do is writing a python script that creates files with a count-number in the filename,  for example.I have come this far:Basically what I can do is count, but the file creation is my problem. open() doesnt seem to work.How do i create these files and how can I choose the directorys to store the files?

I hope this helps
