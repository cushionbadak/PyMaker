I am trying to use  to calculate the sum of digits of  can someone help me please. I am trying to use a recursive function for .Running the file in Python shell:This should calculate 1+9+6+9=25 then since 25 is greater than 10 it should then calculate the sum of its digits 2+5 so that the final answer is 7.
To get the last digit of a (positive integer) number you can calculate the modulo:The remainder of the number (excluding the last place) is:This should in theory be enough to split a number and add the digits:If you want to apply this recursivly until you have a value smaller than 10 you just need to call this function as long as that condition is not fulfilled:Just if you're interested another way to calculate the sum of the digits is by converting the number to a string and then adding each character of the string:
If you really require a recursive solution without using any loops (, ) then you can always recurse again to ensure a single digit:Or you could just not recurse at all:
try this...
