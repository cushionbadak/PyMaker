I have two inputs lists  and  and a function which takes two inputs, let's sayHow do I use  for this setup? I triedand got TypeError: f() takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given)It makes sense because I need to unpack the zipped input. How can I do that?
 doesn't unpack the iterables as your function argument, but instead as a more general way for dealing with such problems you can use  function from  module which should be used instead of  when argument parameters are already grouped in tuples from a single iterable:Here is an example:As another option your can just pass the iterables to map separately without zipping them.Also as a more pythonic way for multiplying two variable you can use  instead of creating a custom function:Here is the benchmark:
You could use a lambda function to handle this situation where: I know this is an old post but probably will help somebody else in future.PD: Sorry any typo I'm from my phone.
