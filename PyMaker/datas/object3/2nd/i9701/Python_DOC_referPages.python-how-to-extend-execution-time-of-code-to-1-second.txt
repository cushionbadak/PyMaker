I'm writing a countdown clock in python, but it looks like the time module only goes down to the second. Is there a way for me to accurately determine when exactly 1 second has passed?Seems like my question was a little confusing, let me clarify. I need to run some code, then, at the end, the program enters a while loop and exits once at least 1000 milliseconds have passed since the time the code started running
If you know the code you want to run will take less than 1 second, then  will give you the remaining time to sleep, no  loop required.There will be some overhead with the arithmetic, but it's within 1/100 of a second and will be strictly greater than 1 second, as you request. I ran the following code:Output:You can run this several times to verify it gives the output you want, no matter how long  takes.Unless it takes longer than 1 second, then the sleep time will be negative which will result in . You would need to check for that case.Or, if you need to kill the function if 1 second has passed, check this question
Here is a way which will work, though im not sure which modules you are limited to.2.50023603439 seconds wall timewhere procedure is a reference to the function you are timing.
By default the  module gives you the time to the 10^-5 second
