I'm trying to print a menu from information within a file, so I took the information and created a dictionary. I'm trying to figure out if there is a way to format the spacing between values, so I can align the values with headers. I am also trying to find out if there is anyway that each key and its values will print without a line of space in the middle.My code currently looks like this:When printing the dictionary the output looks like:OutputWhy did it print the first two keys with values line after line with no space but others with a line in between? I want to align each value with it's header. Is that possible? If so how? The only way I could think to do so would be with the print function and to format it myself.
The reason they don't align is because each item is a different length. The first item in each row pushes the next items farther to the right the longer it is.This is a modified version of your  function that fixes this:I can't verify if it works because I don't have your  module though.
