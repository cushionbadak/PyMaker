I am stuck - need some help to get started - just hitting a brick wall.So there are supposed to be two lists and one table defined as follows.• Actors, a list of strings that are actor names. For each i such that 0 ≤ i ≤ len(Actors) − 1, we refer to Actor[i] as the i-th actor.• Films, a list of strings that are film names. For each i such that 0 ≤ i ≤ len(Films) − 1, we refer to Film[i] as the i-th film.• Scores, a table whose rows correspond to the actors and columns correspond to the films. Scores[i][j] is an integer number defined as follows.– If Scores[i][j] = −1 this means that the i-th actor is not a star for the j-th film.– If Scores[i][j] ≥ 0 then this is the score of the i-th actor for the j-th film. You can assume that the scores are in range 0-100, there is no need to check the validity of the data.I am allowed to define the above structures as fixed in my program, there is no need to request the user to enter them.So how do I write a function whose arguments are a table A of integer numbers and a positive integer number i. The function should return the average of non-negative entries of A[i] (the row i of A).Thanks Jemma
