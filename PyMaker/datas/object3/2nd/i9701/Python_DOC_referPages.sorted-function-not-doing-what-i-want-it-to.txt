I'm creating a program that ranks poker hands. I want to sort each hand  by number value of cards before ranking to make it easier but am having issues getting the sort to work. It sorts every letter in the self.deck instead of the individual strings. 
 sorts a list of strings. If you pass a string to , it is converted to a list of single-character strings and only then sorted. The  in your program is actually a string, not a list of strings: .
What's going on is that in your  class, your  method, you have:So you end up setting hand to the string representation of a list. It sorts that string representation and you get the result you are seeing, which sorts the individual characters lexicographically. It doesn't make sense to make your  attribute a string.
