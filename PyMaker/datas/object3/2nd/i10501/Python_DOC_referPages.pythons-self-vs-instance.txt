What is the difference between the self and instance keywords in Python 3?I see code like,
Neither  nor  are keywords in Python. The identifier  is used by convention as the first parameter of instance methods in a class. The object instance on which a method is called is automatically passed in as the first parameter.In the above snippet,  is most probably a method of some class and  seems to be the conventional first parameter as described above. The second parameter  is just another parameter and the name  does not have any significance in Python.
The snippet is a bit short but  is not a keyword (neither , that is just convention).It is an argument to another instance of another (maybe same) class.
The question is rather generic, but let me see if I can shed some light on it for you: refers to the class(by convention, not a keyword) of which  is a part. The class has variables and methods and you can refer to these with the  keyword(not a reserved keyword) by calling In the case of the snippet above,  refers to the class.  likely refers to some  instance "the big hint is the  and  is a dictionary or class object with attributes you are tting and assigning to  attributes before saving themHope this helps
