I have been playing around with the  module lately and I stumbled upon this behavior that I find rather weird: returns .My question is, why? I really didn't expect it to return . I was expecting .The former is a  object with length 2 (), whereas the latter one is a  object with length 1 ().I didn't expect this behavior at all, because , which is supposed to be 1-byte, has became 2-bytes when encoded with the  codecs.What would you have done to convert an ASCII character to its hex-encoded  representation? What I did was:But I felt like this is kind of a dirty hack.
The behaviour of codec is documented, the purpose is to make a text representation of (possibly) binary data. If you want to convert a character 'a' to a bytes representation of that character using ascii, you don't need the codec module; just use the  builtin.As noted in the comments, b'a' is equal to b'\x61'
