Natural Text
I have made this script which will save players names followed by their scores. I am looking to recall this data back into python so it can be sorted into a table in a UI.Im sure its a simple solution but i can only find how to save to a text document.
There are multiple ways to do 1. you will reopen the your playerscores.txt file read the data from it store it in buffer sort it and write it again .2. while tacking input store it in buffer sort them and then write on txt file.
