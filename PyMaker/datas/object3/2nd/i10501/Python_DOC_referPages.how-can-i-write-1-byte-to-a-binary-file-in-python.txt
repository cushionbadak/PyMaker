I've tried everything to write just one byte to a file in python. will output '0x00 0x0a'will output '0x00 0x0a 0x00 0x00'I want to write a single byte with the value 10 to the file.
You can just build a  object with that value:This works only in python3. If you replace  with  it works in both python2 and 3.Also: remember to open the file in binary mode to write bytes to it.
 (signed) and  (unsigned) pack an integer as a single byte which you can see in the docs for struct. ( is for using standard size and ignoring alignment - just in case) so you can do
