I have written this,Sp is the Parent class for A. And I'm using A class in B,C and D, But D don't need Sp inheritance instead it needs Sp instance object inside D(Please look into D class). I want to stop Sp inheritance in D, is there any good way to write this ?
You can't inherit from  without inheriting from  if  itself inherits from . You could try to work around it though, by making  inherit from two classes, one of which implements the non- behaviors (say, call it ), and  (). Then have  and  inherit , while  inherits solely from .If  doesn't need to be created independently, you could just make  not inherit from  at all, and have  and  inherit from both  and  (), while  only inherits from , which saves the need for a separate .Lastly, you might consider composition. Have  not inherit from anything, just contain an instance of . Then use the  special method to get attributes from  when they're not defined on :You might also need to use  if you need to mutate the  instance. This is trickier (because  is called unconditionally, not just when an attribute doesn't exist), but there are plenty of examples of using it available if you search.
