Starting with a source directory;<  C:/Users/Public/Env Defense/Projects/1_Earnings Calls/Quarterly Earnings Calls/1_IOUs by Quarter/2013 Q1/AAA Done/there are multiple subdirectories within the source directory; for example < /Users/Public/Env Defense/Projects/1_Earnings Calls/Quarterly Earnings Calls/1_IOUs by Quarter/2013 Q1/AAA Done/AEP/Users/Public/Env Defense/Projects/1_Earnings Calls/Quarterly Earnings Calls/1_IOUs by Quarter/2013 Q1/AAA DONE/AlleteWithin each subdirectory are multiple  files with common words in the names such as;*2013 Q1 AEP Earnings Call Transcript.txt*2013 Q1 AEP Earnings Call Transcript.txt*2013 Q1 ALLETE Earnings Call Transcript.docx*2013 Q1 AEP Earnings Call Presentation.pdf'I am writing a script to walk through the subdirectories and remove some of the common words.  For example I want 2013 Q1 AEP Earnings Call Transcript.txt would become 2013 Q1 AEP.txtThe script I wrote is;  FileRename_V1.pyThe result is the following error message; Traceback (most recent call last):  File "FileRename_V1.py", line 29, in     os.rename(filename,filename.replace("Earnings Call Transcript", ''))FileNotFoundError: [WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified: '/Users/Public/Env Defense/Projects/1_Earnings Calls/Quarterly Earnings Calls/1_IOUs by Quarter/2013 Q1/AAADONE\2013 Q1 AEP Earnings Call Presentation.pdf'    -> '/Users/Public/Env Defense/Projects/1_Earnings Calls/Quarterly Earnings Calls/1_IOUs by Quarter/2013 Q1/AAA DONE\2013 Q1 AEP Earnings Call Presentation.pdf'I have researched  code to recursively rename files and the code I wrote appears similar to examples that worked.  Any suggestions as to what the problem is and how to correct the script will be much appreciated.Cheers, BobS
The WinError was caused by the file path exceeding 260 characters.  I edited the directory names to reduce the number of characters and the script worked as intended. It is very helpful to be able to quickly edit the names as I am working with 20 directories each of which contains about 40 subdirectories and each subdirectory contains about 5 files.  Fortunate that someone posted the issue with file path length !!
