Using . Let us say we have and we want to remove all occurrences of 2. We can achieve it by or  .Is this an "in-place" substitution? Also, are we creating a copy of list when we use filter?
andare two different operations that end up with mostly the same result.In both cases,returns either a new list containing items that match the filter (in Python 2), or an iterable over  that returns the same items (in Python 3).The first case,then deletes all items from  and replaces them with the items from the new list or iterable.The second case,assigns the new list to the variable .The time when this makes a difference is this:With this code,  ends up with the new contents , whereas  ends up with the original contents .
