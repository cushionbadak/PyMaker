There is also  function with  to check whether string is numeric or not. To check whether it is non-numeric, simply use  with the conditionIt will be good idea to create your custom function to achieve this using 
Check if its a digit, and take the not of itOr use 
You might use re module, this allow you to check if a string contain for example a digit:
The following expression return  only of all the letters are non-digits:
You can use Regular Expressions to do that:If the return of the match method is  then your input does not satisfy your Regular Expression rule. In the example above it only verify if is a single string but you can change your re rule to match naything you want. You can consult the documentation in here for more information about re.
