I have several arrays:... I want to create a function that creates variables and renames them like so:I am dealing with a very large set of arrays so creating the variables as such one by one isn't easy.  I don't want to use a dictionary if I can help it.  Is there a way to use .format() to create a variable name or something simple that I am missing?  Thanks!
If you're asking how to rename (understanding this action like create a new variable and deleting the existing old one) you could manipulate globals like this:Now, I strongly recommend you not doing this! Don't mess with globals manually... Instead, if your variables have a similar structure, usually there isn't any good reason to declare them individually, you could pack them like this:That way, you can iterate over your data nicely without having any cheap trick like messing around with globals.

Dynamically creating variables is usually not a good idea. Instead, you can just get the attribute from the aggregating list object directly. It's even shorter than :But you might not want to memorize which index was the count. Alternatively, create a function:Or make your  objects dictionaries:Or use  to make it a bit cleaner:
