Is there a formula that is a one way hash for 2 coordinates (a, b) and (c, d) to one integer where a, b, c, and d are positive? Order doesn't matter here, so the formula should give the same results when given  and . The order of the actual numbers in each coordinate point matter ( is not the same as ). Speed is the key here, the formula should be fast and have O(1) complexity. Note - what I'm doing right now is sorting the two coordinates using Python's building in sort, and then using them as keys in Python's built-in dictionary (so, built-in hashing). I need a faster way of doing this so that I can hash the two coordinates to an integer myself.
You can use the hash() of a frozenset for this.Frozensets were specifically designed for this kind of use case (i.e. frozensets are intrinsically unordered collections that are immutable and hashable).Hope this answer takes your right to what you needed :-)
