I'm trying to create a script that counts to 3 (step size 0.1) using while, and I'm trying to make it not display .0 for numbers without decimal number (1.0 should be displayed as 1, 2.0 should be 2...)What I tried to do is convert the float to int and then check if they equal. the problem is that it works only with the first number (0) but it doesn't work when it gets to 1.0 and 2.0..this is my code:that's the output I get:the output I should get:thank you for your time.
You can remove trailing zeros with '{0:g}'.format(1.00).See: https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-specification-mini-languageUpdate: Too lazy while copy/pasting. Thanks @aganders3
Due to lack of precision in floating point numbers, they will not have an exact integral representation. Therefore, you want to make sure the difference is smaller than some small .
