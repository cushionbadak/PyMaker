How do I create a list with the selected attributes of an object in python ? Using list comprehensions.E.g: My object A hasand many more attributesHow do I create a list I can do it manually but it looks ugly:but I am looking for a shortcut.
Why not just ?  literals are simple. You could use  if you need to do it a lot, though it returns s when fetching multiple attributes, not s, so you'd have to convert if you can't live with that.
What you're looking for is 
You can collect them going through all  class attributes and checking if they aren't method or built-in.
