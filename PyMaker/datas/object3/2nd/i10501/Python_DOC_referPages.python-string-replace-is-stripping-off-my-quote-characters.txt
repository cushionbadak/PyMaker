What I'm doing is feeding my python script a CSV file which contains millions of records separated by commas. Any strings are "contained by double qoutes".I pass this .csv file through my python scriptAnd the end result has all the quotes stipped off my strings.What am I doing wrong?EditSample input:Sample output:
This is normal. When reading,  will strip off the quotes because it's assumed that the program consuming the data doesn't want or need them.  will then put them back on if necessary, depending on the setting of  that you pass, the default being  - it will only add quotes if there are characters in the string that could be misinterpreted.You could set both the reader and the writer to  to preserve the quotes that are in the original file, or set the writer to  to requote all output.
