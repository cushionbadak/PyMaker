Now check each of the values in  against each of its corresponding values in the  array. If any of the values from  are greater than , then  is discarded.If not, then multiply each  value by the each corresponding  array value, and after that determine the highest value and print it.For example:  has , all of which are equal to or below , so we take , which gives us . However, that isn't the highest value. The highest value is , which is acquired by . It has . Taking  gives I am stuck here.
I guess this does what you wantâ€”at least it produces sums  from the data similar to those you mentioned in your question. I found your sample code is very misleading since it doesn't produce the kind of  values you refer to in the written problem description below it.You can replace most of that with one (longish) generator expression similar to the one in linked code in one of  @Stefan Pochmann's comments, so this does exactly the same thing:
