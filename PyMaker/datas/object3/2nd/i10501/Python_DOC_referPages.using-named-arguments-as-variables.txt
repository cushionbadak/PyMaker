I am using django but I think this question primarily belongs to Python itself.I have something like:Where  is a named argument that is a  field in my model  representing a column in my database. The variables 'm0' and  are passed from the  to my get function (it is actually a  method in my view class).Can I control the name value of the variable  without using an if else if chain (i.e. make it  or )? Since I have many choices, I will have to use a ridiculously very long conditional chain that leads to this same line but with just a different named argument.I strongly doubt that you should understand this whole problem to answer the question. The original question is simple: Can I use a named argument and its corresponding value as variables in Python?
From what I can make out you can construct the key and then pass in an arg to construct the dict, then include that in the filter
The basic and incredibly powerful idea in Python is that you can pass a list of positional arguments without writing  and/or a dict of keyword arguments without writing  by using  and  as in A function can likewise be written to accept a list of positional args of arbitrary length, and any set of unmatched keyword arguments: . ( and  are not reserved words, just conventional variable names)This example probably shows most of it in operation:kwargs is a dict so if you want, you can use  and all the other  methods to introspect what the user actually passed and validate, parse, process etc. Django frequently uses  to allow the fetching of arguments for the current function, while leaving other named arguments to propagate down a possibly deep set of nested function invocations until a routine near the bottom finds an optional keyword argument of its own.
