I have the follow class and method:How can I unit test it? I am completely stumped although this is simple. It's my first unit test. 
Use the  library (Python 3.3 and newer, backported as ), to replace calls to any code external to your code-under-test.Here, I'd mock out not only  but  too, to just return a string object:If you feel that testing the  argument is important, give   an explicit  object to return instead; you'd have to create that test object before you mock however, as you can't mock out just the  class method:or, in your unittests, use  to keep a reference to the class that isn't mocked.Demo:
