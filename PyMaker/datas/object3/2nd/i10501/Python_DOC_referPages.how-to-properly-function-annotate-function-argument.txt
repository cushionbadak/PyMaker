This question already has an answer here:In Python 3.5, how can I specify a function as a type hint?                    1 answer                I want my function to be annotated that it takes another function as an argument. At first I thought that this is going to work just fine:however function is unresolved reference. I looked through builtins and it is indeed not there, unlike str, int and others I typically use. However, it has to be somewhere, because:Where is the function class defined, why isn't it in builtins? Is my original try supposed to be the correct solution? For now I went with annotating it with , but it doesn't feel right because everywhere else we hint  not . And importing types just for one annotation is also weird.  library also doesn't have anything it that would help me replace this.Also, how would FunctionType work with a type annotation enforcing library (I saw few of those flying around)
Why not use :Frameworks expecting callback functions of specific signatures might  be type hinted using
