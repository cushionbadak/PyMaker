How can I print A/B character alternately in python loop?What I expect in result:
You can use  to repeat through a sequence. This is typically used with  to iterate through a longer list, while repeating the shorter one. For exampleOutput
try this:
You could also try using the modulus operator % on the index of an incremented for loop for the numbers to alternate the letters:
Something like:Output:1 A2 B3 A4 B5 A
I think this will help ->
At the suggestion of @Graipher instead of using combined  with , better and simpler solution will be use  which is Cartesian product of input iterables.Roughly equivalent to nested for-loops in a generator expression. For example, product(A, B) returns the same as ((x,y) for x in A for y in B).https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html#itertools.product
