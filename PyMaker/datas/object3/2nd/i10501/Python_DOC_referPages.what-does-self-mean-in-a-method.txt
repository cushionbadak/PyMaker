Natural Text
When reading a python program, I once find a function uses  in the following way. The line of   looks usual to me, i.e., we always  to define something. But I am not very clear about the usage of . In specifc, what does  mean here, or what does it do?
It doesn't mean anything other than what  would mean. In Python  in an expression will just call , and  is the name conventionally used for the current object, or the receiver, in Python, so  would mean pretty much the same as I guess there is a method  defined for that class as well.
