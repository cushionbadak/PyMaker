Please tell me how I can get out of *.conf [section name] and the value of the first parameter (after the name of the section) and on their basis to create a XML file using python? I have a very simple config file, but each section is more than one option. Thank you in advance.
In the standard library you can find configparser which helps you read such files and xml.etree.ElementTree which helps you bould valid XML files (see sections about modifying and building).
