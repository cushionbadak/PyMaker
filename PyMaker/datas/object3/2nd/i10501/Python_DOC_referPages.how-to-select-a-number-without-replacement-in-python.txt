So I'm trying to make a mix and match between numbers here is my codeThe problem is that it is randomizing but it keeps repeating numbers like here**1.0 job is [4.0].  2.0 job is [5.0].  3.0 job is [4.0].**What can I do to make it not repeat.I'm using python 2.7.12Also how can I use alphanumerical instead of float only.
Best way to achieve this will be to use  (if you want to randomize the original sample list) or  (if you want to keep the original sample copy):Example with :Example with :If you want minimal changes in your solution. You may remove an entry from your samples based on random selection and get next choice from remaining samples like:
write a class to pick a unique element from list1. permutations finds all unique elements 2. rest can define new data and length of resultExample:
Since you are selecting from a list, then you should delete the entry from the list after each check.Create your original list, which will be used as needed.Create a second list from the first to use as you select.As you choose each element from the list, remove itPut the chosen element into a list of chosen element.Python remove methodParameters  obj -- This is the object to be removed from the list.Return Value  This method does not return any value but removes the  given object from the list.Example   The following example shows the usage of remove() method.When we run above program, it produces following result âˆ’
You could do this:Also how can I use alphanumerical instead of float only.Have you tried not converting your inputs to float...?
