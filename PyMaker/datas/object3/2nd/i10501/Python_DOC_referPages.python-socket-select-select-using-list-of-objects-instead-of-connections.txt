Typically using  will require a list of connection objects to work like this:Say I have the below object:I will create a list of remoteDevices before using select after accepting the connections and append them to a list:Now  will be  alist of multiple devices, and their connection object is given to each remote device.Is there a way I can pass in  into the select statement to iterate through the  property of each  object? Will I have to store the connection objects seperately just to use ?
According to the  documentation you can supply a sequence of objects that have a  method. You can easily add that method to your class:The  method simply returns the file descriptor of the connection's socket object. Since you instantiate  with the return value of , this a tuple in which the first item is a  object.
