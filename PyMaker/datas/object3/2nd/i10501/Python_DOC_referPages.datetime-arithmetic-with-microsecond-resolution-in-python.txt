I want to calculate the difference (in terms of days, hour, min, sec, microsecond) between two time stamps (having microsecond resolution) in python e.g. between (1) and (2) Any pointers, how to do it?
You can use the  package:This will give you a  object which represents the time difference between the two datetime objects.If you don't want to install a package then it can also be done using  but in that case you have to define what the string looks like.
