This answer assumes you are using Python 3.x - for Python 2.x some changes are required (some obvious places are commented)For the data format in the question, this could be a starting point in Python:actually this code is all about using a queue to keep the input rows for the window and not more - everything else is text-to-list-to-text.With actual csv-data (see comment)
