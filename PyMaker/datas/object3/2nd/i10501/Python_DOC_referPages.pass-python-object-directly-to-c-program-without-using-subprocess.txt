Natural Text
I have a C++ program that, through the terminal, takes a text file as input and produces another text file. I'm executing this program from a Python script which first produces said text string, stores it to a file, runs the C++ program as a subprocess with the created file as input and parses the output text file back into a Python object.Is it possible to do this without using a subprocess call? In other words: is it possible to avoid the reading and writing and just run the C++ program inside the Python environment with the text-string as input and then capture the output, again inside the Python environment?For code I refer to the function  in this IPython notebook.
You can use ctypes.It requires the C++ function to be wrapped with  and compiled as C code.Say your C++ function looks like that:You can call it from python like that:Now  will have the processed string.
