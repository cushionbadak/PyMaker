For my application I need to set some widget parameters like alignment () and others. But I can't import them (other PyQt5 staff imports withot any issues).Using this codeI got following error:And using this one works:Though I have working sollution I would like to import only  and not . And why  doesn't work with ?
I think the confusion here is that PyQt has a special virtual module called , which imports everything into a single namespace. This is a quite useful feature, but it's a real shame that the name clash with  wasn't avoided.In the first example, the error can be "fixed" by using the somewhat weird-looking . But obviously, explicitly importing from  is a much better solution. It's also worth noting that the  package is a lazy loader, so  will just import an empty namespace with no access to the other modules.
You can do thisYou can't import  only because QtCore is not a package itself, it's just a module on it's own (a single file). it's important to know that all packages are modules, but not all modules are packagesso this won't workLooking at the output you can see that  is a single file which contains a class  that contains other classes and methods on which  is part of, you can see that with.On the otherhand PyQt5 is a package (folder containing other modules) points to it's i'll suggest you read the docs on Modules and this SO question
