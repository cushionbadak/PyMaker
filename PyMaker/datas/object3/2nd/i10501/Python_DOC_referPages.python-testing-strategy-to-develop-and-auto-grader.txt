I have a list of input files and an expected output file, I want to write an auto-grader that does the job of accepting a python program, running it on the input files, and comparing its output to the output file. The approach I have used is to use the  module of python to run the program using  and then perform a diff between the output and expected.out again using os.system().The problem which I am currently facing is reading the input from the file because the program which is given is reading from the console. So, how should I redirect the input from a file such that it is readable by sys.stdin in program.py.Is there a better way to perform a diff without using the diff command?To redirect output from program.py to a file I used . What equivalent should I use to redirect an input file to progam.py such that wherever I have used sys.stdin in program.py it will instead read from the passed file? (Modifying program.py is not an option.)
You can be doing everything using builtin modules in Python 3.3+, since you are effectively spinning up a  and doing a  on the expected output.  Simple minimum example:check.pyhello.pyExample runModify as you see fit, with other methods/functions in the libraries linked.  If you need stdin for the subprocess you probably will need to create Popen object and call communicate, but please read documentations first for future reference.
