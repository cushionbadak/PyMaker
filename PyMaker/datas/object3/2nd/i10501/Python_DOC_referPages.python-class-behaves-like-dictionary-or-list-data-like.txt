In python3 console, input those:My questions are:How can a class act like dictionary-or-list-data-like? May give an example to construct a class like this? Is there some documentation aboutthis?
Python contains several methods for emulating container types such as dictionaries and lists. In particular, consider the following class:If you writeThenwill call the first method, andwill call the second method.If you further want to support then you just need to add the methodHere is an example of a (very inefficient) dictionary implemented by a listYou can use it pretty much like a regular :
It's quite easy ... All you need to do is define a  method that handles slicing or integer/string lookup.  You can do pretty much whatever you want...Here's a cheat sheet of what will be passed to  as  in the following situations:The trick (which can be slightly non-trivial) is simply writing  so that it looks at the type of the object that was passed and then does the right thing.  For my answer, I cheated by creating a  in my  and then I called  on the tuple (since it already does the right thing in all of the cases that I wanted to support)Here's some example usage:note that you don't typically need to even do this yourself.  You can create a named tuple to do the job for you:And usage is pretty much the same:The main difference here is that our namedtuple is immutable.  Once created, we can't change it's members.
i think in python like ECMAScript (aka javascript) class is a dictionary or associative array(associative array). since you can add a property or method to your class at runtime.(see)if you want write a class like that you can use  and  methods:
You can achieve the same behaviour by overriding getitem() and setitem() in your class.You can override setitem() too in your class for achieving the setter kind of thing.
