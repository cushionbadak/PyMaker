is it possible to sort through a list and do something depending on your preferred order or pre determined choice?so i have a list of files containing definitions, if i re.search the string and return a match, i would like to only print the string + highest definitioni started to explore the below idea but i cannot seem to get it to print only the highest -currently it prints all 3any help would be awesome
If I understand what you're trying to do, this should work:The main issue with your approach is that the  only breaks out of the nearest loop. @alfasin's answer fixes this by ing from a function instead.My answer could also just be used without a function if you want, since it only has one loop to break out of:
Since your  is in order, you can just traverse the lists, and return the file when a match is found.   
If you want only a single result (the highest) and considering that your list is ordered highest to lowest, you can simply return after the first result was found:
