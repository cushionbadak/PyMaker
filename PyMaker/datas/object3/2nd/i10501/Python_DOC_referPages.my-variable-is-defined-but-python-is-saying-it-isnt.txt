I keep getting an error telling me that the name  is not defined, but I have it defined inside the  function. I'm a beginner as I've just started class but to me it looks like it should be working:
In python (in contrast to JavaScript), variables are locally scoped by default. This means that the variables are only accessible inside the function they are defined in. This behaviour can be overridden, but usually you do not want that.To illustrate the difference, take a look at this python transcript:As you can see, even though  is assigned to in the  function, the value of the  name does not change in the global scope. If we had not defined  globally at all, the two  calls outside  would fail with a NameError, just like your code does.The ultimate solution to your problem is to either handle output in the  function, or pass the values to the  function (the latter is generally preferred, keep logic and output separated):The official Python tutorial also has a few words on function scopes (emphasis mine):More precisely, all variable assignments in a function store the value in the local symbol table; whereas variable references first look in the local symbol table, then in the local symbol tables of enclosing functions, then in the global symbol table, and finally in the table of built-in names. Thus, global variables cannot be directly assigned a value within a function (unless named in a  statement), although they may be referenced.
 is defined in  and it stays in main's scope. You need to pass it to  and modify  to accept all the values that you need. For example:
