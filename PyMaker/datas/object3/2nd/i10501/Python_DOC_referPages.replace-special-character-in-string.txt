Natural Text
I'm having a issue with a problem where I want to replace a special character in a text-file that I have created with a string that I defined.I have tried with something that looks like this. I thought I could just read from the file, save it's content in my own string and then use the  function to alter the string.But when I try to do the last print, noting has happened with the  string. What am I doing wrong?The text-file just looks like this, all is on one line:
 doesn't alter the string in place, no string operations do because strings are immutable. It returns a copy of the replaced string which you need to assign to another name:now your replaced string will be saved to the new name you specified in the assignment.
