In python, how can I check a variable is a numerical type and has a meaningful value? Here I mean by 'numerical type' those like , , and  with all different bit length, and by 'meaningful value' that it is not  or any other special values that can not be used for further computation. (I guess this is such a common issue and there must be a duplicate question, but I did not find one after a quick search. Please let me know if there is a duplicate.)
Python 2.x and 3.xReason for the distinction is because Python 3 merged the  and  types into just .Edit: Added upon answer below using  to exclude booleans.
Integers can never be NaNs.
It depends how thorough you want to be. Besides the builtin types (, , and ) there are also other types that are considered numbers in python. For instance: , , and even  can act as a number. Then you get external libraries that have their own numeric types. By far the biggest is . With  some of its types will succeed  checks, and other will not. For instance:  is true, but  is not.On top of all this you could even have a user defined class that acts like a number.Python does provide one way of getting around this -- the  module. It provides several abstract types that represent different types of numbers. Any class that implements numeric functionality can register itself as being compatible with the relevant types.  is the most basic, and therefore the one you're looking for. All you have to do is use it  in your  checks. eg.That still leaves us with the problem about whether the object is actually a number, rather than "not a number". The  function is good for this, but it requires that the number be convertible to a float (which not all numbers are). The big problem here is the  type. There are a few ways around this: additional  checks (but that comes with its own headaches), using , or testing for equality. can be used on every numeric type (that I can think of). For most numbers it returns the positive version of the number, but for complex numbers it returns its magnitude (a float). So now we can do  that  check.  is also a special number in that it is the only number that is not equal to itself.This means your final check might look like:
I am answering to my own question. This is based on Seth Michael Larson's answerand DaveTheScientist's answer for another question. Considering that I need to be careful for  and  as well as , and that the passed argument  may be complex, I ended up writing the following function for the check.
