I want to:check whether a string contains an object propertyif it does then access the attributeSo for an object of class and objectI would like for string "What is the name"to return person.name (I already know which object the string is about)The most basic solution would be to do cases for each property being there but the actual code has quite a few and I am sure I don't manually have to write them out, I am just new to programming so I am not sure what syntax is used for thisAny help appreciated 
As others have noted,  is generally useful. is of lesser utility; internally, it's basically a  call in a / block (if  occurs, it returns , no exception means ), so if you're considering code like:just use:to avoid doubling the number of LEGB lookups, function calls and attribute lookups.Alternatively, for repeatedly pulling named attribute(s),  basically lets you make an optimized version of  that pre-binds the attribute name to lookup (making it ideal for use with stuff like the  and  functions, as it makes them more efficient than their equivalent listcomps/genexprs).On top of those, depending on what your goal is, the  and (slightly less reliably, due to issues with classes that use  to define a known set of variables to reduce memory usage and prevent auto-vivification)  functions may be useful.For example, in your example case of pulling any attributes corresponding to a word from a string, you could do a bulk identification of legal attribute names using / and your choice of  or  operations (or a mix) depending on the importance of order, uniqueness, etc.:Then usage is:
You are looking for the function  and .To check whether the attribute exists:And to call the attribute:
