I am a noob in python and I think I have a relevant question.I have this two lists in python :  In listA I have the column names of my mysql table.In listB I have the result of a query to this valuesWhat is the most efficient way in python to produce an output like this?
A list of dictionaries will work well:
Here is the one-liner (as per your title):The notation with  in brackets  is known as list comprehensions. Refer to the Python documentation for more details. The one-liner is using nested list comprehensions:The outer part is parsing the outer list of listB, as shown in the example below. This is helping us to parse listB row by row.The inner part is parsing the listB row to build the string. We are iterating on the index rather than the elements themselves in order to get the column name from listA:Is the equivalent of:The third row results in:We then need to combine it in a single string with coma-separation:Results in:Hence, the expression:Results in:We then combine the overall result with linefeed :Results in:
Not the most efficient way and takes two lines, but you can try this code:Try it here.
A broad for loop is enough
