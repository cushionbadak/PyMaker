I have a list of Car objects, each object being defined as follows:The depreciation_values attribute is a list that has 8 components, like below:The second value (-2.2011534921064739) denotes the depreciation factor and is what I'm trying to use as the sort key.I'm aware of attrgetter:But this would sort the list based on the first value of depreciation_values and not the second.Is there a way to sort all the objects based on the depreciation factor?
You can instead use a lambda in order to access the exact value you want on which to sort:
You could define a  (less than) method and other comparison methods to return a boolean based on your desired sort attribute then you could use the built-in sorted() or . "... sort routines are guaranteed to use () ... "
