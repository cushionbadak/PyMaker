Natural Text
Running the following code works flawlessly, once it is ran I would press the button labeled "Draw Text" and the following error is displayed:There is a task which requires me to draw some text on a tkinter screen using turtle. I have added in code which tells the turtle to draw this if the button in the menu is pressed, but this error than shows up. I am rather new to python and don't understand how to go about fixing such a problem.
The problem is that the  object, from the turtle module, has no attribute . You can use the commands , , , and  to move your turtle. Before using the above commands, I suggest looking at the documentation for the turtle module, as you seem to be confused about how to properly use it.Here is a quick explanation for the basic turtle move methods:: This method moves a turtle object forward(in pixels). Use a integer or a float to specify how far to move the turtle.: This method moves a turtle object backwards(in pixels). Use a integer or a float to specify how far to move the turtle.: This method turns a turtle object left(in degrees). Use a integer or a float to specify how far to turn the turtle.: This method turns a turtle object right(in degrees). Use a integer or a float to specify how far to turn the turtle.
This is fairly straightforward. You initialize  in the caller to be a .  doesn't have an attribute or method named , it has special purpose methods for moving forward or backwards, and other methods to turn relatively ( and ) or to an absolute orientation ().If your goal is to, say, move the turtle forward by  "distance" or something from its current heading, you'd call /.
