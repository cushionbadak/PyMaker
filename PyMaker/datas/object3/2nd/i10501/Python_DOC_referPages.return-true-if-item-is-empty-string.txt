Please consider this snippet:What would be Pythonic way to make this snippet return  even if item in iterable is empty string?Standard restrictions should apply - if item is  or  etc, it should return False as expected.
The only falsy string is the empty string, so if you don't want to test for it, then filter out the strings.
If you want True if there is at least one item that evaluates to True use .Note that in general  and  accept iterable argument and you don't need to loop over them.
This option looks nice to me.
You can use all, for instance:
