I have a huge array of JSON objects in a json file. some objects have more keys than others, but they are all keys that are fields in a model class that I have. I am wondering, what is the best way to iterate over each JSON object to create a model instance with the data from that object, creating null values for any field that the object does not include ? minerals.json (snippet)models.py
 and  can be very useful to solve your problem. (docs)
