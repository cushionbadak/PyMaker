I am Python newbie, and just become very interested in Lambda expression. The problem I have is to find one and only one target element from a list of elements with lambda filter. In theory, when the target element is found there is no sense to continue anymore. With  it is pretty simple to  the loop, but what about by using ? is it after all possible to do this? I search from Google, but did not find the expected solution  
From https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#filterNote that  is equivalent to the generator  expression  if function  is not  and  if function is  .So in practice your lambda will not be applied to whole list unless you start getting elements from it. So if you Only request one item from this generator you will get your functionality.@edit:To request one object you'd call Would output  and not process anything past  in 
with just lambdas is no possible, you need either use  ( in python 2) or a conditional generation expression, and call  on that one to get the first element out of it  For example, let said you want the multiple of 5 in a list
