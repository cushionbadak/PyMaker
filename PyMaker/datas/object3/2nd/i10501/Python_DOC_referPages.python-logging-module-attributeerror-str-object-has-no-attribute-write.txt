I am using Tornado, and in my app I import  so I can log some information about the server.I put this:right before:but when I run the server and click any link I get the following error:What is causing this?I've already changed to another directory to steer clear of namespace conflicts.
Psychic debugging says  has a key named  with a  value (probably a file path);  is only for already opened files, if you want to pass a file path, it's passed as .
