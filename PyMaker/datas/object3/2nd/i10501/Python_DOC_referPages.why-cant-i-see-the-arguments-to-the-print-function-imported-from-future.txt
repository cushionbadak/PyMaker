I noticed that I cannot use flush with the new python function after I import it using . In my journey to discover why I discovered I can't even inspect what arguments/parameters it takes. Why is it?First I made sure that the inspect function worked.Then I made sure that the print function was indeed a function.After those two (seemed to pass/check) I tried to inspect it but this failed and returned a weird error.here is what I did:and everything passed except inspecting print:Why is that happening?This is some info of my python and system:
Extracted from signature:NoteSome callables may not be introspectable in certain implementations of  Python. For example, in CPython, built-in functions defined in C  provide no metadata about their arguments.I've posted the signature docs because inspect.getargspec is deprecated since 3.0
The  keyword was added to print() in 3.3.C functions do not normally carry with them the information needed for introspection.  That is simply a fact of how C is defined and compiled.  As a substitute, signatures were added to their docstrings.  IDLE calltips fall back to the docstring if inspect does not work.In 3.4, a new mechanism was added to include a signature attribute with C-coded function.  The new inspect.signature uses it when present.  Some C-coded functions have been to converted to include the new attribute, many have not.
