This line makes sure that the key  is in the dictionary, before using it. Then you get the value from the dictionary corresponding to  and iterate it. You can simplify this with  method, which would return a default value, if the key is not there in the dictionary. So you can do something like thisIf the  doesn't exist in the dictionary, then an empty list is returned and the loop will have nothing to iterate.Similarly, you are checking if the key exists in the  dictionary, if not, setting a default value (which is a list). You can avoid that  also, with , like this is similar to , except that it sets the default value against the key and returns the value corresponding to the key.
You can solve it with a , iterating over the categories and appending keys:
