When doing automated tests, I like to make sure my script does not write any data to the disk. I am doing tests on the script as a whole, not unit tests of individual functions.Is there a way to intercept all Disk-IO that a python script performs from within this script?Obviously, I can mock the open function (e.g. with  the mock package http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock/helpers.html?#mock-open ) but the problem is that I need to know in what module the open happens. I have to mock  as well as  and  and so on.The problem is that I do not know what modules will write to files.
If mocking  is enough, you can stick the mock into the  module; this is the module that is consulted for all built-in functions:In Python 2, the module was called .Note that this doesn't necessarily catch all writes; anything that uses  to use OS filehandles directly or uses  or  could still end up writing to disk.
