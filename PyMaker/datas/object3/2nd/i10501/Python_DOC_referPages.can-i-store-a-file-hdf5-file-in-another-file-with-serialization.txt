I have a HDF5 file and a list of objects that I need to store for saving functionality. For simplicity I want to create only one save file. Can I store H5 file, in my save file that I create with serialization (pickle) without opening H5 file. 
You can put several files in one by using zipfile or tarfilefor zipfile you would  the database files and  your ed data.for tarfile you would  the database file and ,  your ed data from a file.I would suggest creating a zip if you do not need extended filesystem-attributes because it is a bit easier to use.
