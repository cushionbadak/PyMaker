Based on the explanation on Shared Variables in Python Class here , I expected the following code to give output as :But it is Code:Can somebody please help understand this ? My impression is that shared variables are same as static variables in C++ classes. Any insights to bust that myth, if it is so, would be helpful too. 
Initially, the class A has an  defined to be 123, which each of  and  use since neither has an  of their own.Then you execute , which creates an  for ;  still uses the one from .Then you execute , which updates the  for , which  still looks to, so it see the new value.  But  has its own , and so doesn't care.
You are creating a new instance variable ->  and setting it to . Access the shared static variable instead.I recommend reading the very informative Python official docs on [9] Classes.
@Scott Hunter's answer explains the behavior of code in question best but I would like to add C++ perspective to it here. Unfortunately it couldn't be added as comment in that answer as it is too long. As in C++, to access static members name needs to be qualified by class name (e.g.  or  ) , in Python also you have to access the shared variable outside the class using Class name as qualifier. Within the class, C++ allows to use the static variable name as like other member variables (i.e. without any qualifier) and same is true with Python as well, as shared variables can be accessed using self such as  here.Only thing which is different here is Python allows you to create an instance variable with the same name as shared variable for that instance only. 
Your expected output would mean that you can't change the attribute of an object without changing the attribute of every instance of the objects class. That would obviously break the core of the object orientation idea. I think you can overwrite "shared" variables because this gives just more possibilities.
