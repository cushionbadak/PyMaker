My SQL (sqlite3) query is along the lines of this:This returns a ton of rows.  I would like to create a dictionary from these results, where I can lookup the name given an id.Other answers I've found seem to create dictionaries based on SQL results, but they use the column label as the key -- I have no interest in that.Example table:Desired dict:
The result returned from cursor is a list of 2-elements tuples so you can just convert that to a dictionary as the first item of each tuple is a unique value:
You can loop over the rows (the result cursor is iterable), unpack the key and value, then assemble the result using a dict comprehension:I like using dict comprehensions because I can do additional processing to the results before adding to the dictionary (for example changing case, converting to decimal or datetime, etc).That said, if you want to go directly to the dict, ozgur has the shorter, faster way which is to call dict() directly:Here's an actual sample session demonstrating the process start to finish:
Suppose you get your sql query result in Python, something likeThen you can get all the query results in the return of .The result will be a list of tuples, each tuple will be like (id,name).Knowing this, then it is a piece of cake to transform it into an dictionary,just:
