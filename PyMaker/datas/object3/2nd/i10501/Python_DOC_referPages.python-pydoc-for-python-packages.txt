I'm trying to document a python package in init.py and it's unclear to me how pydoc parses a """triple bracketed""" comment to display to the user via:or How is the comment parsed to provide content in the NAME and DESCRIPTION sections of the pydoc output?  Are there other sections I can populate as well such as EXAMPLES?
Let's consider this dummy package:in  we have:Now running python shell:output is:Examples you can provide in description section. So in . Hope that helps.
Looks like the first line contains a short description (should not exceed one line, as described in PEP 257), that will be put after the name; followed by a blank line and then a paragraph, what will be used to provide content in the DESCRIPTION section.So, for instance if you have this in  (simple example with a module):(note that the doc string can be elsewhere, like in a  attribute, as stated here)then  will output:If your package is installed (in a virtual environment for instance), some more informations can be found by  from its  (like author's name etc.).Not sure about how to trigger an EXAMPLES section. Couldn't find any example of an EXAMPLE section in the  output of a standard python library yet (but I haven't browsed them all). Maybe you can add such a section in the long description in the doc string of your package. But as they don't seem to do it in the standard libraries, maybe it's not the right place to put examples?
