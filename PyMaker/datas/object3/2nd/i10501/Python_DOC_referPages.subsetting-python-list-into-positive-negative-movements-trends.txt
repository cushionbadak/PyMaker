Sorry for creating this question but I have been stuck on this question for a while.Basically I'm trying to take a list:And subset this list into a list of list that display positive/negative movements (or trends)The end result is to have:Basically I have been using nested while functions to append a positive movement to the subset, and when the condition is not met, the subset is appended to subset_list and then evaluates if there is a negative movement.I keep getting an , and so far  only contains Here is my code:Thanks!-Jake
This is what I came up with. It is close to what you have but a little easier to read. I avoid having to increment the index counter  as much which is probably where you went wrong.
Here is a way to re-write this:
In python, one tends not to use the actual indexes in a list very often. Try a for-loop instead, plus a check to see whether the trend changed or not (this treats zero as a distinct trend from positive or negative - you can pretty simply change  to group it one way or the other):
If change in trends always go through the sign change, you can "group" items based on a sign using :We are using  as a variable name for a "throw-away" variable since we don't need the grouping key in this case.
Here is my solution:Unfortunately, I only have python 3 on my system so my answer is in python 3.
