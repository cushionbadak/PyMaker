I am attempting to make a program in Python that copies the files on my flash drive (letter D:) to a folder on my hard drive but am getting a PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'D:'.The problematic part of my code is as follows:Everything seems to run fine until the copyfile() function runs, where it returns the error.I tried replacing getsource() with the destination of the file instead and it returned the same permission error except for the new_folder directory instead.I have read several other posts but none of them seem to be relevant to my case. I have full admin permissions to both locations as well.Any help would be greatly appreciated!
As I stated in my comment above, it seems as if you're trying to open the directory, , as if it was a file, and that's not going to work because it's not a file, it's a directory.What you can do is use  to list all of the files within your desired directory, and then use  to copy the files as you please.Here is the documentation for each of those:os.listdir() (You will be passing the full file path to this function)shutil.copy() (You will be passing each file to this function)Essentially you would store all of the files in the directory in a variable, such as , then loop through  by doing something like  and then use  to copy them as you please.
If you're looking to copy an entire directory and its contents, then  can be used.
