Does anybody has any code for converting tar.gz file into zip using only Python code? I have been facing many issues with tar.gz as mentioned in the How can I read tar.gz file using pandas read_csv with gzip compression option?
You would have to use the tarfile module, with mode  for reading.Then use zipfile for writing.You can use  to check for a valid tar file.Perhaps you could also use , but I think it cannot work on memory.PS: From the brief testing that I performed, you may have issues with members  which are directories.If so, you may have to use , or even first get the info on each tar file member with , and the open the  file for transferring to , since you cannot do it after  (you cannot seek backwards).
