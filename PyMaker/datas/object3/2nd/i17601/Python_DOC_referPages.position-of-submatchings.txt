Let's consider the following code.This gives the following output.Is it possible to ask directly to  positions of submatchings ? For example, I would like to know that  begins at 4 and ends at 11, but I only have the positions of the biggest current matching.
http://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.match.start ?So,  will return 4, etc. (same for , of course).
In addition to the first answer, which is certainly correct, you might also find  and  useful for something like this:The output is a  that has the matched string/substring as key and the indices as the value. For example, the following three s would be the result of your searches above:You could, of course, also reverse the keys/values in these dictionaries by using  instead of .
