This question already has an answer here:How do I sort a dictionary by value?                    42 answers                I have a python dict that looks like Within myCustomObject, I have an integer ID field. So that looks likeWould it be possible to order this dictionary by the ID property within the custom object???
A  inherently has an arbitrary order.If you just want to access it in a specific order one time, you can just sort it. If you don't know how to sort things using anything other than the default ordering, read the Sorting HOW TO. But basically:If you actually want to store them in that order, you need some time that maintains order. Of course a  will work, but an  works like a , except that it maintains the order of insertion, which is more convenient for most use cases. So, if you create a new  and then insert everything into it in sorted order, that would probably solve your problem:You can simplify this down to one line if you understand comprehensions:Variations on similar examples are shown in the docs under  Examples and Recipes.If you instead want the dictionary to maintain sorted order, you will need some kind of sorted dict class. The stdlib doesn't come with such a class, but there are many options available on ActiveState and PyPI. Some are implemented as an  that re-sorts itself every time you update them (or, sometimes, the first time you access them after an update, which allows a long chain of updates to avoid a long chain of sorts). Others use  or a search tree (e.g., a binary red-black tree or a 10-ary B-tree) to insert elements in the right place.
