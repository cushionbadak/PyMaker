At the moment I have a program which retrieves all of the information from the CSV file and outputs it like so:With the code I'm using being: What I'd like to do is check the user input against the usernames listed in the CSV file and if matches, print the corresponding INFO value. So if the username variable was example1, Banana would be printed. Is there any way of doing this, similar to MySQL etc.?Much appreciated!
If you need to match only once, just loop through the CSV file and test each row:If you need to refer to the different usernames in your code more often, and the CSV is not huge use a dictionary:
