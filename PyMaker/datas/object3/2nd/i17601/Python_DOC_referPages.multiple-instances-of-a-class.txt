I have a class called  and I need to create 100 points.I need to do something like:the points should be named , , ... The lines above do not work, obviously.The question is: I know that I could use  inside a loop to create the 100 points but is there any better way to do it without using ?
You can create several objects using list comprehension:
Creating/using dynamic variables is considered a bad practice in Python.  It is very easy for you to lose track of them, cause name collisions, etc.Instead, you can use a dict comprehension and  to create a dictionary of named instances:Then, you can access those instances by name like so:
Thank you very much for your answers. I learned a lot from them. Anyway, I don't need a list of points or a dictionary of points. Imagine I start writing:p1 = Point()p2 = Point ()...p100 = Point()I will obtain 100 points and nothing more. That is what I need. I believe it is not a good practice to put in the program 100 lines of code as above! Additionally, the number of points to create will possibly be variable. That is why I thought there should be an elegant way to do it. Thank you.
