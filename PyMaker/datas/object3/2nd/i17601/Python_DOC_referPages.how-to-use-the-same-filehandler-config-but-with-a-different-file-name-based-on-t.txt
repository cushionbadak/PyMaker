How to use the same FileHandler for several loggers but with a filename different based on the  on the logger?Can I avoid to write 3 times the file handler definition?Thanks
To do this, you'd need to create your own handler, which (for example) created a list of handlers and then passed each event to one of them based on the logger. It doesn't seem worth it just to save a bit of configuration.You don't have to repeat stuff unnecessarily in a configuration, you can refer to shared areas of the configuration as per the documentation.
