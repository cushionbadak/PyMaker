I am trying to make a code (in python) where I can input a range and it will find the sum off all the numbers besides the ones that are divisible by x (which i also choose).For example:if the range is  and  then I want the code to sum the numbers1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 7 + 8 and output 27.or if the range is  and  I want the code to sum the numbers 1 + 3and output 4But, the problem is I have no idea how to do it.
