I am working on a project which is based on python windows version. Now the customer wants the project to be extended to linux platform also.My project uses the package xlwt, xlrd for writing the results to the excel sheet.So here, Will these packages are compatible with the linux platform also? Can I use this package in Linux? Or Is there any equivalent package for Linux to write the result to a spreadsheet?Since my code is very huge,Is there any tool to convert the whole code from windows platform to linux platform? 
Yes, xlrd/xlwt work fine on Linux. Most python code and libraries run the same on any platform.
