I mean, if I have a function like this: How can I compare the 2 returns? I know that I can do this: But, can I compare the 2 of them without seting them in a variable? 
Use all.If you need just one positive result you can use any.
It depends on what you want to check. If you can send them to another function to do the checks, it will work without variables. Say if you want to check they're both True:or  for one of them.But if you say want to compare them with each other, you'd call the function twice:and that's usually not desirable. So there I'd simply use the variable.
simply use
use all command:
