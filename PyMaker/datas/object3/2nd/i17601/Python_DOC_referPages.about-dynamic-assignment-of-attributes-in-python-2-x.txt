When I try to dynamically add attributes to instances of object class, I get an AttributeError. However, it is possible do it with instances of subclasses of object.Does anybody know why?
There is a note in the documentation about that:http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#object"Note:  does not have a , so you canâ€™t assign arbitrary attributes to an instance of the object class."There is also a discussion about this on python mailing list:https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2011-October/614249.html
