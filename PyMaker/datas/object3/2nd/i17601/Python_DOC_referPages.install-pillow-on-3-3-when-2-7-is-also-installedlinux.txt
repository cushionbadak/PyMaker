I have both Python 2.7 and 3.3 installed on my system.  I'm trying to hopefully write everything for 3.3.  I've run into a snag.  I need to install Pillow on 3.3 so I can use Images.  How do I get it to install on 3.3.  If I tryIt comes up and says 'Requirement already satisfied(use --upgrade to upgrade): Pillow in /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages'How do I get Pillow to install on 3.3, since that is where I need it?I ran through the rest of the install(setuptools and prerequisites).  Not sure where they installed.  I did use the python3-setuptools for the initial install attempt.  I don't know if that helped to control the flow of the prerequisites to 3.3 or not.This is on a Linux system.
Your 2.7 and 3.3 have their own separate site-packages locations.And, just as they have their own separate executables (usually  and  for 2.7, and  and  for 3.3), when you install  for each one, they'll each have their own  scripts (usually , , and  vs.  and ).So, just do this:As a side note, if you use virtual environments, either via the third-party  package or the stdlib  package (3.3+ only, and really not worth using until 3.4), this problem goes away: when you're inside a virtual environment, it's either a 2.7 environment or a 3.3 environment, and it's as if nothing else exists.The basic design is explained in PEP 394. How  fits into that design is explained in… as far as I know, docs that haven't been written yet, but will hopefully be part of Python 3.4.0 and/or pip 1.5.something.Older versions of  (I believe before 1.5.0) would use  and  vs.  and , which obviously leads to a bit of confusion.And some distros have their own  packages that do things differently. And then there's Arch, where  actually means 3.2. And so on.But the basic idea is that when you have Python X.Y and V.W side by side, there will be some way to differentiate explicitly.
