I am running my unit test suit with Python 3 on code that was developed under Python 2. All unit tests passed under Python 2 but not for Python 3.  It seems there is some change in the implementation of , and it is a real head scratcher for me. Below is a minimal working example to replicate my problem:Clearly something is going on that I don't expect!  I am assuming that there is some set of default flags that are OR'd together to make  be 34 in python3.  What I want to know is what these are so that I can make my assertion pass by comparing against the proper flags.  As a bonus, what is the purpose for this?
Following are the RegEx flags, in Python 3.x.OutputFrom the ,Strings are immutable sequences of Unicode code points.So,  flag is enabled by default. Since you have enabled , that is ORed with  and that gives you .
It's because in Python 3, strings are unicode, and so it makes sense for the  flag to be on by default.Python 3:
After digging through the  source code, I found the following in "sre_parse.py":If the "UNICODE" flag is not added, it is added for you.  It's value is , so .This function does not exist in python2.x's implementation.
