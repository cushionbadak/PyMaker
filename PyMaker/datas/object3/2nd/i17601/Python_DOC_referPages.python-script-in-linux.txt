First of all, the first argument of  should be a list of arguments, not a single string, unless (a) you're using , or (b) writing code that's Windows-specific. Neither of those is true in your case.That being said, if you want to run that command, you should be using . Otherwise, you're just running the  command with  as a second argument,  as the third, and so forth. And  doesn't know what to do with that; it just looks for a file named , and fails. If you want to use shell features like  pipelines, you have to use the shell.While we're at it,  has no space between the hostname and the , which is unlikely to be what you want. That's one of the many reasons that -formatting or the  function is better:That being said, you shouldn't be using shell features you don't need. The docs have a great section on Replacing Older Functions with the  Module, and one of the first examples shows you how to replace the shell pipeline and do it all in Python.For that matter, there is almost never a good reason to pipe  to another program. Just pass it  as its input. In the shell,  is like  but a bit simpler and with less overhead; in Python, opening the file and then passing  is a lot easier than piping  to it.That being said, trying to drive  as a command-line app has all kinds of fiddly issues that you don't want to deal with; it's much better to use a library like  or .If, on the other hand, you really do want to use the  command-line tool and shell pipelines and so forth… bash is a much better language for that than Python.
