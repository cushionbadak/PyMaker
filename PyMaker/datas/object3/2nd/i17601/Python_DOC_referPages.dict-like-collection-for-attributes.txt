Is there a class in Python 2.7 that behaves like:for arbitrary attributes / constructor keywords? A  is close, but doesn't have attribute access nor such a nice constructor syntax.A named tuple comes close too, but I don't want to create a new type for each combination of attributes.Something like that would be handy to have sometimes. I could make one myself in a minute, but it sounds like something that might exist in Python already.
In Python 3.3, the standard solution is , but this is not backported to 2.7. A very similar type,  exists in 2.7. It's a little obscure but documented and hence okay to rely on.
Going along with the subclassing solution, you could do something like this:It looks a little weird, but it should work. It takes advantage of the builtin attribute location for python objects 
You can subclass  to do something like this:(Thanks to @delnan, two such objects are already available in standard library)
