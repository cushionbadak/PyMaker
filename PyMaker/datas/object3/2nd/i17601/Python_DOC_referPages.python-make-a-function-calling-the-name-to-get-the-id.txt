Sorry new to python, was trying to make a func when I say getID('foo'), it'll return me the id #. This is what I have but it doesn't get me what I wanted. Any help would be great thanks
Using the right data structure would make this a lot easierâ€”and, assuming you're calling  more than a handful of times, also a lot faster. (In general, when you find it too complicated to extract the information you want from your data, the answer is usually to change the data structure.)If you had a dictionary that mapped each  to the , you could just do this:If you've never seen the  before, it's equivalent to , except that if the key isn't present, you get  instead of raising a .So, how do you build that dictionary? Well, you already know how to iterate over your existing dictionary explicitly, so let's do it that way:If you want to make it more concise:Either way, you're just looping over the dictionary one time, to set up the  mapping, instead of every time you need to look up a name. And it's a simpler loop. And it means that each name lookup is now incredibly simple and incredibly fast.
 does not match global variable .Quote : without quote,  references  function.You don't need to iterate all dictionary entries to check  key, value.Just use , 
that's how you're not looping on all keys but take only the one you want
I'd call  on a generator that yields what you want; you can specify a "default" value if the generator is exhausted without yielding a result:(using python 3 syntax here, use  instead of  in python 2)
