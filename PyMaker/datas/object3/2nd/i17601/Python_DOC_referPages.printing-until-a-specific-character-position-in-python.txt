First I apologize if this is a question that has been answered many times, I searched around a while for an answer, but much of what I found went over my head since I am just beginning to learn python. But here's my question:I want to print periods until the 20th character or column of the row so that the data to the right of the periods all line up as shown below.Here's what I currently have but how would I account for the periods without actually hard coding them in?
