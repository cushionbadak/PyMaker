What is the easiest way to add a database to a python application, so that when compiled and then installed on another machine it isn't necessary to install a seperate dbms?
SQLite3 support is part of Python.  This is a file backed db, so no software needs to be installed outside your app.  Consider using the SQLAlchemy package for easier use.
Python includes the module  in its standard library.
As of I know it is not possible to bundle a RDBMS into python application and ship it for installation. But incase if you are looking for a way to store application data without the burden of installing an RDBMS you can useGDBM which is a database with key value pair much like python dictionaries but they are non volatile and so you can store them in disks and use them later. Python has a dbm library to access it.Or incase if you certainly need RDBMS you can check out installers which can do that for you during the time of application installation.
