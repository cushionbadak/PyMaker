How can I turn a python 3.3 script into executable file? I found PyInstaller and py2exe, but all did not support 3.3.http://www.pyinstaller.org/http://sourceforge.net/projects/py2exe/files/py2exe/0.6.9/Both of these tools support 2.7 at most. But my script is written in 3.3.And I searched the forum posts all pointed to old tools that did not support 3.3.
Here is the link for the Python 3 version of py2exe.Hope this is helpful.
You can use cx_Freeze with Python 3.3. http://cx-freeze.sourceforge.net/
Have you had a look at the Python 3.3 documentation? Specifically for Creating Build Distributions and Creating Windows InstallersFrom the docs:Since the metadata is taken from the setup script, creating Windows  installers is usually as easy as running: or the bdist command with the   option:This does presume you have a  file however.
Py2exe is now available for python3 also,download
