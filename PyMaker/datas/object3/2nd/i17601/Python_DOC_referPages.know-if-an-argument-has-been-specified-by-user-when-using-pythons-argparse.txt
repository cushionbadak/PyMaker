Let's say I have a python test using argparse, with several arguments:IP (default: 127.0.0.1)enabled_features (default: [A, B, C])Sometimes, I'd like to change the default enabled_features, let's say to [A,B,C,D]:depending on something I need the IP to find out (so it can't really be a default value in the way argparse has default values)only if the user hasn't specified the "enabled_features"... that's what I have trouble to know!So is there an attribute in the argparse classes to know, after:...that an argument was actually specified by the user, i.e. that one has used something like:and not:Thanks!
 contains all the information that  can give you.  So you have to either test for some default value (most commonly ), or the absence of the attribute (if ).Another approach is to specify a reasonable , and not worry whether the user specified those, or other values, in the input.  Which is more important, that the user specified the values, or the values themselves?
Something like...Would allow you to see if they specified the opt in the command line (assuming you've added the argument to the parser).
The parser object itself saves some useful information we can use to check out the defaults we assigned when adding the argument.Example script :In which case:Because we've done something non-default. Whileand Since this just has default input.Note that because we're checking against an entire list, there's some somewhat undesirable behaviour that order matters and IMO, this is a problem with lumping all the features into a single argument, but you can certainly work around it one way or another if you care.Then, if the user has/n't specified non-defualt , you can change them based on  as desired.
