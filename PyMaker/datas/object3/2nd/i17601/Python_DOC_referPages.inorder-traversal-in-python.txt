The problem I am tackle with is to find the first occurrence node in its inorder traversal in a BST. The code I have is given belowThis code always return None, what's wrong with it. I think I've return node when I find a node with value k. Why cannot python pass this node???Thanks in advance
When you call yourself recursively, like this:That's just a normal function call, like any other. It just calls the function and gets back a result. It doesn't automatically  the value from that function, or do anything else.So, you do the left-subtree search, ignore the results, then go on to check , and, if that fails, you do the right-subtree search, again ignore the results, and fall off the end of the function, meaning you return .To make this work, you need to  the value you got back. But, of course, only if it's . Also, you forgot to pass the  argument down to the recursive call, so you're just going to get a . (I'm guessing your real code doesn't have this problem, but since you didn't show us your real code, or a working example, I can't be sureâ€¦)So:(You don't need the  check for the right-side search, because if it returns , we have nothing else to try and are just going to return  anyway.)
My other answer gives the novice-friendly solution, but if you want more powerful and concise answer:This generates all matches in the tree, in order. And it gives them to you as an iterator, so if you just want the first, you can stop as soon as you find one, with no wasted work:The tutorial section on Iterators and the following section on Generators explains most of how this works. The only missing bit is an explanation of , which is explained in PEP 380.
Since your problem is , you should 1) traverse the tree in-order and 2) stop when you find the first occurrence.
