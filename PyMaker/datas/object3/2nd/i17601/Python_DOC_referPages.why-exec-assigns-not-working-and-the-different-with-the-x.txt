Locals in functions are highly optimized and determined at compile time, stored in an array on the frame. Each local name is merely an index in the byte code, indexing into that array. on the other hand tries to treat locals as a writable dictionary, but inside a function the dictionary returned by  is not connected to the actual locals array of a function. You cannot set locals with .Quoting the  function documentation:Note: The contents of this dictionary should not be modified; changes may not affect the values of local and free variables used by the interpreter.and from the  function:Note: The default locals act as described for function  below: modifications to the default locals dictionary should not be attempted. Pass an explicit locals dictionary if you need to see effects of the code on locals after function  returns.When you add the line  inside the function, then  is determined to be a local by the compiler.
