I want to redirect the  to a file. But This will affect the .  I need to redirect the output of  to  instead of .  How can I do that?
Redirect  to  temporarily, then restore.
The only problem with  is that it prints the prompt to stdout. Instead of trying to intercept that, why not just print the prompt yourself, and call  with no prompt, which prints nothing to stdout?And if you want to replace  with this:(For more info, see the docs on , the module that  and other built-in functions are stored in. You usually don't have to  it, but there's nothing in the docs that guarantees that, so it's better to be safeâ€¦)In Python 3.2+, the module is named  instead of . (Of course 3.x doesn't have  in the first place, it's been renamed , but the same idea could be used there.)
Use getpassThis will print the content  to stdout and  to stderr.Tested and works with python 2.7 and 3.6.
