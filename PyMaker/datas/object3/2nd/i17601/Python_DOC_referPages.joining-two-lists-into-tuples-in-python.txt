I want to use the join function in python (not any other function) to merge two lists into nested lists, assuming the lists are of equal length, for example:I want it to produce a new list like this:
I don't think you understand what  is for. is a string method that takes an iterable (usually a list) of strings and returns a new string object that is a concatenation of those strings separated by the string that the method was invoked on.Below is a demonstration:This means that you would not use  for what you are trying to do.  Instead, you can use  and a list comprehension:Note however that, if you are on Python 2.x, you may want to use  instead of :Like the Python 3.x ,  will return an iterator (instead of a list like the Python 2.x ).  This makes it more efficient, especially when dealing with larger lists.
Eureka! The join function you are looking for in this context, my friend, is the following::-)
