In my code I am writing dict-objects on every . One of the keys are called  and I want to create a  that just prints out the time and the value of the  key.I have tried the following but I get an error message: 
You need to pass just the template to the  class. The template will then be used later on to format your message. You also need to use named slots:You don't call  on it when creating the  object; at that moment there is no log message yet and no level to be filled in.See the logrecord attributes section for what names are available by default; any -style formatting in the second column of the table should be translated to new-style formats instead: becomes  or  becomes  becomes .etc.
