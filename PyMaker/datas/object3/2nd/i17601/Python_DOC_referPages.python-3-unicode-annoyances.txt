I have a string, created from a list. When I try to send the string as the body of an email, I get this error:UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character '\u2013' in position 1242: ordinal not in range(128)This is the "en" character, or dash, taken from a web page.So I tried to use this code to fix the issue:Problem is, that does not work. Please can you tell me what I am doing wrong here? 
Did you mean to replace string inplace? does not change the string inplace, but returns the replaced string.You need to assign the result of  back:
