I've got a class called Point with many functions. I put an extract code:When I call the functions I put this code:I put p.dist(q) and p.pto_medio(q) but I want to write dist(p, q) and pto_medio(p, q), respectivily. I've seen several solutions about that but all solutions give me error.Thanks!
I don't know why you want to do this… but if you want to, it's easy.In Python, an unbound method (that is, a method accessed as a member of the class object) can be called just like a function, by passing the  argument explicitly. So:In other words, the unbound method is the function you 'd in the class definition, with no magic whatsoever.*If you want to know how this all works under the covers, see the Descriptor HOWTO and how methods work.And there are plenty of cases where this is useful, beyond just adapting two pieces of code that were written incompatibly. For example,  and  don't take a function, they take any callable. Sometimes it makes sense to pass them an unbound method:If you couldn't pass unbound methods around like functions, you'd have to write that as:*** In Python 2.x, this isn't true; an unbound method is instead a bound method with  for the bound instance, and there's special magic to make it work. But in 3.0+, unbound methods are just plain functions.** Well, actually you could just use a comprehension: . But if you wanted to use , you'd have to build a wrapper.
