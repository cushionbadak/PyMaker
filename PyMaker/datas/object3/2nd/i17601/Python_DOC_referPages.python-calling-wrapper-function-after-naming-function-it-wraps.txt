I honestly don't know if this is good, bad, neutral, whatever.So far, so good -- functions are just wrapped, no big deal. Here's the bit that I don't know whether to consider a feature or not.Perhaps I know too little of the behind-the-scenes here, but Python has two wrapper functions in memory named , and a user can apparently 'switch' between them by just typing the name of the function it wraps.Is this a feature, and if it is, what would its primary application be? Or if it is not, is this best left forgotten about, because it's just a Bad Idea to try and featurize this behavior? My journeyman guess is that this is only doable because there are not real closures in Python (which probably puts it under  and I should not ever try to actually do this), but that's an uneducated guess.
That is a shortcut of the Python interpreter. The result of the last expression evaluated is assigned to  so that you can use it in subsequent operations.Like:Please note that this will work only in an interactive shell, not in a script, and only when  isn't already defined by you.
