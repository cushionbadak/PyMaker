This question already has an answer here:Java Equivalent to Python Dictionaries                    4 answers                So I have been searching and searching all day, but I cannot seem to find how to create my dictionary I created in Python and create something similar in Java. I have tried looking at ArrayList and List etc. But to no avail.So here is my Dictionary, and essentially what it does is just says from coords (0,0) being the top left point of each piece. It is a piece in and of itself.For example Piece 1 would look like:Similarly Piece 2 would look like:
You could try a The way you could use it:
It looks like you want... a  of s of some kind of pair or coordinate object.If you have a  class that accepts the coordinates as arguments (e.g. ), then you can just do something like the following: can also accept a  (instead of ) as a key for the lists within.
what about HashMap?for example:map.put("name", "value");
If you need to move data from Python to Java, check out JSON.In Python, you could use http://docs.python.org/3/library/json.htmlAnd for Java: http://json.org/java/
