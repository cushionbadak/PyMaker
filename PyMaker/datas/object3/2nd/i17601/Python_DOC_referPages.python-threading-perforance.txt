I would like to use   capability for my app, but had some performance issue (my guess). The site is hosted on  and it talks to a  server based on  to do some calculations. The  server is powered by .My question is:On the GAE side, I have a loop which calls the REST server multiple times to do the calculation. To improve performance, I use  library. But I found some of the calculations are missing. Usually, I do not have this issue if only twenty jobs are fired, but I do have this issue when 200 jobs are fired. I appreciate any suggestions.Here is my code:Below is the error message for one job (usually I receive sever this type error message):
If the problem is one of overload, this problem might benefit from a "pool of workers" strategy.This way, you can control how many simultaneous requests are taking place by limiting the quantity of threads.FYI: Python is not really good at threading (depending on the interpreter). Some interpreters have a Global Interpreter Lock that prevent multiple threads from running at once. Threading works OK for I/O bound tasks, but not for making efficient use of the CPU. For simultaneity, use multiprocessing. The changes to my (untested) sample code above would be to use  instead of  and create a  instead of a .
