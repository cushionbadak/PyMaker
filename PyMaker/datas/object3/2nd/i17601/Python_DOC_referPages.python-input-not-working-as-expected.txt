This question already has an answer here:Receive a string, convert to calculate and display response, but.. Can't split                    2 answers                I am a python newbie.I am getting familiar with loops and tried this example from a bookHowever the output is as follows
You have to use  instead (Python 2.x), because  is equivalent to , so it parses and evaluates your input as a valid Python expression.Note:  doesn't catch user errors (e.g. if user inputs some invalid Python expression).  can do this, because it converts the input to a . For futher information, read Python docs.
you want  in python2 tries to evaluate (dangerously!) what you give it
Your code will work fine in python 3.xBut if you are using python 2 you will have to input string using raw_input()
It seems like you're using Python 2.x, while the code is expected to be run in Python 3.x. in Python 2.x evaluates the input string unlike  in Python 3.x.
In Python 2.x  is designed to return numbers, int or float depending on the input from the user, you can also enter variable names.you need to use:The error is caused because Python thinks that "ljsdf" is the name of a variable, and that's why it raises this exception:becuase "ljsdf" is not defined as a variable. :D is safer to use, and then convert the input to whatever other type after :D
