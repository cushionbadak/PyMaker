In case of for loop in PHP i wroteIs it similar to the for loop below in PythonSimilarly in case of While loop in PHP i usedIs it similar to the while loop below in PythonIf not, what is correct version of for and while loop in Python following the one in PHP.
Yes, these are similar.They're not exactly identical, but the differences won't matter in most code.*And using  directly as a test, rather than an  method/function, is the Pythonic way to do it, as recommended in PEP 8:For sequences, (strings, lists, tuples), use the fact that empty sequences are false.So, you've done everything exactly right.Of course in some cases, using a list comprehension or generator expression (which have no direct analogy in PHP) may be more concise or readable than a  statement, but you never need to use them.* First, a Python  loop creates an iterator from the source, then calls  over and over until  is raised, which is pretty different from what happens under the covers in PHP. Unless you're using very weird types, or trying to mutating the object you're iterating over during iteration, you'll never notice the difference. Second, in Python, unlike PHP,  could theoretically be something which is an iterable, but not a sequence, like an iteratorâ€”in which case  will not work. That's unlikely for something you've named , however. 
Both of your for loops are fine. They are same/similar. But the while loops are different from one another:is checking the list not empty and going through it. On the other hand,will not be working if my_queue is not a boolean value. Hope that helps.
