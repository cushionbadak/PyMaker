I have been looking at some code for a small chat program that I found online. It was originally written for 2.7, but it seems to work with 3.2. The only problem is that I cannot send strings, only numbers:The chat.py file source code:And the client.py source file:When I run these using two separate terminals, they work, but do not send strings.Thank you
When you work with sockets, the message you're passing around should probably be in bytes, . In Python 2.x, a  is actually what a  is in Python 3.xSo your message should be something like:Check here http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/stdtypes.html for more information.According to http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input  returns a , which means you'll have to encode  into  as such:Do verify that this is the right approach to convert  to  by checking the type of .
Your socket code is correct, it was just failing due to an unrelated error due to  vs . You probably intended to read a string from the shell instead of reading a string and trying to evaluate it as Python code which is what  does.Try this instead:chat.pyclient.py
