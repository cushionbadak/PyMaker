I have a webserver setup using Flask, and it works. In addition, I have a demo TCP server, which also works. I want them to run in the same process, so they can communicate; however, I am running into difficulties, as they both want to open a port, and I get the error:My understanding is that one process cannot open more than one portâ€”but correct me if I'm mistaken. Is it possible to run subprocesses each with their own port? Or is there an easy way to communicate between processes in Python?What's the best way to get a webserver and a TCP server to communicate information, such as updates to one reflecting in the other?Thanks!
use different port number for flask web server and TCP server.
A process can use multiple ports, but you normally don't want multiple processes using the same port.In this case, you probably just need a pair of SO_REUSEADDR's, one in each of your processes:http://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.htmlNormally, a *ix kernel will refuse to allow getting data from a port, even after the process that was using it exits - for a while.  This is seen as a security issue, because otherwise some other process could listen on the port afterward, and get data that was intended for the first process.  SO_REUSEADDR tells the kernel "Don't do that".
