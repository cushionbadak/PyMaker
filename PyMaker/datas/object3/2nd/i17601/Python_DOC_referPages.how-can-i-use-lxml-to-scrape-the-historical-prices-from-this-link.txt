How can I use Python lxml etree to scrape the historical prices of funds from this link:http://www.aia.com.hk/en/individual/resources-guides/investment-information/underlying-funds-historical-prices/The link of each individual fund page is similar to the following; however, I don't know how to get there:
First you need to obtain the url of the iframe containing the links:Then download/parse this frame with lxml, and get your links from here:If you want what's inside , I guess you could finish the job with substring/regex...And if you wonder how I got these XPaths, on Chrome you can ctrl+shift+i -> rightclick on a node -> copy XPath, and test them with  on the console. I also had to disable JavaScript (ctrl+shift+i -> settings icon -> General -> Disable JavaScript) to block the automatic redirection triggered when loading the iframe.
