I have some code that makes an API call, formats the data, and appends it to a csv. Due to concerns about thread safety, I store all rows in a list before writing to the csv.Is there a more canonical/faster way to do this? I have looked at the answer here Multiple threads writing to the same CSV in Python, and I don't want to put a lock in extract_data to write because it would slow down the API calls due to causing a bottleneck for the threads to write. For example is there another data structure I could use instead of the results list (something like a threadsafe stack) that I could pop stuff off to write to csv, while stuff keeps getting added to it?
No matter which structure you will use to replace your list, it will mandatory use locks internally. You can use a queue for example, which is thread-safe, but it uses a lock internally.
