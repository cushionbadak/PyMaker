Assuming your script doesn't exit due to any kind of failure (exception, syntax error) and the script doesn't exit due to  or , how does Python figure out what exit code to exit with?It seems to be 0, which makes sense since it indicates no-error on *nix systems.  However, will that always be the case that it exits with 0 (except for the cases above)?  Surprisingly after quite a bit of online searching, I couldn't find anything which explicitly said that it would exit with 0 unless otherwise specified.
 documents a default exit status of , and 's docs specify a UNIX-like OS constant for "normal" exit status, , but there is no documented guarantee I can find for the exit status in general.Aside from that, the best I can give you is that in CPython, the  executable (including / on Windows) is implemented in  by calling  and returning whatever it returns; per the documented guarantees on , the exit status is: if the interpreter exits normally (i.e., without an exception),  if the interpreter exits due to an exception, or  if the parameter list does not represent a valid Python command line.Note that if an otherwise unhandled  is raised, this function will not return , but exit the process, as long as  is not set.so this implies that simply running off the end of the  module without an active exception should always return  for CPython, though alternate interpreters are not technically required to do the same.
If you look at the cpython source code: in  returns the return value of   in  returns the return value of , also in  returns  unless  returns non-zero in  will  inthe event of a  exception and so will not return if thescript sets an exit code. It will only return non-zero if thereis an internal error.So the return value of  is what makes the default exit code of a script .
Exiting with 0 predates Python by a long time, it is part of the POSIX standard. All well-behaved programs indicate a successful exit with 0.
Python's default exit code is 0. This is documented here https://docs.python.org/2/library/exceptions.html#exceptions.SystemExitHowever, the exit code will be whatever the is specified in the  or  functions. So, if you are using a script, you should always check within the script or script documentation what that particular script will return. For example: you could launch python in a terminal, and just type  and it exits with return code of 1 even though there are no errors.
