I'm a beginner in python and i started to learn python 3 without learning python 2. I'm trying to apply the  function which I've learnt  that is not supported in python 3. running it gives following error:I intend to get the output as . How can I do that?
Answer to the questionDon't use the name  for your string variable. It will mask the built-in :Output:Your  and  must have the same length. Most functions from  in Python 2 became methods of  for a while in Python 2 and were dropped as functions from  in Python 3. So use .Solving the problemIf want to remove characters from a string you can do:Output:If you want to remove numbers you can also do:Output:
Use  static method instead (note that you don't need to import it).
As already mentioned in from Python 3.x you need to use the static method . That being said the  and  must have equal length.But you can also do this using regular expression
