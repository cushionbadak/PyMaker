1. IntroductionI have a bunch of files in netcdf format. Each file contain the meteorology condition of somewhere in different period(hourly data).I need to extract the first 12 h data for each file. So I select to use NCO(netcdf operator) to deal with.     NCO works with terminal environment. With , I can get one datafile called which contain the first 12h data of .2. My attemptI want to keep all the process inside my ipython notebook. But I stuck on two aspects.   How to execute terminal code in python loopHow to transfer the string in python into terminal code.    Here is my fake code for example.     3. ConclusionBasically, my target was letting the fake code  coming true.  That means:execute netcdf operator directly in python loop......using  which is an string in python environment.   Sorry for my unclear question. Any advice would be appreciated!
You can use  to execute external program:NOTE: updated the code to use ; you don't need to check extension manually.
You may also check out pynco which wraps the NCO with subprocess calls, similar to @falsetru's answer. Your application may look something like
