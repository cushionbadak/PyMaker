The default mode of  is , e.g. binary. You have to provide the mode explicitly for text:
The default mode used to open the file returned by  is . The  in that string means it's opened in binary mode, and you need to pass  instances to its  method, rather than  instances like you're doing.You have a few options. You could encode your string to . Or alternatively, you could pass a mode to  to have it open the file in text mode (so that  expects Unicode  instances). Using a proper mode is probably the better solution, but your mileage may vary.
The docs explain that  uses binary mode by default when opening a file to write to. Therefore, you can't write strings to it (this only works in text mode), only  objects. So either override that default (as in Daniel's answer), or encode your strings with the appropriate encoding:or use a  object right away:
