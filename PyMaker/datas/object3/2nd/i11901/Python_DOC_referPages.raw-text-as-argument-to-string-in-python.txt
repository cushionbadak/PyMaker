Natural Text
I have a function:and a list:When called it looks like this:and outputs:The thing is, as you can see I must use a string as the argument, is there any way I could type in raw text and then convert it to a string inside the function so that I don't have to use quotes?
First, "raw text" isn't a term. I believe you're asking if you can pass a variable directly to a function that prints the variable's name and value.This isn't possible because variable names are not directly tied to the values they represent - they're pointers or references. That means that when you call  the value  references is passed to , but not the name "my_list".If your intent is to print a variable name along with its value you need to do some sort of reflection (which your  method is doing) in order to inspect the current state of your program and identify the variable named .Of course since you have to specify the variable name as a string anyways, you might as well just define a simpler function that associates a text label with a variable, like so:Which you could call like so:But you could also put more context in the  field, e.g.:To further aid debugging. You might also like to look into the Python debugger , since you're basically manually recreating a debugger.
