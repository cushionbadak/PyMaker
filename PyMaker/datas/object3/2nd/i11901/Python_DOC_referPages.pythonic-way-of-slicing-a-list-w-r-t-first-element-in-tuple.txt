I have a sorted list of tuples of the formI want to slice the list such that all numbers of (x,y) where x is a certain value in the new list and the order is kept. Now, this would obviously work:But it is really slow. It would be faster to find the first and last index that satisfies this condition with binary search.  gives you the first index for a value, and  of the reversed list would give the last index. How would apply it though without doing  and copying the whole list, in a pythonic way?
As suggested in the comments by @Liongold, you can use bisect. Assuming you want all tuples  with :You can find details in the bisect docs.
