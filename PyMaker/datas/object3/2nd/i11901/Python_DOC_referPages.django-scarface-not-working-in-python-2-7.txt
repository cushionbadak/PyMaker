My OS is OSX El Capitan.Versions:Python 2.7.10Django 1.9.2Django-Scarface 3.0After I install scarface and add it to the installed apps, it gives this error and i can't run my application.After I've search for this error, I think that reason is my python version.Still I'm not sure, therefore I'm asking to you.Is there any way to fix this? If the reason is really my Python version, how can i update my python version without damaging my code and everything?
The problem is related to metaclass syntax change in Python 3.x (https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html?highlight=metaclass#changed-syntax), django-scarface is 3.x oriented. I solved the problem (with Python 2.7.x) changing in platform_strategy.py (Line 38) to this: I submitted a pull request in github project: https://github.com/dreipol/django-scarface/pull/11
In the packaging instructions Python 2.7 is supported https://github.com/dreipol/django-scarface/blob/master/setup.py#L30.You could run the package tests https://github.com/dreipol/django-scarface/blob/master/scarface/tests.py inside a virtualenv with Python 2.7.10 to see if they pass. If they don't then there's nothing wrong with your code. If they do pass then the problem might not be in the package itself.
