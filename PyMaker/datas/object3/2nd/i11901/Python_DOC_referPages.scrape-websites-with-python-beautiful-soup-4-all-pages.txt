i am very new to Python, and i am trying to Scrape data from a website, but i need  all pages, so far i have : This code prints data from current page, how can i manage to take data from all pages , and exported to a file. Best regards
Personally, I would use the  library for date arithmetic - it's what it's designed to do.However, since 's  is locale-based, it's safer to do the construction of the string manually, unless you intend on running this on a known locale that matches the website's.
So to add to the question raised in the comments, how to iterate through multiple dates.  I'm not the most proficient programmer, but I would create a dictionary with the key:value => month:number of days in the month.  Then you could create a nested loop to create strings to append to the url.
