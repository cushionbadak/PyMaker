Im having some problems playing a random sound using mpg321.First I make a list of all the sounds and also store the length in a variable I then create a random number between 0 and the length of that list. My problem is I do not know how to add that to the string inside os.system() for the file path.I have tried using %s and putting the variable in after ./sounds/ but I get a syntax error saying os.system() only takes one argument.Any help is appreciated.
The problem is that you need to do string formatting on the string, not on the function callBy the way, I would use subprocess, which provides a much more handsome API than os.system! (https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.call)
