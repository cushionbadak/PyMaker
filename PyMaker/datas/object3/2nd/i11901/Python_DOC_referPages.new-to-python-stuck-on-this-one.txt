This is my first post but I've found a lot of great information here via Google. At the moment, I'm working through Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner. I'm stuck on one of the challenge questions relatively early on in the book. The challenge is to create a program that will guess a number you've randomly selected between 1 and 100. At this point it works, weeds out non-valid answers, and guesses eventually if you play by the rules. If you play the game honestly, it works. However, if you put "lower" instead of "higher" it gets to a point where the program crashes. This works, but I would rather reset the counter and chastise the user with a message.Anyway, here's my code so far. You can see what where I have been trying to make if work with the first "if" clause of the while loop. What do you think?
The error you get is that you pass an invalid range to , for example:randrange is internally used by  and expects a  and a  value as the first two arguments. It indirectly requires that  is lower than .In your code, you use  with the arguments  and , so you have to take care that  before you call .You already have a check in place with that first  inside the loop (btw. note that  is the same as —you just read it in another direction), but it’s being checked at the wrong time: You want to perform that check after one of those boundaries changes and before you call .One way to do that is to change your flow like this:Here, we only change the boundaries when we parse the user’s input. If the user entered something invalid, we just ask them again and continue the loop from the beginning (skipping the lower part). Otherwise, after the boundaries are updated, we perform the validation on the boundaries and only then use  to make a new guess.That way, we ensure that we only ever use  with valid boundaries.
