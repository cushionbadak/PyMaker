I am new to programming so when I wanted a command to turn a hard-coded function's name into a string, I looked it up and started using the built-in  function. The problem is that I don't think I understand how  retrieves the wanted name. I know it has something to do with what is currently visible with local() or dir() but that's about it... (my own research on this topic has been kinda of hard to understand for me) As a result, I stumbled across an error that I don't know how to solve.Here is some code that recreates my error:I get this error message:So why is that when I put my static method into a list and then try to get the function's name from the list it doesn't work? Please forgive me if this question is dumb. As you can clearly see, I don't understand the underlying principle of how  works (and other stuff that I just don't know about to even give these topics names!). An answer would be nice but a reference to some docs would be also welcome.
With this codeThe function  is wrapped in a . When you access a  from a class some magic happens to the  and you actually get a proper function back. Thats why you can access its Putting the  in a list and accessing it from that list prevents the magic from happening and you get the  object back.As a  does not have a  you get an  when accessing its .To solve your problem you could get the underlying function from the To find out more about the "magic" that happens when you access attributes/methods from a class/object look up descriptors
