I'm writing a program, which, inter alia, works with temporary file, created using  library.The temporary file creates and fills in function:(I use  and not  because I execute the temporary file after calling )After some operations with  outside , I call . And all works fine.But I have one problem. If my program fails (or if I interrupt it), the temporary file doesn't remove.How do I fix it ?I really don't want to write  clauses because I'll have to write it so many times (there are many points, where my program can fail).
First, use a  statement, and pass  to the constructor.Then you need to put the necessary error handling in your program.  Catch exceptions (see try..finally) and clean up during program exit whether it is successful or crashes.Alternatively, keep the file open while executing it to prevent the automatic deletion-on-close from deleting it before you have executed it.  This may have issues on Windows where it tends to have conflicts using files that are open.
