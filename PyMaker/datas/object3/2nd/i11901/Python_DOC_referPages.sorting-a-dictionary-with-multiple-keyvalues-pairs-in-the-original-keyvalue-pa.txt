I have a dictionary:I need to run a function where the user can view all of the accounts either by sorting by account number (accno), name, or balance.I have an if, elif, else statement and I have the sort by accno working. I can't seem to be able to sort by Name or Balance. I have seen some complicated code but couldn't get it to work the way I need. So I decided to try to make all the "Name" values get put into a list, which I could then sort; however, the problem is each value gets put into a separate list with each character separated.Any help is deeply appreciated. I am very new and am in a boot camp for learning python in a couple weeks. The instructor is more of a Google the answer, so I am trying to learn as I go. Thanks!
The trick is to use the  parameter to the  function; this will allow us to use any key in a data structure we want as the comparison value for sorting.Another thing you want to do is to effectively split the program in three more or less separate parts:Get user inputMake a sorted data structurePrint out this data structure.If you don't do this, you end up repeating yourself. In your example you're doing looping over and printing out  in two places − now what if you want to change something later? You'd have to change it in two places ;-)Here's a full example with commented added:Notice how this function is now separated in three independent parts − parts that you can now move to their own functions.
Your primary dictionary has accno as key.Create 2 index dictionaries, having name and balance as keys and accno as elements of a value list. (Since a name or balance can occur multiple times)With each insert in the prim dict, also insert in the index dicts under the right key.With each delete from the prim. dict., also delete from the index dicts using name and balance as keys. As the list for a name or balance gets empty, delete the whole element of the index.You can now simply sort the keys from each dict. This is (normal) "database indexing".
Thanks for the input! I like carpetsmoker's answer. I did come up with the below solution on my own as well, and would repeat that elif statement for my other value "Balance":
