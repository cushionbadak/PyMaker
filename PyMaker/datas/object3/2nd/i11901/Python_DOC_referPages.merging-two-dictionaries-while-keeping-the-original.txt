In Python, when I merge two dictionaries using the update() method, any existing keys will be overwritten.Is there a way to merge the two dictionaries while keeping the original keys in the merged result?UpdateSay we had the following example:Can we merge the two dictionaries, such that the result will keep both values for the key ?I'd like  to look like this:
If it's alright to keep all values as a list (which I would prefer, it just adds extra headache and logic when your value data types aren't consistent), you can use the below approach for your updated example using a Prints:You also have the below approach, which I find a little less readable:This wont modify any of the original dictionaries and print:
Output:{'c': 3, 'd': 2, 'e': 3, 'b': 2, 'a': (1, 10)}
UpdateAfter the update to the question I would agree with BAH's implementation of using a defaultdict with a list
