I'm new to Python and I'm working with a 2D list and not exactly sure how to get the average of the rows.For example I have this list:and I would like to get the average of the first and second row.Something like this:(70 + 80 + 90)/3 = 80(30 + 40 + 50)/3 = 40I'm implementing my  function, but I'm a little lost. Someone tell me what I'm doing wrong please.Here's my code:
This should do what you want. Hope it helps!
If you want, you can use numpy package and its function .To compute the average mark of each student, given , the code would look like:Note that  determines that the average is calculate over the rows.With the list in the example provided, the output is:Similarly, you can get the average for every exam using the same numpy function:In this case  to get the average over columns, and the result for the list provided in the example is:About the problem in your , is the main problem.  returns a list of integers starting from 0 to the length of the list, which in the example is 2. With the  statement you iterate over each value of the list from , and then you are trying to use  over an integer, which does not work as it is not a list. The solution that follows more closely your code is already provided in another answer.
How about this logic
list comprehensionjust for print
