I'm trying to write custom mail agent.I am trying to fetch all mails, but my mailbox has polish letter in mailboxnames...So this code (cut all prints from listing):Gives me for example mailbox:decoded = (\Flagged \HasNoChildren) "/" "[Gmail]/Oznaczone gwiazdk&AQU-"See: &AQU-... it is polish "Ä…"Question is how to get rid of this? I cannot find how to decode this bytecode
The encoding is IMAP4 Modified UTF-7, which is a convention used for international mailbox names, as defined in RFC3501, section 5.1.3.Unfortunately, the imaplib module doesn't currently support it - although there are several issues on the python bug tracker that suggest that may change in the near future (e.g. issue 5305 and issue 22598).Anyway, in the meantime, it looks like you will have to find a third-party package to handle this (e.g. imapclient).
