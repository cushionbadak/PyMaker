I am using an API to request data from a website. The data can be found here and pasted into a JSON Viewer. My code along with the error that it is returning are below. I am guessing that this is a quick fix, partially reflecting the fact that this is my first time using urllib.Any suggestions, comments, or further questions are appreciated.
 won't guess the encoding, so you typically need to  the bytes from the object returned and then convert those bytes into a string by using  and the appropriate codec.  e.g.:There is an example of this in the official documentation.Specifically, it says:Note that urlopen returns a bytes object. This is because there is no way for urlopen to automatically determine the encoding of the byte stream it receives from the http server. In general, a program will decode the returned bytes object to string once it determines or guesses the appropriate encoding.
