Here startH, startM, stopH,stopM means starting hour,starting minute, stopping hour, and stopping minute. which is the input given by the user through android. This code runs. It runs onces and then it keeps running. Here is the suitation. If i want the user to input the time again. It wont accept. How can accept the input from the user while the loop is still running?lets just say the first task says to turn on the light then the second task is turning off the light. So when second task is done. It is assumed as complete.I tried using break, return. It does not work as it is supposed to.
You can use threading.Here's a very simple example:import threadingimport timeYou can still input stuff while the  is generating numbers.Unless you really have to, don't print in the  function since stdout can get messy.
