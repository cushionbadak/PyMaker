I have this function:And I want to take number of subjects, then take grade letter of each by calling "findScore' and then return GPA by using one more fucntion like this:Noted:number of subject (n) and a list of grade letters (list)"findGPA() must call findScore() to turn each grade letter to grade point.What is the function body ?I want the output should be like:
 doesn't actually need its first argument like you've proposed, because you could just find the length of the list of grade letters.You can use your  function with a list comprehension to work out the score for each grade, and then sum these with the  function. Finally, this is divided by the length of the scores list, found with the  function.This can be done like so:This then gives your desired output:
Use a dictionary for the grade scores, then simply do lookups for each grade in the list passed in, sum the divide by the number of grades:Output:Personally I would do it all in a single function and just take a list of grades, you can get the number of subjects from the list passed in so num is not really needed.A dict is the most efficient way to do your lookups but if you have to use lists maybe then you can use a the logic closely related  to an example in the biect docs: will also handle an empty list:Using bisect you can search a sorted structure in  time as opposed to potentially looking at every element.
Actually you don't need two functions for this also you can completly remove the first argument to your  function and use the built-in  function.If you are on Python 3.4 or newer you can use the  function from the statistics module.Demo:
