I have 2 lists: , and . Using Python 2, how can I compare each list element in  to each element in ? (i.e. is , is , etc).I know that I could just write out numerous  statements, but I hope that there is a more elegant way to do this.After checking each list element, I want to know how many times a shared value was found (in my example lists above, it would be one time, ).EDIT: This is not a duplicate, b/c i am comparing two different lists to each other, while the possible duplicate dealt with only 1 list.
The  method of  may help:
Probably faster for big inputs than eugene y's, as it only needs to iterate over  once,instead of  times:
If you are only concerned with shared values, and not with their positions or counts, convert them to  and use :If you want to retain how often the elements appear in the intersection, you can also do an intersection of  using Note: This is different from the solution by @GingerPlusPlus in that it is symmetric, i.e. if  is present once in list  and twice in list , then the shared count will be , not .
This function can compare as many lists you want with equal length. Just call cmp(list1, list2, list3)
This code will produce list of elements which is consist in both  and  listIt might be complex by memory in case if you use big arrays but if you plan to use this data than why not
