I am attempting to read my players health.  I have been on a roll but have run into a problem. I am able to read what type of information is at a certain address but can't read what the actual value is, for example here is the response I receive.I am looking for what information is held in the c_char_Array_64 object but have no idea how I would go about it.Here is my code:
You need to get the value:From the docs:If you need mutable memory blocks, ctypes has a create_string_buffer() function which creates these in various ways. The current memory block contents can be accessed (or changed) with the raw property; if you want to access it as NUL terminated string, use the value property: 
The empty slice of most  array types will return the Python equivalent type.  So to convert your 64 byte buffer to a  (in Py3 ), you can do:That will read the full raw 64 bytes mind you. If you want to read it as a C-style string (so the first  byte terminates the Python equivalent ), you'd use :
