First of all I would like to say that I am new to this website and any criticism is appreciated.I am trying to modify a Python script to read an rfid key and then pipe the variable UID to a script (bash) that will authenticate it etc.  So far I have managed to isolate the UID and I can print it in python but I can't get it in the bash script. Here is the string I use to print the uid, how can I pipe that to a bash script?  Thanks!
Use the subprocess module:If you use a python version prior to 3.5, instead of  you have to use .For this to work, the bash program must accept the uid as command line argument. If you need to pipe the string to the bash script, some more work is necessary:Read https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html for further insights. The interface has changed quiet a bit, so be aware of your Python Version. 2.x works differently than 3.4 than 3.5. There are compatible ways though.
