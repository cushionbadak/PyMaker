I've got an object which I print to the terminal, and it looks like this:So I then wondered from which function this the result is. So I tried the following:As you can see, neither of these functions displays what the  statement shows. I always thought that  actually shows the result of either ,  or , but that is clearly not the case. So what does  actually call?
It is easy enough to check this sort of thing:In fact what happens internally is that  (as a function that is, I haven't checked the opcode though I think it is the same) calls PyFile_WriteObject with the Py_PRINT_RAW flag.int PyFile_WriteObject(PyObject *obj, PyObject *p, int flags)Write  object obj to file object p. The only supported flag for flags is  Py_PRINT_RAW; if given, the str() of the object is written instead of  the repr(). Return 0 on success or -1 on failure; the appropriate  exception will be set.
Called by  and the built-in functions  and  to compute the >'informal' or nicely printable string representation of an object. The return value must >be a string object.This is from python documentation. So clearly,  function will call defined , if you define both  and  inside the class. But in the case you just implement , then  shall use .Hope this will help.
