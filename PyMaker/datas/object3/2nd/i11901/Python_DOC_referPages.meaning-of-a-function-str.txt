The final  implies that this function, should have a return type of  as well.For more information see:What are Type hints in Python 3.5https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.htmlhttps://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/
It specifies the return value. It has nothing to do with the code at all and is just for documentation purposes.
