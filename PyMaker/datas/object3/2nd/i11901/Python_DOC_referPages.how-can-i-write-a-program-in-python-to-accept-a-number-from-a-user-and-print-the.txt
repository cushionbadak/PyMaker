You have multiple problems in your code. Let’s start in the order of execution: – Assuming that  is supposed to return the product of the digits of the number you pass in, then this would always return  since you pass  (which is zero) instead of the number the user entered (). –  loops iterate over the elements of something, not the indexes. In this case, this will iterate over the characters in the string . This means that in each iteration  will be a single digit. – In every loop iteration, you reset it to zero.Similarly  at the end of the  loop will not cause any effect, since at the beginning of the next iteration,  will be zero again. You probably meant this line to be inside the  loop (it has the wrong indentation level for that though). – So inside the loop where you are iterating over the digits of the number, you then want to iterate over the digits again? Why – Statically multiplying five digits here defeats the purpose of handling every number – instead of just those numbers that have 5 digits. – In order for that to work,  needs to be lower than  but you are iterating until  is . – You should have your function return the product instead of printing it.A possible solution could look like this:
