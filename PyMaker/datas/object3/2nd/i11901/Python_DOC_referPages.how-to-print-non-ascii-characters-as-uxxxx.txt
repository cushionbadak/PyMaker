How do I do this? I want to print all non-ascii characters in strings as unicode escape literals
You can convert strings to a debug representation with non-ASCII, non-printable characters converted to escape sequences using the  function:As , return a string containing a printable representation of an object, but escape the non-ASCII characters in the string returned by  using ,  or  escapes.For Unicode codepoints in the range U+0100-U+FFFF this uses  escapes; for the Latin-1 range (U+007F-U+00FF)  escapes are used instead. Note that the output qualifies as valid Python syntax to re-create the string, so quotes are included:If you must have  for everything, you'll have to do your own conversion:The above function does not add quotes like the  function does:
Do note that what without replacing  with , what you want is not reversible; eg. you can't know whether the actual string was  (one character) or  (6 characters in ascii range), since both would produce  as output. Martijn's suggestion does the backslash-replacement, and is reversible.You could just make the conversion yourself:(Martijn's note about characters outside the BMP still applies)If you want to do this to everything your program outputs, and trying to remember to pass everything through a conversion function doesn't seem like your idea of a good time, you could also try something like this:This creates a custom encoding error handler, which handles UnicodeEncodeErrors by replacing the offending character with a unicode escape. You can use it like , or like the example above, replace the stdout with one that uses it automatically for all encoding.
The normal representation is obtained by using the  builtin as explain by Martijn Pieters.If you really want to constently print \u escapes, you can do it by hand:gives as expected:NB: I do know that eval is evil but in that particular use case I know that the inner string contains no  and that it is enclosed in  so it can not be more than a mere conversion of encoded characters - but I will never do that on a external string without at least testing ...NB2: this method cannot process correctly characters whose code is greater than 0xffff - it would need another if else...
