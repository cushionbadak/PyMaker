Why doesn't Fraction return closest fraction for float instances?
From the documentation:Note that due to the usual issues with binary floating-point (see Floating Point Arithmetic: Issues and Limitations), the argument to  is not exactly equal to , and so  does not return  as one might expect. (But see the documentation for the  method below.)Basically,  cannot be precisely represented in binary. The Issues and Limitations link in the above excerpt goes into much more detail.As suggested, you can use  to help here:Alternatively, you can use string inputs (which you seem to have already discovered).
