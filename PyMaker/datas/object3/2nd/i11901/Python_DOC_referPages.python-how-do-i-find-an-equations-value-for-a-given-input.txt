Say, I have an equation , I need to find the value of .Easiest way is to create a function, accept a parameter and return the value.But the problem is,  is created dynamically and so, a function cannot be written beforehand to get the value.I am using  for an optimization value. The equation would look something like below: is an array of numbers. There will be a .How do i find the value of ?Basically, Is there any way to substitue the said Variable and find the value of equation When using cvxpy ?
Set the value of the variables and then you can obtain the value of the expression, like so:(although it won't work for  because then you'd be taking the square root of a negative number).
The general solution to interpreting code on-the-fly in Python is to use the built-in eval() but eval is dangerous with user-supplied input which could do all sorts of nasty to your system.Fortunately, there are ways to "sandbox" eval using its additional parameters to only give the expression access to known "safe" operations. There is an example of how to limit access of  to only white-listed operations and specifically deny it access to the built-ins. A quick look at that implementation looks close to correct, but I won't claim it is foolproof.The  I mentioned in my comment uses  inside and carries the same warning.
In parallel to your cvx versions, you can use lambda to define functions on the fly :Then you can evaluate , , and so on. (*) the  is needed to fit each  in the associated function.
