I want to save a list in python to a file which should be able to read later and added to a list variable in later use.As an example This should be written to a file asAnd should be able to read later from python for a later use and assign it to a list variableRight now I'm using the following code.This gives me an errorHow can I fix this? Thanks
You could do it also with , it works similarly to json, but it can serialize a broader set of Python objects than json. Json serializes text, and is human readable, while pickle serializes bytes, not human readable.Consider this example:Notice that with pickle you have to open the files with the 'b' for binary reading/writing.A side note: do not use variables with the same name as python keywords, like .According to 12.1.4 in the documentation:The following types can be pickled:None, True, and Falseintegers, floating point numbers, complex numbersstrings, bytes, bytearraystuples, lists, sets, and dictionaries containing only picklable objectsfunctions defined at the top level of a module (using def, not lambda)built-in functions defined at the top level of a moduleclasses that are defined at the top level of a moduleinstances of such classes whose dict or the result of calling getstate() is picklable (see section Pickling Class Instances for details).
If you just have a simple list, then you can use JSON and the  module. And the contents of  looks like 
Map all values in the list to strings first, the  method only supports strings.E.g. Also calling a variable "list" is a bad practice, use something like "ls" or whatever differs from standard Python keywords. If you want to use it later, you can just delimit the values using spaces. Just write it like . Then, to read it back into a list, do  This, however, will keep the values in the list as strings, to get them back to ints, map again like 
According to the error in your code you passing a list to f.write().you need to pass string.I assuming you want to write one word per line.try the code below it should work.To read later you can just open file again and read using this code:
Turning my comment into an answer:Try Saving and loading objects and using pickle:To load the data, use:
