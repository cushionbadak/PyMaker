From the documentation https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html - (used to indicate a set of characters)Character classes such as \w or \S (defined below) are also accepted inside a setWhat are ? I am only familiar with  (,,, etc) and  (,,, etc). Do character classes refer to the latter ? Or are they something different altogether? If so, what do  include exactly? appears only 2x in the entire page. It is poorly defined and does not indicate whether ,  are certain members of  or the only members. Further testing reveals that  can also be used within  but not something like  - compounding the confusion.
Yes, it is a bit ill-defined, but at the same time I think it's rather intuitive. In short, "character classes" are special characters, or "escape sequences" in the form  representing groups of multiple characters, such as "all whitespace" , "all numbers" , or "all non-whitespace" , and are a subset of those "special sequences".There are three character classes you should know:digits , corresponds to ; note that those do not match floating point numbers, as the  is not in "word"-characters, , corresponds to , but (in Python 2) does not include non-ascii characters, such as umlauts, accents, etc.whitespaces, , such as space, tabs, newlines, etc.Also, each character class can be "inverted" by using the respective capital letter, i.e.  matches everything that is not in , and similar for  and .Other "special sequences" comprise only a single character, such as newline  or tab  (although those are not really a part of the regex language, but just basic Python string escape sequences), and others represent abstract concepts such as "between a word and a non-word" , or "at the beginning of the string" .
