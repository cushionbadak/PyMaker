This is my code:The output I want is , i.e. I want to enumerate the string in the loop between number 0 to 9.The above code gives me:
This is what  is for.This also uses the  parameter of print, where otherwise it will add a new line after each  call.
The code in your question prints  and  because you are asking "Is  in the range 0..9?"You can use list-comprehension to make a single line of numbers in the range 0..9. 
Instead of loops, converting numbers to strings and modulo operations, you can generate the string instantly knowing the length. Concatenate whole versions of "0123456789" enough times and attach the any partial remainder. For example, returns both the integer division and remainder part of it.
Try this: is the modulus operator - it gives you the remainder when you divide by the number provided (in this case the remainder when you divide by 10).If you want the result on one line you could do something like this:Or save it in a string:
