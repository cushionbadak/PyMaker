I'm dealing with an image processing problem that needs to be parallelized. I've seen several examples showing the use of parallel processing in Python, but the inputs of all those examples are 1-D arrays. Therefore, I'm looking for a way to parallelize a function performing a two processes on an image. The following code is what I need to be prallelized:How this nested loop can be parallelized?
I'm not entirely sure what do the variables mean or what does the  function does but this is a general way to make it parallel:This solution is fitted to Python 3.2 and above. Older versions may use the multiprocessing module.If you wish for a more efficient way allowing to get the return values too, this is another way:It's a bit more complicated but what I did here is get the  of all combinations of  and , split  and  into two iterators, and  with the iterators as variables.UPDATE:My best bet is that the thing holding you up is the transfer of the image to different processes.This will only transfer the appropriate part of the image:
