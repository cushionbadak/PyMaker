I'm a python beginner. I've installed Anaconda and Pycharm.I would like to import a  as in this code:but it's not clear to me in which folder I have to put the  file mentioned, in order to use this code.Is there an option to choose a customized folder? 
you can use the absolute path, as described in the doc:http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/io.html#io-read-csv-table
This will work if you put the .csv file in the same folder as your script as the path is considered relative.Otherwise, you may pass the absolute path as a string.Since you mention being a beginner, I'd like to introduce you to .It can do clean joins and automatically manage trailing slashes in an OS-independent way (useless in this example).Anyway, it is a nice habit to use it for path management, rather than using string concatenations for joins, for instance.(Python 3.4 introduces pathlib which is practical, but not included in former Python version (it has to be installed as an external lib).)
