I am relatively new to python. Suppose I have the following string -Now, I am trying to delete all hashtags(#) within the tweets such that -My code was -This code gives me no output and no errors which leads me to believe that I am using the wrong logic. Is there an easier solution to this using regex? 
Here is a regex solution: The regex means to delete a hash symbol followed by 1 or more word characters (letters, numbers, or underscore) optionally followed by a space (so you don't get two spaces in a row).You can find out plenty about regexes in general and in Python with Google, it's not hard.Additionally, to allow additional special characters, such as  and , replace  with , where the  can be substituted with whatever characters you like, i.e. everything in the brackets is allowed.
You can utilize  and  to accomplish your task.Here  will make your  string a list of words separated by spaces. So then when iterating in a comprehension creating a new list, just omit anything starting with a , by using . Then  will simply make it a string again separated by spaces. The code can be written as Output:
Python doesn't have a  operator so  just applies the  operator to  twice which, of course, does nothing. You should use  instead.
