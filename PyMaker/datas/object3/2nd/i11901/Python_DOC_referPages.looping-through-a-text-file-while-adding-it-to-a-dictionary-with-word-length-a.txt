Here is the problem.define a function make_length_wordcount() that:Takes input as the filename in the current directory (as a string)Returns a dictionary, which each key is word length and its value is the number of words with that length.For example, if the input file’s text is “Hello Python people Welcome to the world of Python”, then the dictionary should be: {2: 2, 3: 1, 5: 2, 6: 3, 7: 1}Here's what I have so far:I'm missing a for loop somewhere to actually add tot he counter. I can't figure it out though. Any help would be appreciated!Here's my output:
You've got a better answer from Padraic, but the only bug in your version is that you checked for the word in the dictionary, not its length.
Here is my working answer:Running:
Just count using the len with a  dict :In your own code follow the same logic, forget the words it is the lengths you want to count:You are not counting the amount of times words appear, you are counting the amount of times words of certain lengths appear.
