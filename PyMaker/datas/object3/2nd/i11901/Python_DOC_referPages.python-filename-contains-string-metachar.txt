Natural Text
I'm using os.walk(directory) to show recursively all the files from that directory.The thing is that i need to show only the files that contain an asked String in its name, and it has to manage metachars too.What i have now is:This works nicely, but if  , as i dont have files containing an ' * ', my list is empty.So, how do I get this to work if  contains a METACHAR?
I think you are looking for fnmatch:https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html#module-fnmatch
