I cant find the total of row 4 in a csv file my code is to enter a code which is searched in a csv file which is then written to a new csv file in order for it to be printed as a receipt my problem is in the last few linesthis is my code until know:
You have a nested loop at the end (for loop and a list comprehension inside it) which is why it isn't working like you want it to.You also define a variable named  as  and never do anything with it and then just print it.No nested loop is needed so this should work:Other pointers:There is a  too which is safer to use than just string concatenation and writing to a file.
