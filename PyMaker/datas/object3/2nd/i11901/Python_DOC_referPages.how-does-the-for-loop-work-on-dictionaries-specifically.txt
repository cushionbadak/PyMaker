I was wondering how exactly the  loop accesses keys in a dictionary ?does it call  and iterate through that list ?The reason I'm asking is that I want to query a dictionary's key, any key, and I was wondering if there is a difference in performance (aside from visuals and readability) between calling:andWhich brought me to the above question - what does python do during a  loop on s, specifically, under the hood?
Iterating  does not call . The dictionary itself support iteration.BTW,  in Python 3.x returns dictionary key view which does not support indexing.If you want to get any key, you can use , :
