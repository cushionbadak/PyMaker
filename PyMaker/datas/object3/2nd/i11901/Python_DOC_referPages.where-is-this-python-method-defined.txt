I'm currently reading the code of virt-manager/virt-clone, but did not do much python before.Here is the important parts of the code:https://github.com/virt-manager/virt-manager/blob/master/virt-clone#L169https://github.com/virt-manager/virt-manager/blob/master/virtinst/cli.py#L263https://github.com/virt-manager/virt-manager/blob/master/virtinst/connection.py#L35https://github.com/virt-manager/virt-manager/blob/master/virtinst/cloner.py#L591The last line looks like there is a method  called for an object of class . However I cannot find such a method defined in that class and it does not have a parent class to get such a method from, either.Can you help me spot the place where  is defined?What might be a good way to find such an answer myself? (debugger, etc?)
The  method of the  object is defined in C as part of libvirt's Python bindings. The following code forwards the attribute accesses from it to that object which was returned by  and assigned to :https://github.com/virt-manager/virt-manager/blob/master/virtinst/connection.py#L94This causes  to be .
I haven't investigated your case, but in Python methods can be dynamically added to a class or to an instancethe result is:As you can see the second call to dir shows new method 'f'. So in some cases it might be tricky to find the origin of that.
The VirtualConnection class you refer to has an implementation of , which is a method that will be called when an attribute cannot be resolved. This  method looks up attributes on a "_libvirtconn" attribute of the VirtualConnection instance.See also: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.getattr
