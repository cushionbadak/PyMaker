I have a tuple  to which I would like to append a variable . I do not know ahead of time exactly what kind of variable  will be. could be:a tuple, in which case I'm quite happy to use , ora single object (typically string or int), in which case I should use .Adopting one strategy will give me a TypeError half of the time, and adopting the other will give me  when I want .What's the best way to handle this?
Use  in a  condition. 
Use the second strategy, just check whether you're adding an iterable with multiple items or a single item.You can see if an object is an iterable (, , etc.) by checking for the presence of an  attribute. For example:Try this. This snippet will behave exactly like you describe in your question.Note that in Python 3, strings have an  method. In Python 2.7:In Python 3+:If you are on Python 3, which you didn't mention in your question, replace  with . This will still account for either tuples or lists.
