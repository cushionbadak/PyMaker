Why doesreturn False, butDoes not return True but instead returns the location of the object in memory. I can't find a way to make this statement return true, but I know it is true because: returns "Yes!".As I said, this is of no practical significance, at least not at the moment, but it does puzzle me.
Use  to convert to a boolean value (  ):When you use  in your  statement, it is automatically converted to a boolean value, , that is why it will  Using  will automatically convert it to a boolean value, then invert it, therefore:
The function  returns a match object if there is a match, or  if there's not. To create a bool from that you can use:However, in Python that's not strictly necessary: take a look at e.g. this thread for more on Python's "truthy" and "falsy" values.
Well, focus on this:Here  will return the "location of the object in memory", as you said. That's something not False.So now,  will result in:not not Falsewhich results to:FalseOf course, this kind of thinking can be applied to logical conditions too, like a condition of an if statement.
