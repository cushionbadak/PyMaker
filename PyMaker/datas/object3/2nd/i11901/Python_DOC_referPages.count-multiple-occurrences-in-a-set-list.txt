Is there a way to count the amount occurrences of a set of string lists? For example, when I have this list, it counts 7  blanks.  Is there a way I can do this same thing but for a set of multiple lists? Like this for example below:When I do it this same way, the output I get is  and not the actual count of occurrences. 
SolutionThis works:You need to count in each sub list. I use a generator expression to do this and sum the results from all sub lists.BTW, don't use  as a variable name. It is a built-in.PerformanceWhile not that important for many cases, performance can be interesting:vs.
