I want to be able to turn csv file into a list of lists with the column values for each list. For example:intoIve only managed to open the file and only having success printing it as rows
In case you sure it's fixed number of items in each row, you can use zip:Or in case it's different number of items in row:Use zip_longest and filter:
You could probably start by reading it into a list of lists first:Then chop it into a new sequence, I'm sure there are other tricks with itertools but this is what I came up with:You can now turn the generator into a list, which will have the desired columns as rows.
