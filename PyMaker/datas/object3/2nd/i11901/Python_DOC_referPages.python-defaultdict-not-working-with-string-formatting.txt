This is easy-peasy:This doesn't work, yielding a :Is there a way to accommodate a  in string formatting?
 unpacking produces a , which is why this isn't working. If you're running Python 3.2 or higher though, you can pass the  without unpacking to  which exists for precisely the purpose of passing non- mapping types:Edit: Apparently, in Python 3.5 at least,  actually does work with a , and  is modified (after the formatting, the  is ), so it looks like in modern Python,  may not be necessary for subclasses of . Interesting.
Given another answer and in a comment, apparently that does work in Python3, but in Python2 you need to do something a little more hackish:
Based on @zondo's answer (and to a small degree, @ShadowRanger's), you could do something like this which worked correctly in both Python 2.7.11 and 3.5.1 for me.
