If I want everytime when the player types an invalid input and the "Take a guess" game continues, how can I do?
DesignI think that you should separate, as far as possible, the two issues of looping on the responses and getting a validated response, and you can achieve this by writing a function that handles the problem of validating the user input.Such a function needs to know how to prompt the user and what to tell the user if their input is invalid, so we must provide two arguments to the function, but we provide also reasonable defaults for the arguments...To look at the correctness of the input, we use a  clause, if the body of  raises an error,  looks at the error and if it is a particular one (for us, ) the body of the except is executed.The body of the  ends with a call to the function that we are defining, because this is another way of looping, if you consider what is happening... and in this case it is a simpler way of looping.ImplementationThat said, with the understanding of what we need in our function, we write it:TestingAnd now a bit of testing,Putting it all togetherI've used your implementation, because for sure it is good enough, but I've changed a little the capitalization of the strings, no more  as this is hidden in  and the introduction of an  clause to the  loop that is executed on normal termination, so that your user is informed of the reason why the program is stopping.
Wrap your input in some kind of while loop. â€Œ
