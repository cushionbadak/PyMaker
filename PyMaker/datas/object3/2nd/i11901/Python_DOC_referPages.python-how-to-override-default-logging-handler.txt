Suppose I have got a logger like:Then I add a file handler to it. I want all logs go to the file and all info and above log to be printed on screen.I know I should set the level of the file handler to logging.INFO.However, if I use , then the debug logs won't go to the file. If I use , then all debug logs will be printed on screen.How to solve this problem?
You should use  on the logger and  on the screen handler. That way the logger gets all messages, the file handler gets all messages but the screen or stream handler gets only  or higher.
