Natural Text
So I need to count individual words (specifically red and blue) in a python inputted list.However, it cannot be for instance redish or bluemaybe.Here's what I've done (I've tried if loops to catch it but hasn't worked.)
The following works.Here are your mistakes:Doing  and then  doesn't "expand" the  string in the  list. doesn't happen in-place, it returns a list of strings. In your case, that list is lost since you don't assign it to a variable.You also never reuse the  list.If you wan't a more complete counting tool see https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#counter-objects.
You can make a loop to iterate through the list then return your valuesSplit and append aren't necessary. When faced with a coding problem, try to find the simplest answer and the most concise without sacrificing any substance.
