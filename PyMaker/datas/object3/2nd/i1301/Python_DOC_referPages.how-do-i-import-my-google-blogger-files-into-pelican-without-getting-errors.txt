I can't import my Blogger files in the  file format into Pelican without some kind of Python error. I installed , , , and  but I keep getting other errors appear such as the one below:I run a  derivative if that helps any. I'm also not sure if I'm supposed to be using the  or  parameter when making the call to parse my  Blogger file.
This seems like a bug in . 's date/time parser returns the result of datetime.utctimetuple() which is  instance while  expects an object with  method.Report the bug to the Pelican tracker.
