 only provides a method for throwing an empty  into the task. However, sometimes it might be desirable to have different types of interrupt. For example, similar to SIGINT, SIGTERM and SIGKILL, multiple levels of cancellation may allow a task to do a better cleanup. itself can be easily modified to provide such functionality. The question is, how to do it in a more elegant and efficient way?
I asyncio was providing such functionality long time ago, but it was cut.Now in documentation you can read:asyncio.Task inherits from Future all of its APIs except  Future.set_result() and Future.set_exception().And in asyncio source code you can see:You can read discussion behind this decision in relevant PR and issue.From how I understand stuff supporting / spawns too many ways to shoot yourself in the foot, for example see this discussion.
