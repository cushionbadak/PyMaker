I have two listsI need  to compare and find the closest value of first value in each list of output list with the first value in each list of Calculated list.For eg:I need to compare 0.20 in [0.20,-1.22] with 0.99,0.012,0.22,0.44,0.55,0.21. and so on. If any closest value for 0.20 is in the list ie; 0.20 is closest to 0.21.then take the second value in the corresponding list ie ; -6.6 ,then multiply  -6.6 in[0.21, -6.6] with -1.22 in [0.20, -1.22].What I have tried:Please help me with a code to achieve this. 
You can do it this way:Essentially, all this code does is run over the list and compare the difference between value you submitted, , and the first item in the sublist at that index, to the current minimum difference. If it's less, the value is calculated and the minimum difference is updated. At the end, it's appended to . Then we just do that for each item in the list.
To get to the right answer you need to use the value of input_list * value of output_list.I made a slight change to Woody's answer (added the value as input_point2) and I think that is the result that met your requirement:Output:[[0.2, 8.052], [0.22, 13.7664], [0.1, 15.314000000000002], [0.43, 12.408], [0.34, -12.54], [0.33, -1.32]]
