You can use ,a good tutorial about zip in here. In case one of the lists is longer then the other, you can use  (documented here):

You can simply do following:
EDIT:  is needed for python2 only. In Python 3 the built-in zip does the same job as itertools.izip in 2.x (returns an iterator instead of a list  Using Note that  return  type:It means  computes all the list at once, which is not memory efficient when your  is large. For saving memory, using :  computes the elements only when requested.
You can do it by using  function.The zip() function take iterables (can be zero or more), makes iterator that aggregates elements based on the iterables passed, and returns an iterator of tuples. Code :Output :
