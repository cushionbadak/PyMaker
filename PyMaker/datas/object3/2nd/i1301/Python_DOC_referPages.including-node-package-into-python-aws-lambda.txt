Specifically, I am running Python 3 on AWS lambda and I need to execute a  command ( is the CLI version of the postman app).I have this working locally because I have  installed globally (so I can execute the script through a python .What is the ideal way of packaging up the  package and all of its dependencies?  
The answer to this question is fairly straightforward (albeit it can appear to be a bit odd because of the nature of combining python with js).-If a node package is absolutely necessary to your python lambda, take the time to set up a proper npm virtual env in a directory of your choice (for me, I created ) first for the package manager to do the manual labor of gathering dependencies (use  for this). Be sure to do a thorough review of using a node lambda in addition to a python lambda before you do this.Once the env is there, install the packages that you need (for my case ) with .Within the directory that you chose to work in, you will see all of the dependencies and the desired node package thrown into the  directory. From there, force the python code to call the package from within the directory. Voila... You have yourself a node package working within a Python AWS lambda context.
