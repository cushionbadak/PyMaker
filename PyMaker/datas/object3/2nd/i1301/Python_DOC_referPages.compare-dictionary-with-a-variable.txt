I am trying to compare a dictionary value with a variable but for some reasons I can't output the part that I want from the dictionary.The dictionary is an ouput from a html table. This is the code that I use to prase the html table into a dictionary:This is the output:How to I compare for example the clan days from the first dictionary and if the value matches the value that I set in a variable should get the name as a string so I can later use it in another line.
Assuming you first read the data into a list of dictionaries:You may use  to search for the first dictionary in  matching the  value defaulting to  if no entries matched your search query:Now,  would return you the first match, if you need all of the matches, just use a list comprehension:Note that this kind of search requires you to, in the worst case (entry not found), loop through all the entries in . If this kind of search is the primary use case of this data structure, consider re-designing it to better fit the problem - e.g. having clan_days value as a key with a list of clan names:In that state, getting a match would be a constant operation and as easy as .  is something that would help you to make that transformation.
Not really sure what exactly you want, but if it's just comparing a dictionary value to a variable and getting the Name part if they match, you would get something like this..Edit: Read your post too quickly, considering it's all the rows from a HTML table this code is too simple. Use alecxe's answer :)
