I have known the use of  and  for several properties, how could I trigger a same function when any property changes?For example, the following codes add a setter to property . If the class has a lot of properties like , , ... , , and I want to print something like  when any property changes.It is stupid to add the similar getter and setter one by one.I have read some related questions and answers, but I do not find the solution for many properties.How to trigger function on value change?Using @property versus getters and setters
