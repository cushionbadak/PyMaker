I want to write a function that accepts a single-argument function f, and an integer k, and returns a function that behaves the same as f except it caches the last k results of f.For instance, if memoize is the function we're after, and let mem_f = memoize(f, 2), then:What I have done is:This function returns the result from cache and if it is not in cache, it is computed and cached. However, I am not clear how to cache only last k results of f? I am newbie, any help would be appreciated.   
You could just use  to do the caching. I accepts a  parameter to control how much it caches:results:calling function  4  4  calling function  6  6  calling function  8  8  calling function  4  
Expanding on the excellent suggestion of Mark Meyer, here's what the solution looks like using  and the terminology of your question:Result:
SolutionYou can fix the code you have by using  like this:Testing it outOutput:This version of  will likely work well for your own code. However, for production code (ie code that other people have to rely on), you should probably use the standard library function () that Mark Meyer suggests.
