I am trying to install lightgbm using conda. I successfully downloaded the only version I saw on the cloud(2.2.1) and saw that it forced me to downgrade my mkl. I thought this would be ok, however, when I did this, it broke some other essential functionality (a matplotlib function stopped working). I was wondering how I might resolve this issue? Also is there a general strategy people tend to use when dealing with this whack-a-mole type dependency problem? Is there something simple that can be done to handle this? Thanks in advance!
The general strategy people use for this problem is working with different environments. When you use different environments for projects, you can install packages for each project you work on seperately, and you will not get into trouble with packages not working anymore for your other projects. It works pretty simple and avoids dependency problems. To create a new environment use: Then you should activate your newly created environment: After which you can install to it the packages your project requires: , in your case that would be A great tutorial on how to work with python environments using conda (You could also use pip and venv's, but since you seem to be using conda already I assume you want to proceed with that), can be found Here. I recommend you follow it, it will probably answer all the remaining questions you have about package management, and then you will be good to go =)
