Presuming you are using python 3.*, v needs to be a module, so the way you import it changes to example below.Also note the document of importlib "When a module is reloaded, its dictionary (containing the moduleâ€™s global variables) is retained. Redefinitions of names will override the old definitions, so this is generally not a problem."Though our minimal example works, this is something to bear in mind for more complicated cases.
