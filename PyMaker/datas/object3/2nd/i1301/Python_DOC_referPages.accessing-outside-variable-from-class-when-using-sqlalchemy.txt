In the following code snippet:why  inside the class can be used as global variable without ? I checked python doc and found:In Python, variables that are only referenced inside a function are implicitly global.I wonder does this rule apply here? Because  is not only referenced but modified in  method.
You are not assigning anything to the variable  inside any functions.  is only calling a method. It alters only internal state, not the reference itself. If you did inside a function then you'd need to use , otherwise, you'd just get another variable called  at the local scope and using it would not have any effect on the global  object.
