i made a simple program of adding two nos.in python my code is:output error is as follows:Failed case #1/8: Cannot check answer. Perhaps output format is wrong.
Your code works well as expected, but you have to input like:And also you're creating a  method which already exists builtin, so you can do:Without the  method you created will also work, also even better using  for the two values:
In code you have taken input at separate lines , whereas while in code you are taking them in single line with comma seperated. So try giving input in seperate lines like Or change the input scehma like This will solve your problem.
You are not providing an  value of .Refer the python docs: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input.Below is the run of you program in . Problem is with how your program expects the input and how you are actually providing it. You ask the program to a) print "Enter first number" on the stdout and assign the value to , while you tell the program that it has to be an 'int'then,b) print "Enter second number" on the stdout and  assign the value to then,sum the two values assigned to 'a' and 'b' and print that sumNow,Look at the first run. You are doing exactly how you wrote your program, providing the first value (hitting enter, marking move to next step  if the input is right)then you provide the second value, bit enter, and you get your resultYou are providing int values so program works like a charmProbelm is here, you entered first value to be   that's not an  value.  is  isn'tand hence the error exactly says, invalid literal for  suggesting its not an int. the  part in error tells it is expecting a decimal (normal counting number)You will get the same error if you entered let's say  which is again not an
