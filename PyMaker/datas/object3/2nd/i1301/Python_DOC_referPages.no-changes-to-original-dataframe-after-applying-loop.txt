I have a list of dataframes such that I also created a function which removes the rows with '0' in the dataframe:I tried applying this through a loop and placed an assignment variable within the loop, but the original dataframe remained unchanged even after running the loop. I also tried using list comprehensions to go about itI know the function works since when i apply print(len(df)) before and after the command dropzeros(df) there was a drop in the len, however, may I know how might I go about this problem such that my original dataframe is altered after running the loop?
That's because the variable  in your  loop does not reference a value in your list. You are creating a variable  afresh each iteration of your loop.You can assign via  and  your function:
