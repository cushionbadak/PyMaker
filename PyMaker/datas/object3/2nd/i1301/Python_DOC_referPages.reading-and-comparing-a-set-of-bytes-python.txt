Natural Text
I have two text files, both of them having 150000+ lines of data. I need to shorten them to a range of lines. Allow me to explain:The line which starts with "BO_ " must be the first line and the last will be the one which does not start with "BO_". How do I compare a set of characters since Python reads the file each byte at a time? Is there any inbuilt function to trim the lines in the file. I thought of getting each byte and checking them consecutively with B, O, _ and " ". But this would be hectic, I bet the memory will run out before it is even able to check the file, considering if the mentioned happens only at the end of the file. I tried the following code:This code works perfectly fine, it returns each byte of the text. But, going by this approach, it will be difficult and time-consuming. The code would be very ugly.
You can use  to read a line (up until a newline b"\n" character)read  more here
