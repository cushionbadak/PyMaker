Is there a way to generate a whole number/integer? I am attempting to find a way to generate a random number that is either a 0 or 1 or 2.... and Nothing in between. If I use:Returns:numpy.random.randint seems like it would work but it will return an array. Would some sort of function be the best method to make this work? Thanks
I would recommend you use the random module and use random.randint which generates a random integer
