Some hapless coworker saved some data into a file like this:when they should have usedNow  looks likeInstead ofI already read this file as a string:Now how can I convert  from the incorrectly-saved format to the correctly-saved string?
You can try literal eval
If you trust that the input is not malicious, you can use  on the broken string.Otherwise you will have to manually parse and remove or replace the offending repr'ed escapes.
This code is working correct in my computer. But if you still get error, this may help you
