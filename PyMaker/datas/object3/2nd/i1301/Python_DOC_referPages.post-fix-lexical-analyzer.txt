I agree with the commenters that using a lexing library like  is the easiest or best way to go. If you still want/are required to do it yourself, there are a couple things that need to change.If you see something like , you need to be able to skip to the of the number for the next loop iteration, so  doesn't work. You can just do a , track the loop index manually, and break out when you're done.The most powerful to match your input to the lexeme is with regular expressions. For example, you can match numbers with an optional decimal part using something like(Most number specifications are rather more "interesting" than this, so definitely don't copy over my regex. It will probably be wrong for what you need.)You can use regex101.com to experiment and build your regex.You could alternatively make use of Python's built in string methods, such as  and . With this, your number check might look like
