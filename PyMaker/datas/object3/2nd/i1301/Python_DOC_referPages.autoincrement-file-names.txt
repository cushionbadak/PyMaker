The reason you get this behavior is that  recurses into subdirs. Your target dir IS a subdir of your sourcedir - so you rename files from source to target and later  into the target directory and rename some more into itself using the "renaming" strategy all the time because the file already exists.Lenghty solution - most of it is creating file structures so this is a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example you can use. See the documentation of  in os.walkCreate file structureOutput:Fixed methodUsage: Output afterwards:You see some files in  got the  infix in it's name due to a same-named file was already in it.
