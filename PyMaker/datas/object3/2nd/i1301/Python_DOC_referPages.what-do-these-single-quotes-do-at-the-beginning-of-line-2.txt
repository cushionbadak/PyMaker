I found the following code in some random website explaining concatenating:and I was wondering what the single quotes do in the Any help is appreciated!
 is a method from the  class.Return a string which is the concatenation of the strings in iterable.  A TypeError will be raised if there are any non-string values in  iterable, including bytes objects. The separator between elements is  the string providing this method. will return . will return . is very helpful if you need to add a delimiter between each element from a list (or any iterable) of strings.It looks like nothing but if you do not use , this kind of operation is often ugly to implement because of edge effects:For a list or tuple of strings : For any iterable : Because  works on any iterable, you don't need to create a list from the filter result.works as well
Join method is used to concatenate a string with any iterable object. In this example, the first string is an empty string, also represented by two single quotes,  (don't confuse the single quotes with a single double quote).The  method of a string object concatenates it with another iterable provided. So, if the first string is an empty string, the resultant string is the concatenated output of the elements in the iterable.What is its use: It can be used to concatenate a list of strings. For example:It can be used to concatenate strings. (Since a string is an iterable, as well)You can think of more use cases, but this is just a gist of it. You can also refer to the documentation here.
