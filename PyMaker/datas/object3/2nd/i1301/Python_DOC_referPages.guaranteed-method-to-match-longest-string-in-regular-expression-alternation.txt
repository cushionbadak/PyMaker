This question already has an answer here:python regular expressions, how to extract longest of overlapping groups                    4 answers                For some reason I need to generate the regular expression from some arbitrary list by using alternations.Let's say the user can input ,  and , it will generate .The problem is that, can I make the re to match the longest term when several of the inputs contain common prefix?For example:, ,  will generate I want it to match the longest term if there are several matches. That is to match  rather than  if I use  to match the string I have tried in Python 3.7.1 and it seems it reports matches according to the order in the regular expression. If this is always true, I can just sort the input (wrt length) before converting them to regular expression.However, I cannot find any documentation about this behavior and not sure if this will be unchanged in the future.
From the docs:As the target string is scanned, REs separated by '|' are tried from left to right. When one pattern completely matches, that branch is accepted.This is specified behavior and will most likely not be changed in the future. You should be alright sorting wrt the lenghts and performing the regex match afterwards.Does this answer your question?
