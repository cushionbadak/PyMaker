Here i have  Class which put all elements of  in queue and run thread on them until all of the queue becomes empty  .Here problem is how do i actually identify if my program is done performing threads on all elements which are in queue of  & return .It looks challenging because  are in while loop which keep changes based on  length &  we defined.i have tried putting all threads in list and  them all. But not luck. Any Help?
You need to wait until all threads are done calling :HOWTO:Replace your  expression with class constant:Put additional attribute  (for a list of threads) into your  method:Put each created thread into  list:Define method like  to ensure all threads are terminated (done):The way you need to check "all done":
