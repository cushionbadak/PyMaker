Please forgive me for asking, but despite a ton of dictionary.update threads I could not find one that is an example of what I'm want to do.I have a dictionary:and I have a list:I want to add each list item to the dictionary values. The result would look like:The best result I've got is from trying something like this:But this returns the following: Because I am looping through the list items, I get the last list item (26501) as the result. I'm stumped.  
I guess, the dictionary key is the order of which you want the zip codes to append?Which printsYou might want to have a look at the Python docs about  or this question on StackOverflow about it What does enumerate mean?
With a dict comprehension, you can enumerate through your dictionary and set the new values to the tuple of your existing values and the corresponding zip code:Or very similarly, you can zip the dictionary and the zip codes and iterate through that:
You can just use dictionary.update, and, since you are using numbers as dictionary keys, you can use a regular old  loop and don't even have to use , but you have to remember that list indices start from 0 and your dictionary keys start from 1:
Change new_list tosuch that you're making the key be... the key and the overall structure be a dictionary
