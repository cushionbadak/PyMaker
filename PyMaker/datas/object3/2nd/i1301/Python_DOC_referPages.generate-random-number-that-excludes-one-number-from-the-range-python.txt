I am generating a number from the range of 1 to 10 but would like to exclude the number  from that range i have no idea how to go about doing this.This is what i have so far.python fileSo to round of: I want to generate numbers between  and exclude number .
You could use :
You can generate a random value from 1 to 9 instead and shift it by one if it is bigger or equal to 2.Mathematically, you want to select a random element in a set of 9 elements. All you need to do is to identify the element 3 with 2, 4 with 3 and so on. In probability, this is what we call a random variable.A random variable is defined as a function that maps the outcomes of  unpredictable processes to numerical quantities.This strategy of using a mapping is especially useful when your set is big and generating it would be costly, but the mapping rule is fairly simple.Improvement:It was pointed out by U9-Forward that in this case the mapping can be made slightly more efficient. It suffices to map 2 to 10.
Or do another way of conditioning like Olivier's answer:Then  will never be  again.
You can exclude number 2 using "while"This code will generate random number until it won't be "2"
An obvious and easy interpretable path would be to exclude the  by a  and just drawing numbers, using the function you mentioned, until the  gets not picked. This is yet highly inefficient but a work-around you can reach with basic programming concepts.The more direct way would be to define your list more precisely, meaning without the  and making use of the  function:
