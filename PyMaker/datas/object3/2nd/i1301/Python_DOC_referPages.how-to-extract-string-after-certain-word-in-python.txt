I am trying to get a reference number inside a string which is in most cases precedented by "Ref." or something similar.e.g.: Explorer II Ref.16570 Boxregex with further examplesThe problem is that there are many different variations1 as this is user generated content. How could I retrieve the number with python which is precented by e.g. ? The number/string is not always the same pattern e.g. numbers. .They might be mixed with characters and dots and slashes but for a human eye there is almost always such a number in each line identifiable.E.g.:A small amount of false positives would not be a problem.
Not totally sure if you need to  or , but  will extract any digits after  (case insensitive), i.e.:Regex DemoPython DemoRegex Explanation

I guess additional processing of matches is needed to extract actual references more accurately.Output starts with the lines:
