Consider the following Python code:Which will print 3, 5, and 7. Is the use of  on the variable being iterated on a reliable construct (you may assume that a StopIteration exception is not a concern or will be handled), or does the modification of the iterator being looped over inside the loop constitute a violation of some principle?
There's nothing wrong here protocol-wise or in theory that would stop you from writing such code. An exhausted iterator  will throw  on every subsequent call to , so the  loop technically won't mind if you exhaust the iterator with a / call in the loop body.I advise against writing such code because the program will be very hard to reason about. If the scenario gets a little more complex than what you are showing here, at least I would have to go through some inputs with pen and paper and work out what's happening.In fact, your code snippet possibly does not even behave like you think it behaves, assuming you want to print every number that is preceded by an even number.Why is  skipped although it's preceded by the even number ?Turns out  is never assigned by the  loop because the explicit  call popped that element from the iterator before the  loop had a chance to look at the iterator again.That's something I'd hate to work out the details of when reading code.If you want to iterate over an iterable (including iterators) in "" pairs, use the  recipe from the  documentation.Demo:In general,  together with its recipes provides many powerful abstractions for writing readable iteration-related code. Even more useful helpers can be found in the  module, including an implementation of .
It depends what you mean by 'safe', as others have commented, it is okay, but you can imagine some contrived situations that might catch you out, for example consider this code snippet:On Python <= 3.6 it runs and outputs:But on Python 3.7 it raises . Of course this is expected if you read PEP 479 and if you're thinking about handling  anyway you might never encounter it, but I guess the use cases for calling  inside a  loop are rare and there are normally clearer ways of re-factoring the code.
If you modify you code to see what happens to iterator :You will see the printout:It means that when you are doing  you are moving forward your iterator. If you need (or will need in the future) to do something else with iterator a, you will have problems. For complete safety use various recipes from itertools module. For example:Not that here you have full control in any place of the cycle either on current iterator element, or next one.
