I'm working with some data that has ever-changing keys for each record. I've collected a master list of keys from every record and stored them in a list. I'd like to then iterate through the list to pull the appropriate values using a  but I'm getting an error due to the item in the list item being a  and the dictionary being a .An example, notice the possibility of nested keys. Otherwise my approach would be much simpler:Am I making this harder than it needs to be? The biggest issue is the keys can change from record to record, and in some cases there are nested keys in the data. 
First, you can make the above snippet work if you did something along the lines ofOne issue from your snippet is the occurrence of elements like . Python assumes the  part is a literal list definition, and then the  is indexing that list (but can't because it's not an integer).More generally, I would suggest looking into the  method for dictionaries. You could turn the above snippet intoThat will handle any keys, but if you have deeper than two levels of nested dictionaries, you may want to re-implement it as a recursive function.
