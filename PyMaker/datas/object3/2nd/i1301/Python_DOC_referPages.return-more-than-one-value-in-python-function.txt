I was trying to use *args with a for loop in python, however I don't see how to return all the values passed to the function, which should return all the even numbersThe above code returns only the first value, as I guess after the return it goes out of the function. Indeed, if I use print instead, it worksI'm trying to find a way to return a tuple with all the even numbers when I pass let's say (1,2,3,4,5) to the functionThank you!
In python you can use list comprehension to do this. will make you code more readable and will shrink it too.   
You could slightly modify you function and make it a generator by using . This way your function wont end after returning first even number but will keep yielding them one by one.Output:Or if you want to store all yielded values:
Done, thank you all!!
