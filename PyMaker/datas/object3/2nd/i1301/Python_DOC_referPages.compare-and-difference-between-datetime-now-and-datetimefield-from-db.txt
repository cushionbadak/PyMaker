I can't find any answer to this that works for me.I'm trying to check difference between datetime for created post with datetime.now()example of what I would like to do in view.pyI have tried with timedelta things. Also tried strptime with datetime formats. No luckWhen I print the datetime.now() i get: 2018-12-10 20:22:10.535052And with the post.created_at: 2018-12-10 20:18:52:544396+00:00How do I make them comparable?
Django is giving you a timezone-aware  object.  is giving you a timezone-naive  object. You can't compare these.Instead use , which provides the type of  object that matches your Django settings (in your case, a timezone-aware ).Also note that  objects, as documented, don't have a  attribute. They do have a  attribute.In summary:
