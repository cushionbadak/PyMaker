I have just downloaded python 3.6.1 from github and built it in a local dir. Now I am trying to make a virtualenv with that version of python but I keep getting:I don't want to install this version of python globally on the system. Is there another way to make virtualenv work with it?
I think Python 3.6 introduced a new way of creating virtual environments that don't depend on routing through usr/local. Here is documentation.
