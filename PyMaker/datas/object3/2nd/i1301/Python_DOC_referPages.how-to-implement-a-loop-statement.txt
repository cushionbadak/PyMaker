I made a simple Yahtzee game in as few of lines as I could think. Currently, the user must press Enter (with any value) to continue. I would like to use a loop statement so that the dice continue to roll until Yahtzee (all rolled numbers are the same). I would also like a 10 second timer. What is the best way to add a loop statement to this code? P.S. This is not homework, I wanted to make this game for my Yahtzee nights. My daughter wakes easil...hahaEDIT: This is my final product. Thank you for all the help guys!!
If you would like to check if all the dice numbers are the same it is as simple as.The most simple way of having a "timer" could be adding a . You have to  otherwise it won't work.So replacewithThis means every 10 seconds the dice will roll until all dice are the same number, if they are then it prints Yahtzee and stops the loop.
Replace the  with a  and set the value of that  to  before the  loop and to  when you achieved Yahtzee => in the  condition.What do you mean by 10 second timer, however? A sleep time of ten seconds can be implemented by a  at the end of the inner  loop.EDIT  EXAMPLEThe  represent the code you already have. As commented on your question, the  condition should look more like this one. There are other ways on how to check all the elements in a list are the same.
