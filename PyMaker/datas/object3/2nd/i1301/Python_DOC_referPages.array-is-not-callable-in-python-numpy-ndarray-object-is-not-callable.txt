I am working on a neural network and when i try to shuffle the two numpy.ndarray i get this error. I tried rechecking the shuffle function format and cannot find any faults with that. Please helpThanks
Have a look at the docs of random.shuffle(x[, random])The optional argument random is a 0-argument function returning a  random float in [0.0, 1.0); by default, this is the function random()in your case you pass train_labels, which, according to error message is numpy.ndarray, not function
There are two functions named  that you may want to use, and none of them works the way you expect. shuffles list  using function . shuffles a NumPy array .Both functions can shuffle only one array at a time, but you want to shuffle two arrays, and you want to shuffle them consistently. Consider building a pandas Series, shuffling ("sampling") the Series, and then splitting it into values and labels again:
