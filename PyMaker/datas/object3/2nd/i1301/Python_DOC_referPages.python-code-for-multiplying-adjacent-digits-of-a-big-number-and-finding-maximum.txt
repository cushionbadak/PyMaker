Here is a Python code for finding maximum product we can get from 13 adjacent digits of a number. There is no error message, but this program is not giving the desired output. I am getting(in repl.it)  everytime, though it is clear that the answer is not . I am new to programming.My attemptI have converted the number into an string and stored it into a array to get element by element. The outer for loop traversing over all the numbers(last time when  have value ,  will reach the last entry of the array. (Though the array stores the number in a reverse order, I haven't reversed it because, we don't need to). Can anyone tell me where I am going wrong? Any help will be appreciated. 
Your logic can be simplified somewhat using :If you insist on using a  loop:Note you can modify your existing -based iteration, but this is not considered Pythonic:
