I have this function definition and it gives me invalid syntax on name and position. If I remove the types, the error goes but this should also work. What is wrong here? 
I think you are writing code in Python 2.7 which can throw error. Python 3.x should run your code. 
Sam.I've got the error Unexpected EOF while parsing,when executed yout code. That means your code end is reached before the end of a block.You should put something after (inside) your declaration like
I can't see any immediate reason why your code is not working so the most likely issue is that you are using a Python version < 3.5.Another potential issue could be that lack of any code in the body of the function causing an EOF error as mentioned in another answer (though I will assume you just haven't included this in the question because you didn't think it was relevant). Note that it's always best to include a minimal but complete example in your stackoverflow questions.In Python 3.5.1, using an integer argument works as expected:So does using a tuple:But for tuples where the contained type is known, which may be your case, it may be better (stricter) to use a type alias, as follows:If you can't upgrade your Python version for any reason, there may be other packages which provide type hints in lower versions of Python.
Try running the following code : (this will show you the version of Python you're actually using)If the reported Python version is somehow < 3.5 then you should investigate your environment first and use the correct intended version.
