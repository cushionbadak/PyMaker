I am new to python programming and would like to write a program which has the following requirement:The program accepts an input string and the number of rotations. Rotate all characters in the string and print the result on screen.For example, input is ABCDZ 3Then,output is DEFGCHowever, I have written a few codes by myself and turned out that I could only rotate the character within ABCDZ to e.g. ZABCD instead of the rotation pattern dictated in the requirement. Would anyone like to give help on the issue? How should I start with the correct direction? Thank you very much to all of you. I am really frustrated..
Could this work?Negative  reverses the direction of rotation.
