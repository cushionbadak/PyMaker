Natural Text
I'm looking for a tool/package (preferably in JavaScript or Python) that can access SED or perform the same functionality as SED tools. In my case, I wanted to output specific text data from a file that is accessed via API calls. One solution was to use stream editor. However, I can't seem to find some way to programatically access  Does anyone know of such a tool? Or can point me in the right direction?
sed(1) uses a general concept called Regular Expression, which you should read about. Both JavaScript and Python have built-in support for regular expression matching and substitution.
