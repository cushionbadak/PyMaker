There is no TinkerGraph in Python. In gremlin-python you only get a reference to a graph remotely on a server and that might be a TinkerGraph or something else. If you want to load data that way, you must issue that command as a script through a  instance:where "graph" in that script is a  instance that already exists on the server (and is likely empty). If you're using Gremlin Server, you might consider doing that loading separately as part of Gremlin Server startup as well and then just using gremlin-python to query that data. That would probably be best in this example as the data would just be present when the server is started.Note that in 3.4.0, we introduce the  step which will be part of gremlin-python directly at which point you will be able to directly do:in native python and it will just work (again, the  instance must be defined remotely) though the file must be readable by the server.Here's my working example in the Python shell for submitting a script, first with the tornado error and then without:
