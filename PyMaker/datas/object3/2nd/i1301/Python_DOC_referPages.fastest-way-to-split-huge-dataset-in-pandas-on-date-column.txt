I have a 14 million row CSV file, with a date column (not the first column) that I want to filter and split the data by.Currently, I am loading it into pandas dataframe to do it:Is there a faster way to do this?Filter out rows from CSV before loading to pandas dataframe gives an interesting solution but unfortunately my column to split by is not in the first column.EDIT:I purely need to split the csv files into each date. The resulting csv files are passed on to another team. I need all the columns, I do not want to change any data, I do not need to do any groupby. 
The main problem is reading the whole dataset into memory. Typically, with a very large file, I need to read the file line by line because it does not fit in memory. So I split the file and only then I can work with the parts (either with Python/pandas, R or Stata, which all load the whole dataset in memory).To split the file, I would write a CSV reader from scratch. Not too difficult if you don't have to handle separators inside quoted strings (otherwise it's not much more difficult with a regex). Probably possible with less code with the builtin csv module (I confess I have never used it).The following splits the file according to the values of a variable. It's also possible to adapt the code to split at fixed number of lines, to filter, to add or delete variables...
