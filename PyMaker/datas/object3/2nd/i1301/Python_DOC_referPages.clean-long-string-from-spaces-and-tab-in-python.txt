Try enclosing the string you want with brackets, like so:This would allow you to break the string to several lines while c=having control over the whitespace.
You can use brackets to maintain tidiness of long strings inside functions.Results in:You may also wish to explicitly use the  symbol to represent string concatenation, but that changes this from a compile time operation to a runtime operation. Source
You can use  to cleanup any spaces and tabs at the beginning of each linesThis gives the following o/p
