Natural Text
I tried using this piece of code:but it didn't work. Instead of displaying the first and last character, it would delete the last letter and display the rest.Any help would be appreciated.
If you want to do it without declaring any variables you could use  and then join first and last returned value.Without importing librariesor as @Graipher suggested:Output:
You could just do:Putting 0 would display the first letter and because "len" counts the number of letters and the variable (name) already has stored information, subtracting 1 would give you the last character.
