I'm trying to convert python code into dart. It has two parts. This is the first one:And this is the second one:However, I got stuck when implementing the first bit of python code. Currently, I have this code:But this doesn't work, because  provides string, and  expects bytes. How do I translate the python code to dart? And what is converted into what at the last two lines of first python code? I'm confused about the conversion system and I'm not sure what to do.
I've fixed it.anddid the magic.In the first code,  is in byte format, encoded via utf8. Then, I hash it with sha512 and encode into base64. The additional call in python code () was not needed in dart.In the second code block is basically the same as the first one. However, in some cases, python seems to encode base64 slightly different - it's probably the urlsafe variant. I temporarily solved it by replacing  by  and  by  in the result.
