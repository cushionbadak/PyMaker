I'm having a hard time understanding how imports work in Python 3.x. Suppose I have a project structure like thisMy understanding is that  and  can be treated as packages and the  files as modules.I want to import  and  in (which is the main script). How can that be done in both absolute and relative ways?If I want to execute  after this, is this a bad project structure (maybe  should be placed elsewhere, but I do not want to place it at the root)?
