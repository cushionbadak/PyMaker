the code is from here https://www.kaggle.com/itoeiji/deep-reinforcement-learning-on-stock-dataI know little python,so can't understand what's the purpose of these codes.
Pretty clear,Calling  does the command specified  which list the folder  up a directory.Then it decodes the command result for it to be in utf-8.And then it prints it for you to see it.
 runs a shell command and returns its standard output.  decodes a byte string into a proper Python Unicode string.You should generally not use  programmatically and you should generally avoid using an external subprocess for a task which Python can easily perform itself. A better, more portable and more efficient way to achieve the same result is... though this doesn't hard-code the assumption that the file names are returned as UTF-8 (which is probably a good thing for portability, too).
