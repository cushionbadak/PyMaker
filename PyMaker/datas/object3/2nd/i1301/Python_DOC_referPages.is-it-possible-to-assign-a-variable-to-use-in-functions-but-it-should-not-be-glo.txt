So what I'm trying to do is I need to assign a variable to use in several functions. But that variable should not be a global variable. How can I do that if it is possible?Edit: I did forgot one thing. This is for my project and most of it is finished but this. My code needs to be non-repeated as much as it can. I have 5 variables and 15 functions to use some or all of that variables. Edit2: Let me just post a function here.What I need to do is when I use that function, I need to fill "top_stair_wide", "stair_height", "stair_count" with a variable that is not global. I can't just put numbers because I will use those variables in 14 different functions again with maths.I have a function that draws straight line and before, it inputs and returns character so those are not the problem.
Using a main function as you told me in a comment, you could write it like this:Alternatively: It's also possible using kwargs, because then you have to know the arguments when you call main() and not when you define it:
Create a class, make the variables instance variables and turn the functions into methods. Then you can access the instance variables in each method without the explicit need to pass them around.And so on.
You need parameter(s) in your function definition and then pass your variable(s) as argument(s) when you call it.
You can pass it to your functions like:Or you can set it as constant in current file as:
Another option is using a dictionary storing the shared parameters and only passing this dictionary (rather than all variables separately) as an argument:
