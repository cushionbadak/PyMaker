You should check if user entered valid operation,   wont work here since  won't throw any errors. Also here's more elegant way to get 2 valid integers from user, and calculate final equation (using )Output:
You should use the builtin  module of python. Then you can use a dict like this:This way you don't need to implement simple operator functionality yourself.
The easiest and cleanest way to do so, is to use the  module in Python, so your  method would become as follows. A few changes you should do on your code, though, would be to rename hour  variable to , as it would conflict with python module name, and update the  as a return from the :
