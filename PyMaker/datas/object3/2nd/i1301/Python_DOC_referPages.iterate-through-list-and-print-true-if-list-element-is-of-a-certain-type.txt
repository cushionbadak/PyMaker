This question already has an answer here:How to determine a Python variable's type?                    16 answers                I was wondering if there were a way in python to loop through a list and check if a list element was of a certain type. Something like this in incorrect pseudo code. Is it possible to check for type like this? Also, I found myself unable to iterate through a list with timedelta objects so I've had to except a TypeError every time I encounter one. That is not shown in this code. I appreciate any help. Thanks
