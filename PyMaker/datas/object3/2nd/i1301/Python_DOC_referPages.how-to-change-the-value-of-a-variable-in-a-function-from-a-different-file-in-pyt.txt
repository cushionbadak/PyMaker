From Python's FAQ:How do I share global variables across modules?The canonical way to share information across modules within a single  program is to create a special module (often called config or cfg).  Just import the config module in all modules of your application; the  module then becomes available as a global name. Because there is only  one instance of each module, any changes made to the module object get  reflected everywhere. For example:config.py:mod.py:main.py:In your case, this means you need to:Create a file :Modify :Modify :
One way, is by reading it from an outsource file.  can access the file and write into it.So, under  you will have the following:And  can read from that .json.So, under  you will have the following:I think this is the better way to do it as you decouple the modules and having a more maintainable and salable code.
