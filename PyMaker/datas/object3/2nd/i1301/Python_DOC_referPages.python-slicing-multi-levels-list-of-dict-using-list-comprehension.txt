I have 3 lvls deep list as follows: I am trying to use list comprehension to get all the x into a list and all the y into another listI tried something like this: [gc for gc in [c for c in [p.get('x') for p in parent]]] but the get('x') is still hitting a list instead of an element, mainly because of the most inner [].  Any idea how to achieve this?
