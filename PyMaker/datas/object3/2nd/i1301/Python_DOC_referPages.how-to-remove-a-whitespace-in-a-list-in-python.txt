I'm new here so forgive me if there's anything unusualI know it's simple to remove some whitespacesbut actually I'm not using strings, it's float elements listso I'm using append to put the numbers in the list but they are passed in like this:I want them to be like this:any kind of help will appreciated 
There is no actual whitespace in the list. It is just how it's  function is coded (the way it prints out). If you want to print it out without any spaces the best way to do it is convert it to a string first:
Both those list representations are equal, regardless of the whitespace added after the commas. The extra whitespace just makes it clearer to read.To really test if they are equal, you can use  comparison:If you want a string representation without whitespace, you can use :
That is the default behavior of Python's  but hey its Python and you can override the default behavior. I will not recommend to change the default code of  but instead write your own  like class of yours to meet the requirement of yoursFor testing
