[duplicate]                    2 answers                I am trying to test whether a character is a special character or not. It fails for '-' character when I write the following code:Output>>Not foundHowever, if I change the position of the '-' character in the pattern as follows (line 3 of code), it works correctlyOutput>>FoundWhat is causing this difference and how can I make sure that the characters will be detected?
 is treated as a special character if it is not the last or the first character in a range and not escaped. So: or  or  is ,  or , but  is anything between  and , inclusive, but not  itself.
 in Regex means between. So the first expression says Match characters between ')' and '+'https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html
