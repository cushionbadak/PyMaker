As is stated in Pawel's answer. The sample function of the random package takes two arguments and you only supply one as a list. Assuming the  parameter means number of samples you could try something like . Otherwise, why not just use the sample method of pandas' dataframe documented here. DataFrame.sample(n=None, frac=None, replace=False, weights=None, random_state=None, axis=None)Return a random sample of items from an axis of object.n : int, optionalNumber of items from axis to return. Cannot be used with frac. Default = 1 if frac = None.Then you can just do  I think.
You are missing the second argument in  function.According to the documentation:random.sample(population, k) Return a k length list of unique elements  chosen from the population sequence. Used for random sampling without  replacement.Replace this:with this
You need a value of k in this line of code:as random.sample takes two arguments specified in documentation.
