I've tried to learn python for the last 3 weeks, and I saw a code that I need to understand what it does.In general, the code should somehow connect to two images, and then give me a password that I need to submit.The code is:It would be lovely if someone could explain it to me. thanks!
I'll break the above snippet into parts and explain each indivdiually.The first block are imports.  is usually imported by installing the  library.  and  are two packages included in the Python Standard Library.The next block tells you you're about to define a function that does some image processing. I'll write more in inline comments.There are major problems with this code as well. In some places you refer to  and  despite not defining them. Also, as a matter of practice, you can create paths with  objects in the idiomatic way
