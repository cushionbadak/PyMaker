I'm just too confused, and can't come up with proper way to do this:I have this directed graph:and have two dictionaries, which show outgoing and incoming scoresFor example, in , node  goes to node  with score 2 and to node  with score 3; and in  node  receives score 1 from node .I want to create  such that scores between two nodes are summed up. It should become this dictionary:
You could try to make a  of  objects, and sum the edge counts as you iterate both graph dicts:Which gives:Note:  and  are subclasses of , so you can treat them the same as normal dictionaries. If you really want normal dictionaries in the final undirected graph, you can use either of these dict comprehensions:Additionally, you can also use  here to refactor :
I hope we appreciate taking things in own hand, here's with simple logicOutput:
