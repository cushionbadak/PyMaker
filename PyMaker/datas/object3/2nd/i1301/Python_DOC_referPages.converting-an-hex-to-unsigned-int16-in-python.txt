This question already has an answer here:Convert hex string to int in Python                    10 answers                I've been struggling for a while doing that and can not find the right way to do it.I have a HEX which is the unsigned INT16 How can I do that in python 3.X ?Thanks in advance
You can convert using the  binascii and struct modules from the standard library:UpdateThis question has been closed as a duplicate.  The duplicate solution doesn't produce the required result:However it works as expected if the order of bytes is reversed:This is because the  builtin function assumes that the hexstring is ordered in the same way we order base 10 numbers on paper, that is the leftmost values are the most significant.  The initial value  has the least significant values on the left, hence using  to convert from base 16 produces the wrong result.However in Python3 we can still use  to produce a simpler solution, using .
