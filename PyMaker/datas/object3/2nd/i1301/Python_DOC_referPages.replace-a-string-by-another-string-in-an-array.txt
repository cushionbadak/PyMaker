My file so far looks like this:I would like to replace the "NumberInt(9)" by the digit 9.What I tried so far looks like this:But it does not replace it in my original file... Does someone has an idea?
Here's how to do it, based on the documentation of :Note that  returns a copy of the string, just like the built-in  method does.
First point: use  instead of  here. Also note that python strings are immutable so in both case you have to rebind your string to the result of the function.Second point: your file will OF COURSE not be updated if you don't explicitely do it by yourself - you have to write back the corrected string to the file (reopening the file in write mode).
