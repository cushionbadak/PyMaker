I'm a starting programmer, and I can't figure out how to remove the brackets and the commas from the values I'm pulling out of a dictionary with lists. What did I miss? From what I know, a for loop normally removes them, but doesn't do it now.simplified code:
Use join and map:OutputThe idea is to apply  to each string in the list of values (using map) and then join those strings by comma and whitespace (). Note that you can change the string of the join to fit your needs.
While Daniel's answer is more elegant and complete, I want to address your question about why the 'for' function did not split the language names (remove "," and "]"). The first 'for' function in your code iterates through the dictionary. If you wanted to just use 'for' functions, you would need to reuse it again for each persons's entry to separate the languages. Like code sample below.
