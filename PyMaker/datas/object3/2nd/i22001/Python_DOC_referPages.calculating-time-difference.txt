at the start and end of my program, I have But when I tried to get the difference, I get syntax errors.... I am doing a few things wrong, but I'm not sure what is going on...Basically, I just want to store a time in a variable at the start of my program, then store a 2nd time in a second variable near the end, then at the last bit of the program, compute the difference and display it. I am not trying to time a function speed. I am trying to log how long it took for a user to progress through some menus. What is the best way to do this?
The  module will do all the work for you:If you don't want to display the microseconds, just use (as gnibbler suggested):

You cannot calculate the differences separately ... what difference would that yield for 7:59 and 8:00 o'clock? Trywhich gives you the seconds since the start of the epoch. You can then get the intermediate time with something like
time.monotonic() (basically your computer's uptime in seconds) is guarranteed to not misbehave when your computer's clock is adjusted (such as when transitioning to/from daylight saving time).
