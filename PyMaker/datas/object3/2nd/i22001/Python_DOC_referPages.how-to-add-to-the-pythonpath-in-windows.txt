You know what has worked for me really well on windows. Just add the path as C:\Python27 (or wherever you installed python)ORThen under system variables I create a new Variable called . In this variable I have This is the best way that has worked for me which I hadn't found in any of the docs offered.EDIT: For those who are not able to get it,Please add C:\Python27;along with it. Else it will never work.
Windows 7 ProfessionalI Modified @mongoose_za's answer to make it easier to change the python version:[Right Click]Computer > Properties >Advanced System Settings > Environment VariablesClick [New] under "System Variable"Variable Name: PY_HOME, Variable Value:C:\path\to\python\versionClick [OK]Locate the "Path" System variable and click [Edit]Add the following to the existing variable:%PY_HOME%;%PY_HOME%\Lib;%PY_HOME%\DLLs;%PY_HOME%\Lib\lib-tk;Click [OK] to close all of the windows. As a final sanity check open a command prompt and enter python. You should see If you need to switch between versions, you only need to modify the PY_HOME variable to point to the proper directory. This is bit easier to manage if you need multiple python versions installed. 
Just append your installation path (ex. C:\Python27\) to the PATH variable in System variables. Then close and open your command line and type 'python'.
From Windows command line:To set the PYTHONPATH permanently, add the line to your . Alternatively, if you edit the system variable through the System Properties, it will also be changed permanently.
These solutions work, but they work for your code ONLY on your machine. I would add a couple of lines to your code that look like this:That should take care of your problems

The easier way to set the path in python is : click start> My Computer >Properties > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables >second windows > select Path > Edit > and then add ";C:\Python27\;C:\Python27\Scripts\"link :http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/win/
You need to add to your PYTHONPATH variable instead of Windows PATH variable.http://docs.python.org/using/windows.html
You can also add a  file containing the desired directory in either your  folder, or your , which tends to be my preferred method when I'm developing a Python package.See here for more information.
This won't persist over reboots or get translated to other files. It is however great if you don't want to make a permanent modification to your system.
In Python 3.4 on windows it worked when I added it to PATH enviroment variable instead of PYTHONPATH. Like if you have installed Python 3.4 in D:\Programming\Python34 then add this at the end of your PATH environment variableClose and reopen command prompt and execute 'python'. It will open the python shell. This also fixed my Sublime 3 issue of 'python is not recognized as an internal or external command'.
The python 2.X paths can be set from few of the above instructions.Python 3 by default will be installed in C:\Users\\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35-32\So this path has to be added to Path variable in windows environment.
To augment PYTHONPATH, run regedit and navigate to KEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Python\PythonCore and then select the folder for the pythonversion you wish to use. Inside this is a folder labelled PythonPath,with one entry that specifies the paths where the default installstores modules. Right-click on PythonPath and choose to create a newkey. You may want to name the key after the project whose modulelocations it will specify; this way, you can easily compartmentalizeand track your path modifications.thanks
For anyone trying to achieve this with Python 3.3+, the Windows installer now includes an option to add python.exe to the system search path. Read more in the docs.
This  variable needs to be set for  when ArcGIS Desktop is installed.  (your ArcGIS home bin)For some reason it never was set when I used the installer on a Windows 7 32-bit system.
Maybe a little late, but this is how you add the path to the Windows Environment Variables.Go to the Environment Variables tab, you do this by pressing Windows key + Pausa inter.Go to Advanced System Settings.Click on Environment Variables.On the lower window search for the 'Path' value.Select itClick on EditIn the end of the line add your instalation folder and the route to 'Scripts' folder.Click ok, aceptar etc.You're done, enter cmd and write python from any location of your drive, it should enter the Python program.Example with my pc (I have )Hope it helps.Greetings from Bogot√°
The easiest way to do that successfully, is to run the python installer again (after the first installation) and then:choose Modify.check the optional features which you want and click Next.here we go, in "Advanced Options" step you must see an option saying "Add Python to environment variables". Just check that option and click Install.When the installation is completed, python environment variables are added and you can easily use python everywhere.
These answers are so bad. The installer has a secret option. Click the installer again, uninstall, then reinstall.
