This question already has an answer here:How can I count the occurrences of a list item?                    22 answers                I'm new to Python and I have a simple question, say I have a list of items:Whats the simpliest way to add the list items to a dictionary and count how many times the item appears in the list.So for the list above I would like the output to be:
in 2.7 and 3.1 there is special  dict for this purpose.
I like:.get allows you to specify a default value if the key does not exist.

Simply use list property count\output : 
I always thought that for a task that trivial, I wouldn't want to import anything. But i may be wrong, depending on collections.Counter being faster or not.I think this may be preferable to using count(), because it will only go over the iterable once, whereas count may search the entire thing on every iteration. I used this method to parse many megabytes of statistical data and it always was reasonably fast.
Consider collections.Counter (available from python 2.7 onwards). https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.Counter
How about this:This results in{'one': 1, 'three': 3, 'two': 2}
