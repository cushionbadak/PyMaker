I have a list of size < N and I want to pad it up to the size N with a value.Certainly, I can use something like the following, but I feel that there should be something I missed:
or if you don't want to change  in placeyou can always create a subclass of list and call the method whatever you please
There is no built-in function for this. But you could compose the built-ins for your task (or anything :p).(Modified from itertool's  and  recipes)Usage:
I think this approach is more visual and pythonic.
gnibbler's answer is nicer, but if you need a builtin, you could use  ( in Py3k):which will return a list of tuples  filled-in to None. If you need to get rid of the counter, do something like:
You could also use a simple generator without any build ins.But I would not pad the list, but let the application logic deal with an empty list.Anyhow, iterator without buildins
If you want to pad with None instead of '', map() does the job:
 is a library that includes a special  tool for this kind of problem:Alternatively,  also implements Python itertools recipes including  and  as mentioned by @kennytm, so they don't have to be reimplemented:If you wish to replace the default  padding, use a list comprehension:
