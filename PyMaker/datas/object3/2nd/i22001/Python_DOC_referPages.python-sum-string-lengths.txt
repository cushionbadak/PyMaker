Is there a more idiomatic way to sum string lengths in Python than by using a loop?I tried , but it only works for integers:
I know this is an old question, but I can't help noting that the Python error message tells you how to do this: So:

My first way to do it would be . Another way is to use a list comprehension or generator expression as the other answers have posted.
The shortest and fastest way is apply a functional programming style with map() and sum():In Python 2, use itertools.imap instead of map for better memory performance:

Here's another way using operator.  Not sure if this is easier to read than the accepted answer.
Just to add upon ...Adding numbers from a list stored as a stringnos = ['1','14','34']length = sum(int(s) for s in nos)
