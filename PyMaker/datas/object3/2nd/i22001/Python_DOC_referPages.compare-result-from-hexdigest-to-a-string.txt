I've got a generated MD5-hash, which I would like to compare to another MD5-hash from a string. The statement below is false, even though they look the same when you print them and should be true.Google told me that I should encode the result from , since it doesn't return a string. However, the code below doesn't seem to work either.
Python 2.7, .hexdigest() does return a strPython 3.1.md5() doesn't take a unicode (which "foo" is), so that needs to be encoded to a byte stream.
Using == for a hash comparison is likely a security vulnerability.https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/keyczar-discuss/VXHsoJSLKhMIt's possible for an attacker to look for timing differences and iterate through the keyspace efficiently and find a value that will pass the equality test.
 returns a string. Your first statement returns  in python-2.x.In python-3.x you would need to encode argument to  function, in that case equality is also . Without encoding it raises .
