I'm trying to represent a number with leading and trailing zeros so that the total width is 7 including the decimal point. For example, I want to represent "5" as "005.000". It seems that string formatting will let me do one or the other but not both. Here's the output I get in Ipython illustrating my problem:Line 1 and 2 are doing exactly what I would expect. Line 3 just ignores the fact that I want leading zeros. Any ideas? Thanks!
The first number is the total number of digits, including decimal point.
[Edit: Gah, beaten again]The first number is the total field width.
This took me a second to figure out how to do @nosklo's way but with the  and being nested.Since I could not find an example anywhere else atm I am sharing here.Example using Python 2Python 3More  way, created from docs, but Both work as intended.Pay attention to the  vs the  and the placement of the format is different in python3.Example using  NestedThen expanding that to fit my code, that was nested 's:Which formats everything the way I wanted.ResultImportant Things To Note:@babbitt: The first number is the total field width.@meawoppl: This also counts the minus sign!...
