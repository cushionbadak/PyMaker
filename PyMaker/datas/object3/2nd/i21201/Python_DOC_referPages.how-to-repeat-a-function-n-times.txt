I'm trying to write a function in python that is like:where  is a function that takes one argument and  is a positive integer.For example if I defined square as:and I calledthis would square 3, 2 times.
That should do it:output:or -less?
Using  and lamba.Build a tuple starting with your parameter, followed by all functions you want to call:
Something like this?
I think you want function composition:
Here's a recipe using :I call this , because this is literally what the power function does, with composition replacing multiplication. creates a tuple of length  filled with  in every index. If you wanted to get fancy, you would use a generator to generate such a sequence (see ) - but note it would have to be created inside the lambda.   is defined in the parameter list so that it is only created once. 
Using reduce and itertools.repeat (as Marcin suggested):You can use it as follows:(after importing  or defining  respectively)
There is an itertools recipe called  that performs this operation.From itertools recipes:I use a third-party library, , that conveniently implements these recipes (optional):
