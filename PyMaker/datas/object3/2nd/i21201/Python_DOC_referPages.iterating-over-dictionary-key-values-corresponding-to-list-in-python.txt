Working in Python 2.7. I have a dictionary with team names as the keys and the amount of runs scored and allowed for each team as the value list:I would like to be able to feed the dictionary into a function and iterate over each team (the keys).Here's the code I'm using. Right now, I can only go team by team. How would I iterate over each team and print the expected win_percentage for each team?Thanks for any help.
You have several options for iterating over a dictionary.If you iterate over the dictionary itself (), you will be iterating over the keys of the dictionary.  When looping with a for loop, the behavior will be the same whether you loop over the dict () itself, or :You can also iterate over both the keys and the values at once by iterating over :You can even perform your tuple unpacking while iterating:
You can very easily iterate over dictionaries, too:
Dictionaries have a built in function called .Try:
Dictionary objects allow you to iterate over their items. Also, with pattern matching and the division from  you can do simplify things a bit.Finally, you can separate your logic from your printing to make things a bit easier to refactor/debug later.
List comprehension can shorten things...
