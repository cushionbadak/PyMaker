In python, is there a built-in way to do a readline() on string?  I have a large chunk of data and want to strip off just the first couple lines w/o doing split() on the whole string.Hypothetical example:I want this to result in: I know it would be fairly easy to write a class that does this, but I'm looking for something built-in if possible.EDIT: Python v2.7
Python 2You can use StringIO:Be sure to use cStringIO if performance is important.Python 3You can use io.StringIO:
Why not just only do as many splits as you need? Since you're using all of the resulting parts (including the rest of the string), loading it into some other buffer object and then reading it back out again is probably going to be slower, not faster (plus the overhead of function calls).If you want the first  lines separated out, just do .So for your function:or if you really wanted to get fancy:
The easiest way for both python 2 and 3 is using string's method splitlines(). This returns a list of lines.['some', 'multilene', 'string']
Do it like StringIO does it:So this means: Seems more elegant than using the whole StringIO...
in Python string have method splitlines
