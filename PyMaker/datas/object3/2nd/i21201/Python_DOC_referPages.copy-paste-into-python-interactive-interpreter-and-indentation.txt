Natural Text
This piece of code, test.py:can be succesfully executed with  or , but when one tries to copy-paste it into python interpreter:Why is it so? Can interpreter by configured in such a way that it would read copy-pasted text succesfully? I guess that may affect typing in the interpreter, but that's ok for me.
Indentation is probably lost or broken. Have a look at IPython -- it's enhanced python interpreter with many convenient features. One of them is a magic function  that allows you to paste multiple lines of code.It also has tab-completion, auto-indentation.. and many more. Have a look at their site.Using  in ipython:And copy-and-paste stuff is one of the things fixed in the qt console, here's using a plain old copy-and-paste of your code block "just works" in the new :
I don't know any trick for the standard command prompt, but I can suggest you a more advanced interpreter like IPython that has a special syntax for multi-line paste:Another option is the bpython interpreter that has an automatic paste mode (if you are typing too fast to be an human):
Do  to Automatic indentation OFF. after that you can past your code in IPython.
Continuation lines are needed when entering a multi-line construct.  --Interactive mode, The Python Tutorial (v2) (v3)So you need to enter:I've yet to find a suitable explanation as to why it's different to a non-interactive session, alas.
All of the current answers suggest you change to IPython. For a python-only solution, you can use textwrap to remove leading whitespace from lines.e.g.
One other solution I recently found for similar problem:
If you are like me and use Notepad++ (to copy and paste from), try to replace tabs by spaces by going to settings>preferences>language and check the replace by spaces.I had this problem myself for so long and I found out that python.exe recognizes spaces.
