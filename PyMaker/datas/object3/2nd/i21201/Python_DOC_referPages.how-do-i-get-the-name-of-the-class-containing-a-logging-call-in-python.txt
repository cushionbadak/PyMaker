If I want the function name I can simply include  in the Formatter. But how do I get the name of the class containing the logging call instead?I've gone through the documentation for , but I can't find any mentioning of it.
For a rather easy, pythonic way to get the class name to output with your logger, simply use a logging class.By naming the logger as above, the  will be the name of your classexample outputAlternative(s)Non-inheritance
There is almost certainly a better way of doing this, but until someone points that out, this will work:The output of this is the following:
I personally just tend to name my loggers after classes, as it makes it much easier to track down where a particular message came from. So you can have a root logger named "top", and for the module "a" and class "testclass", I name my logger "top.a.testclass". I don't see the need to otherwise retrieve the classname, since the log message should give you all the information you need. @ed's response above, it feels very unpythonic to me and it is not something I would be comfortable with using on production code.
This is a function to make an informative log message using the representation class method:https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#reprThis can be implemented to any class using a mix-in:You can than be associated with a class using multiple inheritance:Usage
