You need to use  to denote binary number.Also when converting string to a number using , specify base 2 (the second optional parameter). Otherwise it is interpreted as a decimal number:And, you don't need to call  for , because it's already an int object.UPDATE If you want to get a string representation back, use  or  with format specify  (0: leading zeros, 8: at least 8 digits, b: binary)
