I want to make this code compatible with python2-3 : There is no  or  on  type in python 3. What is the best workaround to make this code python2-3 compatible?
I highly recommend using six library for writing Python 2/3 compatible code.Plus use  for checking type instead of .  won't work in case of multiple-inheritance:Other approach is to basically write your own aliases for compatibility based on Python version obtained using :A good example of this is  file from requests library:Now you can import these functions from this file instead of using the builtins directly.
