I have 2 matrix 100kx200 and 200x100kif they were small matrix I would just use numpy dot product however the matrix is too big, and also I can't use loops is there a smart way for doing this?
A possible optimization is Computing  requires 10k×200×10k operations, while summing the rows first will reduce the multiplication to 1×200×10k operations, giving a 10k× improvement.This is mainly due to recognizingSimilar for the other axis.(Note:  is equivalent to  for 2D matrixes and 1D vectors on Python 3.5+ with numpy 1.10.0+)Illustration:Now, if we simply do , we would need 18 multiply and 6 addition ops. On the other hand, if we do  we would only need 6 multiply and 2 addition ops. An improvement of 3x because we had 3 rows in . As for OP's case, this should give 10k times improvement over simple  computation since he has 10k rows in .
There are two  happening - One from the marix-multilication with , and then with the explicit .We could use  to do both of those in one go, like so -Sample run -Runtime test -Sadly, doesn't look like we are doing any better with .For changing to , just swap the output string notation there - , like so -
Some quick time tests using the idea I added to Divakar's answer: is actually faster than !For larger arrays the  advantage decreases
