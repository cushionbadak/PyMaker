This question already has an answer here:Most Pythonic Way to Build Dictionary From Single List                    2 answers                Is there a faster way in generating a dictionary with a certain default value?  I basically want an equavalent ofbut for dictionary.  I currently have:The problem is with n = 1000000, the times I am getting with this implementation is 0.016s for the array and 0.318 for the dicts.  Is there a faster way to do this for the dictionary?
Yup.  is designed for this exact use case. Your example  could be made directly with:Slightly slower, but more flexible, are  comprehensions (2.7/3.1+):That will be a little slower in 3.x, and slower than that in 2.x (because  is a keyword in 3.x and doesn't invoke LEGB lookup, but it's only a normal built-in name in 2.x and therefore has to perform multiple  lookups under the hood on each use, just in case it's been reassigned).  will be just as fast in either case, because  is only looked up once.
