The following minimal program reproduces the problem.If you run the program and send a SIGTERM to the process, the print statement in line 16 (stopping event loop) is called but the programm does not terminate and the print statement in line 13 (event loop has stopped) is never called. So it seems that the event loop is never stopped and  blocks indefinitely.Why is this?Note: A modified version of the program, where  is not called by a signal handler but by a seperate thread with a delay, works as expected. How can it make a difference how  is called?
Instead of  use :
