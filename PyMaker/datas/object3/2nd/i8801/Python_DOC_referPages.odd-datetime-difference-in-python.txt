Could someone tell me how come python shows a difference of 1310 seconds between two dates?
As you can read here a  object has three fields: ; ; and . Or as is specified in the documentation:(...)Only days, seconds and microseconds are stored internally. Arguments are converted to those units:A millisecond is converted to 1000 microseconds.A minute is converted to 60 seconds.An hour is converted to 3600 seconds.A week is converted to 7 days.(formatting added)Althout the constructor is  and thus provides ways to enter hours, it thus converts the , , etc. all to seconds. The constructor will look like:(but probably a bit more advanced, etc.)So that means that  actually is modulo day, and without microseconds.You can however use  to return the total amount of seconds:So  is basically:If you divide your  by , you will see that it returns:so 21 minutes and 50 seconds
