How do I write the code by using binary search:Like define low, high, middle for each of element. As,15 is the largest element in  smaller than 17.19 is the largest element in  smaller than 20.Since floor doesn't exist, output is -1.Can someone help me with it?
You can simply use the  module and decrement the obtained index.This generates the following results (for your given sample input):Mind that  must be sorted, and that in case  is an element of , you cannot make the distinction between "not found" and -1 as a result. Since we use binary search, the algorithm runs in O(log n).
