In the following code, how do I return only those values as True, where order of elements in checklist is followed in routelist? For eg: should return as True  but not .
Make a set for membership testingGenerator expressions to filter AND maintain orderUse zip to pair up items in  and the target lists for comparison.To ensure all items are present as well as in the correct order, use itertools.zip_longest.Using  would have produced an incorrect result:Or just make new, filtered lists and compare.
Use a mapping to determine the weight of each value, filter out the ones that don't match, and check that it's ordered properly:Result:
It also works on edge cases where expected_seq has values which the input parameter doesn't example 
Not sure this is a good solution, but it seems it works.The main idea is quite simple: filter out everything which is not in routelist, then enumerate the rest and check indexes. Return logical and of match for all indexes (reduce function).
