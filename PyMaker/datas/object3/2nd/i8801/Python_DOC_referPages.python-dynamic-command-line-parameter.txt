I need to specify command line parameters depending on another parameter.So the first specified parameter should specify the action and the following the arguments for that action.Is there a framwork/library with which this can easily be done?I have looked into  so far but couldn't find anything that could do this?
The problem is that  is absolutely gigantic and I guess that's why you couldn't find it easily, but if you had read through the entire documentation (or knew the terms to look for) you would find that the concept of subcommands will probably achieve what you want to do.  Here is a very quick and simple example:A simple usage:Of course, check out the documentation for all the details, like using  to give it more meaningful names (which you can see being used with the  call in the example).
