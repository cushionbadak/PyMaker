I need some help writing a pretty simple code (at least in pseudo code):I want fit data using a polynomial of order , where n is a parameter and should be changable. On top of that I would like to always keep the first three coefficients fixed to be zero. So I need something likeSo problems I can not sove atm is:How do I create a polynomial function with  number of coefficents? I basicly need to create a list of variables of length .If that is solved than we could put  to  to .I hope I was able to make myself clear, if not please help me to refine my question.
You currently do not keep the first 3 coefficient fixed to 0, you just give them a default value.Arbitrary argument lists seem to be what you are looking for:If the number of arguments MUST be of fixed length (for instance ), you can check len(args) and raise an error if necessary.Calling  now returns the polynomial function with the coefficients You can find more information in Python's documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#more-on-defining-functions
