Natural Text
RETURNS:So I built a webscraper to go get calendar events posted to several websites of interest and they have their dates in various non-standard formats. I am using  to convert the free text dates into something more usable in a calendar. The problem I just realized I am facing is for events that I scrape that have already occurred. I narrowed the problem down to starting when the month of the date to be parsed is at least one month prior to the current date, as demonstrated above in the code. What can I do to either correctly parse these dates (they aren't all in the format as depicted above) or otherwise catch them so they don't get added erroneously to my google calendar? 
I would recommmend using the  library:example:
