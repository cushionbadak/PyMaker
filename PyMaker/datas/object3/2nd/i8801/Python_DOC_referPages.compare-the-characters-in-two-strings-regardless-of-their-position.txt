I have a function  that compares two strings and the elements of said strings, regardless of their position, and returns the number of identical elements. The code I have:The only issue is that tests such as:fail. I guess because it's only checking the first elements, and returning that result. Is there anyway to get around this whilst using  or should I take the more arduous route?
The easiest solution would be to use :Which should work correct:The problem with  is that it zips the elements by index, so you only compare items at the same position.
