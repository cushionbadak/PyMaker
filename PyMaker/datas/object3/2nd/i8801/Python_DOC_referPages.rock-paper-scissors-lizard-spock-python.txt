I am creating a rock paper scissors lizard spock game in Python for my class and i am trying to figure out why whatever choice I make I am always winning even though I set up all my if statements correct. ``
To summarize all of the things you should pay attention to:boolean conditions - the result changes with the parentheses that are inside the condition.  --> this basically calculates the  part first (like in regular math) and then you have  which evaluates to True.  --> this basically calculates the  part first (like in regular math) and then you have  which evaluates to False - because you don't use parentheses. Do not call a function within the same function - this is called , and it's not for the what you need. Use a  loop, that runs as long as i.e. -  you didn't get a proper choice input ().Your instrcuions choice - the choice made by the user doesn't really change the flow of the game. the game starts also if the user entered . You should Add an exit statement in the  function.
The reason is you are missing parentheses on all of the "if" conditions.
