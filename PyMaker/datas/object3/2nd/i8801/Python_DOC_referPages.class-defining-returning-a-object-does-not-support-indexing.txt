This is my first attempt at defining a class.  My intention is to provide dimensions of sprites and totals of frames in a sprite page and have the class calculate start and stop points for all of the frames.  Then, it would add them to a tuple containing all of the completed math so it can blit the sprite at the correct time and location to create the animation.  It works if I manually add all of the frame locations to the tuple in the main game program in this way:But the above code is gonna get cluttered very quickly and I'd like to use this same class to pull animation frames for other characters later in the game.I think the math is solid, but I suspect there is something I don't know about lists / tuples that is causing this error.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  I've read 4 tutorials on lists/tuples, and it just isn't helping me...   Here is my code:and error message:
If you want to access your custom class as a list you must implement operator overloading, especially __getitem__:Sample code: (I implemented a list  to store the items)
