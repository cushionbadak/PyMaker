I want PyCharm to warn me when I forgot to declare types for a function or a variable. Is there any way to make PyCharm do that?
On official blog there are some words about PEP 526 supportSyntax for variable annotations PyCharm 2016.3  EAP brings support for the new PEP 526 Python 3.6 standard, which  introduces the syntax for type annotations of variables including  class variables and instance variables. That means PyCharm now  recognizes the new syntax and uses this meta information about types  for type inference. Ultimately this positively affects code  completion, inspections and error checkingI really doubt it's possible to make PyCharm forcing declaring types. It's not a statically typed language and declaring types should be optional.
