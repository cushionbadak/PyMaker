You can use string methods. If you encounter a 'the' in any form, you just put it into lower case. Every other part of the string is assumed to be a name and is capitalized.This uses the join() method to merge the modified parts of the string again and builds a new list based on the names list.To eliminate duplicates, the set function is used, finally the set is converted back to a list.
