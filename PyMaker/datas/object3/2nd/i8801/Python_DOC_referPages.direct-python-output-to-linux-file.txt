This question already has an answer here:Correct way to write line to file?                    10 answers                I have a script written in python which I am running on ubuntu. I would like the output of this command to be directed into the file.  I would ideally use the python.py > file.txt but the script has some interactive parts which I won't be able to use if I redirect the output to a file. I tried changing the code to this but I get syntax errors. I literally use python for the first time so excuse my lack of knowledge. Any ideas on how to do that? Thank you,Alex
you can open the file with  like you did. then instead of printing you would use becasue you opened the file in append mode (denoted by the "a" in open) it would add this string to the end of the file. you might also need to add a new line after your string:when you are done writing:
On Python 3, it could look like:I've added space after the comma for readability. See What does ** (double star) and * (star) do for parameters?On Python 2, you could add  at the top of your script and convert to string manually  or just:You could use  object instead of , ,  e.g., a tuple/list:or for readability, you could use  to create a custom class:It enables , ,  syntax. If you need a mutable object, you could use :On Python 2, you could partially emulate it using .For a richer functionality, you could try  package:To run this and other code examples that require third-party Python packages from PyPI, you could use  for convenience (to install, run: ). Though it is not necessary, you could just install dependencies manually instead:  (make sure to run your script with the same  executable as : ).To print  to the file:To save it in JSON format:
If you use with-keyword; the file-stream will only stay open inside the block. Then you dont have to remember closing it when you are done.If you meant to append to file like echo "test" >> test.txt and not echo "test" > test.txtThen just change the open mode to 'a' instead of 'w'
