I want to replicate a list more than 1000 times and then append to a larger list. For instance:When replicating this list and then nesting it a hundred times:So far I've only come across a*2, which is not want I want.
You can easily replicate the list by the following.The above will create reference.If you need separate copy then do the following.
In that case you should use . But note that the  operator will create multiply references to your main object, since it's a mutable object. Instead as a more pythonic way you can use  which will give you separate copies of your main object:
You're very close. While  may give you , there is a way to use that same operator to get the result you want. It's just repeating the contents, so try .
Use list comprehensionYou can do various such operations over lists.Check this link here
try
As per my understanding, you need to replicate list without using same reference to perform some operation in future.you will try this piece of code to generate a list containing n times replicated listOr simply use this shorthand:hopefully this code is solve your problem
