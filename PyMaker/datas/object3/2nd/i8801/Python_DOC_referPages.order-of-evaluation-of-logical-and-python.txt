In python, which is more efficient:orThe latter would be more efficient if  isn't calculated when  is false. But I can't seem to pinpoint whether that's the case in Python docs. Maybe someone can point me to it?
Short-CircuitingPython doesn't run  in  if  is false. You can try it out yourself:The reason Python does this is it has something called short-circuiting which optimising logic expressions like this one. Python realises that if if  is false then there is no point in checking  because the whole expression will be false anyway.How to Avoid Short-CircuitingYou can bypass this in Python by using the bitwise versions of the logic operators:For example:Note however that you need to wrap  in  because bitwise only works on the same data types.PerformanceI would imagine performance wise the one with only one if statement would be faster as other wise python might have to go through 2 if statements if it finds the conditions are true.
This is called short-circuiting, and it is mentioned in the docs.And the answer is, Python will not evaluate b if a is False.
It evaluates from left to right, simple experimentThis outputs
