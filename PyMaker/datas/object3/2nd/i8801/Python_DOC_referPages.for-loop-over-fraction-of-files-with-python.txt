Is there a way to create a for loop that executes over a fraction of files?In this case, I would like to move 1/5 (the last 1/5 of the files) of all my images in subfolders to another folder with its subfolders. I have started some, but need help.
Sure, just slice  accordingly:You may need to make adjustments if there is specific rounding behavior you expect.Also, don't use  to move files. Use .
