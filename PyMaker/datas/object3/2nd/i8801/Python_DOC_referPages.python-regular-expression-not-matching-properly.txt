I have a stringI want to retrieve According to this postWhat regex can match sequences of the same character?I think I successfully retrieved this pattern using a online regex parser.
There are two things you should consider here:1) Use raw string literals when defining regex (or double escape the  inside the pattern so that  could be parsed as a backreference and not as an octal character notation), and2) Use  here to get whole match values since  will fetch only the values captured with capturing groups:See the Python demo.Here,  is the whole match stored inside the  that is returned by .
