There is no way to return  from issubclass when class is derived from class with  implementation. I modified code from:python subclasscheck & subclasshookI only added '(Sized)' to both class definitions:Is there any way to return  in this case? Or maybe I'm doing something wrong?
The problem is that you  when the  doesn't exit early. And as stated in the documentation:If it returns NotImplemented, the subclass check is continued with the usual mechanism.So it uses the normal subclass check and finds that you do, in fact, inherit from  so returns .There are two solutions: instead of . However, do you really want/need  to return  for direct subclasses?If you inherit from  for classes  and  it works as expected:
I think the good way to implement this:I think that when we assume that  is mechanism similar to compilation (or reflection) in other languages we should return False. If there is some doubt the class is correct subbclass then code shouldn't run or even compile (not in python).
