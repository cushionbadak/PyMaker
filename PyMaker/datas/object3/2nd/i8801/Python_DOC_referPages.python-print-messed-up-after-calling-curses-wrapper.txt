Natural Text
I am having a problem with curses library in Python. Consider the following code:The problem is every text printed by "print" function is messed up even before calling "create_screen()" function which initiates the screen by "curses.initscr()" 
You can use  and  normally before and after your program uses . Also, you do not have to put all your code into , and you don't have to pass the  function to , either.  is just a function like any other. Check out this simple example:This prints and asks for user input, then shows a curses screen, then goes back into "normal" printing mode.
