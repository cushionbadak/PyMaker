In chapter 2 of Data Science from Scratch by Joel Grus, the following examples are provided:According to Grus, Python treats  (an empty list) as a "falsey" argument. So why do we get different results based on whether the  or  argument is applied to an empty list?
Per the documentation of :Return  if all elements of the iterable are true (or if the iterable is empty).And the documentation for :Return  if any element of the iterable is true. If the iterable is empty, return .An empty iterable  is falsey, but it doesn't matter as the return value is just by implementation. If you're wondering why this happens, it's just a consequence of the implementation. If you look at the equivalent code for  from the documentation:Because of this specific implementation, if the iterable is empty, the  loop is skipped completely as there are no elements. Thus, it returns . For , the documentation provides the equivalent code:The reason it returns  for an empty iterable is the same reason  return . Since there are no elements in the list, the  loop is skipped and it returns . This implementation does have a reasoning, since empty set logic makes  return true, see this Math.SE post and this SO answer.  can be thought of as "there are as many true elements as elements". Since an empty set has no true elements and no elements, it returns true because 0 equals 0.  can be thought of as "there's at least one...", and since the set is empty, there's not at least one because there is not even one element. Thus  returns true for an empty set, and  returns false for an empty set.
The logical reasoning behind this definition is as follows: is related to the existential quantifier while  is related to the universal quantifier and follows their logical norms.Translate  as there is at least one: At least one element of  evaluates to true <-- NO.
