Let's say I have cassandra table define like this:I have 3 list of same size let's  records in each list. Is it a good practice to insert data using a for loop like this:
Prepared statements with concurrent execution will be your best bet. The driver provides utility functions for concurrent execution of statements with sequences of parameters, just as you have with your lists: execute_concurrent_with_argsZipping your lists together will produce a sequence of parameter tuples suitable for input to that function.Something like this:
Its probably a good idea to start by looking at the python driver getting started guide. If you have already seen that then apologies but I thought it worth mentioning.Generally speaking you'd create your session object and then do your inserts inside your loop, probably using something like a prepared statement (talked about further down the getting started page) but also here and hereThe example of the above page uses this as a good starting pointYou may also find this blog helps when talking about better throughput with the python driverYou might find the python driver github page a useful resource, in particular I found this example using a prepared statement here that might help you too.
