Normally when I want to run a script from the command prompt or shell I navigate to the directory my script file is in and type  and press EnterHowever at the moment a script I want to run relies an a package in the virtual environment. In the Python documentation I found a way to solve this relying on the execution of an activate.bat file:Now I wonder if there is an alternative to this, something like . 
so sorry @Elmex80s there are no way for that in the other way yes I meant from inside a virtualenv you can access to the packages installed in you global system but before install this virtual env you need to use the option system-site-packages and you would have the access I talking about it. You can see all this here:https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/#cmdoption--system-site-packagesRegards
