I have a list of strings which represent tuples, like so:Is there any way to sort it by accessing the numbers after each q, so that the list looks like this:It would be easy if these were integers, however I need to keep the string format as they are now...
You can sort based upon a key which you define:Usage:
You can split the string at the first "," using  then  "(q" customize the sort using by supplying a "key" function
result['(q0,0)', '(q1,0)', '(q2,0)', '(q3,0)', '(q4,0)']
