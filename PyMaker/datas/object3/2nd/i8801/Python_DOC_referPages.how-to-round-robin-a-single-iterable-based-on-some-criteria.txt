I have a list of dictionaries, which I want to make round robin sorted.I want this result:The way I solved it is as follows:Using Python's  to separate the items by source and then using the roundrobin solution which I got from Python's docs.But, the solution, does not cover all the cases, for example  will break when one source is missing or a new source has been added.How can I make a solution to cover more edge cases and make the solution pythonic?
Here's a solution using  to split your input into the appropriate groups:Because of the way  works, the clever use of iterators in the version of  you took from the docs isn't very helpful, so I've rewritten it in a way that's hopefully easier to follow:Group the iterable by While you still have any groups left:Pop the first group from the front of the list of groupsPop the first item from that group, and yield it.If there are still items in the group, append it back to the end of the list.Here it is in action:The version of  above assumes that your list is already sorted. If not, it'll need to be sorted before it's grouped:
