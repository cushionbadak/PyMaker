I have below code on list comprehension.This is giving me below errorHowever, below code works.Is there any scoping rule for the second  loop in list comprehension?I am using Python 3.6.
Good question,however this code works well in ,and it will throw  in .It can be a surprise to get the UnboundLocalError in previously  working code when it is modified by adding an assignment statement  somewhere in the body of a function.This is because when you make an assignment to a variable in a scope, that variable becomes local to that scope and shadows any similarly named variable in the outer scope. Since it assigns a new value to x, the compiler recognizes it as a local variable. Thus the earlier variable attempts to print the uninitialized local variable and an error results.See more details from Why am I getting an UnboundLocalError when the variable has a value?.
