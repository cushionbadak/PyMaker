I am trying to create a program that will open a port on the local machine and let others connect into it via netcat. My current code is.I am new to Python and sockets. But when I run this code it will allow me to send a netcat connection with the command:But then on my Python script I get the error for the c.send:I am basically just trying to open a port, allow netcat to connect and have a full shell on that machine.
The reason for this error is that in Python 3, strings are Unicode, but when transmitting on the network, the data needs to be bytes strings instead. So... a couple of suggestions:Suggest using  instead of  to prevent possible issues where you may not have sent the entire msg with one call (see docs).For literals, add a  for bytes string: For variables, you need to encode Unicode strings to byte strings (see below)Best solution (should work w/both 2.x & 3.x):Epilogue/background: this isn't an issue in Python 2 because strings are bytes strings already -- your OP code would work perfectly in that environment. Unicode strings were added to Python in releases 1.6 & 2.0 but took a back seat until 3.0 when they became the default string type. Also see this similar question as well as this one.
You can decode it to str with .
You can change the send line to this:The b makes it bytes instead.
