I want to generate something like hash for almost every object. It is currently implemented as:.However, it generates different hash for  and . I really want the generated hash to be identical for them. Thus I want a function that sorts a general object (maybe something contains a dictionary as an attribute) and make sure  and  pickle to the same bytes.Is this possible?Or is there a better way to generate such hash?Edit:I don't care if data types are altered. For example,  can do the job for a dictionary. But I want a more general method.
