My main problem is that I have no clue how to do the argparser that will allow me to make it a command line program. Help?Here's what I have for code so far:

When your scripts get complicated with more input options etc. you can take a look at argparser. https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html
To use  you will first want to declare the  object, then you can add arguments to the object using the  method. After this you can use the  method to parse the command line arguments.As an example using your program:You will invoke it from the command line in the same order the commands are added in this case, so in your case For more information see: https://docs.python.org/3/howto/argparse.html
