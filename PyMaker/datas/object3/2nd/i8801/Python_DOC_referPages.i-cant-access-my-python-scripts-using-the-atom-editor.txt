Trying to execute 1.py and 2.py scripts which are saved in my .atom folder.However when I copy exactly what my tutorial video types I get errors (shown in screenshot). Also the atom tutorial doesn't seem to work for me either.Tried creating a 3.py file in the user1 directory so I could access directly but all I get is a quick flash of a pop up window and then nothing.
First, python should be in the PATH.Then, inside powershell, if you're in "C:\Users\user1" you should be able to launch:and see something, as long as  exists and prints something.One alternative would be to install script package. Then  will launch the script directly. You'd still need to install python and have it in PATH.If you still have problems, read this page (learnpythonthehardway.org) very carefully. Don't jump any step, and you should be fine.
