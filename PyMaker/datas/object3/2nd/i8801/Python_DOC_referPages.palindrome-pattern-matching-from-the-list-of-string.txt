one question regarding repeating patternI have:Now let's assume I want to get only 121 from a list or 535 or 737 whatever has first and third position the same. Do you have any idea how would i define this with pattern variable?Thank you
You can use a capturing group and a backreference:If you want to make sure it's the whole string :Or that the 3 digits form one single number :The last 2 regexen would prevent  from matching .UpdateIf you want to match  but not , you could use a negative lookahead :It means : a word boundary, a digit not followed by itself, another digit, the same digit as the first one and a word boundary :) 
Use a backreference:Note you need to use a raw string literal, or you'd have to escape the  twice.Besides, if you want to match the whole string, you need to add  at the end of the pattern since  only anchors the match at the start of the string. Or, if you use Python 3.4 and newer, you may use  regex with the  method.
