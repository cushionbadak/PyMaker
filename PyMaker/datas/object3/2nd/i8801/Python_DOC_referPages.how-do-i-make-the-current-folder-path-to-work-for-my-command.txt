I'm new to Python and really want this command to work so I have been looking around on google but I still can't find any solution. I'm trying to make a script that deletes a folder inside the folder my Blender game are inside so i have been trying out those commands:The Folder i want to delete is called "killme" and I know you can just do: but I want the path to start at the folder that the game is in and not the full C:/programs/blabla/blabla/test/killme path.Happy if someone could explain.
I think you are using shutil.rmtree command in wrong way. You may use the following.Look at the reference https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.rmtreeSyntax: shutil.rmtree(path, ignore_errors=False, onerror=None)Assuming that your current project directory is 'test'. Then, your code will look like the follwing:NOTE: It will fail if the files are read only in the folder.Hope it helps!
What you could do is set a base path like and then append the path and use something like:If you are executing the python as a standalone script that is inside the desired folder, you can do the following:Hope my answer was helpful
The best thing you could do is use the os library. Then with the os.path function you can list all the directories and filenames and hence can delete/modify the required folders while extractring the name of folders in the same way you want.
