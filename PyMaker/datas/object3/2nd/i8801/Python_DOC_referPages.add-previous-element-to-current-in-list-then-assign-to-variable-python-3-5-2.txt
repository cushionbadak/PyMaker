First post on here, I'm stoked!  Okay, so here is the question:  How do I add previous element to current element and then make a new list from those values to add them to matplotlib graph?  Here is an example of my code:'''I think you can see the point I'm trying to make'''del example_list[:]'''This works for hard coding it in, but I want this to happen for hundreds of elements. (when people add to list from my "simple_finance_app" Python script)'''  Thanks for the help!  (P.S. I already have the matplotlib code so no need to add that, however, I it could help others who read this question/answer)
You can use the  method for that:This generates:If the function (here ) works in O(n), then  will work in O(n) whereas your hardcoded solution works in O(n2).Basically the  function takes as input an iterable  and a function , and each iteration it calls  on the accumulator and the new element. In the first step it emits the first element, and then the accumulator becomes that element. So it basically generates . But without calculating  each time. It is thus semantically equivalent to:but probably less error prone and more efficient.
You mean  combined with slicing?Or in general:
Vanilla  loop solution:Note that repeatedly calling  in a  loop/comprehension will result in O(n^2) complexity.
