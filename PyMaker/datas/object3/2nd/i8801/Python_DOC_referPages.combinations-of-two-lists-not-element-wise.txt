I have two lists:I want to get the combinations produced between the elements of list  and the elements of list a but treating elements of  as pairs (or triples etc. etc.) as the example below which gives  number of combinations.I have tried to use  (as described here) but this will give only the 6 possible combinations. 
You can use  but specify  to be . So you can use:The  will generate tuples like:So here the first element of the tuple is the one that is attached to , the second one to . Now we  them together with the  list, producing:Now it is only a matter of formatting (), and ining them together and  them (or you can use list comprehension to produce a list).The result for your sample input is:Note that the elements here are generated lazily. This can be useful if you are for instance only interested in the first  ones, or when you do not want to generate all of them at once.
You could explicitly create your pairwise items using , then operate on those pairs again with  will contain the two lists that can fed into  again.The result is:
