I'm using a Class provided by a client (I have no access to the object code), and I'm trying to check if a object has a attribute. The attribute itself is write only, so the  fails:Is there a different way to check if an attribute exists?
You appear to have some kind of native code proxy that bridges Python to an extension, and it is rather breaking normal Python conventionsThere are two possibilities:The  object has a namespace that implements attributes as descriptors, and the  descriptor only has a  method (and possibly a  method). In that case, look for the descriptor:Here the  function retrieves the namespace for the class used for .The proxy uses  (or even ) and  hooks to handle arbitrary attributes. You are out of luck here, you can't detect what attributes either method will support outside of  and trying to set the attribute directly. Use  guarding:You may have to use a debugger or  statement to figure out exactly what exception is being thrown (use a  block to capture all exceptions then inspect ); in the traceback in your question the exception message at the end looks decidedly non-standard. That project really should raise an  at that point.Given the rather custom exception being thrown, my money is on option 2 (but option 1 is still a possibility if the  method on the descriptor throws the exception).
