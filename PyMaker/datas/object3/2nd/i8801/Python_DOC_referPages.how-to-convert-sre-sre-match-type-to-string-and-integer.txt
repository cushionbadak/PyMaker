I am trying to parse regular expression in Python and am assigning the value of the parsed string to 2 variables.For instance if I have a stringI want to assign value 1 to an integer variable called rank and values[Michael, Jessica] to an array called name.When I parse using  and assign value using  function the type of the variables assigned is _sre.SRE_Match . Can you please help me on how to convert it to integer and string formats respectively.
The following line:should be replaced with:to get a string.If you want  object, use :BTW, using , your program can be simplified.Alternatively, instead of using regular expression, when parsing HTML, it's better to use library like BeatufiulSoup, lxml.
You can try this :DemoThen iterate through the matches and assigned to array or variable ...Sample Code (Run it here):
