How do I copy a file in Python?I couldn't find anything under .
 has many methods you can use. One of which is:Copy the contents of the file named  to a file named . The destination location must be writable; otherwise, an  exception will be raised. If  already exists, it will be replaced. Special files such as character or block devices and pipes cannot be copied with this function.  and  are path names given as strings. 

 is often more useful than  because:it allows  to be a directory (instead of the complete target filename), in which case the basename of  is used for creating the new file;it preserves the original modification and access info (mtime and atime) in the file metadata (however, this comes with a slight overhead).Here is a short example:
Copying a file is a relatively straightforward operation as shown by the examples below, but you should instead use the shutil stdlib module for that.If you want to copy by filename you could do something like this:
You can use one of the copy functions from the  package:Example:
Use the shutil module.Copy the contents of the file named src to a file named dst. The destination location must be writable; otherwise, an IOError exception will be raised. If dst already exists, it will be replaced. Special files such as character or block devices and pipes cannot be copied with this function. src and dst are path names given as strings.Take a look at filesys for all the file and directory handling functions available in standard Python modules.
In Python, you can copy the files using module module module1) Copying files using  module  signature  signature  signature  signature2) Copying files using  module  signature  signature3) Copying files using  module  signature  signature
Directory and File copy example - From Tim Golden's Python Stuff:http://timgolden.me.uk/python/win32_how_do_i/copy-a-file.html
Look at module shutil. It contains function copyfile(src, dst) 
You could use or as I did it,  where  is the name that I had generated inside the program.This is a Linux only solution 
For large files, what I did was read the file line by line and read each line into an array. Then, once the array reached a certain size, append it to a new file. 

I suggest using Swati's answer, but supposing you have a text file and don't want to use additional libraries in your code just to copy it, you can use the following one-liner:
Firstly, I made an exhaustive cheatsheet of shutil methods for your reference.Secondly, explain methods of copy in exmaples: manipulate opened objects  Copy and rename  Copy without preseving the metadata  Copy with preseving the metadata`shutil.copytree()``Recursively copy an entire directory tree rooted at src, returning the destination directory
Open the source file in read mode, and write to destination file in write mode.Above Code is self explanatory, anything to explain it more is like adding more overhead to the payload. Not all answers need explanation
