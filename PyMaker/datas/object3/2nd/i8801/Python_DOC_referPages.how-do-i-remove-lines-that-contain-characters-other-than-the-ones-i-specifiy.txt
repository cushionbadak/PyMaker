Natural Text
I have a list that contains DNA and random lines like this:I want to make a function that filters out any lines that containing anything other than the characters 'A' 'G' 'C' or 'T'. So far my code has a very crude way of filtering that can easily be fooled:If anyone can point me to some helpful tutorials regarding python data manipulation that would be great too. Thanks!!!
Possibly the best tool for data manipulation you can learn is comprehensions (check out the Python docs tutorial to learn about those). Here's a solution using them:You can see you basically describe the data you want. The above means "give me all the strings where all of the characters in the string are in the set {"G", "A", "T", "C"}.
There are many different and efficient ways to do it. This is one way:
You can use re.search with regex  which tries to find out non  characters, if there is any in the string, exclude it with an  in the list comprehension:
