It looks like  doesn't print to the console on AppVeyor -- the output is redirected. Therefore  is used to encode Unicode text to bytes while printing to stdout.  supports only a few from a million of Unicode characters. To change  here, you could  envvar -- utf-8 character encoding supports all Unicode characters.
