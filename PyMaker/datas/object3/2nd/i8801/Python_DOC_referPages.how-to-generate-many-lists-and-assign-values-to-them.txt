I want to read a specific number of lines from a list and assign all those values to a new list. Then I want to read the next bunch from the last_value+1 line from before for the exact same number of lines and assign those to a new list. So far I have this:Let's say  and I want to assign the first 10 values from  into my newly generated then I want the next 10 values from  to be assigned to  so . The code so far is:Now the problem is, that i cant append to mklist because it's a string:How can I assign those values within that loop?

You could use a more suitable collection, for example, a dictionary:
