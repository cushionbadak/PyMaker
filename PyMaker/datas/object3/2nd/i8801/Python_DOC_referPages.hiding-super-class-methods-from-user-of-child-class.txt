I am wondering if it is possible to prevent the user from invoking the methods of a parent class when using the child class. At the same time, I do wish that these methods be available to the methods of the child class themselves.For instance, suppose I have an implementation of a linked list. I then base a stack ADT implementation on it by inheriting (not sure if it is good design ...). Hence, I wish to "hide" the methods of LinkedList class from the user of the Stack class.LinkedList:Stack:
Here are the official syntax to declare protected and private method in a class.The protected method declared in the parent class will be callable from a child class. The private method declared in the parent class will be hidden from a child class.The raised Exception is:Step 1 - declare both private and protected method in the .Step 2 - declare function to call the both function from a .Step 3 - create an instance of  to check private and protected accesses.Check of protected method from the Child class ==> Access is allowedOutput: ""Output: ""Check of private method from the Child class ==> Access is deniedError: ""Error: ""
