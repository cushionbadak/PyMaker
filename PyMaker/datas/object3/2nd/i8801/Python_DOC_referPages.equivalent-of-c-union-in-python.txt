Say I have the following code in C++:And say I had the value of  somehow in Python, how would I be able to get the name of the file?For those of you that are unfamiliar with C++. What I am doing here is writing some value in  32-bit integer format to  and then interpreting the bitwise representation as an  32-bit integer in . I am taking the same 32 bits and interpreting them in two different ways.How can I do this in Python? There does not seem to be any explicit type specification in Python, so how can I reinterpret some set of bits in a different way?EDIT: I am using Python 2.7.12
I would use python struct for interpreting bits in different ways.something like following to print -12 as unsigned integer
