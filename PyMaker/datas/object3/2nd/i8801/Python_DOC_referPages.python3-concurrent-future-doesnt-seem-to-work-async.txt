I'm new to python and just trying a simple threading example. But I can't explain myself why this code is working synchronous:I'm basically from C# and thinking of a future as a  in C#. So this is a handle or token for the new Thread.I would expect following output:123Hello World.NoneBut I'm getting:Hello World.123NoneBefore something is printed the Console wait for 3 seconds. So this code is running synchron. Can someone help me up with the understanding of futures and tell me why the  isn't running on second thread?
The statements after the  is executed after the statements inside the  statements done.(because  internally calls  to wait the pending futures done, and related resources freed. See )By indenting those statement (, ) inside the  statement, you will get what you want.
