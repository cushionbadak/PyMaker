I am trying to test the utility of decorators in Python. When I write the following codes, there is an error:I first define a function  asAfter that, I use log_calls to decorate another function as:When I run the following codeThe error  comes. I don't know what is wrong with this decorator, and how to fix this.
You are passing in 2 arguments to your decorated function here:If you wanted to apply the  tuple and  dictionary as variable arguments, echo the function signature syntax, so use  and  again:See the Call expressions reference documentation:If the syntax  appears in the function call, expression must evaluate to an iterable. Elements from these iterables are treated as if they were additional positional arguments.[...]If the syntax  appears in the function call, expression must evaluate to a mapping, the contents of which are treated as additional keyword arguments.
