I have the following code:When I run this code on machine X everything is working just fine, but when when I try to run the same code on a different machine I end up with the following error:Am I doing something wrong or is the second machine messing with me?EDIT:When i used IDLE debugger on my second machine everything is working. it seems it is not working when running it normally, is there anything i can do to resolve this?
I can't believe that the same code is working for you on another machine with the same python version.Your issue is exactly what the Exception says it is . You need to provide  to  instead of a .You can convert your string into bytes via :Edit: Well, someone beat me to it :D
Try to do:Usually sockets work over bytes not strings, the error could be related to that, hope this can help.
