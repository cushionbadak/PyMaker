If you wanted to implement your provided code using a class, you could do so to the extent of something like this:I did not complete the class including all of your code, the rest will be for you to figure out - you can "modularize" your tkinter application by separating widgets, which will not only allow you to take a more methodical approach to the implementation, but also make your code more readable. If you are not familiar with classes, check out the chapter on them in the official Python Tutorial, and here is a great reference for tkinter, NMT Tkinter.
