This question already has an answer here:What's the logical value of “string” in Python?                    6 answers                I was doing a quick test on the "if" statement and the following code fragment results in the print producing output as expected.Case 1Results in >>> Roses are red, in the interpreterAlso: As expected.Then I tried:Case 2Again I got the result: Roses are redand :Can someone explain in the second case why the "if condition is satisfied" (if that is an appropriate way to describe the situation) and the print() is executed?I would have thought the correct operation would be something likewhere "do this" is executed only when "expression" evaluates to the Boolean value True. Why is "do this" executed when "expression" is a string?
The string "True" is truthy meaning that it evaluates to true in your if condition.
