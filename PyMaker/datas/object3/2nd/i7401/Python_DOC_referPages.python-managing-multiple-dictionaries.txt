I am doing some very basic operations with Python (3.6, but also tested in Python 2.11 - behavior is the same) and dictionaries. Here is the code sample:So far so good, when I print those dictionaries:I get my expected results:But if I attempt to modify with the values, for example:And do the same print again, I get:Question is: Why was the  dictionary changed? I have only modified , but this new key assignment for  dictionary also modified . Am I doing something wrong?
You have only one dict  and both of your dict are refers to the same dict . You have to copy this dict to get another dict.Try to:or:And now this constructions:Get expected result:
It's because the max_values and min_values are linked together. That is, they are both referencing initial_values. So if you change one you change the other. One solution would be to use deepcopy.
As you can see from the graph,  and  reference to  , which means  and  link to the address where you create initial_value dictionary. Once you update the value inside of the initial_val, it will also show in both   and .To avoid this problem, you can use In this way, it creates a new instance for your old dictionary.
Because you gave both of the values same dictionary just look at the first two lines of your code.
