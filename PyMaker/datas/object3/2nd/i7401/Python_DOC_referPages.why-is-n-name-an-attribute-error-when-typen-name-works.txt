I am getting an error as  has no attribute :But  is an instance of the  class, and  gives a result, so why does  throw an error. I expected that because  is an instance of class , it should have access to all attributes of that class. 
 is not an attribute on the  class (or any of its base classes):It is an attribute on the metaclass,  (it is a descriptor, so is bound to the  class when accessed on ):Just like attribute look-up on an instance can also look at the class, attribute lookup on a class looks for attributes on the metaclass.Attributes on the metaclass are not available on instances of the class.
