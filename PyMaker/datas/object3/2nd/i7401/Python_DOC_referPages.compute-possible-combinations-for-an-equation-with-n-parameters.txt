I need to compute all the possible combinations of an equation, given the number of parameters that are included in this equation. The available operations are the usual: For example, if I have an equation with two parameters the available combinations will be:If I have three parameters then the available combinations will be (96 combinations in total):and so on.I know that there is a similar question here however, I am not sure how to modify the code in order to generalise it for N number of parameters. EDIT:The code for computing the combinations when 3 parameters are available is the following: I thought that for N parameters  should become      where  is the number of parameters.I am not sure how to modify the elements within  in order to match any number of parameters N. 
You just have to modify the code in the answer in the link to work for you..
You can use  for the operators as follows:Here we are using  for computing all possible combinations between the symbols and the operators.
