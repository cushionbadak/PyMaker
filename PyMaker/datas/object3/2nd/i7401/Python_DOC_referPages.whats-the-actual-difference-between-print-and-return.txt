Here is my code. I would like to the the value for each key from python dict. So when I use  in function it's working fine but when I use  in function it's just return any one value not all. So, how can I get all values using ?
 is a statement
If you call the function from somewhere else, like another function or just from the terminal, a return statement would let you store the return value in a variable. Print simply displays the input given in the print function to the terminal where you call your tech-function
 terminates (ends) the function it's in, and wherever it was called from receives the value that it returned.So in your code: The loop starts, it hits the  statement, so it ends the function (and ends the loop) and just returns the first element it was at. Then the  statement, in which you called your function, will just print that one element, and that's it.On the other hand, if you replace your  with , then the function doesn't get terminated prematurely, so the loop runs over all the values and prints them.What you seem to have in mind, somewhat, is turning your function into an iterator. Try replacing  with  and see what happens, then read up on iterators and  in the python documentation!
Because when reached,  statement will terminate the function. To get the behavior you want, just rewrite it as
Your code consist of two main blocks:1. define a function 'tech'2. print the result of a call to function 'tech'Inside function tech there is a 'for te in arg.values()' loop. The loop gets initialized with the first value and the loop encounters the 'return' statement which forces the current value to be returned from function 'tech'. The loop is abortedThe print function receives the result of function tech and prints it (containing only the first argument)
