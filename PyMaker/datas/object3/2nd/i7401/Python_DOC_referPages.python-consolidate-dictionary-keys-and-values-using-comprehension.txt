How do I CONSOLIDATE the following using python COMPREHENSIONFROM (list of dicts)TO (list of dicts with tuple as key and list of 'server#'s as value
the need to be able to set default values to your dictionary and to have the same key several times may make a dict-comprehension a bit clumsy. i'd prefer something like this:a  may help:if you prefer to have a standard dictionary in the end (actually i do not really see a good reason for that) you could use  in order to create an empty list where the key does not yet exist:the documentation on  (vs. ):This technique is simpler and faster than an equivalent technique  using dict.setdefault()
It's difficult to achieve with list comprehension because of the accumulation effect. However, it's possible using  on the list sorted by your keys (use the same  function for both sorting and grouping).Then extract the server info in a list comprehension and prefix by the group key. Pass the resulting (group key, server list) to dictionary comprehension and here you go.I get:Keep in mind that it's not because it can be written in one line that it's more efficient. The  approach doesn't require sorting for instance.
