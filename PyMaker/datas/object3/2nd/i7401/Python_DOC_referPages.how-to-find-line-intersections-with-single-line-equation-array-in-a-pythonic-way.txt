What would the most pythonic way be, without using for loops, of finding line intersection points in an array comprised of m,c values?achieving the desired result with for loops would consist of something like:
The equation for the intersection of two lines  and  is .By making use of broadcasting it is easy to compute all intersections between any number of lines:This works by appling the element-wise  operator to a column vector of shape [N, 1] and it's transpose of shape [1, N]. The vectors are broadcast to a matrix of shape [N, N].The final result are two symmetric matrices  and . Each entry  is the intersection of lines  and .  means the lines are identical (they intersect in every point).  means the lines do not intersect.Let's show off the result:
