So, here is my Shoping Cart code, im stuck with this code, i fix one error, another pop out. So now i get TypeError: getTotal() takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given)Output i get:Every tip, every help is welcome, thanks,
There a several errors in your classes.First, in Python, you can ger rid of  methods, especially in your case. So, you can redefine  and  classes as: In the  class, that code does not what you want:It will append the integer  into the current . To do as you would, take into account the current item to add:Next,  cannot work as it is:Finally,  cannot work too (!). If you want to find the carta length (as  is a list), do that:Final code with fixes and a right  statement:We can do a lot more pythonic, but it seems you are learning Python, so try to understand that snippet correctly and then try to optimize, if wanted and needed. And read that tutorial :)
The class  already wraps the list of items contained in the cart. You don't need to pass any argument to . The call is correct; the definition is not. does need an argument, but it's the item to add to the cart, not the cart itself. Your current implementation only adds the number 1 to the cart on each call, not the first argument.Likewise,  just needs to return the length of , not take any additional arguments.Python isn't Java. You don't need to define separate functions for simple attribute access (as I've hinted by my definition of  above, accessing  directly).Finally, you want to either return (not print) a string from , or dispense with the / pair. 
Well, in your print you call  but in the definition of Cart, you have this method . So when you call it you have to pass 2 arguments. You only pass one wich is . So if i understood properly what you're trying to do you have to change the method getTotal to  as you don't use the parameter carta
