I want to create a function called jaccard that works something like thisExcept I only want it to take one parameter and have the other parameter hard coded into the function.I want to write a function that will generate this function with the hard coded parameter because I need to use it with thousands of parameters.So I want to generate a function like this.The reason I want this is because I want to apply it to a column of a Pandas DataFrame. The data frame contains a list of strings. I want to find the jaccard distance for each of them with the hard coded parameter in the function.Thank you in advance!
