I am working with RC-522 RFID Reader for my project. I want to use it for paying transportation fee. I am using python and used the code in: https://github.com/mxgxw/MFRC522-python.gitOn python script Read.py, Sector 8 was read with the use of this code:The output of this was:So that last part(Sector 8 [100, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]), I convert it to string. I want that to be a list but I can't. Tried to put it on a variable x and use x.split() but the output when I execute print(x) is "None".I want it to be like this: DATA = [100, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]so that I can use the sum(DATA) to check for balance, and I can access it using indexes like DATA[0]Thanks a lot!!
Follow these steps: Open  >> header file for RFID Reader vi MFRC522.pylook for functiondef MFRC522_Read(self, blockAddr)add this line  at the end of function.Save it. In read() program, call it like I hope this solves the problem.
You can use .split(",") to specify the delimiter ",".Something like that:prints 
In line with Moutch answer, using list comprehension:If data string is entire output of Read.Py
If you have some guarantee about the source and nature of the data in that list (and you know the format will always be the same), Python's  would work. For example:If you don't have these guarantees, you'll have to use the  method as suggested by Moutch, due to the fragility and exploitability of  - it blindly executes whatever (potentially malicious) code is passed to it.Edit: Use  instead of plain old  for safety guarantees. This still requires that the formatting of the string be consistent (e.g., that it always have square brackets) in order to properly evaluate to a Python list.
