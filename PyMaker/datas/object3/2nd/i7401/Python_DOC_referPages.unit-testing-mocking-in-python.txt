So let's say I have this bit of code:Now it's a simple enough method, and as you can see we are using an external library(). In unit tests, I have to create a mock of this object that roughly replicates it. Let's call this mock object . My question is how would I tell the code when to use  or ? I've looked it up online, and a few people have suggested dependency injection, but I'm not sure I understand it correctly.Thanks in advance!
In you test:
As Dan's answer says, one option is to use dependency injection: have the function accept an optional argument, if it's not passed in use the default class, so that a test can pass in a moc.Another option is to use the  library (here or here) to replace your .Let's say you have a  that looks likeIn your  you can do:The  you use can include properties on objects, e.g. . A big gotcha is that you need to mock the object in the module being tested, not where it is defined. In the example above, that means using a path of  and not .
