I am reading a file in python and getting the lines from it. However, after printing out the values I get, I realize that after each line there is a trailing \ at the end. I have looked at Python strip with \n and tried everything in it but nothing has removed the trailing . For example0048\0051\0052\0054\0056\0057\0058\0059\How can I get rid of these slashes?Here is the code I have so farI've even tried using regexBut nothing has worked so far. 
You're probably confused about what is in the lines, and as a result you're confusing me too.  is a single newline character, as shown using  (which is your friend when you want to know what a value is exactly). A line typically ends with that (the exception being the end of file which might not). That does not contain a backslash; that backslash is part of a string literal escape sequence. Your replace argument of  contains two characters, a backslash followed by the letter n. This wouldn't match a ; the easiest way to remove the newline specifically is to use . The line reading itself will guarantee that there's only up to one newline, and it is at the end of the string. Frequently we use strip() with no argument instead as we don't want whitespace either. If your string really does contain backslash, you can process that as well, whether using replace, strip, re or some other string processing. Just keep in mind that it might be used for escape sequences not only at string literal level but at regular expression level too. For instance,  will remove a backslash from the end of a string; the backslash itself is doubled to not mean a special sequence in the regular expression, and the string literal is raw to not need another doubling of the backslashes.
