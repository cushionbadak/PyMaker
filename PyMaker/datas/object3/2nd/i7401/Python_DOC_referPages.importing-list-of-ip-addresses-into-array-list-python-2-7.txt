I am working on a small project to take a list of IPs/subnet and convert them into separate IP address and subnet mask. I am using netaddr to complete the change and am now working on importing a list of IPs like below into and array or list.13.107.6.152/3113.107.19.10/3123.103.160.0/2023.103.224.0/19 ...etcI started in a txt file trying to import line by line, and have tried using a csv file with spaces delimited as well as putting commas and using that as the delimiter.This is my my most recent work using this as the csv fileHowever when I do:It only returns 1 and then a block of the IP addresses.Is there a better way to format the IPs in the csv or text file that will help me insert them into the array or list? My goal is to get each individual IP in its own spot so I can run it through a loop.Thanks :)
With a txt file with 1 IP per line the following will accomplish what you need:
