I would like to pass a ByteArray variable from my Python program to my DLL written in C in order to accelerate some specific processing which is too slow in Python. I have gone through the Web, tried Ctypes with combinations of byref, cast, memoryviews, addressof, but nothing works. Is there any simple way to achieve this without copying my ByteArray into something else that will pass ?Here is what I am trying to do:But I get a type error when passing the first parameter (MyData) to the C function.Is there any solution that doesn't require too much overhead that would waste the benefits of my C function ?Olivier
I'll assume that  is supposed to be . We can use  to create a mutable character buffer which is a  array of . But  will not accept a , we need to pass it a  object to initialize it; fortunately, casting between  and  is fast and efficient.I don't have your DLL, so to test that the array behaves correctly I'll use the  function to shuffle its chars. typical output
