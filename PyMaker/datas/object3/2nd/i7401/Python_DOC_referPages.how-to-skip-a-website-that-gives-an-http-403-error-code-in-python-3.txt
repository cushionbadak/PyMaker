I have a list of URLs that I am trying to check using . It's working just fine until it encounters a website that blocks the request. In that case I just want to skip it and continue to the next URL from the list. Any idea how to do it?Here is the full error:
The error you're seeing simply indicates that the server has marked the requested resource - that is, the URL you're trying to access - as forbidden to you. It doesn't give any indication of why the resource is forbidden, although the most common reason for such an error is that you would need to log in first.But anyway, it doesn't really matter. The way to skip this page and move on to the next one is to catch the raised error and ignore it. If your URL-accessing code is within a loop, like this:orthen probably the easiest way to catch and ignore the error is this:where  jumps immediately to the next iteration of the loop. Or you could move the processing code to a function:On the other hand, if your URL accessing code is already in a function, you can just .I strongly advise you to learn about the HTTP status codes, and be aware of  the errors that  can generate.
I haven't tried this, nor I know urlib, but you could use a try and except statement to catch the error and continue thereafter. You could tryIf you want to constantly catch exceptions you could useAlthough this is not recommended because you risk blowing up the stack (Matteo Italia)
