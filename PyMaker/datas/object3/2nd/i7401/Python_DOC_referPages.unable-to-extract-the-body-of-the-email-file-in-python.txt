I am reading an email file stored in my machine,able to extract the headers of the email, but unable to extract the body. Is there any proper way to extract only the body message.Stuck at this point.For reference the email file can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3XlF206d5UrOW5xZ3FmV3M3Rzg/view 
UpdateIf you are having the  error, you might want to read what follows.I did some tests, and it seems the doc is indeed erroneous compared to the current library implementation (July 2017).What you might be looking for is actually the function  it seems to do what you want to achieve:The conceptual model provided by an EmailMessage object is that of an  ordered dictionary of headers coupled with a payload that represents  the RFC 5322 body of the message, which might be a list of  sub-EmailMessage objects is not in current July 2017 Documentation, but the  says the following:The payload will either be a list object or a string.  If you mutate  the list object, you modify the message's payload in place.  Optional   returns that index into the payload.Optional  is a flag indicating whether the payload should be decoded or not, according to the Content-Transfer-Encoding  header (default is ).When  and the message is not a multipart, the payload will be decoded if this header's value is 'quoted-printable' or 'base64'.  If some other encoding is used, or the header is missing, or if the payload has bogus data (i.e. bogus base64 or uuencoded data), the payload is returned as-is.If the message is a multipart and the decode flag is , then  is returned.
The 3.6 email lib uses an API that is compatible with Python 3.2 by default and that is what is causing you this problem.Note the default policy in the declaration below from the docs:If you want to use the "new" API that you see in the 3.6 docs, you have to create the message with a different policy.will give you the new API that you see in the docs which will include the very useful:
