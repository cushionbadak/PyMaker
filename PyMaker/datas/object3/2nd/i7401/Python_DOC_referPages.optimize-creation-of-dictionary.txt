I have a list with ids called . Every element in  is a string. One  can exist multiple times in this list. My aim is to create a dictionary which has the the number of occurrences as a key and the value is a list of the ids which appear that often.My current approach looks like this:Output:This works nicely if the list of ids is not too long. However, for longer lists the performance is rather bad. How can I make this faster? 
Instead of calling  for each element in the list, create a  for the entire list:If you prefer a one-liner, you could also combine   (for view on the elements sorted by counts) and  (but I rather wouldn't)
