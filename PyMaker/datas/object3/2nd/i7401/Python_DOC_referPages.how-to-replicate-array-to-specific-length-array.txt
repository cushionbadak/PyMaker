I want replicate a small array to specific length arrayExample:The new array that I want would be: This is my code:I get error message:DeprecationWarning: assignment will raise an error in the future, most likely because your index result shape does not match the value array shape. You can use  to keep the old behaviour.But I get my corresponding variable:So, how to solve the error? Is there an alternative?
There are better ways to replicate the array, for example you could simply use :Return a new array with the specified shape.If the new array is larger than the original array, then the new array is filled with repeated copies of . [...]
First of all, you don't get an error, but a warning, that  is deprecated if  has dimensions that do not match .Second, the error message tells what to do: useand you do not get a warning any more and it is guaranteed to work.Another, easy way to do this if  is not needed is to just use :
Copy the array (called lists in python) with [:] because they are mutable. The python short cut is then just to multiply the copy and add one moreelement. gives the 13 elements you want.
Repeating a list (or any other iterable) can be done without , using 's  and  functions
