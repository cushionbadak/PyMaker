I'm working on an irl minigame where you get materials every 5 minutes.To monitor this i wanted to write a simple python script.But now there is a little roadblok, how do you make a loop that does something every x minutes, while still running other keyboard inputs without it disrupting the loop?
Maybe a timer will be helpful for your task. I recommend you to check this link: https://docs.python.org/2.4/lib/timer-objects.html. While the timer is counting you are able to do other tasks and when the time is up, you can attach a function to the timer to do something. Timers from this library inherits from Threads
Here's a fairly simple example of using a threading.Timer. It displays the current time every 5 seconds while responding to user input.This code will run in any terminal that supports ANSI / VT100 Terminal Control Escape Sequences.You need to send a , that is, hit CtrlC to stop this program,
