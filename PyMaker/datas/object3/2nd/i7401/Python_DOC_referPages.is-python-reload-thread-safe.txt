Using python, I am writing a nasty cralwer system that cralws something from the websites of each local government, and total websites count to over 100, just in case their webpage changes, I have to use reload to do hot-update. But I am wondering if reload is thread safe. because say, I am reloading moudle Cralwer1 in thread 1, but at the same time, thread 2 is using Cralwer1. Will thread 1's reload cause thread 2 to fail? If so, I have to do a lock or something, otherwise, I can happily do the reload without extra work. Can any one help me out? 
Is Python reload thread safe?No.The reload() executes all the pure python code in the module.  Any pure python step can thread-switch at any time.   So, this definitely isn't safe.
reload = re-execute top level code in Crawler1.Generally speaking without more info/code sample, you can:Encapsulate the "operational" top level code that kicks things off, e.g. put it in a function or a class, and invoke that instead of reloading the whole module. This may involve calling/adding some cleanup function.Use a global variable, which thread1 and thread2 will flip and be aware of to prevent stepping on each other. This doesn't scale quite as well, but can perhaps prevent/delay usage of locks.Using locks is actually not that hard,they even support context managers:https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#with-locks
