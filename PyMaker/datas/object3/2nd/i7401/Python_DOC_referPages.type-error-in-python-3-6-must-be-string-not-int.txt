I am trying to make a program that can find a definite integral but when i run it I get an error message that i can not figure out even after searching on several websites for the answer. This is my code:Then it displays this error message after I enter some code:Can someone Please help?
Whenever you use the  function in python, it returns a string. To quote the docs (emphasis mine):The function then reads a line from input, converts it to a string (stripping a trailing newline), and returns that. As you see from the docs, the  function converts the input to a string and returns it. Thus, you cannot perform operations like  on it as it is a string.To convert a string to an int, you need to use the  function. Thus, the line of code will be:This will fix your issue as the  function will cast the string to an int and then you should be able to perform operations like  on them.Side Note:  is a wrong spelling, it is  (note the extra ).
You are reading the  from input and that is always a string, when you try to increment it with  it gives that error. You should modify your input to get an integer ant not a string, so change this lineto this 
if you use python takes it always as string. So to convert it into integer using Here when you input Exponet: 2, Python thinks it is a string but when you try to increment it fails to increment the integer value because of you input string.
Your code is missing  before the  variable that you set in the  method. Later, you're referring to this variables using  which causes the  to be thrown.
