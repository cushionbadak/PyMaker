I'm having trouble including data files in my setup.py script. My package is setup as follows:I want to include the  file when installing so that it can be read by . To do so I used the  keyword in :I also included the file in : seems to run fine and doesn't throw any errors. However, when I import the package I get a file not found error because  is missing. I have tried referencing other stack overflow questions (particularly this one) but can't figure out what I'm doing wrong. How can I get setup.py to include the necessary data files?
If it is listed in 's  (correctly) you shouldn't need to include it in  (as it will be included automatically)In your case, the error is with your  line, the paths are relative to the namespace's rootIn your case it should be:Also note that the key in package data is the dotted module path (it's not super relevant for this toy case however).
