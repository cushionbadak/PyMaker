I am working on a mini GUI project , I am currently struggling to figure out how to get selected value from the list and then return that value to the main function so that I can use that value in somewhere else . Can someone help me please !!!!at the moment ,the item_selected function is not returning anything , I want to return selected_device back to the main function so I can use it in other functions as well .EDIT: I've edited code above to remove formatting errors @jcoppens
As you can see in the documentation, the  function is called with one parameter, . But if you define the function inside a class, it requires the  parameter too, which is normally added automatically. In your (confusing) example, there is no class defined, so I suspect the problem is your program which is incomplete.Also, I suspect you don't want  in the for loop:And I suspect you want  indented below the :Please convert your example in a complete program, and formatted correctly.BTW:  is not a good name for the signal handler. It is also called if the item is unselected (which is why the signal is called 'changed')!And important: Even though you should first read the basic Python tutorials and Gtk tutorials, you should then consider using lazka's excellent reference for all the Python APIs. There's a link on the page to download it completely and have it at hand in your computer.
