I've created a basic Python port scanner which allows me to scan an IP address or hostname, and can specify particular ports, or define a range of ports to scan. My code is as follows:I know how all this code works, but I need to implement a feature that allows me to scan a local subnet of IP address, so if I run the program as (python portscanner.py -t 192.168.1.0 -p 1-50) it will scan all the IPs in the local subnet, namely 192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.255.I don't know how to implement this feature, have looked online with no avail. Any help would be appreciated.
The built-in  module can help you with this. The linked documentation page includes the following example:I'd strongly suggest you consider using the CIDR Notation for IP address ranges as shown, since the library can then deal with the representations directly.Since from the comments it appears you need an IP address whose last byte is zero to be treated as a  subnet I'd recommend something like this in your  function:
