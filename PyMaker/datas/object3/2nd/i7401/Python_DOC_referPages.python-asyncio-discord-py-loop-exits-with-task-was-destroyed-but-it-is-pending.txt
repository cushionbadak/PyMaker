The relevant code pertaining to my issue:discordbot.pymain.pyThe error and traceback:This seems relevant but I attempted the solution and couldn't get it to work. I do believe the issue is because the discord client module needs control once every ~60 seconds. Since my function  takes more like ~70 seconds, asyncio breaks.
the discord client apparently needs control every minute or so, and your  function is blocking for more than that.This is because you are mixing a synchronous bittrex client, with an asyncio library (discord). You will need to use the same paradigm for both: the discord client is based on asyncio, so you will need to find an asyncio-based library for bittrex (or write one).This new library should expose some coroutine similar to the functions you are using. So you would call , instead of  and  would become a coroutine .With this, you will be able to change your bot to use , which means the discord client will be able to take control while you are waiting for the results of .I am not getting into the specific of asyncio here on purpose, but reading about it would probably help, here for instance: https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html
