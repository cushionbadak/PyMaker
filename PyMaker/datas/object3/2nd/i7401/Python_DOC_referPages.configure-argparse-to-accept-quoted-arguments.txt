I am writing a program which, among other things, allows the user to specify through an argument a module to load (and then use to perform actions). I am trying to set up a way to easily pass arguments through to this inner module, and I was attempting to use ArgParse's  to have it build a list of arguments that I would then pass through.Here is a basic layout of the arguments that I am usingHowever - if I then try to run this program with  (where I would like to pass through the  to my module) it seems to be parsing the  as its own argument (and I get the error Any ideas?
With:I get:This is using a linux shell.  The quoted string remains one string, as seen in the , and is properly interpreted as an argument to .Without the quotes the  is separate and interpreted as a flag.Are you using  or some other OS/shell that doesn't handle quotes the same way?In Argparse `append` not working as expectedyou asked about a slightly different command line:As I already noted  is passed through as one string.  Because of the space,  does not interpret that as a flag.  But it does interpret the bare '-t' as a flag.There was a bug/issue about the possibility of interpreting undefined '-xxx' strings as arguments instead of flags.  I'd have to look that up to see whether anything made it into to production.Details of how strings are categorized as flag or argument can be found in  method.  It contains a comment:http://bugs.python.org/issue9334  is an old and long bug/issue on the topic.
The solution is to accept arbitrary arguments - there's an example in argparse's doc here:argparse.REMAINDER. All the remaining command-line arguments are gathered into a list. This is commonly useful for command line utilities that dispatch to other command line utilities:
