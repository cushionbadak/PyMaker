When ran, this code print:But when I put the toString method in Dog class to the side more, like so:It prints properly, saying:Spot is 53 cm tall and 27 kilograms and say RuffWhy is this?Edit: I just realized that the thing that printed was Animal's toString method, not Dog's toString method.
Don't class attributes as default values or as "declarations", and don't use -prefixed names unless you understand why you might need to use such names. Also, you don't need ;  serves the same purpose and is called automatically as needed.
Private attributes are just that... Private. There is no concept of Protected variables in Python. By restricting the variables with the double underscore, you prevent even subclasses from accessing them.
