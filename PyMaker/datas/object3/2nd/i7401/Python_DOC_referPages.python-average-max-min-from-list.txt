so I have a list like this:I need to find an average, min and max of these.I have tried:but of course it doesn't work because these are not numbers. and they have "m" and "s"  behind them.EDIT: This code works fine, but it only returns the first value it gets.for example if there is a "h" and a "m" it returns only the "h"so 1h 20min and 1h 15min would be "3600" both.
This is my solution for the first part of converting the strings to usable seconds values, think it works wellResults in kesto2 = [204, 45, 3760] which are the times in seconds. From there you can find your statistics pretty easily.
Create a function that converts those strings to numbers, then use this function:
I suggest you make a function that convert your values in seconds.For example "3m 24s" is 204 seconds.I help you with the function's signature:After you finished your function, useand so on...
The code below converts the time to seconds and adds them to a new list called , since they are all the same units, now you can easily sort them. First the minutes are separates by using  which separates the list when an 'm' is seen. I only take the first value hence . The seconds are obtained by taking the character that occur after a space up to an 's'. At the end I total the seconds and add them to .This solution is not limited by the number of digits the seconds or the minutes have.
you could parse those entries with  and then convert to  objects. these can be added and divided by integers:note you have to initialize the  with . the default is  - but  is not defined.
 is your desired list.
hope this will helpUpdateHere you call the function for string formating. and then you can oparate as comment describe. string formatting can be done in efficient way. Here is the only a simple solution.
