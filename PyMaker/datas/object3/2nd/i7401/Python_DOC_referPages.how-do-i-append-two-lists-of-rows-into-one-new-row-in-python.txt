I have two two csvs with many columns in each.  I am looping through the rows in each and would like to combine the rows as i go into a third csv that has the columns of both. so far this is the only way i can do it:This takes along time to manually write out e[x] for the number of rows in x. How can i just do something like this without getting a run time crash:
Use , marge them by index so the missing rows from the file with fewer records will be filled by NA.
Read the data from file1 and file2 into a  and then append them like so:This will only work properly if number of rows is same.
