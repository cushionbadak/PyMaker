Natural Text
Hello I am having trouble modifying lines of text using python. I am making a payroll app and I cannot get the modify method to work. I do not understand why the entry that I search for will not delete in the new files. I am copying the files over to a temp and then renaming the temp file but the old entry stays in.
There are some serious issues with your code:You overwrite  before looking at it, so whatever they input doesn't matter.As Hugh Bothwell pointed out:Tries to compare a string to the first character in that same string, which will only be True if  is a single character.Instead, you want to do something like this: I've cleaned up a lot of the extra fluff by using  which handles closing the files for us and letting the built-in  loop:I've also renamed your list variable as , as overwriting the built-in  variable is a recipe for errors.Please note that, should you have more than one "bill" and you search for "bill", you will be prompted to change them both. Also, there is no abort for this function and it is destructive, so you lose whatever information was already stored for these employees. In a real payroll application, this would probably be disastrous.Additionally, if you want to make it a little more reusable, instead of specifying four elements in a list, you can:Which will compile as many inputs as prompts and then store them space separated in the file as a line, although it's less obvious what you're doing.
As mentioned in the comments, there are a few things wrong with your code...It is good practice to use the  syntax in a situation such as yours.Here is a solution that I believe will solve your problem.
