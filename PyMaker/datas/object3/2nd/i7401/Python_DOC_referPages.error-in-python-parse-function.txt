I am really new to Python and have some error when I run my code.I have this Amazon data set which is formatted as a JSON file(Please see below for the json format).The command I am using is offered by the data senders, which converts the JSON file above into 'strict json' file (the original JSON file is not strict json based on the data senders).The command offered by them is as follows:I have only changed the path, putting the directory of the the JSON file with quotation marks (e.g., "C:\Users\daisy\Research\study\Amazon\reviews_Video_Games.json.gz")For example, the code that I ran looks like this:However, I get the following error:Do you have any idea what is wrong with the syntax?Again the original code is given by the data sender so I am quite sure that the code is correct. I think I did something wrong when I changed the 'path' into my file directory.Thank you. 
You can't define a function like that.Though you could set a default value like so:Update for encoding issue
