Suppose the following list of tuples representing sentiment estimates from 3 different methods:I was wondering what is the most efficient way to find the majority sentiment, and for this to calculate its average, i.e.:Thanks
You can first group by the sentiment (note they need to be sorted first)Then figure out which sentiment is most common (aka has the longest group)Then lastly compute the average
using  and the  module you could do this:although given you are looking for efficiency i prefer CoryKramer's answer.

Its better to use Dictionary. Define a nested dictionary where 'key' is the sentiment name and value is a dictionary which contains : 'numbers'(key) which is the list of sentiment values(value) and 'count'(key) for the number of sentiment's occurrence(value). example:
That should do.
