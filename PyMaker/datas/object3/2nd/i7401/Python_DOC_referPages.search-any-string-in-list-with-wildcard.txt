Natural Text
I have this piece of codetermlist is a list that contains my search terms. These i want to find in the second list (text) which contains multiple sentences. This works so far but the accuracy isn't good enough, because it finds any string combination. Now I rather would like to find the search term and a wildcard at the end for considering plural.Example for code now: search term "car" is detected in word "carry".How it should be: search term "car" is only detected in words "car", "cars" ..."car?" or something like that.Is there any easy addition to my code above or is another search method necessary? Edit: Aim in general is to find texts where the search terms appear. A little variance (ex. plural) helps to identify more text with same semantic context.
The re module can do this
