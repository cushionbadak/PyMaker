I'm trying to understand how this bit works:the script:For me the difficult to grasp is the bit of doing inception and provide(return) values which will be used in the main function and in the same trigger the  from within the  function.Since I'm new to advanced concepts in python, I found it really interesting. How this "operation" is called so I can read a bit more about how it works. i.e. returning some values in line order separated by  and interpreting them based on the position in line(for the lack of better description).
It's returning a tuple. A tuple in Python is similar to a list, but it's immutable: you can't add, remove or replace items.Often, tuples are constructed with the syntax , but the parentheses are optional in many cases, so  is also valid.On the receiving end, tuple unpacking is used to get the individual elements of the tuple, and assign them to separate variables.
What is happening here is in fact not that several values are returned. Instead, a single tuple is returned, and this is then unpacked using something called tuple unpacking.The code is equivalent to
 returns a tuple . Tuples are very useful for grouping related data, for example something like  might be a better way to store information about a person then creating 5 separate variables. When  is called this tuple is unpacked:And hence: 
The docs say:This means  will return a single object - a tuple and the rest is just unpacking it to the separate values.So i would say those are two operation: tuple creation in return statement and tuple unpacking in main.
