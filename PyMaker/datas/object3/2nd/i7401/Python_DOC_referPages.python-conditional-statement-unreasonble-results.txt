Natural Text
I try to understand why I get unreasonable result from the following :I get 3 times  and then last one .What is the order of this complicated condition?I've tried this:and it's ok but I'm trying to understand why above doesn't work.
This is because condition  means  AND  AND  First of all when  first condition evaluates to False and so nothing else gets evaluated. Then, if a is <0 but b=1 last condition in the chain is False. Therefore your chained condition is False 3 out of 4 times. This is well explained in section 6.10 of Python documentation. 
You need parentheses due to operator precedence
As CoryKramer pointed out, the operator precedence is making the difference.Your code is equivalent to this:Because  has higher precedence than  by language definition.So, use  to force the precedence that you need:Also, FYI you are coding the  operator.
Due to operator precedence you need to place the two conditions in parentheses for your expected results. Otherwise the comparison operators are solved, checking for  in your code, which is not what you expect.Note that all comparison operators have the same precedence and comparisons can be chained arbitrarily, e.g.,  is equivalent to  AND 
From this, you could make it more readable imo:
