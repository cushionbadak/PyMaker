Consider the following code (not a very good design, but that's the point):Now, if I want to test , I need to mock  (as it accesses the file-system inside the constructor).To write a test that will make sure  returns  in case  and  provide different values, I also need to mock .So, the test function should probably look like the following:Now, the strange point - as may be seen from the comments inside the code, if we assign  to the class, it won't propagate, but if we create an instance and assign to it, it propagates to other instances of the class.I suppose this behavior is related to internal mechanisms of , so it's important for me to understand it, to make proper usage of this library with all it's rich functionality.So, does anyone has a clue?
On the first case I can not see anywhere that you are patching the  method. You should assign the mock value to the  method of  before  is called. For instance why does the following test fail?:The reason for the previous behaviour is that we are forgetting to patch the return value of the object (A), in this case , instead of the object itself (). The  object is the result of instantiating the  class and you should access the method throgh the  of the  class. In your example it would be something similar to this:You can check some of the following posts for more info on common python unit testing pitfalls:https://esaezgil.com/post/unittesting_pitfalls/ (written by me)http://alexmarandon.com/articles/python_mock_gotchas/And of course the docs: https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html
