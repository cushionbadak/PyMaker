Natural Text
I want to execute a sympy lambda function in parallel.I don't know:why it works in parallel although it is a lambda functionwhy it stops working when I try executing without the poolwhy it works if I uncomment the first return in And apparently the markdown preprocessor needs a line of text above the code so this is the code: It prints:(I cut the traceback)If I uncomment, it works normally:I tested only on Windows and it works exactly the same with 'numexpr' instead of 'numpy'.
The object  has no fields when it is created. It can thus be pickled with the stock  library. Then, when you call , you add a  attribute to the object containing a  expression, which cannot be pickled. This causes a failure in the  functionThis explains why before calling  you can pickle the object and use  and why it fails after the call.When you uncomment the line in , you do not add the attribute to the class, and the  object can still be pickled after calling .
