I have json file which has duplicate keys. ExampleI want to make this as     {      "data1":"abc",      "data2":"xyz"    }I tried using object_pairs_hook with json_loads, but it is not working. Could anyone one help me with Python solution for above problem
You can pass the  method a keyword parameter to handle pairing, there you can check for duplicates like this:I used  to count each key, if it already exists, I'm saving the key as  - so it will be added with a trailing number.P.SIf you have control on the input, I would highly recommend to change your json structure to:The rfc 4627 for  media type recommends unique keys but it doesn't forbid them explicitly:The names within an object SHOULD be unique.
A quick and dirty solution using .Prints this string:
