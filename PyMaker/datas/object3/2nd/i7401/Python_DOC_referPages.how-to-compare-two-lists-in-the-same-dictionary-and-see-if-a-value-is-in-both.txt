I am fairly new to Python and would appreciate some help for a project I am working on for work.I have a dictionary of lists and want to traverse the dictionary and check if any values of the lists are the same.  I need to check the list value of 'one' and check to see if in 'two' and 'three', then check 'two' values are in 'three' and so on.  Then I need to print out the key and values that are the same.ie.Not sure the best way to do this.
You can take the combination of keys using  and find the itersection of values for pairwise keys:
A nice way to do it in pure python is to iterate over all possible values in the resulting lists. Create a dictionary that maps each value to the keys associated with it.Now, when you call results, you will get a dictionary that looks likeWe can then go through the results and only print out the ones with multiple associated keys.Giving you:This way of doing it should be fast since it's linear with respect to the total length of the combined lists from the original dictionary.
I guess is how i would do it... theres trickier and cooler ways but this is simple to understand and i think the smallest big-O
You can turn the dictionary into a list of tuples then iteratively compare the first tuple in the list to theremaining tuples in the list like this:
