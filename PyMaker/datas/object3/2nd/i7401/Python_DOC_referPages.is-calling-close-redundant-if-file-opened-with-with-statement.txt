Assume I have the following code:Is  above redundant?
Yes it is; Beside, it is not guarranty that your  will always be executed. (for instance if an  occurs).But the  function of the  statement is always executed because it follows the  pattern.The with statement is used to wrap the execution of a block with  methods defined by a context manager (see section With Statement  Context Managers). This allows common try...except...finally usage  patterns to be encapsulated for convenient reuse.The context manager’s __exit__() method is invoked. If an exception  caused the suite to be exited, its type, value, and traceback are  passed as arguments to __exit__()You can check that the file have been close right after the  statement using Source for my answer:Understanding Python's "with" statement
Yes. Exiting the  block will close the file.However, that is not necessarily true for objects that are not files. Normally, exiting the context should trigger an operation conceptually equivalent to "close", but in fact  can be overloaded to execute any code the object wishes.
The  statement creates a runtime context.Python creates the stream object of the  and tells it that it is entering a runtime context. When the with code block is completed, Python tells the stream object that it is exiting the runtime context,and the stream object calls its own close() method.
yes, the with statement takes care of thatas you can see in the documentation:The context manager’s  method is invoked. If an exception caused the suite to be exited, its type, value, and traceback are passed as arguments to .In the case of files, the  method will close the file
