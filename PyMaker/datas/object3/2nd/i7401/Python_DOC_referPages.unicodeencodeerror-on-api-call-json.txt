Probably super noob question, but would really appreciate any help with this :) Error:Traceback (most recent call last):  File "/Users/kjetilbergtun/Dropbox/My Python Projects/footballapi.py", line 13, in     print(response)UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character '\xe9' in position 51: ordinal not in range(128)
 is used by  to convert the Unicode characters in your string to a byte stream that can be sent to your output device.Before you start Python, you can set the environment variable  to the encoding required by your console.
