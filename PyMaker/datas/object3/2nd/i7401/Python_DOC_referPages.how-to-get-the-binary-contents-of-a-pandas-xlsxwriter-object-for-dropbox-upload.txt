I am trying to upload to dropbox an Excel sheet with multiple tabs made with  and . Not very big files, just around 5MB. I am using the  module for Python 3I am doing:I read in the docs that  expects a bytes object. I am getting the error: Is this error because I am not supplying the file in the needed format? How can I do this upload so I don't get a type error?
You are trying to use the built in function  to open an object. It requires a string as its first argument (which represents a file path). More information on the  function can be found in the docs. The source for pandas ExcelWriter shows it stores the filename you pass to it in . So renaming your variables to better represent what they are and using the  attribute of the ExcelWriter instance:
