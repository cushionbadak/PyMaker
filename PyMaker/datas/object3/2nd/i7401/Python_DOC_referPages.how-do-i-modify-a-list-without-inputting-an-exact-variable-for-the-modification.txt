I'm in an intro programming course and struggling a bit with lists in Python. The following problem is from my textbook and I'm having an issue getting my code to pass both tests:Modify short_names by deleting the first element and changing the last element to Joe. Sample output from given program:['Sam', 'Ann', 'Joe']Here is my code (which passes the test for the sample output): When other names are substituted in for the original short_names (ex: ['Jessica' , 'Erin' , 'Max', 'Josepfine'] then my code fails to execute properly. I think that having the actual names in my "short_names[1]" variable is the reason for this. I'm just not sure how to fix it. Any direction/advice would be great. Thanks! 

You shouldn't hard code the names when you do .Instead, do this:
