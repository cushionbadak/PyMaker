Natural Text
I am new to coding in Python. I am trying to make my code so that if I enter the age a series of text will be printed. However, my code only works if i follow it line by line. For example, when i input the age 2000+ immediately nothing will happen. I need to first input an integer less than 12, followed by an integer over 2000. 
This code works because it asks one time and tries to see if some conditions are true, instead of asking each time. 
Here I wrote code for your understanding purpose. Take new variable, so that no need to repeat input() method several times. Also, Age validation code keeps inside the first condition and it will be executed when the 1st condition will be true.
Every time you go to another branch in you  you are asking user to enter another age! Instead do the following:

 is invoked every time when followed by . So the multiple 's in the  's are not necessary.store the result of  like , then use  in the  and  parts instead.
The  function returns a string. Quoting the docs (emphasis mine):The function then reads a line from input, converts it to a string (stripping a trailing newline), and returns that.So, in each  when you call , you have to enter a new string. Thus, you have to first enter an integer below 12.To fix this problem, you need to store the original input in a variable. Now, as the docs say,  returns a string. So, either you can cast (using ) the integer in each case, by doing:and storing the variable as a string.Though, unless you do not have any specific reason to keep the age as a string, I'd recommend you to convert the string while storing the age in the variable in the first place:In this case,  will have an int.
Hopefully, this is what you are looking for:
