Let's say I'm not allowed to use libraries.How do I go about calculating the product of indexes in a list.Let's assume none of the integers are 0 or less.The problem gets harder as I'm trying to calculate the indexes vertically.With numpy the solution for my problem would be:However without it my solution is much more chaotic:
And why not simply:Alternatively, a small improvement over your solution:
You can iterate over each row getting each row's n-th element, and multiplying each element together:If you cannot use any libraries, including , you can write the logic for the  function manually:
We can transpose the nested list and then use  (a Python built-in) in Python 2.x on each element (list) for a one-liner -
Here's a quick recursive solution
