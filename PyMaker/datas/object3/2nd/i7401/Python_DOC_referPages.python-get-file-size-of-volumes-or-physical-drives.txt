I am opening a volume in Windows, like this:The problem is that I need to get the size of the volume.I've tried:t, , nothing works, says invalid parameter or argument.I would need a way to get this without using win32 specific functions.
To do some calculation on the volumeUNIXUse WINDOWSFor windows you can use the  module or use wmictypes
I don't think this can be done properly without leveraging the Python Win32 API.Here is a Python Recipe (GitHub) to quickly calculate folder or volume size. It uses the  function to efficiently calculate the total size of a folder or volume. It also can handle cases where a cutoff size is desired or errors are encountered along the path.I've converted the function to Python 3:If you want the output to be more human-readable, there is another Python Recipe for you (see also): 
use psutil module
