I have sequence of played cards in a list. There were 4 players, so each four elements in the list represent a single trick. I have to process 4 cards together to find trick winner. I need to split the list four elements at a time. I am currently doing the following:I think that I can do better than this using power of python. Can I access 4 cards together in a loop? Can any one help me to make my code more Pythonic?
If you want to create lists of length of 4 from a list, this would do the trick:

You can make your code a bit nicer by iterating explicitly through groups of four instead of element-by-element. There are a couple of ways of doing this. The easiest would just be to increment the index by four:This has the advantage of not calling the processing code on an empty  when , as your code does. Also, I would recommend sticking to one naming convention (underscores vs CamelCase). I picked the former since that is the generally recommended Python convention.You can do a slightly more complicated version using the  recipe provided by the  documentation. The advantage of this approach is that it will probably scale better:Keep in mind that this implementation of  is going to fill extra elements in the last group with  if your input sequence does not have a multiple of four elements. It also assumes that you consume all the elements of the group in each iteration (which you do in this case). For alternative implementations, see this wonderful answer.
