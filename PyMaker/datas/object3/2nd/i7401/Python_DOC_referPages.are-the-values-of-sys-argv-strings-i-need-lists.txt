I have a VBA script that runs the following in the command prompt:That runs a python file called govlaunch.py that takes a bunch of arguments that I am parsing by using sys.argv[1] or sys.argv[n].Strangly, sys.argv[1] shows up as  which is exactly what I want... but it's a string instead of a list like I expected.Are all of the values sys.argv[0] through sys.argv[14] going to be string types?  How do I go about changing them to what I need?
You can parse a string as a literal using Output:
You can separate strings by comma using split() function which returns a list
Don't read from  directly, use a command parser e.g. . This allows to easily pass and cast multiple types; you won't need to manually cast the different strings to type you want, only specify what type the argument should be coerced to when defining the argument.You could pass a list of ints as argument, by adding it as an argument and specifying the contained type:
See the following script:syspython.py:This causes:I would pass these args like:Just separate with a space, or quote if the arg has spaces like "A book title should be quoted"As stated below, you can also just split them if you have to:Here is a nice function to convert your items of argument 1:Using it:So now in your script do like:
Yes.Running;With;Outputs the following:If you want to parse them use a parser, such as .
Can do slicing then split:Output:If want list of floats, do:Output:
