Code:QueryAs shown above, I'm selecting 5 random sample combinations and declaring them under the variables .To improve my code, I would like to do so, but ensure that an item from the list doesn't appear more than once in all variable outputs, in which all combinations are different and non-repetitive. I would preferably like to achieve this without having to remove items from the list as it is reused later in the code.Expected Output (Example):
You could shuffle a copy of the list (you said you wanted to reuse it so one needs to make a copy because shuffle works in-place) and then just take 2 elements for each sample:or if you don't want to hardcode the s:
You can use . Its purpose is to choose with () or without () replacement from an array-like object (which also works for your list):Result:This returns an array of 5 rows, which each include one of your samples of size 2.
You could simply build a 'cache' of generated values - so the elements of  are not removed:
 is the correct method, you just need to call it once for 10 letters instead of 5 times with 2 letters:
Use  to generate a shuffled copy of the initial list, and a generator to yield the shuffled values as required.Outputs;If you want exactly five random values then use this;If want them one at a time then use,
You can loop over the sample generated and remove the elements from :Output:
