Consider the following scenario:script.py:cant_import_this.py:The output of  is, surprisingly:What seems to be happening is: checks if  exists in  can't be found in , so  is found and loadedthe uninitialized  module is put into the module is executed, which removes  from  and replaces it with instead of returning the module itself, the result of the lookup  is returnedIs this interpretation correct? More importantly, is this behavior documented anywhere? Could it possibly be considered a bug?
I found the answer in a footnote:The importlib implementation avoids using the return value directly.  Instead, it gets the module object by looking the module name up in  sys.modules. The indirect effect of this is that an imported module  may replace itself in sys.modules. This is implementation-specific  behavior that is not guaranteed to work in other Python  implementations.So it's not a bug, but it can't be relied on either.
