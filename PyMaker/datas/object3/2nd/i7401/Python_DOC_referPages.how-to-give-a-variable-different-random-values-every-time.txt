The above is my attempt to print a random shuffling of letters each time the random_letters() method is called, though it does not work.  What approach can I use to generate this effect?
What you wrote doesn't work because  returns a single random number, when you print  it's always going to be the same character. Even if you declared  inside the  loop, it wouldn't be enough to assure every character is different, simply because it would have to generate all different numbers in all loops, which is highly unprobable.A workaround is creating a range list with the same length as your characters' list, then shuffling it with  and printing the characters' list using the indexes of the shuffled list:
@coldspeed's method works rather well also, just make it a np.array as above for my method to work.If you decide you only want it to return the same randomized string each time, set above the shuffle method.
