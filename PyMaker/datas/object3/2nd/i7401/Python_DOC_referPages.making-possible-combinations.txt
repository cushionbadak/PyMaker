This question already has an answer here:How to generate list combinations?                    4 answers                I am trying to make possible combinations of , like:I'm using , but its just returning, What would be the procedure to have both  and  too.Also, here I am talking with input . What would be the procedure if I had to make combinations of input ,  such that the output is .Also, I don't worry about the order.   
The tool from itertools you are looking for is .This will give all possible arrangements of the specified elements that are of length 2 (specified by the  keyword).Both  and  explicitly state that they do not repeat elements.The function  is close to what you want, which allows repeated elements, but only gives distinct combinations, rather than all permutations.  The function  doesn't exist, because this is exactly what  gives you.
Apart from what Nielson added, you can also obtain the required result without using ,This will produce the desired output.
