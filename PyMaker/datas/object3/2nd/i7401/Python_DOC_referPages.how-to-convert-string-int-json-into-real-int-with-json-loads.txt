I'm trying to convert a string which represents a JSON object to a real JSON object using  but it doesn't convert the integers:(in the initial string, integers are always strings)Instead of  I'd like it becomes . I know I can run through the whole object, but I don't want to do that, it's not really efficient to do it manually, since this  argument exists (https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html#json.loads). Thanks to Pierce's proposition:
As we established in the comments, there is no existing functionality to do this for you. And I read through the documentation and some examples on the JSONDecoder and it also appears to not do what you want without processing the data twice.The best option, then, is something like this:This has the downside of processing the JSON object twice â€” once in the  call, and again to recurse through the entire structure to fix things. Also note that this will convert anything which looks like an integer into an . Be sure to account for this appropriately.To use it, you do e.g.:
In addition to the Pierce response, I think you can use the json.loads  parameter instead of  one, so you don't need to walk the json object twice. For example:As @ZhanwenChen pointed out in a comment, the code above is for python2. For python3 you'll need to remove the  part in the first  condition.
Here is my solution! I used , it is useful when you have nested There is filter only for parsing json key to int. You can use  filter for json value too.
