A simple example for the usage of the python heap implementation isIn a more complicated scenario, I have an array of tuples likeand want to use the first entry of each tuple as heap key, i.e. the tuples should be sorted according the number in the tuples by the heap. How can I do that? 
You can simply use the tuple as they are. The Python documentation explicitly makes note of such as usage:Heap elements can be tuples. This is useful for assigning comparison values (such as task priorities) alongside the main record being tracked:Simply push the tuples to the heap, and pop them off when needed:Because the implementation for  uses default sorting for tuplesand Python sorts tuples element-wise, ensure the objects by which you want the tuples to be sorted come first.
