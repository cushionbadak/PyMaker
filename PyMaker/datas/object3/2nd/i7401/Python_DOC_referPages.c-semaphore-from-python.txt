I have a C code in which I have implemented a locking mechanism using semaphore. The basic flow is as below -The python code at the reader end is as below:The data on the other end of the  is being processed by a Python Script. The problem is that the reading of the PIPE on python end is not able to fetch the full set of the data.It's because I had read that for  for every write, there should a reader or else the pipe open is blocked during next iteration.In this case, after writing  to the PIPE, the python's reader implementation is able to  and the PIPE is readily available for next write set.This is the reason why I was looking for a  for the same.My doubts are -1) Is there a way in which I could increment the s variable (kind of  what a signal() function in C would do) every time the python script  is finished polling up all data from PIPE.2) Is there any other smooth implementation of such a problem, any  other IPC technique between C and Python enabling lock mechanism?Thanks!
The above line only write 4/8 bytes (32-bit/64-bit) of data from tempBuff to pipeIf you want to write all data within tempBuff, you need to change the line to
