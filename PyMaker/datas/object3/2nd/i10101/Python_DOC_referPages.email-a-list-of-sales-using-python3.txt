I am a programming newbie, and half of my problem is that I cannot find the right questions to ask - I have looked at lots of Stack Overflow posts to try to work through my issues, but I've not been able to apply what I've found to my situation. Consequently, I need your help, internet. I'm trying to make a program that runs once a week using Windows Scheduler. When it runs, it should:consult an excel file, extract some information from the last forty rows,draw up a form email,include the extracted information in the form email,send the form email to a specific recipient.I've got SMTP working fine, including the form email generator, and I can get the stats out of the excel sheet using openpyxl, but I cannot wrestle the information into a useable format to send. The code I've got so far (for handling that info) looks like this: What I get from that is a whole ream of text, like this:['DEIGHTON, Len (born 1929).', 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Spy.', 20] ['BROOKE, Rupert (1887-1915); ABERCROMBIE, Lascelles (1881-1938); DRINKWATER, John (1882-1937); GIBSON, Wilfrid Wilson (1878-1962).', 'New Numbers Volume 1 Number 3.', 76] ['SHUTE, Nevil.', 'A Town Like Alice.', 100] ['SWINBURNE, Algernon Charles (1837-1909).', 'A Song of Italy.', 15]Ideally what I would want to send in an email would look like this, with a new line for each individual sale item: DEIGHTON, Len (born 1929). - Twinkle Twinkle Little Spy.-  20BROOKE, Rupert (1887-1915); ABERCROMBIE, Lascelles (1881-1938); DRINKWATER, John (1882-1937); GIBSON, Wilfrid Wilson (1878-1962) - New Numbers Volume 1 Number 3. - 76I've written an email body, which is set up to include the list of info using a format like the following:Any pointers on the no doubt hideous code above would be gratefully received.

As others have said, use join. You could, in place of  do something like:  which will result in a nicely-formatted list of strings in .The line to generate your email body could then be something like:
I believe something like this will produce what you need.
