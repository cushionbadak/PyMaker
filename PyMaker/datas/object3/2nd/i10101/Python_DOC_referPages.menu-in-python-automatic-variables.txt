I'm working on a program but I'm stuck. I have created a menu with multiple options. Now I'm wondering is it possible to automatically create variables if you add a team. I.E.: normally you would enter the variable at the top and do it like teamA = input. Is it possible to do this automatically without any given variables and use of a database?I've tried looking around on google and on this site but couldn't find anything. Also sorry for the vague description, this is the best I could do. Thanks in advance :)
Lets say this variable you want is just a team name, you could just put all the team names in a list, and if you need to refer to them, you could do so by indexing.Personally, I would make a team class that could hold things like members, score, or whatever you want. 
You don't exactly 'create a new variable', but what you're wanting to do is store a list of teams and then add to it when the user selects the first option.  The following will get you started in the right direction...You should do some reading on python lists and python dictionaries.  https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html
sure ...in this case i just used a simple dictionary as my database (I know its not a real database... but its plenty good for this) ...
