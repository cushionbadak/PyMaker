This is the instructions:1.Define a class named Bag in a module named bag.py 2.Define an init method that has one parameter, an iterable of values that initalize the bag. Writing Bag() constructs an empty bag. Writing Bag(['d','a','b','d','c','b','d']) construct a bag with one 'a', two 'b's, one 'c', and three 'd's. Objects in the Bag class should store only the dictionary specified above: it should not store/manipulate any other self variablesThis is the Error I got:The input is:I have no idea how to make the init function. since the first input calls b = Bag(), whcih will always raise Error: b = Bag() raised exception TypeError: init() missing 1 required positional argument. Can anyone tell me how to fix it?
Your init method is expecting the argument i to be initialize,And another problem of your code is self.bag will never initialize to a list if len(i) is not zero, you can,t append to bag if its not define as list before hand.Code below should fit what you want
The first raised exception:Your  call expects an argument passed to Bag. For example The second raised exception:If you actually pass an argument through the Bag constructor the length will be greater than 0 and bag will never be created so you can't append to it. I am not sure what you are trying to do but maybe  regardless of the length of i?
Sounds like things may be simpler if you use the built-in  class, which is in the  module. From the docs:
