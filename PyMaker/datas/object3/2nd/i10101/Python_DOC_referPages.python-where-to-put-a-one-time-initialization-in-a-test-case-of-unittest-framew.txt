My test is simple. I want to send two requests to two different servers then compare whether the results match.I want to test the following things.send each request and see whether the return code is valid.compare different portion of the outputs in each test methodI do not want to send the requests in setUp method because it will be send over and over for each new test. I would rather want to send the requests at the initialization. (maybe in the init method). But I found a lot of people were against that idea because they believe I should not override the init method for some reason. (I do not know exactly why) If that's the case, where should I send the requests?I am kind of against doing them in the class body (as shared variables).
A class method called before tests in an individual class run. setUpClass is called with the class as the only argument and must be decorated as a classmethod():See: https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.setUpClass
