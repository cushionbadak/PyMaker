I learned python 3 last year, but I have barely experience.I am reviewing about tuple again.I would like to figure out difference between   and Since  is true, but  is false, I am very confused.
The boolean value of a tuple is  if it has contents, if it is empty it is . Because  is a tuple with one element it's boolean value is .You are comparing a  to a , that will always result in .
 does not test for . It tests for the truth value of an object:Any object can be tested for truth value, for use in an  or  condition or as operand of the Boolean operations below.Objects are normally always considered true, except for the  or  objects (on their own), numeric zero, or an empty container. is a tuple with one element, and any tuple that is not empty is considered a true value, because it is not an empty container.You can use the  function to get a boolean  or  value for the truth value:
Perhaps this highlights the difference.  will evaluate because a non-empty tuple is a truth-y value. It is not true itself. And comparing a tuple against a boolean shouldn't be expected to return true in any case, regardless of the content of said tuple. 
For any  whatsoever,succeeds, because  is a non-empty tuple, and all non-empty tuples evaluate to  in a boolean context.And again for any  whatsoever,cannot succeed, because the things being compared aren't even of the same types (for a start,  isn't a tuple).In your question, what I spelled as  you spelled , but it makes no difference what value  has:  , , the integer 42, a file object, ..., it doesn't matter.
Not empty values are equivalent to  while empty values are equivalent to . The tuple  is not an empty tuple so  always succeeds. On the other hand  is not equal to the singleton tuple  so the logical expression  evaluates to .
