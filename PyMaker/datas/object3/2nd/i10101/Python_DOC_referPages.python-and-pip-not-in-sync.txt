I am working on a remote linux server with python 2.7.6 pre-installed. I want to upgrade to python 2.7.12 (because I am not able to install some libraries on the 2.7.6 due to some ssl error shown below).I downloaded and compiled from source and installed 2.7.12 and  opens 2.7.12. However, I still get an update python version warning while using pip. It seems the pip has not synced with 2.7.12 and continues to serve 2.7.6 and I am not able to find other installations of pip in system.I just want a working version of python2.7.x with pip/pip2/pip2.7 working properly.
