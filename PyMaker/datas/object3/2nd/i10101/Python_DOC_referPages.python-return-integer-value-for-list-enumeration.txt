Is there a cleaner way to get an integer value of the position of a list item in this code:Returns all items after 'rt' as a list ['paaq', 'panc']
Yes, use .Or, to minimally change your program:References:https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-str-unicode-list-tuple-bytearray-buffer-xrangehttps://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists
What this is doing is slicing the array, starting at where . not specifying an end  means we want until the end of the list.
