Natural Text
I tried searching but could not find much about the  operator.https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_basic_operators.htm mentions that  is "similar" to the  operator and does not say what is different or how it is different.My tests seem to show it is the same:Any help to understand this would be appreciated.
The python documentation says that they are equivalent. The comparison operators  and  are alternate spellings of the same operator.  is the preferred spelling;  is obsolescent.The  operator has been removed from Python 3.
