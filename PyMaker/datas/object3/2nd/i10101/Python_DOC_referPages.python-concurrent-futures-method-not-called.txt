I am running a local django server with the following code: I am initializing a process pool executor to accept tasks with 2 worker threads. The tasks are being submitter but the worker threads handling the submitted tasks do not seem to have triggered. Following it the console output: What am I missing here ?
First, you are using  instead of . The former is a way similar to the built-in  function to map arguments to a function that you want to run asynchronically on all of them. You used  with  instead of an iterable (e.g. ), but don't do that in your case. You are passing only one value to the map. however, fires up only one function asynchorincally in your pool. That's exactly what you want to do!I've modified your example a bit, following is the code. Also consider aboutreading if might be favorable in your case instead of as it seems to be I/O bound (network stuff). But don't catchme on that.Example output:Also note @ShadowRanger's answer which has a way to determine when all your tasks finished.
The  function is intended to pass arguments from an iterable(s) to a mapping function. You didn't provide any iterables so it doesn't run (and your function takes no arguments, so if you had provided iterables, it would have failed when it passed too many arguments).If you just want to run that function without arguments some number of times, call ;  is intended to pass arguments and accumulate results from what it returns, not just run something for side-effects (it's a functional programming tool, and functional code is side-effect free in general).Fixed code would be:
