Python                    4 answers                How do I check if a string is a number (float)?                    32 answers                How can I detect either numbers or letters in a string? I am aware you use the ASCII codes, but what functions take advantage of them?
Check if string is positive digit (integer) and alphabetYou may use  and  to check whether given string is positive integer and alphabet respectively. Sample Results:Check for strings as positive/negative - integer/float returns  if the string is a negative number or a float number. For example:If you want to also check for the negative integers and , then you may write a custom function to check for it as:Sample Run:Discard "NaN" (not a number) strings while checking for numberThe above functions will return  for the "NAN" (Not a number) string because for Python it is valid float representing it is not a number. For example:In order to check whether the number is "NaN", you may use  as:Or if you don't want to import additional library to check this, then you may simply check it via comparing it with itself using . Python returns  when  float is compared with itself. For example:Hence, above function  can be updated to return  for  as:Sample Run:Allow Complex Number like "1+2j" to be treated as valid numberThe above function will still return you  for the complex numbers. If you want your  function to treat complex numbers as valid number, then you need to type cast your passed string to  instead of . Then your  function will look like:Sample Run:PS: Each operation for each check depending on the type of number comes with additional overhead. Choose the version of  function which fits your requirement.
For a string of length 1 you can simply perform  or If your string length is greater than 1, you can make a function something like..
