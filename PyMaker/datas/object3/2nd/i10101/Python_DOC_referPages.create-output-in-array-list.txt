An example of my input is:I need to produce output in an array list How can I achieve this?
If you want the numbers located before the "arrows" (), here is a solution using  :I'm using  to convert the strings to int.More informations on the regex used :I'm using a lookahead expression ()) to match only something located before this string : .And what I am looking for is a number between 0 and 9, thanks to the set of characters .Please note that this won't match  for example. In this case, I need to change the regex to the following : , to match 1 or more numbers.
