I am just starting out learning Python and for my project we need to take a file and create a table listing the team name in one column and wins in another column with header and have in alphabetical order and have to use set method. As a side note the class I took was a complete disaster and we never even covered this information, so I apologize ahead of time for my ignorance. Thank you.I don't believe this is in set method.
So this probably isn't the fastest or the pretiest solution to this particular problem but I usually do something like this.
so you've got a file like this:and you need this:firstly, I still don't understand how you'd use  here. you want to count things, but items in a  are unique, so it's useless for counting how many times an item appears. You're probably meant to use a . note that while you are reading the file, it's useless to sort it, since a  cannot be sorted: is the key, and  will return the value for that team, unless it hasn't been added yet, in which case it will return . you add  to the value that was already there, and put the new value back in . after doing that for every line, you'll have a dict like . Alternately, you could use a module that does the counting for you.https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/stdtypes.html#dict.gethttps://docs.python.org/3.3/library/collections.html#collections.Counterthis is how you can solve the first part of your problem. The second part, you'll need to turn it back into a list that can be sorted.  will give you a list like https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/stdtypes.html#dict.items can take a  argument that tells it what to look at on each item to decide where it goes, which is how you can tell it to look at the number of wins.https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sortedto print it out in columns, take a look at , which will allow you make sure each column has the same amount of spacehttps://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#formatI think you'll find that the examples in the linked documentation will be a good starting point for the remaining parts of your problem.
