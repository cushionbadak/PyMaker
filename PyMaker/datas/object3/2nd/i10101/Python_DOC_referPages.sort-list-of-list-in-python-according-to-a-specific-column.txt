I have a list of lists that looks like this:I want to sort corresponding elements in each sublist so that the middle sublist would be in descending order, which would result in:The second list is now descending: . Essentially, I want reorder the vertical columns in that 2D representation. It seems like an easy task, but I had difficulties finding a solution.So far I tried:which didn't change anything and I triedwhich gave None.
The attempts you made will sort by values in the second column, but you want to sort by values in the second row. So transpose the list, sort by column, then transpose back.Bonus tip: your  approach printed  because  doesn't return anything, it sorts in-place. So you should instead do  and then . Conversely, your  attempt didn't appear to do anything because it doesn't sort in-place, and instead returns a brand new list. I'm guessing you did  and then  and were surprised to see nothing changed. You might instead do  and then . (although just using  would be more idiomatic)
