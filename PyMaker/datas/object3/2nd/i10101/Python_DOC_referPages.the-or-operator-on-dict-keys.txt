As I've been unable to find any documentation on this, so I'll ask here. As shown in the code below, I found that the  operator (), worked as such:Which produces the result, in some order:Initially I assumed these iterable was compatible with , similar to the way sets are, however. Testing with other iterable, such as a , threw an error. Even;  Which I'd assume worked, due to the use of  in the previous examples, threw an error.So, my question is; What on earth have I come across, and more importantly, how reliable is it? What subclass does my arguments need to be, for me to be able to use this?
The Python 3 Documentation notes that the  method is set-like and implements .Note that  is not set-like even though it might appear to be so in your examples:However these are leveraging off the fact that the keys view implements  (and ) over arbitrary iterables.For example, the following will not work:
