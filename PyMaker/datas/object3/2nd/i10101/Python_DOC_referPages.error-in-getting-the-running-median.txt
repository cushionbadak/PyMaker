I am trying to get a running median for a number of integers. For example: 6 elements will come one by one, let say 12,4,5,3,8,7  for which running median at each input is 12,8,5,4.5,6,5 respectively. I wrote a python code but it seems to give incorrect answer. Help is appreciated .
Read the comments embedded in the code below - A more Pythonic (sic) way of doing the same - 
This was the output and input:The issue was in your  you were inserting as long as a was less then the next value. You didn't just insert once, that added more values than you wanted into the list. Adding a  will only insert once, at the time it finds the first spot it belongs too.
