Is there a way to remove trailing zeros from a  field in a django template? This is what I have:  and this is what I need: . There are answers suggesting to do this using the  filter:However,  performs rounding (either down or up), which is unwanted in my case, as I only need to remove trailing zeros without any rounding at all.
The solution is to use the  method:
Try .https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/templates/builtins/#floatformat:If the argument passed to floatformat is negative, it will round a  number to that many decimal places – but only if there’s a decimal  part to be displayed.
