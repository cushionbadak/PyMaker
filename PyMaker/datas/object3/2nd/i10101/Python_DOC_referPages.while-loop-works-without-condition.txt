As far as I know, while statement requires condition to work, but here it works without any; how's that possible? How does  work?The code is below:...
A  loop evaluates any expression it is given as a boolean. Pretty much everything in Python has a boolean value. Empty containers, such as  generally evaluate to , while non-empty containers, such as a set with at least one element, evaluate to . can therefore be read as "loop while  is not empty", i.e., "loop as long as  does not evaluate to boolean ".As an aside, instances of any class you write will usually evaluate to . You can modify this by implementing a  method in your class that returns something else.Also,  works fine. No need for .
There is a condition. The loop will iterate as long as there is an element in set q.You would get a similar effect if you wrote:or evenHowever, these expressions could be viewed as perhaps a little redundant.
