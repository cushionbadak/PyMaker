suppose we can and can only get the iterator of some iterable(L).and we can not know the length of L.Is that possible to print the iterable as:My try at it is as follows.
Here's one way to do it with  and .  on the key function  groups the items in the iterables in threes  in successions. The logic uses the integer division of the next object in the count item on 3:Output:
You can split the iterator into chunks of three, using  and  from  and a  loop, and then join them. The  loop will do most of what your  construct is doing.However, if your iterator is just a , you can just use  with a  parameter:
