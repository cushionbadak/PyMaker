If I take a simple , and wish to return JSON:This will give me "valid" json. However, the json will be delivered like this:It's not only an eyesore, if you then try to print that (eg via ), those  on lines 2, 8, 11 will become . (This has been noted in other questions). To parse that json in the browser, you need to run it through  twice (or transpile the escaped chars another way).On the other hand, if I do the below code (and this is my present hack for getting around the problem):This gives me valid json without the additional  chars (excuse the cat pic):My question: clearly, the browser is getting different inputs. Yes, they're both valid json (they pass validators) - but the first won't clear . Is there any way to force the core serializer to conform to the second json output format? At present I'm having to write a lot of boilerplate serializer code that's making my classes look messy.
The inbuilt django serializer outputs a . The django  takes key+value data and stringifies it with the right HTTP headers added. That's fine if you pass a dictionary or list, but if you pass a  that aready has  chars in it (like the output of the core serializer does),  blithely escapes the existing  because you can't have  in an unescaped string of course. Yay teamwork.Obviously, with this deeper understanding of what's going on, it's a bit stupid to expect the serializer to output anything other than a string - that's what serializers do, right?So then I might think, can I get the JsonResponse encoder to ignore the  somehow in the string? JsonResponse in 1.9 can provide encoder arguments.Yes, but none of the arguments include , and even if it did it wouldn't be able to parse  properly.And at that point, you kind of realise that you actually want to just:And that's probably the easiest way of going about it.
