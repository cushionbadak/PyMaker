Error code explanation: HTTPStatus.NOT_IMPLEMENTED - Server does not support this operation. Do I need to do something more to make my server serve the current directory? Until now I have just used  ( when on Mac.) I am using Python 3.This is an will stay local so don't worry about the  files and the server script being exposed through it (if it worked!).
