This question already has an answer here:How to test multiple variables against a value?                    21 answers                I am checking whether two substrings are contained in another string:This does not work, the if statement is already being entered when only one substring is part of the string. Can someone explain why?I found the following workaround, I'd simply like to know why Python behaves that way.
It doesn't work because  return  or operand which can convert to False and after this you verify 
So  works to check if two booleans ( values) are , however  is not a boolean. However,  and  and both booleans, so you can create a statement:Now inThe statement  creates a generator that will return two boolean values. What  does is takes any iterable such a list of generator of booleans and returns a single boolean checking if they are all .
