Reading from a sub-process gives you a bytestring. You could either decode this bytestring (you'll have to find a suitable encoding), or use the  option and have Python automatically decode it for you:From the Frequently Used Arguments documentation section:If universal_newlines is , these file objects will be opened as text streams in universal newlines mode using the encoding returned by . For , line ending characters  in the input will be converted to the default line separator . For  and , all line endings in the output will be converted to . For more information see the documentation of the  class when the newline argument to its constructor is .For a process run via the shell,  should be exactly the right codec to use, as that gets the information on what encoding to use from the exact same location that other processes like  are supposed to consult, the locale environment variables.With ,  will be set to the string str.strip()` to remove the extra whitespace there:
That is a bytestring. Change your code to make that a str:
