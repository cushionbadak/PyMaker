I want to import a python script in to another script. If I execute :Can I anyway mute the first  which is coming from the ?I can't comment the  in , since it is being used somewhere else. 
py1.py use an So like your py1.py would look like: This will allow you to still use py1.py normally, but when you import it, it won't run the  function unless you call it.This explains what's going on
Simply open the /dev/null device and overwrite the  variable to that value when you need it to be quiet.
You might want to consider changing the other script to still print when its run 'in the other place' - if you're running py1 as a shell command, try to make sure all "executable statements" in a file are inside a block.(see What does if __name__ == "__main__": do?)This would fix the underlying issue without having you do weird things (which would be redirecting the standard out, and then putting it back etc), or opening the file and executing line by line on an if block.
You could implement this functionality with methods:As MooingRawr pointed out, this would require you to change whichever classes use  to import it and call the  function which may not be to your liking.
