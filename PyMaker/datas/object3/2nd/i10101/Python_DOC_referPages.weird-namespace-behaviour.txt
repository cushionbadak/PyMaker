When trying to run the following code:it yields an UnboundLocalError, butdoesn't.Is that a wanted behaviour ?Is there a way to modify the value of a variable without creating a new one ? I could use a dict of one element. It works but it seems ugly:Isn't it a better solution ?
just addat the beginning of the method  to declare that  is global variableTake a look at this topic in Python's FAQ to get more informations
To refer the outer scope variable of the function,  should be declared as global.
You'll have to add  to the function.Other ways to handle this problem is:Making  capitalized you'll be able to access it without the         however  is then unchangeable which seems like something that isn't appropriate in your case.Taking  as an argument. This makes the code less messy and easier to debug later.
