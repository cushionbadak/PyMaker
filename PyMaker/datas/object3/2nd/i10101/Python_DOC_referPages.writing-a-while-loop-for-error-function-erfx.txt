I understand there is a erf (Wikipedia) function in python. But in this assignment we are specifically asked to write the error function as if it was not already implemented in python while using a .  is simplified already as : Terms in the series must be added until the absolute total is less than 10^-20.
First of all - SO is not the place when people code for you, here people help you to solve particular problem not the whole task Any way:It's not too hard to implement wikipedia algorithm: Please read the source code carefully and post all questions that you don't understand. Also you may check python sources and see how erf is implemented
