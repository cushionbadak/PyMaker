I am new to python and I am trying to run this code to want parallel ping of multiple machines.but I can not ping all IP concurrently. seems it run one after another .can some one please guide me on how can i ping multiple server concurrently.
 is not patched, but  is patched; Replace  with  (You can also use  if you are using Python 3.5+)
The problem is that  is running synchronously, because the function is blocking. You should try to do it in different processes.Here is a concurrent code that does the same.
