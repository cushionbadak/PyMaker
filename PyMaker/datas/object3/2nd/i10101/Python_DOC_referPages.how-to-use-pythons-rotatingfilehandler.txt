I'm trying to do a test run of the  module's  as follows:However, with  line commented out, the resulting  file contains no data:If I comment in the line with , I get the expected  files with numbered suffixes. However, there is also the  which is a (relatively) large file:How can I set up the logging so that it only generates the  files, and not the large  file?
Python provides 5 logging levels out of the box (in increasing order of severity): , , ,  and . The default one is . The docs says, thatLogging messages which are less severe than lvl will be ignored.So if you use  with the default settings, you won't see anything in your logs.The easiest fix would be to use  function rather that :And if you want to change logger level you can use  method:
I found that to obtain the desired behavior one has to use the same name in the  and  initializations:Here, I have chose the same name . This results in only the 'size-limited' logs being created:
All previous answers are correct, here another way of doing the same thing except we use logging config file instead.logging_config.iniHere is the config file :myScrypt.pyhere is simple logging script that uses the above config fileRESULThere is the result, notice maxBytes is set to 10 but in real life, that's clearly too small. (args=('testing.log','a',10,100)
