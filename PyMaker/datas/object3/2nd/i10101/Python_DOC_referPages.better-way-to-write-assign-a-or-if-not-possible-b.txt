This question already has an answer here:Check if a given key already exists in a dictionary and increment it                    12 answers                So, in my code I have a dictionary I use to count up items I have no prior knowledge of:Obviously, I can't increment an entry of a value that doesn't exist yet. For some reason I have a feeling (in my still-Python-inexperienced brain) there might exist a more Pythonic way to do this with, say, some construct which allows to assign a result of an expression to a thing and if not possible something else in a single statement.So, does anything like that exist in Python?
This looks like a good job for defaultdict, from . Observe the example below: will take a single parameter which indicates your initial value. In this case you are incrementing integer values, so you want .Alternatively, since you are counting items, you could also (as mentioned in comments) use Counter which will ultimately do all the work for you: It also comes with some nice bonuses. Like :Now you have an order to give you the most common counts.
