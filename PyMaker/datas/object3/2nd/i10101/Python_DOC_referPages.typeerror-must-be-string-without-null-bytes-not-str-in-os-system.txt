I am trying to write a python code which executes a C executable using the following line where ./a.out is a C executable, and payload is a string (without spaces) given as command line argument. (The link is this. I am trying to follow example under section chaining functions) Now I have written another C code but it takes 3 command line arguments. So my string should be arg[1] + " " + arg[2] + " " + payloadString. (The c code is converting the arg[1] and arg[2] into integer to use it in its functions). Here is the snippet of my python code: where ./a.out is executable of my C code which takes 3 command line arguments. When I run the python code I get error:Can anyone help me?P.S. I am new to python. Similar questions were there in stack overflow, but I am not sure how to use their answers to solve my problem.
