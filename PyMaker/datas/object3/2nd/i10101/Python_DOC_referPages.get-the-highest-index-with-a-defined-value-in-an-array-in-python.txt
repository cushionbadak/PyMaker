what could be a nice one-liner to get the highest index in a python array whose value is defined (i.e. not None):would return:4 (as the "last" defined element is 4. (with value 3))Sure a search loop would make the job, but it feels non optimal...
Loop over the reversed of the list and return the first valid item's index:Note that since you are looping over the reversed array the correct index would be  (if we consider the first index as 1).If you are looking for a functional and/or more optimized approach you can use  and it's  function:

A relatively Pythonic solution which does not use indices:The  bugs me, but it is needed as  cannot take in a generator.
Another alternative using . But this won't work for empty  or list with all . But in order to handle that, we can use  and  statements (since you need one line solution):This expression will return  for the above mentioned edge cases.
You could create a generator that iterates on the indices of the list in reverse and tests until a not  value object is reached: 
If the input list is very large, you can use  and the built-in  to avoid iterating or copying the whole thing:This will throw  if there are no non- values, which I would argue is more pythonic than returning a default.
