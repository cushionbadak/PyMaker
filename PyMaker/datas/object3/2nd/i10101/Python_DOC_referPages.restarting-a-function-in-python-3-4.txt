I need help for my python assignment. We have to make a quiz program and I am having trouble with restarting a function.I need something like continue, but instead runs the function again. Also, some tips on returning values from functions cant hurt! Thanks! ~Also, I just started using python 2 weeks ago, so this is pretty advanced to me. EDIT: Thanks to user: 2ps! :D
To capture the return of the  function, just make sure you return something at the end:To call the  command over and over again, use a loop.This will run until the user types in exit.
