I want this piece of code to print "second". I tried these inputss1 = ".0" and s2 = "0.00"Could anyone please explain in brief what "" means exactly?I understand that it relates to string equality as well as comparing the ord() on strings and wanted to know how these are different.Thanks in advance for any help.PS : Please excuse the indentation. Python beginner here!
There's no 100% sure way of making that piece of code print second, since interning is an implementation detail.CPython interns integers in the  range,So you'll need a character that when it's passed to  returns something > 256. checks if every  has the same  as .From the  documentation:Return the “identity” of an object. This is an integer which is guaranteed to be unique and constant for this object during its lifetime. Two objects with non-overlapping lifetimes may have the same id() value.CPython implementation detail: This is the address of the object in memory.
In plain english,  means that ALL the values of  and  for  ranging from  to  (where  and  if the reference for  and ) is same for both the listsCheck  document. As per the document:zip() returns a list of tuples, where the i-th tuple contains the i-th  element from each of the argument sequences or iterables. The returned  list is truncated in length to the length of the shortest argument  sequenceFor example:Now  will return the tuple list of  value based on the condition  where  and  are  pair from the previous list of tuple returned by .Now the last part. if  will return  if the list  of  value mentioned above will be having all the values as . In case any single item is as ,  will return the value as
