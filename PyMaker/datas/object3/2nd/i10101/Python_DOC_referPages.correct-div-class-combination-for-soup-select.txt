I'm developing some scraping code and it keeps returning some errors which i imagine others might be able to help with. First I run this snippet:I run this snippet on the first page of today's job postings. And I extract the URLs at the bottom of the page in order to find the total number of pages that exist at that point in time. The below regular expressions take this out for me:Not on the third line above, the number of pages is always contained within the second from last (out of five) URLs in this list. I'm sure there's a more elegant way of doing this, but it suffices as is. I then feed the number i've taken from the URL into a loop:This is where I get an error. What i'm attempting to do is loop through all the pages that list jobs starting at page 1 and going up to page N where N = pagenum, and then extract the URL that links through to each individual job page and store that in a dataframe. I've tried various combinations of  but receive an error each time that reads: .If anyone has any thoughts about this, and can see a good way forward, i'd appreciate the help!CheersChris
You can just keep looping until there is no next page:Just loop over the generator function to get the urls from each page:I also use   in the selector as there are other tags that match so we make sure we just pull the job paths.In your own code, the correct way to use a selector would be:You syntax is for find or find_all where you use  for css classes:But that is not the correct selector regardless.Not sure why you are creating multiple dfs but if that is what you want:That would give you a list of dfs:But if you want just one then use the original code with itertools.chain:Which will give you all the links in one df:
