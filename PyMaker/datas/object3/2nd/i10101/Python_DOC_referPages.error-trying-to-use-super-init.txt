I am fairly new to Python and have taken the code excerpt below from a book I'm working with. It is listed below exactly as it is written and explained in the book but yet it throws the following error:When I try to give  an argument, it tells me it needs to be of type.I've searched multiple threads and haven't had any luck yet.
You're running Python 2, not Python 3. Python 2's  requires at least one argument (the type in which this method was defined), and usually two (current type and ). Only Python 3's  can be called without arguments.Confirm by adding the following to the top of your script, which will report the actual version you're running under:Note: Since you're not doing anything in 's  aside from delegating to 's  with the same arguments, you can skip defining  for  entirely. You only need to override  with explicit delegation if initializing  involves doing something different from initializing a , otherwise, s initializer is called automatically when initializing a  subclass that does not define . As written, you could simplify  to:and it would behave identically (it would run slightly faster by avoiding the unnecessary interception and delegation of , that's all).
In python 2.7 your ElectricCar class would look like this:
