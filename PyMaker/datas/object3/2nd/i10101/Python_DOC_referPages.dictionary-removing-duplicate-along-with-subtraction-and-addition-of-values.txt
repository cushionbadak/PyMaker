New to python here. I would like to eliminate duplicate dictionary key into just one along with performing arithmetic such as adding/subtracting the values if duplicates are found.Current Code Output{('GRILLED AUSTRALIA ANGU',): (('1',), ('29.00',)), ('Beer', 'Carrot  Cake', 'Chocolate Cake'): (('10', '1', '1'), ('30.00', '2.50',  '3.50')), ('Beer', 'Beer'): (('1', '1'), ('3.00', '3.00')), ('Carrot  Cake', 'Chocolate Cake'): (('1', '1'), ('2.50', '3.50')), ('Carrot  Cake',): (('1',), ('2.50',)), ('BRAISED BEANCURD WITH',): (('1',),  ('10.00',)), ('SAUSAGE WRAPPED WITH B', 'ESCARGOT WITH GARLIC H', 'PAN  SEARED FOIE GRAS', 'SAUTE FIELD MUSHROOM W', 'CRISPY CHICKEN WINGS',  'ONION RINGS'): (('1', '1', '1', '1', '1', '1'), ('10.00', '12.00',  '15.00', '9.00', '7.00', '6.00')), ('Beer', 'Beer', 'Carrot Cake',  'Chocolate Cake'): (('-1', '10', '1', '1'), ('-3.00', '30.00', '2.50',  '3.50')), ('Beer',): (('10',), ('30.00',))}What i want: example:SUBTRACTION FOR DUPLICATE{'Beer': [9, 27]} , {'carrot cake': [1, 2.5]} , {'Chocolate Cake': [1,  3.5]} notice that for duplicate item entry i trimmed Beer into one along with (10-1=9) for quantity amount and (30-3=27) for the cost. How do i automate this process?ADDITION FOR DUPLICATE{'Beer': [2, 6]}notice that I added beer and beer into one entry and along with the quantity (1+1) and cost (3+3=6)My code:link to csv file if neededhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1kSBxOGO4uJOFVZSWh2NWx6dHc
Working with your current output as posted in the question, you can just  the different lists of tuples of items and quantities and prices to align the items with each other, add them up in two , and finally combine those to the result.Afterwards,  is this: Note that you do not need a special case for subtracting duplicates when the quantity and/or price are negative; just add the negative number.If you want to keep the individual items separate, just move the declaration of , , and  inside the outer loop:Example result for the two-beer line:           If you prefer the  to group the items, quantities and prices together, use this:Result is this like this:
