Natural Text
I'm new to Python and I've been given the task to create a program which uses a text file which contains figures in Fahrenheit, and then I need to change them into a text file which gives the figures in Degrees... Only problem is, I have no idea where to start.Any advice?
First you'll need to create a Python function to read from a text file.Second, create a method to convert the degrees.Then, you will create a method to write to the file the results.This is a very broad question, and you can't expect to get the full working code. So start your way from the first mission, and we'll be happy to help with more problem-specific problem.
I'd start making a python script file (a text file with *.py), and write an expression that opens your text file. You'll need to do some operations on strings to get your lines of characters into a usable data structure (possibly a list of floats).Not required, but I also recommend you write a function that converts your units because it will make your code more readable.Finally, you'll want to convert your numbers back into strings that can be written to a file, and then of course write those lines to a file.Check out the links I've provided as they take you to multiple learning materials for Python in general. You may find multiple answers to your problem under different tutorials, so explore!
Hope this help!The program asks for input as fahrenheit & converts in to celcius
