This question already has an answer here:Remove an even/odd number from an odd/even Python list                    3 answers                So I understand placing even numbers in a new list but when there are a number of odd numbers in front I can only seem to call -1? and for an empty string I receive 'nothing' when it should also return -1

The  block will be executed for the first odd number, this will terminate the  and discard all previous appends. Instead you want to return the even number as soon as it is found (you don't need the list) and then move the  to align with the  or outside the :Reference for Python  block:How can I make sense of the `else` clause of Python loops?
As others have noted, your  case is causing premature termination, and the use of a  is rather pointless. You could fix all this, see the other answers for minimalist fixes, but there is another option: Let Python built-ins do more of the work for you.The  function will return the first item from an iterator, and with a second argument, if the iterator is empty, it returns the second argument instead. So give it a generator expression that lazily produces all the even numbers in the input, and it will pull the first one and return it. If none are found, the default case will return  for you:For the pathological sorts, this might be slightly faster, but it's far less intuitive to people who don't already know Python internals inside and out; I don't recommend it:
