Sorry for the poor title, didnt know what to put.When creating a class in python i use this,but why is it different to this?Surely the equals sign means it is the same process? Why is different?
 is an assignment statement, you appear to be confusing this with a , the equality comparison operator.The statements are entirely different:assigns the value referenced by the local variable  to the attribute  on the object referenced by . It sets an attribute on the newly created instance, from the value passed into the initialiser method.The alternative statementassigns the value of the attribute  found on self, to the local variable . It rebinds the local name (replaces the old value with a new). Once the method ends, the effects are gone. You are likely to get an  as the attribute  doesn't exist on  at that point in time.If  had been used, then usually yes,  is the equivalent of . However, objects can override how equality is tested by defining a new implementation for the  method so the two expressions could theoretically produce different results.
This assigns the instance variable  to the value of the argument which was provided to  (in this case )This assigns the instance variable  to the value of the argument . This would throw an error if  was not assigned to something else earlier in the  function.
