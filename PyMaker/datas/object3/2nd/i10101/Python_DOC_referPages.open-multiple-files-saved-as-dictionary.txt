Natural Text
User's input are the names of the experiments and a file with data. After data manipulation I have saved in a dict which sample (row) in the file corresponds to which experiment.For example, (sometimes sample can belong to either several experiments, or one or none)While parsing the datafile again (for the second time) I want to write the sample row into the corresponding experiment file. Meaning, all experiment files should be opened while I am parsing through the datafile. My idea is following:My question is, is it legit to open the files saved in the  and then close them in that way? Or is there any other cleverer way of doing it?PS. I know, I could have saved the sample rows into the lists of corresponding experiments and then write all experiment record in an experiment file but the datafile can be of several GB. 
After we discussed at the comment I update my original answer.If you want to open multiple files, you can do it with the context manager . Here is an example code:Each element in the  list represent one file that you open.
