I am very new to python and very much appreciate any help I can get! I have created a class and I am hoping to combine two lists from a previous instance of the class with the same lists in the current instance of the class. This is my current code: The error says no Module self.another_flu_tweets and occurs at the import line.  I have ran a code to create an instance of the class and then input the name of that instance as the argument for the merge method. Does anyone have suggestions for how I can reference a previous instance of a class in the current instance of a class? Any help is very much appreciated!!!Currently using:and then I ran 
Pass the name of the instance without the quotations, as using quotations makes it a string which will complicate your code:  Once you've passed the name of the other instance to a method in your current class, you'll simply do: statements are used for imports; not sure of what you were expecting that to do.The  reference on the other hand is a name (conventionally used) to refer to the current instance of the class within a method. So you would not need to set up an instance attribute that references the other instance i.e.  is not needed.
