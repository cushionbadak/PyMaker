two questions:1. why does print the whole tree butchokes on this unicode error?[NOTE: this is the TM symbol]I looked at these answersScraping works well until I get this error: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\u2122' in positionWhat's the deal with Python 3.4, Unicode, different languages and Windows?python 3.2 UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\u2013' in position 9629: character maps to <undefined>https://github.com/Drekin/win-unicode-consolehttps://docs.python.org/3/search.html?q=IncrementalDecoder&check_keywords=yes&area=defaultand tried these variationsall to no effect.This was done with python 3.4.3 and visual studio code 1.6.1 on Windows 10.  The default settings in Visual Studio Code include:// The default character set encoding to use when reading and writing  files.      "files.encoding": "utf8",python 3.4.3visual studio code 1.6.1ipython 3.0.0UPDATE EDITI tried this again in the Sublime Text REPL, running a script. Here's what I got:This code is only 217 characters long, so where does ‘position 300’ come from?
Here's a test case:Here's a script (Python 3.x):Here's the output, on an IDE that supports UTF-8 (PythonWin, in this case):Here's the output, on my Windows console, which defaults to :For Question 1, the reason  works is that no directory had a character that wasn't supported by the output encoding, but  is now printing a tuple containing  and one of the files has an unsupported character in the Windows console.For Question 2, the first example misspelled  as , and the second example didn't declare an encoding for the file the output was written to, so it used a default that didn't support the character.Try this:Content of , encoded in UTF-8:
The console you're outputting to doesn't support non-ASCII by default. You need to use .That works on strings not on lists. So  won't works, and it's , not .Print your lists with list comprehension like:
