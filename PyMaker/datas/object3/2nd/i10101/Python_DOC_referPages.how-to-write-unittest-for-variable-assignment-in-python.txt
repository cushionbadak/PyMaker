After creating a test class and inheriting , I tried to write a test like this:But, this throws a .  However, if I try , it throws the attribute error, as it should.How do I write a unittest to test this correctly?  Thanks.
You can also use  as a context manager:The documentation shows more examples for this if you are interested. The documentation for assertRaises has a lot more detail on this subject as well.From that documentation:If only the exception and possibly the msg arguments are given, return a context manager so that the code under test can be written  inline rather than as a function:which is exactly what you are trying to do.
 takes a callable (and optionally one or more arguments for that callable) as its argument; you are providing the value that results from calling the callable with its arguments. The correct test would be However, you should use  as a context manager, which allows you to write the much more natural
