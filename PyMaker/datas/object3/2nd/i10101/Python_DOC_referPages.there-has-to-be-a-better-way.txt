This question already has an answer here:Testing divisibility by multiple numbers                    5 answers                Is there a more idiomatic way to accomplish the following in Python3?I'm trying to find the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20. I'm not looking for a new solution. I'm looking for a neater way to express what I am doing above.
Yes use all with range:If all , it will return True otherwise it will short circuit and return False if there is any remainder for . Also, checking  is redundant so you can start at 2.Or conversly, check if there is not any  with a remainder. Or if you prefer functional:
You can use the  function combined with a list comprehension - or better yet - a generator expression:
Use a for loop in a while loop.
