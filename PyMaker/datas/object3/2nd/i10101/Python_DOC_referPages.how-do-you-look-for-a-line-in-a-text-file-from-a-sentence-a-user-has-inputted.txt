Natural Text
Can someone please help me on how to get the keywords from the inputed string by the user. Thanks. I need help on how to look for some of the words the users inputed in to =a and search for them on the textfile and print the line
I assume your keywords is meant to be a list? Then you use  to check if any word out of the keywords is in the line. Though, you may want to  your line to improve that detection. Otherwise, you have , which stores the user's input, so you can use that. Then, again  is a list, so you use  as beforeOr, if you want to check if the entire entered value is in a line, then 
I am not sure I understood the question but is this what you want?. this will take the line containing the most words from the user input:but it seems to me the easiest way to do what you want is to store at the start of each answer the question, or even easier - just ask the user the question number and return this corresponding answer.
