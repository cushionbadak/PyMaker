I have the following function:EDIT (full function)If the date is right, the function creates a list where the month is put, otherwise a  is put. But if I write:I get this error:So Python is telling me I have to put a control in the list number 8. How do I manage to tell the function to act like this?
Use Python  and :If the date is invalid,  will be raised, in which case you return .Call  for each date string in your function.
