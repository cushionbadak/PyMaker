Just taking a section of your code:   int() casts the arguments to integer format.  The error message is telling you it takes two arguments: 1) the value to be converted and 2) the base.So in:You're trying to cast the argument  to an integer.In the specific error message you're getting, you're trying to cast  and all of the subsequent variables to , and pass that to the variable Score 1.  Python doesn't know where to start with that.You can find more information at Python Docs.
