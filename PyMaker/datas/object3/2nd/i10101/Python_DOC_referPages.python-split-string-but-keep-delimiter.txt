In python I can easily read a file line by line into a set, just be using:each of the elements in the set consists of the actual line and also the trailing line-break.Now I have a string with multiple lines, which I want to compare to the content by using the normal set operations.Is there any way of transforming a string into a  just the same way, such, that it also contains the line-breaks?Edit:The question "In Python, how do I split a string and keep the separators?" deals with a similar problem, but the answer doesn't make it easy to adopt to other use-cases.doesn't have the expected effect.
Here's a simple generator that does the job:This solution adds an additional newline at the end though.
The  method does exactly what you want if you pass  as the optional  parameter. It keeps the newlines on the end of each line, and doesn't add one to the last line if there was no newline at the end of the string.
you can also do it the other way round, remove line endings when reading file lines, assuming you open the file with  for universal line endings:
Could this be what you mean?
