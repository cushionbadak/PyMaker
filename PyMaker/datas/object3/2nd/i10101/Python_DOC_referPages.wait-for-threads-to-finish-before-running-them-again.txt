I am making a program that controls 2 motors through a raspberry Pi. I am running python code and I am wondering how to achieve the following :Run motor1Run motor2 simultaneouslyWait for both motors to finishRun motor1Run motor2 simultaneouslyetc.What I have done so far is creating a Thread and using a queue.Both thread_1 and thread_2 won't finish at the same time depending of the numbers of steps the motor need to process. I have tried to use the Lock() functionality but I am not sure how to correctly implement it. I also thought about re-creating the Threads but not sure if this is the correct solution. 
You can use  actually:
You can use the thread's  method like so:As per the documentation at https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#threading.Thread.join:A thread can be ed many times.To run threads repeatedly, you will need to reinitialize the  object after each run.
