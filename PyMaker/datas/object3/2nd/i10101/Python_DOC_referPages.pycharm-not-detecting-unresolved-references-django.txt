So I'm having a problem with PyCharm and can't find a solution for it.It fails to recognize unresolved references: The image also shows that it fails to auto-complete request.session. It only happens with .session, it works with every other attribute.Also, this image shows that it does detect unresolved references for other stuff:I'm running it on a virtualenv, the interpreter is configured correctly and I have Django Support enabled.Oh, and I'm using Python3 and Django 1.10.2EDIT: Just tried it with other projects. It doesn't work with Django 1.10.x but works with Django 1.9.x
Well, in your 1st example  is a parameter to the  function - how would Pycharm know what type it is in order to check unresolved references (or offer auto-completion suggestions)?You could add a check for 's type (also maybe a good idea to prevent bugs):Or, since you tagged your question with  you could also use type hinting:
