I started learning about asynchronous code, and I have read a lot, but I just can't seem to find very simple examples to try it by myself and understand it better.I want to write a simple Python (preferably 3.5) program that does the following:1) Call the dummy async function  that just waits for a few seconds and returns something2) Continue doing stuff until  returns something3) Retrieve the return value from  and put in a variable4) Proceed on doing stuffHow can I do this?EDIT:Sorry if this wasn't clear, but I know how to do this using threading. I'm aiming for doing this using the async-await statements and the asyncio module.
To try to answer your question I've modified one of the example from the asyncio docs to include more of what you are asking for. https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.htmlIf you run the above you should see that dosomethingelse runs, while compute is waiting. I found asynchronous programming really hard to wrap my mind around. But I think that asyncio is actually much more straightforward than threading or multiprocessing because everything runs in the same memory space and (with simple coroutines like this) the program flow is completely sequential. The first task runs until it hits an , then the next task gets a chance, and so on. I highly recommend reading through the module documentation, which is quite good and trying to write some examples to explore each topic. Start with coroutines, then chaining, and then callbacks. EDIT: I'll leave this here as I think it's a good simple example. Comment if you disagree. Note that the  syntax is because I was using a slightly older version of python 3 at the time.I don't remember what tutorial I was reading but here is one of the first asyncio tests I wrote.
to stick to your question (because there are other ways to achieve what you want), a simple answer would be as follows:
