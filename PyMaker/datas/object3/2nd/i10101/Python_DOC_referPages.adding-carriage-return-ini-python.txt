This question already has an answer here:How do I read multiple lines of raw input in Python?                    7 answers                I want to write a program that gets multiple line input and work with it line by line. Why there is no function like  in Python 3?  does not allow user to put lines separated by newline (Enter), it prints back only the first line.Can it be stored in variable or even read it to a list?
In Python 3.x the  of Python 2.x has been replaced by  function. However in both the cases you cannot input multi-line strings, for that purpose you would need to get input from the user line by line and then  them using , or you can also take various lines and concatenate them using  operator separated by To get multi-line input from the user you can go like:Or
 can correctly handle the EOF, so we can write a loop, read till we have received an EOF (Ctrl-D) from user:Python 3Python 2
 is basically equivalent toYou can read directly from  if you like. The first two require that the input end somehow, either by reaching the end of a file or by the user typing Control-D (or Control-Z in Windows) to signal the end. The last one will return after five lines have been read, whether from a file or from the terminal/keyboard.
Use the  built-in function to get a input line from the user.You can read the help here.You can use the following code to get several line at once (finishing by an empty one):
