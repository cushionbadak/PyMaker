Natural Text
I have some code which prints every possible letter combination for a word length of 3.This code works fine but if I wanted to see every 4 letter word, then I would have to add another for loop and the same for 5 letters and so on. I am wondering how I can have a certain number of for loops depending on user input.
You itertools.product with a  where n is how many loops:
