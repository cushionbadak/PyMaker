Say you have a list value like this:  Write a function that takes a list value as an argument and returns a string with all the items separated by a comma and a space, with 'and' inserted before the last item. For example, passing the previous  list to the function would return , but your function should be able to work with any list value passed to itMy cod is below. When running, it shows  and  won't work; They are not separated with comma and space.
You have to specify the range value with or . Maybe  if value is a list.You get the exception  because you are referencing the class  instead of calling it.
You need a start and an end point for the FOR loop.eg. this will return "This is printed" 10 times.
Here is the code which does that
