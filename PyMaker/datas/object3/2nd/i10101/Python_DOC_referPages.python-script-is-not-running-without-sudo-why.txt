This is my python script which downloads the most recent image from my S3 bucket. When I run this script using  it does as expected, but not when I run it as . In this case, the script finishes cleanly without exceptions or process lockup, but there is no image file.Why does this happen? Is there something I could do at boto's library end or any other thing?
As @Nearoo in comments had suggested to use  to catch exceptions. catching the exception like this Should fetch you this error if the script is compiled using python 3xIf you would compile your script using python 2.7, this error wouldn't come.Probably you might be having multiple versions of python on your system,which should be the reason for your difference in behavior of  and  and for the same @mootmoot answer suggests to use . Now if you would have googled this error, you should find that  has been deprecated in python 3x and suggestions would be to use  instead.add these importsand replace with these is an alternate to  is replaced by  and  is used from functools  Check this out
Presumably the problem is that you try to store things somewhere your user doesn't have permission to. The second issue is that your script is hiding the error. The  block completely ignores what sort of exceptions occur (and of course consumes them so you never see them), and uses  which by default doesn't show; that should probably be at least a warning and would be better if it showed something about what went wrong. By the way, odds are you shouldn't be posting S3 authentication keys here. 
Always install virtual environment before you start development in python. The issue you face is typical python newbie problem : use  to install all the pypi package. When you do , it will install pypi package to system workspace and only accessible by . In such case,  will works, because it has the rights to access the package.To resolve this issues and isolation of development environment (so you don't pollute different project with differnt pypi package), python developer will install python virtual environment (from above link), then use  to create your project workspace, run  and  to install required package to the environment, then you can run python without the .Python virtualenv is also deployed inside production environment for the same reason.Important Note : avoid boto and boto2. AWS no longer support them nor with bug fixing(AWS is not officially support boto2, use it at your own risk). Switch to boto3.  For the exceptional handling issues, @Yann Vernier has mentioned it. And exception error will not logged by .  You may try with  or simple use  to raise the actual exception error.
