If there is a trailing space in a string , then  will remove that space. The reason it doesn't get removed by  in your case is that the space is not in the string you are printing, but instead is added to the visual output by the  function.Update:It is hard to say, because it is a mystery what happens before or after the code snippet in your edit, but it sounds like you want to do something like:
