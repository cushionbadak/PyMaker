I'd like to change the thousands separator such that  in Python uses a different character. The separator should be .How can I set this without affecting any other locals settings?EDIT: Any other suggestion for a unimposing separator viable in a fixed with font is welcome!
Your options are to either take the  formatted output and replace the commas, switch locales and use the  number format (which will format the number based on the current locale), or use a third party library like babel. The latter gives you full locale control over number formatting, for example, provided there is a locale that uses U+066C as the thousands separator.With the  function, the first option is quite straight-forward really:I have yet to find a locale that directly would use  for Western Arabic numerals however; U+066C is commonly used only with Eastern Arabic numerals instead. Babel doesn't include any such locale data, at least.You can pass any babel  object in to the  function, so if you need a custom separator you can clone an existing locale and set the  value:which results in the expected output:
