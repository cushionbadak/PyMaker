For the  method of generator, I use the below example. I tried to find the Python documentation for  method, but failed, could anyone help to point out?The purpose I want to find the official document is I want to look for all forms of  methods and meaning of the 2nd parameter  in my below example.
 is a function, so it is listed in the functions documentation:  Retrieve the next item from the iterator by calling its  method. If default is given, it is returned if the iterator is exhausted, otherwise  is raised.The second argument then is the default, returned if  raised . If no default is set, the  exception is not caught but propagated:The default is rather redundant for the specific example you gave, as the  generator expression is guaranteed to have at least one result.PyCharm can show you documentation for Python standard-library functions; just use the Quick Documentation feature (CTRL-Q).
