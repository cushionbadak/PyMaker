I have the following command line tool:The output of  is:however I would like to have:How could I have that reordering?
You would either have to provide your own help formatter, or specify an explicit usage string:The order in the help message, though, does not affect the order in which you can specify the arguments.  processes any defined options left-to-right, then assigns any remaining arguments to the positional parameters from left to right. Options and positional arguments can, for the most part, be mixed.
With respect to each other the order of  is fixed - that's why they are called that.  But  (the flagged arguments) can occur in any order, and usually can be interspersed with the postionals (there are some practical constrains when allowing variable length .)For the  line,  moves the  to the end of the list, but that just a display convention.There have been SO questions about changing that display order, but I think that is usually not needed.  If you must change the display order, using  a custom  parameter is the simplest option.  The programming way requires subclassing the help formatter and modifying a key method.
