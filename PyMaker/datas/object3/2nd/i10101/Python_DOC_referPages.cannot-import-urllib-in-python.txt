I would like to import  to use the function ''. However, I encountered an error when trying to download via Pycharm: "Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement urllib (from versions: ) No matching distribution found for urllib" I tried  but still had the same error. I am using Python 2.7.11. Really appreciate any help
A few things:As metioned in the comments,  is not installed through , it is part of the standard library, so you can just do  without installation. Python 3.x has a  module, but Python 2.x does not, as far as I know.The functionality that you are looking for from  is most likely contained in  (which is also part of the standard library), but you might be even better off using , which probably does need to be installed through  in your case:In fact, the  documentation itself recommends that you use the  library "for a higher-level HTTP client interface" - but I am not sure what you wish to do, so it is hard to say what would be best for your particular use case.
