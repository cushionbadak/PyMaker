As the title suggests, I would like to get python 3.5 to search my root ('C:\')for pdf files and then move those files to a specific folder.This task can easily split into 2: 1. Search my root for files with the pdf extension.2. Move those to a specific folder.Now. I know how to search for a specific file name, but not plural files that has a specific extension. This little program will find me either the 1st or all locations of a specific file. I, however, can not modify this to be able to search for pdf files due to the lack of knowledge with python and programming in general.Would love to have some kind of insight on where to go from here. To sum it up, Search the root for all pdf files. Move those files into a specific location. Lets say 'G:\Books'Thanks in advance. 
Your find_all function is very close to the final result.When you loop through the files, you can check their extension with os.path.splitext, and if they are .pdf files you can move them with shutil.moveHere's an example that walks the tree of a source directory, checks the extension of every file and, in case of match, moves the files to a destination directory:
You can use  from python 3.5 onwards. It supports a recursive search.If recursive is true, the pattern “**” will match any files and zero or more directories and subdirectories. If the pattern is followed by an os.sep, only directories and subdirectories match.Therefore you can use it likeWith a minimum of string wrangling. For large searches however such as from the root of a filesystem it can take a while, but I'm sure any approach would have this issue. Tested only on linux, but should work fine on windows. Whatever you pass as  must already exist.
