I want to test printed value in check_board_state function but I have problem with these tests. When I try to run them  using     python -m unittest tests.py i've got error:AttributeError: '_io.TextIOWrapper' object has no attribute 'getvalue'Tests works fine in PyDev in Eclipse when I use Python unittest instead of Python run. How Can I resolve this problem?
