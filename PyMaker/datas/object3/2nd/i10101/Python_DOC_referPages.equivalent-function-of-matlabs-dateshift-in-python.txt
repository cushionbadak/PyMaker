MatLab can take a date and move it to the end of the month, quarter, etc. using the  function.Is there an equivalent function in Python?
I'm not sure if it counts as the same, but the  module can make times available as a , with separate components for year, month, day etc. This is easy to manipulate directly to advance to the next month, etc.If you don't mind using an extension, check out . The list of features starts with:Computing of relative deltas (next month, next year, next monday, last week of month, etc); The documentation for  shows how to advance to various points.
I think  should do it for you, e.g.:You might find other helpful functions here: https://docs.python.org/2/library/calendar.html and here: https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html
