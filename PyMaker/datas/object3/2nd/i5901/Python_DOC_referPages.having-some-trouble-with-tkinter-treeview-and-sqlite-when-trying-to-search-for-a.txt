I have successfully been able to click a search button on my tkinter GUI and have the results display in my treeview however if I want to search straight again I get an error because when trying to write for the second time it's writing to the same row as the first search query. How would I either clear the treeview or make sure that my program writes to the next row in my treeview?So 'data'  will return ('memberID', 'fullname', 'username') and I am inserting those values into my treeview
Read doc Treeview.insert.  has parameter  to choose row. Or you can use word  to put after last row. needs  of inserted row/item (not row number)and later
