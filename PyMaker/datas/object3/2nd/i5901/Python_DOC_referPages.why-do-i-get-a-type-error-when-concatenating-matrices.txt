Natural Text
so I'm working with this code which should return the combined version of two matrices from a text file (w/o importing any kind of module). The text file might contain something like:[[1,2],[3,4]] [[5,6,7],[8,9,10]]And output:[[1,2,5,6,7],[3,4,8,9,10]]I keep on getting this type error: TypeError: eval() arg 1 must be a string, bytes or code objectHow do I fix this? Thanks.

Here is a way to do it using  which is much safer than running the dangerous  on arbitrary file input:For your data:
