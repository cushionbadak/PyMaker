I have a url I want to POST some JSON data to, but I'm having trouble decoding the data. I'm using Postman to test sending data to the webhook, and I've set up a system to capture what the webhook receives. When I run the following code (python):I get the following output, stored in the  variable:How else should I be trying to decode the JSON data? An earlier error I was getting was  when I tried using .
Since the data you're trying to parse seems to be multipart/form-data, i think the best approach is .  For this you'll need the request body and the boundary, which you can get from Content-Type headers with .  An example:  {'param1': [b'val1'], 'param2': [b'val2'], 'param3': [b'fdata']}  The result is a dictionary with the field names and a list of values (as bytes) for each field.You could then decode the first item of values in  to get a dict of strings.{'param1': 'val1', 'param2': 'val2', 'param3': 'fdata'}
