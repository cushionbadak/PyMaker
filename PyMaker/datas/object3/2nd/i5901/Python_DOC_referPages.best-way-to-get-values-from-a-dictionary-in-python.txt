Apologies for the potentially noobish question.I have this dict:I need to make a query with each value.In Python what is the best way to get the values?I currently do this:I think it can be done better.Thank you very much!
You can iterate through the keys and values of a dict using .(In Python 2 you might prefer to use  instead of .)If you don't need to make use of the keys at all, you could just use  (or  for Python 2).Maybe a list comprehension would work for you; it is impossible to tell without knowing what "Make query with j" entails.
Do you want to iterate over the list elements in every value? If you don't use the key, you can use  directly:

For Python 2.xUsing dict.iteritems() you can iterate through the keys and values in dictionary and make queries or anything. Dict: name of the dictionary*
You can do it this way:You can get the list of all the values like this:Then you can use
