I only know how to write python for GIS purposes. There is more to this code using arcpy and geoprocessing tools.... this is just the beginning part I'm stuck on that is for trying to get data ready so I can then use the shapefiles within the zipped folder for the rest of my scriptI am trying to prompt the user to enter a directory to search through. For use of this script it will be searching for a compressed zip file, then extract all the files to that same directory. Tried with y'alls suggestions and still have issues with the following:
I'm not sure on the use of . However...To iterate over entries in a directory, use :Inside the loop,  will be the name of an item in the directory at . When checking if it ends with ".zip", keep in mind that the comparison is case sensitive. You can use  to effectively ignore case when using :To get the full path to the entry (in this case, your .zip), use :Pass this full path to .
Your first if-block will negate the else-block if the location is invalid. I'd remove the 'else' operator entirely. If you keep it, the if-check effectively kills the program. The "if folderExist" is sufficient to replace the else.This may be neater if you're okay not using your original code:
[UPDATED]I was able to solve the same with the following code
