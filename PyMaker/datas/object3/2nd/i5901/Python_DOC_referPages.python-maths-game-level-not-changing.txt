When I type  or  or  my game does not go to the requested level.It prints the entered level (e.g. ) and stays on level one.
You should define the function before using it. You are calling functions before they are defined.Also the calls to them (e.g. ) after them is not needed.You may also move the imports at the begging of the file, and remove them from each function.You may also use an IDE, for example PyCharm.
