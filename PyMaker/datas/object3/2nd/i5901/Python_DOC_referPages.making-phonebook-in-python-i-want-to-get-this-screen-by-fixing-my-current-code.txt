I made my code like below....But as i input the data such as spam & number, previous data is deleted.So i'd like to make multiple value in one key...(i think using list is kinda good method)For example, Key: spam - Value: 01012341111, 01099991234, Key: spam - Value: 01032938962, 01023421232, 01023124242enter image description hereIn summary, I want to get this print (attached Picture)this is my code: 
You should use list for that. The problem is that you cannot append to a value that has not yet been set.And, as you saw, assigning multiple times to the same key won't do the trick.So, in order to make it work you could initialize all your possible keys with an empty list:This works but it's just tiring. Initializing dicts is a very common use case, so a method was added to  to add a default value if it has not yet been set:But then again you would have to remember to call  every time. To solve this the default library offers .Which may just be what you need.Hope I could help. ;)
