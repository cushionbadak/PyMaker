Natural Text
I have a text file with data.In each line there is one or two words and one number, so the problem is, that sometimes there are 2 columns and sometimes 3.I only need those numbers. How to copy them to a list in Python?I tried withBut I don't know how to get rid of '\n' in the end of number? Because when I change to , it doesn't work.Is there a better way?
If the line number is irrelevant:
When python reads text files, it also reads in the newline characters ( at the end of each line). You may want to remove these characters, and since these are numbers cast the value to  before appending to your list:output:
If you split each line by the space you would have a list of everything in the line. You can then use  to get the last element in that list. for example:this should get you just the last column in each line. If you also need to store it as a number you can do  as the last line.EDIT:You can use  to remove the  and all other white-space at the end of the line:
