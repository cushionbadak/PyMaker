Having looked at this question:ctypes: How do I define an array of a structure as a field of another structure?now I'm trying to implement my version of the solution, but the output of  in  is different from how is it set in C. My question is: what is the proper way to set  as an array of  objects in python (which is originally allocated/set in C)? There is  something obviously incorrect on the line  in pylink.py.clink.cpylink.pyOutput
This was solved by replacing this line in pylink.pywithThe attribute  is declared as a , so function  is not valid here. An important distinction between my implementation the one linked in the question is how the structure arrays are declared. Mine is a pointer, whereas the other uses a zero-sized array.
