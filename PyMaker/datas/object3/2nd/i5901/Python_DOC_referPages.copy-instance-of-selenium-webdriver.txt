You are assigning browser to broswer2, browser2 is essentially a reference to browser object hence broswer2 and browser both points to the same object. What you can do to solve this issue is use a Python's standard copy moduleNow both object can be modified independently From copy docs:Assignment statements in Python do not copy objects, they create  bindings between a target and an object. For collections that are  mutable or contain mutable items, a copy is sometimes needed so one  can change one copy without changing the other. This module provides  generic shallow and deep copy operationsRead more about copy module here in docs
