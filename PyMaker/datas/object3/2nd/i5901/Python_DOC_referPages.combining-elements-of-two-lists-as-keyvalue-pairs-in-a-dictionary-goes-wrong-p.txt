I have two lists:Both has same length (8)ReportsWhat i am looking for is,How to do it? Why the index has changed?
By index do you mean ordering?  does not preserve ordering. If you need ordered dictionary use .That gave me:
You may notice that the  matches your elements just fine. So that only leaves the  to contain some problem. And that is in fact the crux of your problem here. Dictionaries are not Ordered! And that's why there is a chance that when you print out your , the order may change.So just use an  , and it should solve your problems.
