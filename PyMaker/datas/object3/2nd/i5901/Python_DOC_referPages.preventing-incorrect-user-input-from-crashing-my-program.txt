I am attempting to access a FASTA sequence from a UniProt database.  This currently works when entering the UniProt code in correctly (a 6 digit string of characters, for example P10079), however if entering an incorrect one it crashes my program.  I've attempted to write a loop so the user can re-input another code, until one is correctly entered although I'm still getting errors.  Is this because I haven't used this in a function?Cheers
The problem is that your  statement will only executed if no exception occurs. So if the first input is invalid, i.e. causes an exception, but not the 2nd input, the whole  block will be skipped.One of the several possibilities would be to put everything in a loop which is executed until  succeeds and then get the sequence information.
