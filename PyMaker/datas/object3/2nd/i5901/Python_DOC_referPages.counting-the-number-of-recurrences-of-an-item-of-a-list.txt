This is my code, however I want it to print the number of words at the specified length, but instead it prints the words itself. Any suggestions?
You can count the number of elements that satisfy a condition by using:Note that  here must be a boolean (since  is , and  is , it thus sums up the s and thus counts the number of times the condition is met).So if you want to count the number of elements that have a length less than five, you can write:Or for the number of words with length five:etc.
you could count the words in your loop, but it's more pythonic to feed  with a generator comprehension filtered on the word size:another variant is to convert the result of the test to boolean (here the result of the test is already a boolean so no need to  it), and sum that:It's ideal for testing one condition, but if you want to count words matching several conditions (, ) in one go, the classical loop remains the best choice since it iterates on the list only once and you're naturally using short-circuit evaluation with , too bad for listcomps but that's life:
In addition to the existing answers, you can use  and  functions to get a count as well:
I'd build a  first, then it will be easy to extract the information you want.Alternatively, you can build the  with The  tells you that your sentence has two words of length two and two words of length 5.Getting the number of words with lenght smaller than five:Since a  returns  by default when a missing key is looked up you can get the same result by issueingwhich is probably a little easier to read than the first option.Getting the number of words with length 5 is very easy:
You have to find length of each word then you can count them based on word's length.Using , , and  builtin functions will simplify code a lot:will print:
