I want to print the  from file but, here  is not working.It shows the error:_pickle.UnpicklingError: the STRING opcode argument must be quoted
The file containing the pickled data must be written and read as a binary file. See the documentation for examples.Your extraction function should look like:Of course, you will need to dump your data into a file open as binary as well:Additionally, the logic of your main seems a bit flawed.While the code that follows  is only executed when the script is run as main module, the code that is not in the main should only be static, ie definitions.Basically, your script should not do anything, unless run as main.Here is a cleaner version.
