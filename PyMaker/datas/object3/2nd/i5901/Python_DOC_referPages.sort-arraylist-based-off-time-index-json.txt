I have Python code written where a function gets in a JSON list (responses), a location (that is irrelevant at the moment) and a  (an array with  numbers that need to be compared with the  list)It returns a list where , as a string, is the first element. I need to sort the list by .How can I do this? Here is my code.Time is formatted on a 24-hour clock (no am or pm),  for example.
This should suffice:This is because your array is an array of dictionaries. The  routine grabs a dictionary element to use for sorting.
