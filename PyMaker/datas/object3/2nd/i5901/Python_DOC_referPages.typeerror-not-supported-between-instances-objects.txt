I am trying to sort by name but it is typing an Error: TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'Person' and 'Person'. Could you tell me where the problem is? Here is my code. Error:
It's just what it says: you cannot sort  objects.  If you want this to work, you have to define at least the  operator for your class, using whatever sort criterion you had in mind -- perhaps alphabetical by name?Another possibility is to simply write your own function, and call it with .Also, I'm not sure why this matters: you never use the return value of this operation.  You store it in the local variable  (that's a poor variable name, by the way), and never use it.
How about writing a custom key function and pass it as  argument?
