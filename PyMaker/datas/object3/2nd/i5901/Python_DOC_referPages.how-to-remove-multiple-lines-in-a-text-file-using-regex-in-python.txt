I want to remove multiple lines in a file using regex.I have a file with something like this : Basically, when I choose the host name like  for example, it'll detect the line that has it and remove all the lines after it until it encounters the first  : I guess we would use something like  but it works for line by line stuff not for multiple lines.Starting like this?
I have 3 ideas for you.  Try MULTILINE mode.  You can read more about it here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.MULTILINE which I think will do what you are asking.When that just doesn't do the trick, I cheat.  I'll run a pre regex to swap all \n to something strange like "this_is_my_special_holder".  Now everything is on one line.  I'll do the work I want like you have written.  Then I'll run a post regex that swaps all "this_is_my_special_holder" back to \n.  If you ever get stuck in a language that doesn't support multiline this should always get it done :)You may just be able to run the regex, my example here does just that:Here is how I would do this whole thing:    import reI open the file with 'with', that way you don't have to close the file handle later.  'r' is to read the file and 'w' is to write the file.  The regex simply replaces:with nothing.  http://regex101.com is a handy site to actually play with the regexs.  good luck!
