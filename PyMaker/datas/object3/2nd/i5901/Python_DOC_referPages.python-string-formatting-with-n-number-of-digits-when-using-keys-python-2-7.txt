This question already has an answer here:Nicest way to pad zeroes to a string                    13 answers                To have specific number of digits in string formatting, I am aware that it can be done in this way:But my case is a bit different. I am using specific keys to denote the values, for example:Here I want to have different values for the , i.e. When I use the above method with , it does not take into account the  and so my folder is not recognised. EDIT:Most of the answers are for only one value, however, I want to have more than one key value, i.e.:
The new format string syntax allows you to use format specifiers, just like the old -based syntax. The format specifiers you can use are similar, not exactly the same in all cases (I think), but as far as I know, anything you could do with the old syntax can also be done with the new syntax.All you have to do is put the format specifier inside the formatting expression, separated from the field name/number by a colon. In this case, you could use , where  is the code to get a zero-filled () width-2 () representation of an integer ().
Just learnt from other answers and commentators that we don't need  but can use the expression  to give the padding.Expand to more positions:
There are a lot of ways. Look this answer.This is my subjetive opinion, but I have ordered them by worst to best.Then, you have to combine that with your current string, nothing really complicate.Edit:I am not sure what the OP is asking with his edit exactly but:Can be changed by a lot of ways, I'll give some examples:Etc.
