I was looking how to stop a thread on python using the thread module, and I found that this method is not provided by the module. I have seen some tricks to implement a way to stop the threads but nothing of this worked for me.   My program have a main window that shows every function on it, and one of this functions opens another window that do a "function2" with a button.I want to be able to do things, or not let the windows freeze while "function2" is running, so I have used  to define the "function2" and called it using  method.This, works great, but when "function2" is done, I cannot re-run the function because of the threads can only be started once.I need a solution to this, if someone can help me, I would be glad.Thanks.
Expanding on comments. What you have iswhich basically creates one thread and tries to re-run it on click. There is no such thing as re-runing threads so instead you have to create a new thread on click:While this is better it has another drawback: what if someone starts clicking the button like mad? You want to restrain the number of threads to use. For that using a thread pool is a good option:This code is for Python3.x. For Python2 I think you need some external library.
