In Python 3, I should be able to use  in a class method as a substitute for the parent class:The above behaves as expected when I instantiate a  and add values to it. But if I use it as the data type for a  object, something goes wrong:If I replace  with plain  as the parent class, the error gets even weirder:If instead of  I write  or  explicitly, I can use  as the  with no problems. Can someone explain what is going on? (Since there is an easy work-around, I'm more curious about the cause than about the solution...)
Method attribute access on a  proxy object, like ordinary method binding, just passes the object implicitly as the first positional argument.  Change this:To this:Note that  doesn't use cooperative inheritance, i.e. it just calls  directly.  Ideally, every object in the inheritance chain should be using .  Please proceed with caution if you plan to use  with a multiple-inheritance structure.
