Natural Text
I have some variable from API.For example:I need to get variable b by decoding a:But I can't write in code something like this:because this text (\xd0\xbc) is already in the variable.
You need to use  and pass  to get .If  is not the standard encodings you were looking for, try others. 
will this help ? I would guess there is a better way however I do not know it
