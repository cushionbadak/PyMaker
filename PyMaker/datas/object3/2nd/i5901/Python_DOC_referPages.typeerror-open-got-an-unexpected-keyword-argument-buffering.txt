I am writing a chatbot program with python and when I run my code I get the following error.  Could not find any information online regarding error.  All I saw was maybe that it was a bug and I should report it to python.  Currently running python3.5.3.  This is the part of the code that gets the error.
The error is very explicit:A simple check of the documentation for  would then show you that this function does not take a  argument.So simply remove it.
The  function doesn't take a  argument. Even , which takes , explicitly notes:The  argument is ignored. Its use is deprecated.Buffering arguments are a bit nonsensical for compressors; they have to buffer to some extent, since if you request X amount of data, they may need need to decompress a block of unknown final size to get it, so they're either decompressing the whole block and buffering the uncompressed data beyond the X request, or stopping decompression when they reach X, buffering the compressed data (and they might still have to buffer some uncompressed data since decompressing a single byte from a stream can produce many bytes of output).Point is, there is no reasonable way to disable or limit buffering; the needs of the compressor mean you don't have that level of control.
