New to python and regular expressions, I have been trying to find a way that I can parse a sentence so that I can take parts of it and assign them to their own variables.An example sentence is: Laura Compton, a Stock Broker from Los Angeles, CaliforniaMy objective is to have: name = "Laura Compton" ( this one is the easy one, I can target the anchor link no problem), position = "Stock Broker", city = Los Angeles, state = CaliforniaAll of the sentences I need to iterate over follow the same pattern, name is always in the anchor tag, the position always follows the , after the closing anchor, sometimes its uses "a" or "an" so I would like to strip those off. The city and state always follow the word "from" .
You can try this:Output:
You can use named groups within patterns to capture substrings, which makes referring to them easier and the code doing so slightly more readable:Output produced from sample :A.M. Kuchling wrote a good tutorial titled Regular Expression HOWTO you ought to check-out.
