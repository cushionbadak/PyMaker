I want to access some files in my network drive.My network drive is called  "networkfile". If I just run this on the Window command line, it is working:  net use \networkfile\Programs. However, It didn't work when I put it in the Python script (I'm using Python3). I tried:a = os.system("net use O:\networkfile\Programs")a = os.system("net use \networkfile\Programs")a = os.system("net use \networkfile\Programs")a = subprocess.run("net use O:\networkfile\Programs", shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)None of those work. The error is:  "System error 67 has occurred. The network name cannot be found."Anyone has experienced this before? Please advice.Thanks,
your string  is being evaluated by the python interpreter as:because the  is interpreted as a newline character. You can work around this in a couple different waysuse a raw string (see four paragraphs down here) to prevent backslashes being treated specially (in most cases).escape the backslashes themselves so they evaluate to a literal backslash (make all  into )use the  library to generate the string so the correct directory separator is used regardless of operating system.
