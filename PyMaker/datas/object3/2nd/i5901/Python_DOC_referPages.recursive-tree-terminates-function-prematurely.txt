I am trying to define a function that returns a list of all combinations of legal coins that amount to a given sum. Let's say the given sum were 10 and the legal coins were 5, 2, 3. In that case the function should return:I've managed to create a recursive function that gives me the correct result, but by printing the correct answers on separate lines and mixing in a bunch of 's.How can I return the correct answer to a list of legal solutions without terminating the function prematurely. I know that my function is ineffective. I can think of some improvements myself, and will implement them later.Here's my code:This is the output:
You just need to turn your function into a generator, by replacing those  calls with .I've also changed the default of  to , since you don't really want a default mutable argument here. See “Least Astonishment” and the Mutable Default Argument for details.outputIf you do actually need a list of the solutions, then simply run the generator into a list, like this:output
