It's not possible (as far as I know) to actually change the running version of Python. And furthermore, I can't think of any reason you would have to.In the rare circumstances where you might have found it advantageous to do such a thing (e.g. if you're using two libraries which are not both compatible with any single Python version), you can use something like the subprocess module to run a different version of Python in a separate process. You can either have it communicate with the original Python process, if necessary, or you can just have the original process sit there and do nothing until the newly invoked version finishes.
