I can't pass a dict of dict between processes with multiprocessing in Python2.7Expecting result: {'a': {1:1, 2:2}}, but got {'a': {}} instead
Make the nested dictionary a proxy object too:or retrieve , mutate that object, and set it back: is not a regular dictionary; it wraps a dict to track mutations to the object itself, but your value, associated with the key  is not such an object, so mutations to that object are not detected, and the changes are not communicated with the parent process.If you were to use , then  the latter would retrieve the still empty dictionary from the parent process and set  back to that empty object; you have to create a local reference to the remote mutable nested dictionary first to ensure you correctly tell the parent process to correctly set it.From the Proxy Objects section of the documentation:If standard (non-proxy) list or dict objects are contained in a referent, modifications to those mutable values will not be propagated through the manager because the proxy has no way of knowing when the values contained within are modified. However, storing a value in a container proxy (which triggers a  on the proxy object) does propagate through the manager and so to effectively modify such an item, one could re-assign the modified value to the container proxy:
