Is there any python function to call Mac OS frameworks like ctypes wilndll does?I am trying to build botu win and mac OS app, since the H/W manufacturer released both .dll and .framework with almost same structure and functions.Is there any equivalent of ctypes in OS X?
ctypes is a foreign function library for Python. It provides C compatible data types, and allows calling functions in DLLs or shared libraries. It can be used to wrap these libraries in pure Python.https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html
