Consider the following code:This will result in a list being formed as follows:Whereby each number is paired with another number in the list and no repeats i.e. if [1,2] exists then [2,1] will not be created also pairs with two of the same numbers e.g. [1,1]  will not be created either. However now consider a list of objects whereby I would like to pair each object with one other object (not itself and no repeats) in a similar fashion as the numbers were. For some reason my code does not allow me to do that as it presents a message  '>' not supported between instances of 'Ball' and 'Ball'. (The class I created was called Ball which generated the objects).Any help to resolve this issue would be very much appreciated.
Of course,  is the proper "pythonic" solution: However, you have the correct idea, you can generate all the indices of the objects to be paired, and retrieve them:output:
