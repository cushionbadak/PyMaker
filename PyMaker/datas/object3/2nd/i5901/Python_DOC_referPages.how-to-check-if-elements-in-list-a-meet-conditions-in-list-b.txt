I have a list of numbers:And a list of conditions:I want to check if a number in 'a' meets one of the conditions in 'b' and if yes, put these numbers in list 'c'In above case:I created this code what seems to do what I want:However my list 'a' can be very big.Is there not an easier and faster way to obtain what I want?
Building on @user2357112's suggestion, you can create a list of functions for all your conditions, then pass each number, to each function to determine whether the number meets any of the conditions, or not.
Assuming you could change  to hold valid conditions (when concatinated with elements from ) as discussed in the comments above:You could concatinate each element of  with these conditions and use  to check if it evaluates to  or . This, of course, can be done in a list comprehension:
 you want simple ,pythonic and easy to grasp forget the above ones
Based on previous answers, I think there could be 2 more ways.For a really big list, you should go with example #2 because it is more memory efficient and time complexity is linear instead of quadratic-like in #1
