I'm learning python 3.6 since a few weeks and stumbled in a tutorialover the morse dictionary example.There is a dictionary like:With my following code it's possible to enter one letter and get at stdout the matching morse code:same behaviour with:What I want is to input complete words or sentences and get the morse code at stdout for each letter which was entered in one lineI thought the following might be work (but it does not..). which results in error, don't care if I input  or  ( the default separator is \w, I think)I also tried if I can get on with dict.get() or dict.update().I think there must be a simple way to do this, or? ;) Is the goal to iterate the input?I appreciate any help
You shouldn't need the split or the if statement that you have. Check to see if this works for you:If you want all of the letters for a loop on the same line you can append them to a list or add them to an empty string and then print that at the end of the loop like this:
(use  in Python 2)
Use dict.get() which basically is: dict.get(value-by-key,value-if-not-found). The value if-not-found can be an empty string Returns:
Perhaps:By way of explanation, the code inside the  statement does the following:Iterates over the input string For any keythat exists in , returns the matching value Builds up all returnedvalues into a list Joins the list elements (morse characters) withcommas
