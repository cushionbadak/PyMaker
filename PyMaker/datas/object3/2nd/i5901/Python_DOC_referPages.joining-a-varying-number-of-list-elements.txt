I have the following list of strings:Where the format of every string is: count, stock name, volume, some more int values...I need to split these strings into a list where each element is one of the items in the string format above, and this is how I attempted to do that:However, I believe this is inefficient and it doesn't work when the name is more or less than two words. How would I handle this? Would I have to adjust how I generate the list of strings (data) in the first place?EDIT:Output:
You can use :Output:With the parenthesis removed:Output:
You can split lists on charactersAll of the strings in your original data list have 2 sections, the stock name and then the number values, if you split on the closing paranthesis in the string you can break it into a list holding a string for the stockname and a string containing the numbers, the numbers have consistent spacing between them of one space and then you can split the list of numbers on the space character.https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split
