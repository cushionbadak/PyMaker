Given a list of tuples:I want to check if the first number == second number + 1 in each tuple.In case they are equal I need to return  and else return .I tried two different methods but both check only the first tuple ()  and then return , despite that it should return  (because the second tuple  is ).Attempt #1:Attempt 2:What am I doing wrong?
You are only testing the first tuple in your list.  ends the function.Test all tuples before you decide to return i:So when the first tuple is tested, the  test is still false, so you continue to test the next tuple. At that point  is tested and  is returned. If you were to remove the  tuple from the input, then the  loop ends and the  line is reached.You can use the  function, together with the inverse test (not equal) to make the above loop more compact:This returns  the moment a tuple that matches your criteria is found,  otherwise.
You can try this:Output:
