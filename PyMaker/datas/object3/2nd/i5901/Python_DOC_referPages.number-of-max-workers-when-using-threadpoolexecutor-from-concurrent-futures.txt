What are the factors to consider when deciding what to set max_workers to in ThreadPoolExecutor from concurrent.futures?As long as you can expect Python 3.5+ to be available, is there any reason not to set max_workers to None which will then "default to the number of processors on the machine, multiplied by 5" as described in the docs here?https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor
I don't think this question can be so generically solved it will depend on each case.From this answer:The more threads you use, the higher concurrency you'll achieve (up to  a point), but the less CPU cycles you'll get (as there will be context  switches). You have to instrument your application under typical  workloads to see what works best for you. There is no universally  optimal solution for this.
