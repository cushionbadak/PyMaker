Natural Text
I have a string like this:It's a list of news headlines parsed from the Google News RSS Feed. I'm sending the data over serial to a LCD which has 2 lines with 16 characters each. Currently, I split the string into 32 character parts, then display each part for a fixed length of time. The problem with this is that it displays only part of the last word in most cases, and in some cases, only part of the first word, depending on how the string is split. So, how can I split the string by the whitespace, to prevent splitting the words, and still try to be less than the 32 character limit. An example using the above text would be: First line: Trump, Defending Himself AfterSecond line: Flynn Guilty Plea, Says FBI Isand so and so on. 
You can create own definition and define limit as follows and you can iterate over list.output:
You are trying to wrap the text to a 32-character line length.  The textwrap module in the standard library does this.
