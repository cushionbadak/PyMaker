I am currently trying to make a program that will run commands. I want to have it so there is a list of commands and the program will take my input command, check to see if its in the list, and then run the command if it does. and if not I want it to print out Invalid Command.this is currently what i have. I already made the list but youll notice in my if statement i want it to check to see if it equals cmd or google. I am going to have a lot more commands then this so in the nature of making things look pretty, i wanted to know if there was a way i could have the command check the list, run the command if its in the list, and if its not, print invalid command.
You can create a function per command, and store the name for command and function to be executed in a dictionary. Like this:This way you only have to create new functions, and add them to the dictionary. The logic in the main loop remains the same.
I think the most versatile way would be using a dictionary and the exec funktionCan't test this right now but it should work
I did a similar program, a little console, to help me on the developments.the solution is a if-elif-else statement because every command is different to the other. So:Array commands and the first if statement aren't necessary because now there is "else" that intercept all invalid commands.if you want see my code there is a link:  DevUtils at line 38 i manage commands.
