How do I check to see how many times the keys in one  exist in . If the keys of  exist in  a variable, , with an initial value of  should be subtracted based on how many times the keys are found. For example  looks like this and  looks like this Since there are two repeat keys between the dicts, should be equal to .if  looks identical to , then  should be . Also,  will always be the same size, but  can get quite large, so a fast lookup method would be ideal. Lastly, the values of dicts here don't really mean anything. 
Using set intersection:Edit:Because key views are already set-like, so you can do  directly. Note that  is a very cheap call because it simply provides an alternative interface to the existing dict structure (Credits to @PM2RING in the comments).
Since dict_keys are already set-like, you can simply useThat is for Python 3. In Python 2, the equivalent view object is , which you'd use similarly. 
Make sets out of the list of keys in each dict.Find the intersection and union of those sets. gives you the set of differences.If that's 0, then you return 0;otherwise, return the size of the intersection.
This will work in Python 2 and 3:
