I explain what I have to develop.Let's say I have to perform a function that is responsible for receiving two matrices, which have the same number of columns but can differ in the number of rows.In summary, we will have two matrices of vectors with the same dimension but different number N of elements.I have to calculate the Euclidean distance between each of the vectors that make up my two matrices, and then store it in another matrix that will contain the Euclidean distance between all my vectors.This is the code I have developed:In this method I am receiving the two matrices to later create a matrix that will have the Euclidean distances between the vectors of my matrices  and .The problem is the following, I do not know how, to each one of the calculated Euclidean distance values ​​I have to assign the correct position of the new matrix  that I have generated.My main function has the following structure: calculates the Euclidean distance using efficient methods.It has to have the same result as  that calculates the same as the other but with non efficient code, but I'm not getting what the result should be.I think it's when I create my Euclidean matrix  that is not doing it correctly, then the calculations are incorrect.Updated!!!I just updated my solution, my problem is that firstly I didnt know how to asign to the D Matrix  my correct euclidean vector result for each pair of vectors, Now I khow how to asign it but now my problem is that only the first line from D Matrix is having a correct result in comparison with cdist function
not fully understanding what you're asking, but I do see one problem which may explain your results:You are overwriting the value of D each of the NxM times you go through this loop.  When you're done D only contains the distance of the last compare.  You might need something like D[i,j] = math.sqrt(...
