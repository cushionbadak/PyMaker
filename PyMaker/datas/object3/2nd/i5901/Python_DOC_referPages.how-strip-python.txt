Natural Text
I'm writing a quiz code for school. The code iterates over a text file and loads the questions and answers from it. The user will select a difficulty to do the quiz on. The number of options for answers will vary depending on the difficulty. I have split each question and possible answer in the text file with commas.This is what a line of the text file would look like:Question 1. What is 4+5?,9,10,20,11The first option (question[1]) will always be the correct answer, therefore I would like to shuffle the options. With this code the options are outputted with square brackets, newline characters and quotation marks. Does anyone know how I can strip these? I tried to use:  however this seemed to do nothing at all. Thanks  
The problem is that you are trying to print a  object. Instead, you should print each option. you'd probably be better printing some formatting around it:please read about  and  to understand exactly what happens here
Something like this?Python docs:Return a string which is the concatenation of the strings in iterable. A TypeError will be raised if there are any non-string values in iterable, including bytes objects. The separator between elements is the string providing this method.

To remove characters from a string, use  to remove characters from the right end of the string and  to remove characters from the left of the string.
