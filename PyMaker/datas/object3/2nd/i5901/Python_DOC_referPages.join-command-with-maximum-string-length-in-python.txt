I want to join a list of ids to a string, where each id is separated by an 'OR'. In python I can do that with I am wondering whether there is a way to prevent this string from becoming too large (in terms of bytes). The reason why this is important for me is that I use that string in an API and that API imposes a max length of 4094 bytes.My solution is below, I am just wondering whether there is a better one?
Just for fun, an over-engineered solution (that avoids Schlemiel the Painter repeated concatenation algorithms, allowing you to use  for efficient combining):With this, you use  to break up your iterable into pre-sized groups, then  them without using repeated concatenation:If the goal is to produce strings with a given byte size using a specified encoding, you could tweak the  to accept a third constructor argument:
This is a simpler solution than your current one:
