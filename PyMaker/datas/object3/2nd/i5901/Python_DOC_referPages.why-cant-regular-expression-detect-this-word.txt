Natural Text
I'm trying to make a small program that detects words, I have a string and I want to be able to pull out specific words, this is the code so far:I want to be able to detect the '"main":' because the word I want to detect always follows this term, I thought this would be the easiest way to pull out the word that I want. However whenever I run this program the word main is returned to me, I have tried several ways of rearranging this code but nothing seems to work, sorry if it's obvious, I'm new to RE.
