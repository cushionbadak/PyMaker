Natural Text
I'm trying to run a program that administers a quiz based on the contents of a text file. My code looks like this:This program administers a quiz on US states, capitals, and governorsglobal for how many questionsHOW_MANY_QUESTIONS=10open file with answersanswers_file=open('quiz_answers.txt','r')open file to add results at endresults_file=open('quiz_results.txt','w')def main():def create_dictionary(infile):def pick_question(dictionary):main()When I run the program, the error I get is: state=infile.readline()  File"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/encodings/ascii.py", line 26, in decode    return codecs.ascii_decode(input, self.errors)[0]UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xff in position 36: ordinal not in range(128)So the problem stems from reading that first line of the text file; what is the issue and how can I fix it? I've never seen this error before. Thanks in advance!
Wherever you open infile you will need to open it with the correct encoding. The details of how to do this:Python 2.7: Backporting Python 3 open(encoding="utf-8") to Python 2Python 3+: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#openMost likely the issue is that you are using Python 2.7 and attempting to open a utf-8 file.
