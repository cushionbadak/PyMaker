I'm totally new to Python and I'm trying to write a class, which will store only two attributes, one of which is intended to be a number and another a datetime object. Though I'd also like, while storing  as a datetime, to initialize and output it using a string like "dd.mm.yyyy". So I go: But at runtime  points at  and says: . How can it ever get a string, when it's meant to be converted to date while setting. Why is this happening? Confused.For example:
You can't use  for both the  object and an instance attribute. Only the property is available (because it is a data descriptor), and  references that property object. The expression  is passing the  value to the setter, it is not setting an instance attribute.Because  is evidently a  object in your case, that means that in the setter  is called, which fails. Even if that succeeded, you'd then try to assign that result back to , which would call the setter again, ad infinitum. And it is a  instance either because you passed in a  value originally, or you passed in a string, and the first  call succeeded and now  is being assigned that  instance that was just created.Rename the instance attribute; giving it a leading single underscore is usually the most helpful naming scheme here:I also changed  (a call to an unbound method) to a method call on .
