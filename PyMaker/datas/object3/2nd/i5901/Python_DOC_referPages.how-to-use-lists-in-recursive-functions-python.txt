I'm writing a function that recursively traverses the file system, and returns a list of all files with the  extension. The  parameter is just a function that can be run and checked (i.e. is the file greater than 100 bytes, etc) - The  function (set as its default), simply returns its argument. My implementation:My problem is that when I recursively call  in the following lines the  is cleared to empty again. I understand why this is happening, but have no idea how I would fix it. The list has to be defined within the definition of , so whenever I use recursion it will always be reset no matter what right? Maybe some other data structure is better suited, like a tuple or dictionary? 
Add an optional argument that can be used in the recursive case:As an alternative, as suggested by Blorgbeard, since you return , use that for your  calls, changing only a single line in your original code:to:This creates additional temporary s, but that's usually not a big deal.
Your function returns , so just append the returned value when you make your recursive call, instead of throwing it away as you currently do:
