While using  I very often have to condition some action on the value of a tag's class. For example, imagine that I want to do some action on  only when the attribute is , and a different action otherwise.What I do is:This is a bit clumsy. I wonder if there's a way to make the condition a little more compact than this. The ideal would be that a check on the final condition (that  contains ) implied that the element does have a  attribute and, consequently, it is a tag, not a NavigableString.
Using a ternary operator would definitely remove some bulk, though not everything at once. The number of if-else's would still be same though. So, not sure if that would work for you.http://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/ternary_operators.htmlSo the current code would become:or if you want to compress it further (though I feel that would affect readability):
Like for Python dictionaries, you can use the  method instead of accessing the element using . This way, it does not raise a  if the element is not present but just returns . Also, you can provide a default value, so you can simplify the code to:
