I'm trying to cut up a list of letters using  where the corresponding position of the letter in  cuts at  in such a way that 'K' ( 1), cuts after a letter when read left-to-right, and 'S' ( 0) cuts before a letter.I currently need to use a list comprehension inside another list comprehension to confirm this, but I'd like to lower this to a single list comprehension while returning the location of the word that is found to be successfully cut by this pattern in  and .Is there a more clever way to go about doing this?
