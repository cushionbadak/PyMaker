Here it is the progamm:*I'm new to stackoverflow feel free to tell me if i'm doing something wrong.
If I understand correctly, your program works correctly already and you are looking for ways to reduce running time.You could use the multiprocessing package to parallelize your program into per-file subprocesses.To do so, put the code in your  loop into a function (let's call it ), and then:This will create as many subprocesses as there are cpus/cores and will distribute the work onto those. This should result in a significant reduction of running time, depending on the number of available cores in your machine of course.Keeping track of the number of moved files does not directly work anymore, however, because the variable  is not accessible to the child processes. Your function could return a  if the file was moved and a  if not, then you could sum up the results of all calls to  like this:
