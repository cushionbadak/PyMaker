I want to do is find who has the most points and output their name.However, all I can do with this program is print the highest score. How do I print the name, as well?
The simplest fix from here is to put them into corresponding lists:This is not the "best" way; that would have a single list of 2-tuples, or a dictionary to hold the scores and names.  I leave that to the student, once you understand how this works.
You could make a dictionary of players to their points and use 's  argument.What this does is call the  function to determine the value of each thing, instead of just taking their normal value.
A clean solution would be, if you would save the highscores in a Dictionary with Player as the key and the  as the value. That's of course to begin with, to really retrieve efficiently retrieve the highest elements there are more sophisticated data-structures that inserts . You could use a list with the bisect method to maintain this
You can zip them (like a zipper) - will truncate the result to the lenght of the shortest list:If you sort this list of tuples it will sort the list by each tuples first param, if they are identical it will sort those 2 by the second tuple param.:It is sorted ascending (you can specify otherwise, lookup sorted) - you get the last one by  a list comprehension.Output via:gives:
