This question already has an answer here:Why does random.shuffle return None?                    9 answers                Right now I am trying to do a piece of code for the Monty Hall problemI have some code that I am trying to fix and then enhanceThis is one thing that I am stuck on:I am trying to change the way the door at which the prize is chosen by using random.shuffle(), I have to use random.shuffle(), not anything else.How would I do this?What I have now does not work for that.if I put , I don't get a new output.how do I make it return the chosen output
 shuffles in place, meaning it will return  if you try and assign a variable to it's non-existent output.Since you say you have to use , you can shuffle the list in place with , then take an element from this shuffled list eg: 
From the python3 documentation of the random module: random.shuffle(x[, random])   Shuffle the sequence x in place.The 'in place' means that the function is replacing the variable x (in your case, 'door') with a different variable that has the same values as before but with their order shuffled. It does not have a return, it simply modifies the variable you gave it, which is why your print statement shows 'None'.If you must use, , you can simply select an element of the door after you've shuffled it  (i.e.  then ). However, if other functions were to be an option, then  may be simpler instead (documentation for random.sample here).
