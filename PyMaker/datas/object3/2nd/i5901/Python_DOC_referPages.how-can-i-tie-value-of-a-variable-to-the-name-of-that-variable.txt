I'm working on a homework assignment for an intro to programming class that is asking me to create a program that allows a user to input a list of values (rainfall in each of a 12 month period) and to calculate the total, median, and the lowest and highest values in the list.What I have so far works, but I don't know how to make the program print the name of the month that the value is tied to. That is, if March had the lowest amount of rainfall, how do I tell it to print not just the integer that the variable  represents, but the name of that variable as well? From what I can find online, it's being suggested that I should perhaps be using a dictionary instead of a list - but we don't cover dictionaries in class until next week, and the chapter of the book the excersise is from is all about lists, so I assume I'm supposed to find a way to do this with a list. Here's my code so far:
You can simply have a relationship between the min and the max value's index within the list to another list containing the month names.
