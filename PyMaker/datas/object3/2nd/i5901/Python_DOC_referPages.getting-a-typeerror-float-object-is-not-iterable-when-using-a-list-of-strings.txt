Im trying to get the closest match between two lists of strings ( and ) to create a .The purpose for that is because I have to clean a dataframe that has one column of strings which each string represent a fruit which some entries has spelling mistakes that I need to fix.The actual column that I want to fix is called test:Output:    Then I converted the test column into a list called  and I created a list of fruits with the correct names:I created a for loop that goes through  and get each element and returns me the closest match in fruits list. However, as I thought it would be easier to try to fix a small list first than just after my code works I could use it to fix the  list.So I created these  and .I copied some of these values of test column into the , and I created  with values of the list fruits.The way I managed to do that was:When I run this it works fine, but if I apply the same algorithm to my  list and fruits list it doesn't work, it says:  .If someone knows how to fix it or another way that I could do this it would be very helpful.
Without seeing the entire code I would guess that newTest is a float when you are using it with your data?Or that the line:The function diff may be recieving a float instead of a string, for exampleInstead of:This may be the case if your data is floats and not strings.Posting relevant parts of the actual test would aid in diagnosis.
