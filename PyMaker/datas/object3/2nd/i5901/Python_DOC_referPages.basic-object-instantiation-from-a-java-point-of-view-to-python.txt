I am trying to learn Python by porting an old Java project I did some time ago to Python.But I will present here my doubt in a more simplified way...I want to make my code as Object Oriented as possible...This is the basic doubt that I got...When I instantiate this object, I can work on procedural code in AnotherClass() and get the output from there...and I get this:How can I do the same thing but in Python... (this is my first time trying to understand OOP but in Python!)I hope an answer to my question will help another programmer that wants to learn a new language through porting!EDIT: I am currently using python 2.7....Sorry for not declaring the version...
Here's how to translate AnotherClass to pythonThere's no  in python. I assume You already know  keyword in Java,  in python do the same thing, you can access instance variables like  but  is not a reserved keyword
