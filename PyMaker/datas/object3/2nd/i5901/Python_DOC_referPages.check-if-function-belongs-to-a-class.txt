I'm trying to write a documentation testing tool which checks whether the docstrings match the actual function signature (among other things). However, I've run into a bit of a roadblock. I can't find a way to figure out whether a given function belongs to a class or not.The problem is that methods usually have  as their first parameter, and this is never documented (for obvious reasons). This would cause my tests to fail, since they'd encounter a parameter that's not documented.I would prefer to not explicitly check if the first parameter is called  and skip it, because a) nothing prevents a function from having a parameter called  and b) the name  itself is a matter of convention (so you could have a method with a first param that's called ) and my tool would fail in either case. I also can't just initialize an object and check if the function is a method, because this would fail with any class that takes required parameters in its .So the question is, is there any way I can detect if a function is a method before it is actually bound to an object? Or do I need to resign myself to just checking if the first parameter is called ?
One option is . For methods this includes the class name which you can use. This is one of the reasons why it was added:The qualified name of the class, function, method, descriptor, or generator instance.See PEP 3155's proposal for more on this attribute.Of course, since  is set during class definition, one can get false-positives when functions are dynamically added to a class. So, this answer basically covers the question of if a function has been defined in a class.So, there's no clear-cut way to detect this since, a function defined inside a class and accessed via the class and a function outside a class have no difference. (except for  in most cases). A sensible course of action would be to use the  as a "quick" check to see if a function has been defined inside a class and, if that is , fall back to checking for  with the  function and .You won't be able to cover all cases, this is Python and I can do pretty much anything I'd like. Purportedly we are all consenting adults, though. :)
