I have tried to run the give python snippet:I get the output as:As well as a tkinter windowBut when I tried to execute the snippet as given below:I get an error:My doubt is that why do I explicitly need to import font from tkinter. As you can see that I have already imported the font module using the "*" notation in line 1. Please give some example so that I can understand how this is taking place. 
 does not import everything. One way that it doesn't import everything is that it does not automatically search for submodules of a package.  is a submodule of the  package, and if it has not already been loaded by some other import,  will not find .
The answer is simple: Python doesn't automagically import all module hierarchies, just because you import the top-level one. Those who do (e.g. os, which will make os.path available) have to explicitly write code for that .Just add , and it worksHowever, as IDLE uses tkinter itself, it has already imported tkinter.font, thus you think you can get away without that import , I hope this helps : )
Modules can have submodules and/or functions, variables, etc. What gets imported by  depends on how the module was implemented.  Most modules will not automatically import submodules. In this case, tkinter is the main module, and font is a submodule, and tkinter was not designed to import all submodules automatically.  So when you do , you are grabbing all the functions and variables, but not the submodules.  The submodules must be explicitly imported to be used.  You can enter:Or you could also enter:The difference would be whether you want to use  or
