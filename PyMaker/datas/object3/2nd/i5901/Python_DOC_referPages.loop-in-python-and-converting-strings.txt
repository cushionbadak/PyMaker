I'm new to programming and I'm having a hard time understanding how to ask the user if they want to run it again?    How exactly would I add a loop that asks the user to continue or not? I'm new to programming and im very confused. I also don't understand how to add the English form of the sentence before the pig latin form??can someone please help!
you can use a  loop in your  and a string like -1 to exit
A simple solution might look something like this:You'll probably want to be a little less strict about the inputs you accept.I think it would be better practice to put this loop inside your main function (and have a check on  before invoking it), but this at least demonstrates what the loop would look like.
