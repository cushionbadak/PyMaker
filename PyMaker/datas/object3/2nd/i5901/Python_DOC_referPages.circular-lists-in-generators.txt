Propose If you  which returns . Is it possible to rewrite  to return ? Or for generality sake, is it possible to zip a list with itself for the last touple to be .
Yes, you can use  for handy iterators to accomplish this rather elegantly:Note,  works like this:It is an infinite iterator, so be careful.  here stops at the shortest, so it works fine.Also, :Which works just like  or sequence slicing, i.e.  except it works on any iterable, not just sequences.Anyway, note this approach is generalizable:


a pure python cyclic  answer can be made with a parameterized slice indexing, adding the slices
