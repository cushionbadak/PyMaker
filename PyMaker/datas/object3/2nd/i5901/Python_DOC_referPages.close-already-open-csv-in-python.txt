Is there a way for Python to close that the file is already open file.  Or at the very least display a popup that file is open or a custom written error message popup for  As to avoid:I've seen a lot of solutions that open a file then close it through python.  But in my case.  Lets say I left my csv open and then tried to run the job.  How can I make it so it closes the currently opened csv?I've tried the below variations but none seem to work as they expect that I have already opened the csv at an earlier point through python.  I suspect I'm over complicating this.This gives an error as there is no reference to opening of file but simply strings.Or even..As well as:How do I close an already open csv? The only workaround I can think of would be to add a messagebox, though I can't seem to get it to detect the file.
You can also try to copy the file to a temporary file, and open/close/remove it at will. It requires that you have read access to the original, though.In this example I have a file "test.txt" that is write-only (chmod 444) and it throws a "Permission denied" error if I try writing to it directly. I copy it to a temporary file that has "777" rights so that I can do what I want with it:
Try using a  context, which will manage the close () operation smoothly at the end of the context:
