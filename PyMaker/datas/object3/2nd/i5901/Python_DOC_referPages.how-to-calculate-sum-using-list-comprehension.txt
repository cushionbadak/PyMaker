How do I get the cumulative sum of this list using list comprehension:Here's what I tried but it prints the double of each item in the listI expect the results to be:list_comp=[1,5,14,30] But I'm getting this:
List comprehensions are for mapping or filtering of lists. They cannot have an internal state, which is what you would need to do this efficiently.However in Python 3 there is  for that:
You can do it like this, by combining slicing and a list comprehension, but it is ungainly to do a cumulative sum efficiently.I would not recommend using this, it recalculates the sum n times!A proper way to cumsum can be done like this: is another way that @NielsWerner demonstrated.Further efficiency can be found with the  library, and the  function of this library.

I would like to add one more way of achieving this if you are using Python 2:for Python 3 i recommend using built in method
