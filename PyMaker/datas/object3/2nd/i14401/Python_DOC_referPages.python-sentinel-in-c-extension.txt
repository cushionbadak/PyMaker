I'm working on a Python extension module written in C++.According to the Python documentation the module method table should be written like this:But I see that some developers write the sentinel like this:My question is the following is there a risk to use the shortened version?
A pod class initialized with  has fields not explicitly set zeroed.If  is pod (plain old data), as I suspect,  will generate the same data as .This is true in both C and C++.If the class  was a non-pod class in C++11,  could do something different than , but I strongly doubt that is the case here.The only concern I would have is if the library changed on me to make  a non-pod, and chose to make  not zero the data at the same time.  I would find that unlikely.
