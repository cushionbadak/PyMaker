Below program asks for  keyword with But, below program does not give such error when inner function  refers to  before assignment as .How do I understand/compare these two scenarios?
You are never assigning to , only to . The two concepts are not quite the same thing.The line:would rebind the name  to point to another object. The line:alters the object referenced by the name , by binding a specific index in that sequence to something else. The name  itself is never altered, so there is no ambiguity here as to what scope that name belongs in.In Python scoping, only binding operations on the name itself count. Binding operations are not just (direct) assignments, but also include function parameters, function and class definitions,  statements and targets for ,  and the target in  loops. If a name is bound to in a given scope, it is considered local, in all other cases Python looks for the name in a parent scope, with the outermost scope being .Assignments to subscriptions (using ) are not binding operations in this context.See the Naming and binding section of the Python Execution Model documentation, as well as the Short Description of the Scoping Rules? post.
