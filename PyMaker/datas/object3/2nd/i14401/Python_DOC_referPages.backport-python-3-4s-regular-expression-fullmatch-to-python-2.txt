Python 3.4 introduced the new regex method .Has anyone back-ported this new method to older Python versions?
To make sure that the entire string matches, you need to use the  end-of-string anchor:The  anchor is not necessary since  already anchors the match to the start of the string.
Here it is my backporting, which has at least one problem (thanks tim-pietzcker) but does not require recompiling regexes:And here are some test-cases proving the above emulation-function.
