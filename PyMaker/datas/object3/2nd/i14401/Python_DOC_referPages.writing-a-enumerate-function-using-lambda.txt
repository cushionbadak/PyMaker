I received this exercise:Write a function  that takes a list and returns a list of  tuples containing  for each item in the listMy problem is that I cannot insert the index and value in one or a combination of  loops. This is the code I managed to make:This is roughly the code I want to produce (must be on one line):How can I put it all one  line to get  back? The output should look like:
If you can actually index just add the value by indexing:If not  use zip and put range in the lambda:
outputs:EDIT: use  instead of  and  instead of  if you are using python3
Python's  and  functions solve this problem pretty handily.In Python 2.x, you should use , and  instead.
You could also do it recursively: returns the th  value form the list, and returns it.The only problem is that you must pass in a list:However, if you just blindly added calls to , you would't be able to replicate the functionality required without using a slice.A neat trick for bypassing this requirement is to use another lambda:
