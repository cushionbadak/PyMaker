I have a list of strings that need to be sorted in numerical order using as a int key two substrings.Obviously using the  function orders my strings alphabetically so I get 1,10,2... that is obviously not what I'm looking for.Searching around I found a key parameter can be passed to the  function, and using  should do the trick, but being my key a substring and not the whole string should lead to a cast error.Supposing my strings are something like:I want my list to be ordered in numeric order on the basis of the first integer and then on the second, so I would have:I think I could extract the integer values, sort only them keeping track of what string they belong to and then ordering the strings, but I was wondering if there's a way to do this thing in a more efficient and elegant way.Thanks in advance
Try the followingThis uses regex (the  module) to find all integers in each string, then compares the resulting lists. For example,  returns , which is then compared against other lists.
Extract the numeric parts and sort using themNow  are
