Below assignment is taken from hereQ5. Define the repeated function from Homework 2 by calling reduce with compose1 as the first argument. Add only a single expression to the starter implementation below:To complete this assignment, I would like to understand, to what does  binds to?  binds to  function
First, what should  return?A function that, when called on some arbitrary , will return .So, if you want to build that with , you'll need to return either  or .Now, look at what  does, and figure out what it's going to pass to  each time. Clearly your  argument has to either start or end with  itself. But what else do you want there to make sure you get one of the two acceptable results?And meanwhile, inside each call to  except the last, one of the two arguments has to be the  function's , while the other will be the result of another call to . (The last time, of course, they'll both be .) Figure out which of those is  and which is , and how you get  to pass the right values for each, and you've solved the problem.
