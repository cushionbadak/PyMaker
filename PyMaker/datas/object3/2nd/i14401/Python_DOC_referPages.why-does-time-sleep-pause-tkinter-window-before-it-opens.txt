I'm developing a program for a stadium and  pauses the program before the window opens instead of when I want it to. What is the explanation for this behavior?
What  does is suspend the execution of your program. If you do that 6-16 times, for 1 second each time, before ever calling , you're asking it to wait for 6-16 seconds before starting up your GUI.You probably don't understand how event loop programming works. Reading through some Tkinter tutorials should get the idea across nicely. If you want a less Tkinter-focused explanation and more information about the details of what's happening and the different ways to get around it, see Why your GUI app freezes.At any rate, I think I can guess what you want to do, even though it isn't clear from your question: You want to start the GUI up, and then, every second, replace the . To do that, you have to wait while the GUI is running, not before it starts.But you can't just call  while the GUI is running, either. The GUI can't run while your program is asleep (again, that's what  means).The easiest way out of this is to turn your loop into a sequence of function calls, each of which schedules the next one to run a second later, using the  method. For example:When you first call , it creates the initial label, asks  to call  again in 1000 milliseconds, and returns. So, a second after you start the loop, it gets called again, which creates the next label and asks  to call it again a second later. This keeps going until you decrement  all the way to , at which point you call  instead of , which ends the main loop, which ends the program.There are other things you probably want to fix about this program. For example, instead of destroying and creating a new Widget label each time, you can just change its text—or, maybe even more simply, make  an  connected to the label, so just updating  automatically changes the text. Also, for anything less trivial than this program, you'd probably want to replace the global variables with something cleaner—most Tkinter tutorials show you how to use a  subclass by about the second or third example, which gives you a convenient place to organize both widgets and member variables like .
I don't underatand your question exactly:1) You could update your wimdow in the loop to draw it to the screen... root.update() after or before time.sleep()2) If you don't want to hide your window before the mainloop is executed, use root.attributes("-alpha",0.0) to hide and root.attributes("-alpha",1.0) to show the window.
