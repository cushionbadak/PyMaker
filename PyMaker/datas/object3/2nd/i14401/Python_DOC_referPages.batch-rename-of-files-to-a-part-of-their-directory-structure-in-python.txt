First off, I'm new to Python and programming in general. The files I wish to rename are located in this format where SampleID is a unique ID: /home/MattXD/Documents/Processed/Untitled Folder/SampleID/subfolder/report.pdfI want to rename all report.pdf files to SampleID.pdfI feel I'm close to being on the right track as I can see from  and  that I am storing the correct file in  and the new name that I want to use in . I cannot seem to rename the file though! I think I am misusing shutil.copy2 and there may be an issue with my for loop as I get an error that the file names (report.pdf and report.pdf) are identical (which they are). Thanks for reading.
Well, actually there's a  function:Rename the file or directory src to dst. If dst is a directory, OSError will be raised. On Unix, if dst exists and is a file, it will be replaced silently if the user has permission. The operation may fail on some Unix flavors if src and dst are on different filesystems. If successful, the renaming will be an atomic operation (this is a POSIX requirement). On Windows, if dst already exists, OSError will be raised even if it is a file.This function can support specifying src_dir_fd and/or dst_dir_fd to supply paths relative to directory descriptors.If you want cross-platform overwriting of the destination, use replace().Availability: Unix, Windows.If you insist on using ,  is your choice.
