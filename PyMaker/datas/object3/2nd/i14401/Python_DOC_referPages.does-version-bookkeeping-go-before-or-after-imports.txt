I am hoping to use Version Bookkeeping in some python scripts I commit to Mercurial.I intend to follow the instruction in https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#version-bookkeeping but I am not sure if before any other code, separated by a blank line above and below.means before imports. Does it? I am asking because some imports seem to have to be placed at the very beginning, for example:
These lines should be included after the module's docstring, before any other code, separated by a blank line above and below.  statements are code.  You can put them inside of / statements in order to catch , and less commonly they can be used inside functions and class statements.  So this goes after the module docstring and before the imports.I am asking because some imports seem to have to be placed at the very beginning[...] statements are not (just) ordinary code.  They are understood by the compiler (as opposed to the interpreter), and have to come before you start assigning variables or importing other modules:A future statement must appear near the top of the module. The only  lines that can appear before a future statement are:the module docstring (if any),comments,blank lines, andother future statements.So, if your version control crud is a comment, you can put it before the future statements.  But if it's a real variable, it has to go after.
