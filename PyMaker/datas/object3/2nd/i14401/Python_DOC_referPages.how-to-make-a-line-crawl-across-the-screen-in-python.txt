Natural Text
What I want it to do is print   then have an animation of a line crawling across the screenInstead it prints  and then after a couple seconds, all the dashes in the line pop up at onceAny Ideas?
Output is normally line-buffered, meaning when you  part of a line, it may not get displayed until you finish ing the rest of the line.You can change the buffering, but the simpler solution is just to explicitly call  on the  stream (which  normally prints to) every time you want to force it to display what you have so far:In this case, it may also be cleaner to also use  directly on , just to make it clear that you're doing low-level I/O instead of the normal high-level  mechanism:This is explained in the docs… but only if you know where to look, and already understand most of it… explains that  is the default file that gets printed to, then  says:These streams are regular text files like those returned by the  function. Their parameters are chosen as follows: … When interactive, standard streams are line-buffered … You can override this value with the -u command-line option.If you follow the link to , it says:Force the binary layer of the  and  streams (which is available as their  attribute) to be unbuffered. The text I/O layer will still be line-buffered if writing to the console…Then you have to follow a few links from  or text files to get to  and read almost the entire module documentation to figure out how to access and rewrap  or just call .
Seems like you are wanting to display some kind of "progress" to your user.I recommend you use something like progressExample:You do have to install this 3rd-party package hwoever as it's not part of the standard library. Typically this as as simple as:
