However, I know that there are other unicode prefixes for the larger codepoints (such as )I have seen the uppercase  being used such as  and i have also seen  being used.  My question is when do i use those.  For instance many emoji are just given as . And my thought is to use a capital  and fill in 12  before those digits but when do I use an  and when do I know to use leading zeros (and how many)All of this is me guessing because I can't find any documentation.
