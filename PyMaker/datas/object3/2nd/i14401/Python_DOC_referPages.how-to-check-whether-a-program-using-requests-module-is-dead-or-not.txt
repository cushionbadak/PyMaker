I am trying to using python download a batch of files, and I use requests module with stream turned on, in other words, I retrieve each file in 200K blocks. However, sometimes, the downloading may stop as it just gets stuck (no response) and there is no error. I guess this is because the connection between my computer and server was not stable enough. Here is my question, how to check this kind of stop and make a new connection? 
You probably don't want to detect this from outside, when you can just use timeouts to have  fail instead of stopping is the server stops sending bytes.Since you didn't show us your code, it's hard to show you how to change itâ€¦ but I'll show you how to change some other code:If you do want to detect it from outside for some reason, you'll need to use  or similar to move the -driven code to a child process. Ideally you'll want it to post updates on some  or set and notify some -protected shared flag variable every 200KB, then the main process can block on the  or  and  the child process if it times out. For example (pseudocode):
