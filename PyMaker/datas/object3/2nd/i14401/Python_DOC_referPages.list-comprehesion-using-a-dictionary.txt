I have this dictionary:And I wanted to create a list with only the pair that are True. It would look like this:So I tried doing it this way:But I get the error: What am I doing wrong?

To get those, you call  to return an iterable of key/value pairs, which can then be unpacked into the names  and .1Note that this answer is in regard to Python 3.x.

You can iterate over , and store off the  if the  is
