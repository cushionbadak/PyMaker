I have the following error when I try to split a string into two values.Error: builtins.ValueError: need more than 1 value to unpackWhen I debug, it shows that the first  statement is still true, even when there is no space in the string. I am wondering why is it not going into the second  statement.
 will always be  because it's the empty string. The empty string is always going to be in every single possible string, just like the empty set is a subset of every set. You probably mean to check for  which is a single space character. A better approach would be to split the string on whitespace and check the length of the list to determine if you have two items. For example:This is the method where you look before you leap (LBYL).And this is an alternative method where you ask for forgiveness rather than permission (EAFP).By the way, I took out the calls to , because using  takes care of that for you.
 is the empty string. Asking  is like asking whether you can make room in your daily schedule for something that takes zero time. Of course you can. Always. Ask  instead.
use else: instead of second if. should be
