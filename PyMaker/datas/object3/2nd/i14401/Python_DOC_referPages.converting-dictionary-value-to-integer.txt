I'm having issues converting some numbers from strings to integers. Here is the function in question:And traceback:I'm slightly out of my depth, however I know that  is a value that should be able to be converted to an integer ()What I've tried: I've tried converting the value in the list of strings before its added to the dictionary and I've had the same result. I've also tried using dict comprehension but that seems to cause issues when I use the value later.Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks.
You are assigning dictinary values in the wrong way. It should beWraping up things in  will creates sets in python3TestEditIf you are trying to assign integer values to the dictionary keys, it must be done at the time of assignment like
Because you added  around your  it makes it a set. If you remove the s it should work.Also as stated one of the comments above you actually need to save the value after you turn it to an int. Just calling  won't actually save the number. Try something like  if you want your dictionary to have integers instead of strings.
