As explained in Inheritance in the tutorial, this:… makes  inherit from .You can inherit from 1 class, 2 classes, or 20 classes:But you can't inherit from no classes. You can write a  statement with no base class names, but that means you're inheriting from the universal base class, .So, all three of these are identical:(However, this is only true for Python 3.0 and later. In 2.x, the first two actually create an "old-style" or "classic" class instead of a normal class.)If you look at your class with  or the  module, you'll see that it's got a whole bunch of things you didn't define anywhere—a  method, a  string, and so on. A few of these are filled in automatically by the  statement, but most of them are inherited from `object.
The parentheses at the end of a class declaration indicate it is inheriting from another class.Consider:Then we can do:But this will fail:
