I'm trying to set up the below code to ask the user to enter two integers (num_sides & num_rolls). If the user doesn't enter an integer for either input, then the code should print the statement "Enter  an integer".I find this code only tests the num_sides but doesn't test if num_rolls is an integer. What's going on here?Thanks in advance for your help!
Why do you have a nested loop? (Two  one inside the other one)The following code is simpler and should work:If both  evaluate and do not crash then  is executed and you can leave the loop.As it is a function, you might want to return  at the end of the function so they aren't lost. (You could also replace the  with the , which will effectively stop the function too at the same time)Unless this is only the beginning of your code, then never mind what I just said. :)
You can just cast  and check for a :
