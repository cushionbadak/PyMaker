Recently, I'm beginner in python, and I've programmed an analog clock on Tkinter, which can display time every second. But this clock uses a  infinite loop to refresh the time, that totally blocks the rest of the program. Because I want to use it in an another program, as a parallel function, I had to reprogram the refreshing method.I've found something about the  function which can (I think) help me, but I get a  and I don't understand why. Is the drawing of my clock too heavy for python? I'll put the code here and hope someone understand my problem and can help me.(PS 1: I don't take care about the code before "principle function" and I don't think the problem is there, but I'll still post it because I'm not sure at all that this part is debugged.PS 2: I'm really sorry about my English which may be a problem, so tell me if you don't understand.)
The problem is that in the principle function,  calls itself immediately while trying to arrange for it to be called again after the specified 1 second delay. This occurs in the last line:A simple way prevent this, would be to use something like this instead:What this does is create an anonymous function using a  expression . The function created accepts/requires no arguments, and all it does is call  when it's called. That function is what is then passed to  as the second argument. The notable thing is that doing this does not actually call  in the process. The second argument to  should almost always be a callable — such as a function or a bound method — rather than the results of calling one, as you are doing.After making the change, you should see something like this with moving clock hands on it:
