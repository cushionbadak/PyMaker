I'm trying to uncompress a file from www.dukascopy.com using lzma (files seems to be binary, it's in their .bi5 format). It's forex data for the EUR/USD pair. Excuse me, but I'm not very familiar with how to read binary files. Did I decompress it right? If so, how should I convert my resulting data that I have decompressed.Test file:https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11283578/00h_ticks.bi5My test code:Which prints:
You can iteratively decompress the file without reading it entirely into memory like this:Example:We can then confirm and verify the output by comparing a download of the file and decompression with the  command line tool:Output:Since I don't have local access to the same file as you nor do I have the same environment the above example downloads the file you put on Dropbox and decompresses it iteratively with Python 3.4 and the  library/class.
