Natural Text
I am having issues converting a text file to a python dictionary. Fortunately, the text file has a ":" that divides my future key with its value. For example, every row is structured like this "-Project Manager: John Caldwell". Id like to loop through a directory that contains numerous text files. In the process id like to strip away a '-' that each row has. Here is the code that i have so far:This is what i get when i run the script
The problem is that  isn't a list of files, it's just a string. So,  gives you , then , then , and so on. None of those end in , so you don't open any files or do anything else.What you want is probably .Or, if you want to open all files in that directory or any subdirectories (recursively), use  (see the linked docs for sample code).As bgporter points out, if the only reason you're calling  is to then check each filename against a pattern, you may want to use  to skip the need for the  test.
