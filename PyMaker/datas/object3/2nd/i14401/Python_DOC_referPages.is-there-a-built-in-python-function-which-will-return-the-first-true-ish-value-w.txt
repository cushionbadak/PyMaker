Here's the functionality I mean, and I do it pretty frequently so maybe I'm just reimplementing a built-in that I haven't seen:Does Python let me do this with built-ins?
You essentially want to map  on the sequence, and get the first true-ish value. For that, you can use  with the default filter function that does exactly that, and get the first of that using :In Python 3, all these things are lazy, so the whole sequence isnâ€™t iterated. In Python 2, you can use  to get the lazy versions of the builtins,  and 
you can use  builtin and generator expression:if you want to use predefined function, it might be better to use filter, which accepts function as the first argument (lambda in example):
I don't think there's a built in function to do what you want. There is an arguably more Pythonic way of doing what you're doing:The downside of this method is that it will iterate through the whole list, instead of breaking out at the first value. You also have to add extra checks to make sure the list isn't empty.
