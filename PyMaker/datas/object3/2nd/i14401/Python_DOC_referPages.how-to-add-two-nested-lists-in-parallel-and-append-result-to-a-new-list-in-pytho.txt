I'm trying to add all the elements of two unequal nested lists in parallel and append the result back to another new list, i've written a little hacky code that could add them but there's a lot of things wrong with the code, first i tried to make the pairs equal by appending 0's to the end of the list but the code still runs into the problems since the length of the first pair is 3 and the length of the second pair is 4, i also tried using map but i couldn't add an integer and a NoneType,the final result should be like this
You can simply use  and fill-in with , like thisThis would would work even if  and  have unequal number of elements,Note that, when we   and , we use  as . And when we   and  we use  as the .So, if the number of lists in  and  are not equal, then  will be used fill-in and when the number of elements in  and  are not equal,  will be used as the fill-in.
You can use  in  to get ride of checking for validations then use  function for sum the zipped items:Note that if you want to iterate over the result you don't have to use  (its just for demonstrating the result).
 is very helpful here:The fill value pads the list or sublist with the given value. In our case a new list with  for the outer loop and  for the inner loop.Writing this a nested list comprehension does the same but may take more time to read and understand the code. Using more lines can make reading and understanding faster. Of course, this depends very much on the person reading the code.
