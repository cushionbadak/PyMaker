I'm attempting to build a class representation of a matrix complete with most of the normal mathematical operations. I've hit a snag with the scalar multiplication operation.The relevant part of the code is as follows:The standard way the scalar multiplication is expressed is cA where c is a scalar and A is a matrix, so  in Python. However, this fails with a  while  runs as expected (note the ). Thus I conclude that the * operand is defined for  and .What is this magic and how can I replicate the behavior?
You need a  in your calss. For example if you addthen:As in the docs, the are called to implement the binary arithmetic operations with reflected (swapped) operands. These functions are only called if the left operand does not support the corresponding operation and the operands are of different types.
