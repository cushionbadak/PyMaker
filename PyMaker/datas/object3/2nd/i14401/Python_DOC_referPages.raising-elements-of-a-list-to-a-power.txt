Example:UPD: you should also consider reading about  function of  lib: https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/math.html
Nobody has mentioned  and  and the accepted answer does not mention , but for the sake of completeness I am posting this solution:I would use a list comprehension myself as suggested, but I think  is a very cool function that deserves to be shared. I stole my answer from @sven-marnach here by the way.
Another  pattern, using  instead of :
Actually your script do what you want, and that is the result (keep in mind that you are applying the power function to [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9])('Cubic list:', [1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729])Your problem is that you also modified the original list, due to the nature on the list type in python. If you want to keep also your original list you should pass a copy of it to your function. You can do it like this
Use a list comprehension for some increased speed:
You can simply do:
