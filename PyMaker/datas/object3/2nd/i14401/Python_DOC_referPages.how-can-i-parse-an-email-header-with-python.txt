Here's an example email header,The header is stored as a string, how do I parse this header, so that i can map it to a dictionary as the header fields be the key and the values be the values in the dictionary?I want a dictionary like this,I made a list of fields required, This can list items can likely be the keys for the dictionary.
you can split string on newline, then split each line on ":" 
Split into individual lines then split each line once on Output: makes sure we only split once on  so if there are any  in the values we won't end up splitting that also. You end up with sublists that are key/value pairings so calling  creates the  create from each pairing. 
 will work for you:Demo:output:
