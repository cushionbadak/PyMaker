I have a script that writes a file to disk and then needs to upload it to a remote server using psftp. based on some of answers I have seen on this site I have a basic idea of what I want to do but because:My code is written in Python 3.xMy code uses a mix of strings and variables in the commandsI have not been successful. here is my code ( after setting up the variables)the code compiles but the file does not get uploaded1) What am I doing wrong ? :-)2) How can I see if a connection is made and what command actually goes through ?3) Is this the best way to call psftp or perhapes I should write a batch file on the fly each time and use the "-b" flag to call it ?Note. I cannot use any libraries that do not come with the standard Python distro in my code. So I have to use psftp.referenced answers:Can i control PSFTP from a Python script?formatting strings for stdin.write() in python 3.xTIA
Drop . If  accept a command on its stdin and you want to get its output as a bytestring then you could use :It raises an exception if  returns a non-zero exit status (It usually means an error).
