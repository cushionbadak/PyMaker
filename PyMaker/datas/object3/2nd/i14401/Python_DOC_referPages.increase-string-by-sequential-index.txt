In a file dealing with climatological variables involving a running mean with hours, the hours progress in sequence. Is there a / command that would take that hour (string) in the file and then change it by two, so next time the file is read its (202) and so on to (204) etc...See the number being added to 'i' below. My goal is to increase the number in this case, 569, by one each time the file runs through other commands involved in processing the data. The next desired number next to i would be after that... If there isn't a sed/awk command to do such a thing, is there such a thing in any other method?Thank you for any answers. 
Here is an alternative using awk:Starting with this file:We can use the awk command to create a new file:To overwrite the original file with the new one, use:How it worksThis looks for lines that start with  and, on those lines, the fifth field is incremented by 2.This is awk's cryptic shorthand for print the line.
You can definitely do this in Python (or Perl, Ruby, or whatever other scripting language you like, but you included a Python tag). For example:Hopefully the regex itself is trivial to understand:Debuggex DemoThe  function can take a to be applied to the match object instead of a string as the "replacement". So, lines that don't match will be printed unchanged; lines that do will have the match substituted for the same two parts, but with the second part replaced by
