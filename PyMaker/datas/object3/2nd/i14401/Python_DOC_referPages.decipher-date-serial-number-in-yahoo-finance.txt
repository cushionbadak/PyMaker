I need help deciphering the date number at the end of this url: view-source:http://finance.yahoo.com/q/op?s=XOM&date=1434672000 -- it doesn't look like a proleptic Gregorian serial number, but in Yahoo it designates June 19, 2015. My goal is to write a Python code segment that will create a valid Yahoo date number from my input of yyyymmdd, so that I can generate a valid url for any stock ticker symbol (not just XOM) and option expiration date expressed as yyyymmdd. Thanks!
