I am developing a GUI with PyQt, and I'd like to use the PyQt resource system to keep track of my resources (images, templates, etc). I'm trying to find a way that I can get the absolute path to my resources so that I can load them with non-PyQt classes. For instance, I would like to be able to get the path to a resource image and plot it with matplotlib, e.g.Does anyone know if the PyQt resource system supports this kind of use, or will I just have to manage my resources some other way?
You should read this doc about the Qt resource system. Basically you construct a .qrc XML file and use pyrcc5 executable to convert that into a python module you can import.Once you have your python module you can do stuff like  for reading the contents, or use  directly since you want to work with images. Additionally, notice that your files are in memory so you can't access them in non-Qt classes with a path, which is why you need to read the data from memory instead. Load your image data into a buffer and read it into your matplotlib classes.From the matplotlib.image.imread doc:fname may be a string path or a Python file-like object.  If  using a file object, it must be opened in binary mode.Therefore you should be able to wrap your data in a  object.
