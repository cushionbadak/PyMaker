Unless I'm mistaken, a range can only include unique numbers. So, a number could be in it or not. I guess only if we want to pass a range as one of many accepted types (dynamic) to some function would it make sense.However, it seems like if it would go over the whole range to count a number it would be very inefficient.I tried to time it compared to "", but on my machine it seems they have the same timing. Can that be right?
Because  objects conform to the  ABC, and that ABC has a  method.In other words, it is there for completeness sake, so that the object qualifies as a sequence.It doesn't have to go across the whole range as it is easy enough to calculate if the number is part of the sequence, see Why is `1000000000000000 in range(1000000000000001)` so fast?
