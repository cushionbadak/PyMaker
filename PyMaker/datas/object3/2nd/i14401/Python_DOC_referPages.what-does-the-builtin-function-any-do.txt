I did some google searching on how to check if a string has any elements of a list in it and I found this bit of code that works:I know this works, but I don't really know why.  Could you share some insight?
As the docs for  say:Return  if any element of the iterable is true. If the iterable is empty, return . Equivalent to:So, this is equivalent to:â€¦ which is itself effectively equivalent to:If you don't understand the last part, first read the tutorial section on list comprehensions, then skip ahead to iterators, generators, and generator expressions.If you want to really break it down, you can do this:That still isn't exactly the same, because a generator expression builds a generator, not a list, but it should be enough to get you going until you read the tutorial sections.But meanwhile, the point of having  and comprehensions and so on is that you can almost read them as plain English:
This produces an iterable of booleans indicating whether each item in  is in . Then you check whether any item in this iterable of bools is true.In effect, you're checking whether any of the items in the list are substrings of .
What's going on here with:is best explained by illustrating:If you read the  documentaiton you'll note: Return True if any element of the iterable is true.  If the iterable is empty, return False. Equivalent to:The list comprehension should be more obvious as it constructs a list of  for each element of .Basically (in English) you are returning any match where each sub-string exists in the search string (haystack).It's important to note as well that  will short circuit and end on the first (ish) value it finds.  can be implement in pure Python like this:
