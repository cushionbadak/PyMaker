I have a Python package that includes , , , , and  subdirectories with binaries for the appropriate platforms, which I call through the Python file . When I run , the generated wheel does not include the files in those subdirectories, only the Python file. How can I get these included in the wheel?Note: I'm aware 1) that the  flag is meant for Python-only packages and 2) that I should be creating separate wheels for each platform. However, I don't have access to Windows or Linux computers for development, and there is no naming convention for Linux-specific wheels.The contents of  can be found here.
Well, the first issue is that your project doesn't follow the expected layout, so you need to call  with the  argument in addition to the  and  arguments (See installing package data).However, the files you're trying to include aren't really package data, so you probably don't want to add them to  like you currently are.  interprets paths relative to your packages, not relative to the project root. Instead, use  so you can provide paths relative to your setup.py file.
