Say you have a  object such as that returned by .Then later on you also get a string representing the time that complements the date object.What is a pythonic way of combining these two in a datetime.datetime object? More specifically, can I avoid converting the date object to a string? This is how I get it done for now:EDIT:I looked into  as the first answer describes, but I am a bit at loss with getting the time string into a time object:
If you just read the docs for , or look at the  in the interactive interpreter, you'll see the  method:classmethod Return a new  object whose date components are equal to the given  object’s, and whose time components and  attributes are equal to the given  object’s. For any  object d, . If date is a  object, its time components and  attributes are ignored.So, you don't have to write the method yourself; it's already there in the module.Of course you need to parse that  into a  object, but you clearly already know how to do that.But if you did want to write it yourself, formatting the date and time as strings just to parse them back out would be silly. Why not just access the attributes directly?
