What I want to do is very simple but I can't figure out a good and not too complex solution for this. Basically I want to define some global variables that will be used for example as a folder name And what I want is to set the foldername value as input when running the script, something like:so when running my script, the folder will become C:\TEMP\somebeautifulfoldername
You can pass arguments to Python script like following:And this is what you get In your case:
You can use the built-in  module for this combined with getting the command line arguments from :Here I added just a very simple argument with some basic help string, but you can do quite a lot with this like giving a default value, allowing a list of files instead of a single file, specify the type, ... . See the manual for more details and examples.Usage:
If you run it the way you want:It will give: HELLOFOLDER
There are a number of options to parse command line arguments into a Python script. There's the standard library's optparse and argparse for instance.A really nice 3rd party tool is docopt, which allows you to write the logic described above very easily by describing the script usage directly as documentation of your script like this:That said, you may also want to look into tempfile for generating temporary files to make the script more cross-platform. Hard-coding Windows-specific paths is rarely a good idea.
