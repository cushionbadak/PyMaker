I have a problem that I want to solve with itertools.imap(). However, after I imported itertools in IDLE shell and called itertools.imap(), the IDLE shell told me that itertools doesn't have attribute imap. What's going wrong?
 is in Python 2, but not in Python 3.Actually, that function was moved to just the  function in Python 3 and if you want to use the old Python 2 map, you must use .
If you want something that works in both Python 3 and Python 2, you can do something like:
You are using Python 3, therefore there is no  function in  module. It was removed, because global function  now returns iterators.
How about this?In fact!! :)
I like the  idoms for universal Python 2/3 code, like this:You then have to refactor your code to use  everywhere you were using  before:You do need to install future for this to work on both 2 and 3:
You can use the 2to3 script (https://docs.python.org/2/library/2to3.html) which is part of every Python installation to translate your program or whole projects from Python 2 to Python 3.(-w option writes modifications to file, a backup is stored)
