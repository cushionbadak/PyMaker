I want to get the parent of current directory from Python script. For example I launch the script from  the desire path in this case is I know  from . But I don't want to parse  resulting string. Is there any another way to get parent of current directory in Python?
Using os.pathTo get the parent directory of the directory containing the script (regardless of the current working directory), you'll need to use .Inside the script use  to obtain the absolute path of the script, and call  twice:Basically, you can walk up the directory tree by calling  as many times as needed. Example:If you want to get the parent directory of the current working directory, use :Using pathlibYou could also use the  module (available in Python 3.4 or newer).Each  instance have the  attribute referring to the parent directory, as well as the  attribute, which is a list of ancestors of the path.  may be used to obtain the absolute path. It also resolves all symlinks, but you may use  instead if that isn't a desired behaviour. and  represent the script path and the current working directory respectively, therefore in order to get the parent directory of the script directory (regardless of the current working directory) you would useand to get the parent directory of the current working directoryNote that  is a  instance, which isn't always handy. You can convert it to  easily when you need it:
This worked for me (I am on Ubuntu):

You can use  from the  module:You can use multiple calls to  to go further in the path:

 returns parent of current directory.Now your current directory will be .
You can simply useFor example suppose the path to your python script is . To refer to  located in . You simply need to refer to it as
