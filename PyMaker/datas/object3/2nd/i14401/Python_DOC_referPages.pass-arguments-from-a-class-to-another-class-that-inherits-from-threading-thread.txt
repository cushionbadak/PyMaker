I have two class in my python code. The class  must to send two parameters to the class  but if I send them by the costructor I never call the costructor for the thread metod . This is my code:and this is my output:I run the script in this way:What's the best method for send the parameters from a derivated class to a base class?
You need to call 's . Usually we use  for that.In your case you'll want to do:The general pattern is to have each class accept certain arguments, and pass any other arguments off to its parents'  methods.I'd also urge you to use some sort of argument parsing module rather than trying to handle it yourself. Depending on your version of Python,  is in the stdlib from 3.2+.
