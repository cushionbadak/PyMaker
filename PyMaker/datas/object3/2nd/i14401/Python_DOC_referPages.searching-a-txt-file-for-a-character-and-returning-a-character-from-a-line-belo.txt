No need for splitlines, then file will be a iterator:You can do something like:when called with file:This is assuming you want the line with the string 'Sale' on it, if you want 2 lines after then:
You want the next two lines right this gives the next two lines after the match Output:By using enumerator :output:
Here you can find two solution, the second is more pythonic. Both functions takes as parameters the , the second is the offset between the Customer ID line and the desired line to return and the last is the input file. If the id doesn't exist, the function return .If you don't need to pass the offset to the function, you can remove-it and declare inside of functionInput file
