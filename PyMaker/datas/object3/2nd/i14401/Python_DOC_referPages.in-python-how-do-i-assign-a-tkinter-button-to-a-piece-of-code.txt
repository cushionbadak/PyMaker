I cannot work out the code for this and I was wondering if any of you do. I want to assign a button in a tkinter menu to a defined function in another piece of Python code (Or to have some way of linking them). I have tried numerous different websites but I cannot find it easily.websites I have tried:-https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html-www.tutorialspoint.com/python/tk_button.htm
This is the first result I get in google:As you can see,  is used to assign a callback function to run when the user clicks the button.
