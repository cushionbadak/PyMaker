This question already has an answer here:Equation parsing in Python                    7 answers                I want to use a string of a polynomial in a lambda expression, but I couldn't figure out how to do it. It may not be possible, but if it is I'd love some help!An example of what I'm trying to do is:Assume that I only have access to the polynomial in type str.Is there something that removes the quotes or a version of eval that works with variables?
Do you want to avoid using eval? Otherwise you can just do:In Python  is a bitwise operator, so it needs to be replaced by the  operator.Also check out the SymPy package.
Instead of a  you can use np.polyval from If you meant  then a quick fixor with lambda
