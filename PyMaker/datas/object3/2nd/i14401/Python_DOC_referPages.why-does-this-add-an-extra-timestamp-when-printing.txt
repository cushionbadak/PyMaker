I use below code add timestamp into print. but it is strange why it add two timestamp around message.  When I . it output as below.  Before and after , there are two timestamp.why is this? I only want to add timestamp before . 
It's due to the fact that the  statement or function performs two calls to , one to print the message () and one for the ending newline or space.You can see this using a script like the following:Called results in:Note: and  are the arguments for the two calls performed when doing . and  are the arguments for the two calls performed when doing , , , ,  and  are the arguments performed when doing .An other way of seeing this is by using exceptions:Note: the  was still printed even though the  raised an exception. What python is doing is taking each single portion of the stuff to print, evaluating it and then calling . Afterwards it calls  to print the space due to the comma and finally evaluates  which results in an exception.In the same way  first evaluates , then calls  and finally calls  to add the final newline.If you want to propoerly attach a timestamp to messages you should use the  module instead.
Base on @Bakuriu answer, I am using below code to achieve my object as I am confident that I will not use "\n" in print message. :). I post here if others are also interesting.
