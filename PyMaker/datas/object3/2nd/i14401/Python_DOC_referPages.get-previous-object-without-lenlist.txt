How to get previous or next object with this format of code?I know how to do that with:
You can use  :Note that as a more efficient way for accessing to  items and refuse of multiple indexing you can use  function to create an iterator object from your list (from second element to end) and access to   next elements in each iteration with  :Note that if you don't pass the  as the second argument to  function it will raise a  error.You can also handle it with a  statement.Also for short lists you can use  function and for long lists  function ( in python 3): will give you the following pairs of items :and in the loop you can use  as the current item then  will be the next item or use  as the current then  will be the previous!:)
There are many different options depending on what your use for the neighbour entry is. For instance, if you only want to process pairs, and not modify the list:Or if you need to keep the prior entry as a reference: here is used in place of a prior item for the first, similar to how it's used for the next item after the last in Kasra's iter()-based example. 
The loop will give the index and object the previous object can be accessed by the (current index - 1) whereas the next by (current index + 1)
