According to the http.server documentation BaseHTTPRequestHandler can handle POST requests.class http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler(request, client_address,  server)¶ This class is used to handle the HTTP requests that arrive at  the server. By itself, it cannot respond to any actual HTTP requests;  it must be subclassed to handle each request method (e.g. GET or  POST). BaseHTTPRequestHandler provides a number of class and instance variables, and methods for use by subclasses.However, down below it says:do_POST() This method serves the 'POST' request type, only allowed for  CGI scripts. Error 501, “Can only POST to CGI scripts”, is output when  trying to POST to a non-CGI url.What does this part of the documentation mean? Isn't that contradicting itself or am I misunderstanding something?EDIT: To clarify, the following method I tried seems to work, I'd just like to know what the documentation of do_POST means.
CGIHTTPRequestHandler IS a subclass of SimpleHTTPRequestHandler, which is a subclass of BaseHTTPRequestHandler (I found this out by looking at the source code for SimpleHTTPServer.py and CGIHTTPServer.py). This part below:do_POST() This method serves the 'POST' request type, only allowed for CGI scripts. Error 501, “Can only POST to CGI scripts”, is output when trying to POST to a non-CGI url.Refers to CGIHTTPRequestHandler, not BaseHTTPRequestHandler! See:http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandlerCGIHTTPRequestHandler
 as documented is a method of . Its default behavior does not affect  in any way.
