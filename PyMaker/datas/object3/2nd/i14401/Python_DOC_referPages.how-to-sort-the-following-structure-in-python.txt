You don't need to sort the list if you only need to get one value. Use the built-in  function with custom ordering function like thisor evenThe latter code will work as well, because sequence objects may be compared to other objects with the same sequence type:The comparison uses lexicographical ordering: first the first two  items are compared, and if they differ this determines the outcome of  the comparison; if they are equal, the next two items are compared,  and so on, until either sequence is exhausted. If all items of  two sequences compare equal, the sequences are considered equal.
