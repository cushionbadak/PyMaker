I wrote a python script to search all  file in the current folder, and write their names in a file for later processing.However I only get an empty file, even if I have a  in my folder.Here's my code:
open file via "with":
 doesn't do such pattern matching. Assuming  is a string, just useBut for gods sake, don't call a string variable .Or to check for multiple endings at once (thanks @msvalkon for the reminder):And you could use Python's  module which does come with such pattern functionality:
file writes should be done like this:but you probably also have a problem with so your code would beAnd now the nice version:
You can simply use the built in  module which does exactly what you want: searches for files that match a certain pattern. If you use what I wrote it will search for files in the current directory which have  or  file extensionsNote the use of a context manager () instead of  and . This is more pythonic.Also, I used  joining to skip the  loop.
What  is doing is asking "is  a substring of "?  That is not a glob-matching operation.The simplest solution is probably to use  instead of .
modified the answer of Rain Lee a bit.1st) define a function:2nd) call that function and put the results in a list:3rd) you could display it
