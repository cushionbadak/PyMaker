Given the modelsOn the OPERATION model, i overrode the  function to change the Book quantity by executing the  function on Book's model(at least that was the intention).The logic that determines if the inventory_quantity should add or subtract is in this function, is that the right way to do it?Also, I know my code is extremely wrong on terms of how Python deals with objects, when I save an operation on admin panel I get , why? It seems that i'm passing only Thanks for the help
I'm not exactly clear on why you're overriding , but you should make the  call last there, since it's what does the actual saving of the instance data.Re "takes exactly 2 arguments (3 given)", the definition of the  method in the  class should take  as its first argument. All Python method calls automatically are passed the instance itself as the first method parameter. See the Python docs for more: "the method function is declared with an explicit first argument representing the object, which is provided implicitly by the call..."(Also, you don't show us where  is defined so we can't be sure what it is -- from reading your code it seems it should be  instead.)
