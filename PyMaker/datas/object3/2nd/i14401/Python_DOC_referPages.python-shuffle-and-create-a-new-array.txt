People here are advising deepcopy, which is surely an overkill. You probably don't mind the objects in your list being same, you just want to shuffle their order. For that, list provides shallow copying directly.About your misconception: please read http://nedbatchelder.com/text/names.html#no_copies
Use  to create a copy of the array, shuffle the copy.
Have a look : Immutable vs Mutable types. This is the reason behind why you need an extra function to create copy of the list
You need to make a copy of the list, by default python only creates pointers to the same object when you write:But instead use this or the copy method mentioned by Veky. It will make a copy of the list.
Use a slice to make a shallow copy, then shuffle the copy:
