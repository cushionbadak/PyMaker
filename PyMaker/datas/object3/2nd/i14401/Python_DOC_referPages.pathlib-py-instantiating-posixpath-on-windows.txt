I cloned thefuck source code from its repository. Tried to install it for development by the following commands:It worked fine. Afterwards tried to run tests by:Got the following errors:I suspect that this tool is written to only work on Linux and unix-like command lines. What is the reason for this error? And if it's a part of python library that is not implemented for Windows, are there any quick fixes?I want to start working on open source projects to become a better developer. Using Linux for my development tasks is not a problem. It would help me if I knew the opinions of more experienced developers about this. 
The reason for this error is, that on Windows,  is not implemented. But there is , which you can use wherever you want to use  for platform independent handling of POSIX paths. Alternatively, it might be possible that instead you actually want to have platform dependent paths (that is  on Linux and  on Windows), in which case you should just use .From the documentation (below the inheritance diagram):Pure paths are useful in some special cases; for example:If you want to manipulate Windows paths on a Unix machine (or vice versa). You cannot instantiate a WindowsPath when running on  Unix, but you can instantiate PureWindowsPath.
