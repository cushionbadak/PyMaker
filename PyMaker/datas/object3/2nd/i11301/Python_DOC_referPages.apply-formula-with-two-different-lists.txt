I have two lists like this:I have to apply this formula in the lists:The 'n' is the elements of listA, 'x' is the elements that correspond to the same index of 'n' in listB.I need to apply this formula to all the elements in both list. So that when the loop runs the first time it needs to do this:For the second this, it needs to do this:And it repeats until the end of both lists.I know I have to use a 'for' loop, but my problem is that I don't know how to get the elements from the second list. I'm trying to do this:Inside thhe brackets it should be the elements from listB but I don't know how to get them, and they need to have the same index as the element from listA.The output should be a third list with the result of each formula applied.I have tried to explained myself the best way possible, but if you don't understand my question feel free to ask any question. Thanks in advance.
I assume both lists have the same size all the time, most pythonic way is to use lambda and list comprehensions:
You can  them:will yield
numpy vectorized approach will be much faster compared to regular for/list comprehension/etc. especially on big lists:Output:Timing and comparison on two 1M lists:Vectorized numpy approach:List comprehension:Conclusion: vectorized approach is 55 times faster
This code for first formula:Output:
