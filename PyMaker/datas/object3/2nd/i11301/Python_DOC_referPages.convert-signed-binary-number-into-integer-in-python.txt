I found out that in python, if you use :but if you try this:  in fact, when right shift more than 3 bits, the answer is always . I know this is implementation stuff, but I came across this problem:In the following array, find out the number which appears only once, while others appears always three timesThis is the codethe answer should be , but instead I get ; how can I convert it into -4?
Bit manipulation on Python are easily done with int.from_bytes and int.to_bytes.On the other hand, solving the "find the value appearing  times" is easily solved using the  class:Using  and  is clear and readable, so you don't want to try to do the conversion yourself.Using  is also more readable than your cryptic implementation, yet my one-liner may not be the most readable imaginable version, it's still a single line and far more readeable.
