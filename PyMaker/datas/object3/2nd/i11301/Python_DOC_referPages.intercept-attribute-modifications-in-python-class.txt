I want to implement a class in Python where modifying a subset of its attributes leads to a specific class method being called. I see that Python offers many ways to achieve something what I want but I'm not sure which is the most Pythonic and minimalistic way to achieve this.For instance, let's say we have class  with attributes , , , and we're interested in intercepting modifications to attributes  and . Whenever someone calls  or , I want method  to be called. Also, I don't really care if I have to use a wrapper for each attribute, provided that this wrapper would have to be written only once, e.g. somehow intercept calls to virtually non-existent methods  and  to .
This is actually pretty easy with the new classes in Python, built on top of the  class :
