I am having an issue with iterating over a list of callables in python. The callables are supposed to be called on a generator of strings. The current behaviour is that the last callable in the list is called as many times as there are callables in the list. My current code:In the above code strings is initially of type 'Generator'. I have also tried the following:This has not worked either, but when I don't loop over the callables and simply call them it works just fine:This seems strange to me as the above should be equivalent to the for loop.Thanks in advance for your help and suggestions :).
This doesn't actually call your callable. It creates a generator expression that will call  later, using whatever  happens to be later.After the loop,  is the final callable. When you try to retrieve an element from , all those nested genexps look up  to compute a value, and they all find the last callable.You could fix this by using  instead of a genexp:
