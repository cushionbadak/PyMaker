I am trying to set up an app where users can download their files stored in an S3 Bucket. I am able to set up my bucket, and get the correct file, but it won't download, giving me the this error:  Any idea why? This seems like a relatively easy problem, but I can't quite seem to get it. I can delete an image properly, so it is able to identify the correct image.Here's my views.py
The problem is that you are downloading to a local directory that doesn't exist (). You need to either:Create the directory on the local machine firstJust use the filename rather than a full pathUse the full path, but replace slashes () with another character -- this will ensure uniqueness of filename without having to create directoriesThe last option could be achieved via:See also: Boto3 to download all files from a S3 Bucket
Downloading files using boto3 is very simple, configure your AWS credentials at system level before using this code.replace is to locate the file in your local with s3 file name, if you don't replace it will try to save as 'test/abc.txt'.
