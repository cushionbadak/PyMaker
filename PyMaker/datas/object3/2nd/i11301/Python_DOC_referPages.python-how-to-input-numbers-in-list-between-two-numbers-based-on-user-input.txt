This gives me a syntax error. I can't even use Any way I can use something like list slicing to input numbers into a list?
That is not the correct way to generate a list. If you want a list of numbers based on input you can use this:You might want to read up on  and .
if my comment is the case, you can append items in your list, based on range as follows:for rounding digits:round(number[, ndigits]) Return the floating point value number  rounded to ndigits digits after the decimal point. If ndigits is  omitted, it defaults to zero. The result is a floating point number.  Values are rounded to the closest multiple of 10 to the power minus  ndigits; if two multiples are equally close, rounding is done away  from 0 (so, for example, round(0.5) is 1.0 and round(-0.5) is -1.0).from python orgs documentation.
