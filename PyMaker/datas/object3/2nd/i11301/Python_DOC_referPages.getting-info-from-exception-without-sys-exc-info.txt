I am trying to get more information out of an exception object, , beyond its error message. In my code I sometimes capture exceptions deep in some subfunction. Back at the top level I want to print info about where the exception occurred etc.I have seen similar questions where the answers involve using , but according to the docs, this is too limited:Return information about the most recent exception caught by an except  clause in the current stack frame or in an older stack frame.whereas I want to get this information from an arbitrary exception object captured and stored at some unknowable point in the program execution, with possibly multiple exceptions being raised at later points.The information seems to be in there; if I issue  it all comes out. But I cannot figure out how to pry it out of the exception object without ing it. Can I somehow capture the output from  in a string and print that?
Use the  module:(2 is the line number)
