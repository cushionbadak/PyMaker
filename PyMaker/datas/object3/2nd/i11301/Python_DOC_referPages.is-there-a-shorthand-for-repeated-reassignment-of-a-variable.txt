Consider the example:This could trivially be reduced toNow, consider (x as an OrderedDict)Is there a shorthand trick to avoid repeating the variable assignment? For example, is there a function such that:or
In the  module there is the  function. It works like , which is the one you are most likely to have already seen: given a name, the return value of  is partial function that calls the named method of its argument.That is, given:Is the same as saying:You could use this along with simple  expressions and/or  or  to construct a list of functions/methods to be applied. Then, as @cricket_007 suggested, you could use or write code to automatically apply them.Also of note is . You can write or construct a caller function, and then use  to supply it with a list of functions to call.Here's some code to reduce a list of functions against a list of data (py3, but works in 2.7):
