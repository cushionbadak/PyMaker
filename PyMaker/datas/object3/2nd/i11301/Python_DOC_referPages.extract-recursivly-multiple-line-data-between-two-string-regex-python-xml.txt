Natural Text
I have a huge XML file from which I need data for specific entries. File structure is:In my XML i have many of these entry.What I have to achieve is to extract all the lines (complete record) for certain entries.I need to create different xml file, one for every times that you found text between  till next .In this case i would like to have tow different xml file, with different file name. Ex : 1  -> 127.0.0.1.xml  :and the second one : 2 -> 192.168.10.1.xml : What could be the REGEX to perform such extraction of record for specific entries? Is there any more pythonic way to achieve this?I would appreciate your help on this.AS
Do not use regex for this. Instead have a look at the ElementTree module. With this, you can just iterate over all the opentags, and then write each one into a different file. This is more pythonic than using regex ('don't reinvent the wheel').If you have to use regex you could do:Make sure to pass the  modifier so  matches newline.This is the final solution: 
Presuming the format is the same for all the files and  is actually in the first file you can use itertools.groupby to group the sections:Which for your example data gives you exactly what you want.
