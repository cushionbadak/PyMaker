Natural Text
I have a list in python, which is from a text document that I split at new line characters. The end of data is indicated with  in the text document. I need to count each of element of the list and then split the strings in the list at tab characters, creating a two dimensional list.I thought this was fairly simple, however, I'm not getting a result from my code. The strings in the list are not splitting at all, nevermind at .Has this got something to do with tab characters being troublesome? Or can I not replace elements of a list in-place? Should I be creating a new list with my split records?
