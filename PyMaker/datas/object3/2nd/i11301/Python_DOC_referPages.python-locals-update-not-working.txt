This question already has an answer here:Why is it bad idea to modify locals in python?                    5 answers                Why below is not working inside function but working outside?Error : NameError: global name 'abc' is not definedIf i run it outside function, it works
According to the locals documentation:Note The contents of this dictionary should not be modified; changes may not affect the values of local and free variables used by the interpreter.So it's not working because it's not intended to work. But to answer your question now, it works in the global scope because modifying the  is possible, the globals documentation don't have the note telling "this [...] should not be modifyed".And, obviously, when you're in the global scope, global is locals:So you're modifying globals, which is permitted.
