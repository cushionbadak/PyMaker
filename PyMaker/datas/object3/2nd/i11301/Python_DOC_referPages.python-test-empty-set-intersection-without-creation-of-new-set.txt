I often find myself wanting to test the intersection of two sets without using the result of the intersections.The problem is that a new set is created to do this test which can be inefficient.Is there a short way to do this without explicitly writing it out (as in the following)?

You can use  to test wheather two sets have an empty intersection, just negate for the oposite:
