Hey everyone I'm trying to define a function that can return the longest string in a list as this is what I have so far:But it keeps coming up with errors, I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. Can someone please help?
You can do it as follows.What you did wrong?, this should be x>a, because we have to check whether the existing longest word's length is smaller than the current word's length. part is not required. The code will return the first longest word, if there are 2 words with the same length.Otherthan that, you are correct.Edit:Fixed to work with python 3.x
 will find the maximum value from an iterable, and you can provide it a function to tell it how to compare them. Here, telling it to compare items by their length.
You can do this really simply
this should work.
