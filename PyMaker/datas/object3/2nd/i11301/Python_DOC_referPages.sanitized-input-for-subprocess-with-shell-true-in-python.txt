I have python script, which has code.When I run  it gives error.Then I do some google, and found that, I have to sanitized my input and with  and  I can sanitize it.I changed my code to.But still I get same error, is there any way to remove this error when run  
So, user enter command which he want to runIf the user already may run any command including  then the  's warning about  is not applicable.The warning would make sense if the user were allowed only to choose some parameters for a fixed command e.g.,  a search query for a  command:whatever user-specified  is; it won't make it to run some other command (only  is run).Compare it with :A user could pass  that would produce   command.  allows a user to run an arbitrary command in this case even if it is not intended. It is called a shell injection.You could call , to avoid naive attacks but it may fail in the general case that is why  should be avoided if the input is not from a trusted source.
