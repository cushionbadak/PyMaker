I have this function and I need to build an interface for it.It's a function that is searching some data in the log file.This data needs to printed into Label.1. Data (int ) needs to be user input.2. Value from user input will be searched in the log file3. Results from the log needs to printed on label. Thank you for support.I'm  new here! So hello to everyone.Namaste!This is the progress-Please see below the code:
Your main problem seems to be that your button does not execute your  function as you expected.The code for your button looks like this:While the function it's supposed to execute is this:That means that on pressing the button, you create a new button with a different command () and assign it to your original button. This happens when clicking on your button for the first time; clicking on it for a second time, the "new" button will look for the  function, which does not exist - it is outside of the scope of the class.My solution is toinclude the  function in your  classdrop the on_button function altogetherassign  as the command for your buttonHere we go:Notice that I made some changes to your class'  function. Instead of using your class itself as the main window, I generated a main window called  and put the button and the entry widget in there. Concerning your code in general: As jcfollower pointed out in the comments, you should check out effbot's introduction to tkinter and maybe the Python docs on Tkinter for more information on how tkinter is used.
