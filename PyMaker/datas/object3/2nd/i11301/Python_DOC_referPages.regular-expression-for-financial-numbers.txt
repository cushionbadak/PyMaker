I think my chances are slim based on the responses to other questions related to regular expressions.I am try to parse numbers in different representations:from which I cannot control the source format.I suppose I can come up with different regular expression for different formats. How to detect which format is which? Has it to be brute-force way to look for the letter 'K'?
This kind of thing is often done by iterating over a bunch of regular expressions and stopping when you find one that matches - because your conversion from a string to a number needs special parsing beyond the capabilities of regular expressions. That means you need to order them in a way that you know will give the right answer. In this case, you might do something like this:As an aside, this pattern is common in other places too, such as deciding which function will handle a web request based on the URL.Just for fun, here's an alternative implementation that uses dictionary lookups and a single regular expression instead of iteration:
