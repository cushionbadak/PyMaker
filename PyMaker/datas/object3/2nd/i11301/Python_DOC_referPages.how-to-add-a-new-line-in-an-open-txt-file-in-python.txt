Moreover, If I want to add more rows, how can I do this?One more thing, I use the python 3.5
I wrote a little class to do everything you asked for and more. Implementation examples are done at the bottom. Let me know if this works for you.
If by "add a new vertical line" you mean "add a new column" to your file, you can do this with the help of the  module.The code below works by reading the contents of your file as a list, making the changes, and then writing the updated list back to the file.  You can add rows to your file this way, as well.This code also uses  statements when working with your file.  Using either  or  (like you included in your question) is the correct practice when working with files.  A  statement is easy to use because it closes your file automatically.
