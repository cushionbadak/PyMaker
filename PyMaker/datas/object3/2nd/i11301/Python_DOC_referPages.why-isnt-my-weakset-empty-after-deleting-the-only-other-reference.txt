I decided I should familiarize myself with the  library, so I started messing around with the collections, thought I was getting the hang of it until this. Here I have a WeakSet  that I would expect to contain 3 s to each  instance, and it does:Then I would expect that as soon as I get rid of the  name, there won't be any more "strong references" to each  instance, and they will be garbage collected. But for some reason this doesn't happen. Why is there still a weakref inside my WeakSet? I can use  again and it persists, seemingly no matter what I do.
You still have the  variable from here:That variable retains its last value from the loop, so it's still referring to the last  instance, keeping it alive and in the .
