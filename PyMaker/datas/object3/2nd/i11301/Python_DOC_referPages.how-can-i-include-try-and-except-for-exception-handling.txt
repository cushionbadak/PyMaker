Natural Text
I attempted to include  and  in this program to catch text string exceptions, but unable to figure out how to implement. How can I include  and  for exception handling?

You just need to use a try except pairNow you need to ask for a valid response. for example.This depends on how you want to handle the rest of the processing. Some might prefer to return a 0 if it is an invalid entry since 0 price or 0 hours would also be invalid so test for > 0
