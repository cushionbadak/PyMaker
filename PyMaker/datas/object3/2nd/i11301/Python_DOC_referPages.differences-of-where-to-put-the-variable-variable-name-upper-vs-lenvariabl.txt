Why in the methods , the placement of variables different from the others, for example theThings may be trivial , it makes me uncomfortable if do not know it ... thanks.
 is calling a method of the  class or an inherited class. is calling Python's built-in  function on a  object for which the  function determines the length depending on the type of object, be it a  or  for example.So the placement of the  tells you if you are calling a class attribute ( in front) OR you are passing a variable into a method which is not an attribute of the  class ( in the brackets).
