I have a Python dictionary of objects from a class that I have created in one file. It is of the form , with several key, value pairs.My goal is to do something in a method in a separate file that changes an attribute of certain objects in the dictionary and to save those changes to those objects while keeping them within the dictionary.I've tried using pickle, but it doesn't seem to save the changes to the objects within the dictionary.Basic Idea of what I'm doing right now and what is wrong with it:File #1:File #2:So when I run File #2 the first time, it should print , and it doesbut when I run File #2 the second time, I want it to print , but it prints  again because the change to the value was not saved.It could be that I am using pickle incorrectly...Any help would be appreciated! Thanks!
From the pickle documentation:Note that none of the classâ€™s code or data is pickledSee pickling class instances for the right way to do it.Also  does not exist in the unpickling environment, that can't be a good thing, class are unpickeled by name if I read the doc right.BTW I'd use  over  so you can open the file between two runs and inspect it yourself to understand what happen. There's a few advantages to use  over , and a few to use  over , here's a comparison between pickle and json.Oh, and, avoid naming your variables  or any existing builtins, it shadows them and can lead to very strange behaviors.
