I would like to make a  with asyncio. In particular to handle the case that the server is not available when the client is started in which case the  will keep trying. That is something that the  does not do.Concretely:The EchoClient example would be fine.The crux is how the connection is made.in the case of the twisted version with .VsOr similar with the asycnio version.The problem is that in the asyncio version the connection is established by  which simply fails if the server is not available. How can I reconcile the two?Many thanks 
I think I get what you want. Here's the code and example based on asyncio TCP echo client protocol example.
