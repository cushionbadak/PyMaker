This question already has an answer here:Finding max value in the second column of a nested list?                    4 answers                I am writing a Python program that produces a list similar to the code block below. The user inputs ten numbers, which are stored in a list. It counts the number of distinct objects. The first number in each ( ) is the number the user entered, and the second value is how many times it was entered. What I need to do is essentially print out to the user "The most common number is x which was entered y times".I tried a normal max command, but it chooses the second value as the max even thought it was chosen less often. Thank you for your help.
As the other answers have already pointed out, you can tell the  function to only look at the second value by setting the  parameter. To output the result you can do this:
Use the  option to , which is a function that tells  what value to base the output on.This will use the 2nd element to determine the maximum value.
 has a key argument which you can use to specify on which tuple element the max should be found from. Alternatively if you aren't a fan of anonymous functions you could use  to use the second element similarly with 
Normaly a list of tuples is sorted by the first element, but you can change  the way to get the max element by the key argument
