I am trying to generate a list of possible moves for a checkers-like game. For example, at the start of the game the board would look like [[1,1,1], [0,0,0], [2,2,2]]. My function would take the color (one for white, or two for black) and move the pieces either one space forward, or one space diagonal to capture another piece. So the list of first possible moves with white going first is  [[[0,1,1], [1,0,0], [2,2,2]] , [[1,0,1], [0,1,0, [2,2,2]] , [[1,1,1], [0,0,1, [2,2,2]]]So far I have:But I can't figure out what modifications I need to make to it to calculate the new list of possible moves.
First, we must note that moving forward or backwards depends on the owner of the piece.We'll take as an argument the direction of the movement, with the code of the player, the code of the opponent and the board.Now I'll define a function which generates the possible moves. The format is (original piece row, original piece column, new piece row, new piece column)Now we have a generator that generates all the possible moves on the board.We can use it to modify the board to our needs.
