i have been dong a simple webscraping program to learn how to code and i made it work but i wanted to see how to make it faster. I wanted to ask how could i implement multi-threading to this program? all that the program does is open the stock symbols file and searches for the price for that stock online.Here is my code
If you just iterate a function on a list, i recommend you the .https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html?highlight=multiprocessing%20map#multiprocessing.pool.Pool.map
You need to use asyncio. That's quite neat package that could also help you with scrapping. I have created a small snippet of how to integrate with linkedin with asyncio but you can adopt it to your needs quite easily.Since default executor is ThreadPoolExecutor it will run each task in the separate thread. You can use ProcessPoolExecutor if you'd like to run tasks in process rather than threads (GIL related issues maybe).
