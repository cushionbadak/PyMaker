I'm sorry for how basic this question is. The aim: This is my output from a software program:For those with a biology background, I want to pull out ONLY the reciprocal best hits. For those with a non-biology background, I want to extract the pairs of genes, only if the number in the first column only appears twice.For example, we can see the number 1 appears twice in the first column of the file:but the number 3 appears 4 times appears in the first column of the file:So for this sample file, the output would look like this:As these are the only four pairs of lines in the file.This is my code:This works, the output it prints is:I'm just curious as to how other people would do it? In reality, my actual data set will have thousands of lines, so I'm wondering if there's a more efficient (either in terms of time or memory) way of doing this? Or how people would add in "checks" to make sure the number only appears twice? At this stage, I have mastered python basics, so I'm looking into ways to design code better.
A possible improvement is to change the  to , since  is a O(n) operation, whereas  is about O(1).  I'm not sure about the real performance gain. You should use time to figure that out.
If your file is sorted by the numbers in the first line, you can use :
