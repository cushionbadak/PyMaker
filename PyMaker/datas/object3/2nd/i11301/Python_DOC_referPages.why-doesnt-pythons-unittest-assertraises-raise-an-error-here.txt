Using Python 3.5, why does all tests below pass when run? Since, an  is not raised when  is called, how come that  doesn't complain? According to the documentation for : "or fails if no exception is raised".Can someone help me out?
Because you have called  with wrong signature and exceptions was raised prior calling  (actual body of   wasn't executed, exception was raised prior execution).To get more clear picture of what's going on try to raise ZeroDivisionError from  and replace  to  within your test cases.
An exception is raised when you call  because you've defined the  method outside of the  class.   That's why it's a good idea to also verify the exception message in your test:
