Create a basic ip object to hold a record of your current ip and to get the next ipOutput:10.220.1.1, 10.220.1.2, 10.220.1.3, 10.220.1.5,Traceback (most recent call last):File "C:\Users\J10ey\workspace\SO_Help\src\ip's.py", line 32, in      print ips.next_ip(True)   File "C:\Users\J10ey\workspace\SO_Help\src\ip's.py", line 21, in next_ip     raise StopIteration  StopIteration
