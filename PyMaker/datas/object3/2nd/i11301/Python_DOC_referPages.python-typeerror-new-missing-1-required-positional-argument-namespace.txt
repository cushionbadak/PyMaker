I try to initialize class usingbut I got TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'namespace'. The init code of TimeSeriesFeature is below:and BasicFeature init code:and I'm using python3.5. Is there any mistake?
The error you're getting is from the fact that instantiation of metaclass does not use it's  method, but rather it's  method which (excluding self) expects 3 arguments, last being said namespace.As it stands now your class inherits from  (which is a metaclass), therefore it is also a metaclass:but I think you'd rather set  as a metaclass of your class:That way your class becomes an ordinary class, with  as it's metaclass.If you'd like  to be a abstract (in other words impossible to initialize) class, add an abstract method to it, like this:and overload it in subclass without the  decorator:Then, users who attempt to instantiate  will get an error about  being abstract, but users who instantiate  will not.
