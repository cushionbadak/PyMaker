Why is my code so sluggish (inefficient)? I need to make two methods to record the time it takes to process a list of a given size. I have a  and  method. Even though there is a difference between those two search times.  is still pretty slow. I'd like to optimise the processing time so instead of getting  with  and  with . It would only take a fraction of a second. What can I do? I'd be eternally grateful for some tips as coding is still pretty new to me. :)
The fastest way is using  operator, which tests membership of a value in a sequence.Reference: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#membership-test-operationsUpdate: also, if you frequently need to test the membership, consider using sets instead of lists.Some pros and cons can be found here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset
Adding the following code to above:produces the following on my system:Hope this helps. The basic idea is to tap into underlying C code and not make your own Python code.
I managed to find out what made the code sluggish. It was a simple mistake of adding to the list by instead of . Now clocks in at  instead of . But I have no idea why it changes the performance so much.
