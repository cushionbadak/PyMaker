Natural Text
I'm currently trying to write a script in Python that can manipulate JSON ".txt" files within a folder and saving it as a new JSON ".txt" file within the same folder.  I already know how to manipulate the file, but I'd need to manually type in the actual path.  Is there a way to just type in the folder name and the name of the text file to just manipulate that instead of typing the full path? Because right now, I'm having it to doeach time I want to manipulate a specific JSON text files, I'd have to change the whole path, and I'd have to edit "out_file" manually every single time, so I can I make it more flexible?since I'll be placing the script into a main folder with all the sub-folders and JSON Files.  It'd be easier for me to manipulate the sub-folder JSON text files without having to put the full path.
Yes you can easily do that with the os module constructs the path to the file by joining the strings you supplied to it and adding the correct file separator ( in *nix systems and  on windows)while  returns a string of the root directory which will be  in *nix systems and  in windows
For the input, relative paths may be sufficient. For the output, just generate the filename from the input filename by adding '_edit' using .
