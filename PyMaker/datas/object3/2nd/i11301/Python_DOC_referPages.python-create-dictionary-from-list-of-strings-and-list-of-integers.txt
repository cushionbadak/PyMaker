I have two lists: one contain the name of pages like  and the other list contain the corresponding page number like I want to create a dictionary from two lists such that the splitted words from list one as a key and corresponding value from list two as value. And if key already is in dictionary then append value to it.For the above example I want a dictionary like:
You might be surprised that the results are out of order, but that's because dicts in python don't have an order. If you want them ordered you'll need to use something other than a vanilla dict.This outputs:
You can use  to loop through the two lists simultaneously. If you don't need the dict to be in order, it's much easier to use  than a normal dictionary:Although since your  is just a list of subsequent numbers, it's probably better to use  so you don't have to update the  list every time you make changes:Now if you do need the dict to be in order, you can use  combined with @Keatinge's answer:Or if you only need the output to be sorted, use the earlier  solution and throw in  when outputting the values:Finally, you could use an , but most would argue that this is a bit of an overkill for such a simple program.
List comprehension approach. Basically double iteration in list comprehension is used here (look more pythonic to me). Another way of iterating would be using . And to convert the a list with duplicated keys, if the order is not a concern. Then  would be quite useful. Though pure base python approach would also work, and it will be something like this:
