Natural Text
I have been having problems with some code I am writing. Basically, when I run the code I enter an 8 digit number and it should scan the CSV file to see if the number is inside the file. If it is, the row should be written to the text file. However, when I run it and I enter a number, I get this:(EDIT) And even when it is fixed, the output is:My code is as follows:Any help is appreciated, thanks.
The  method of a Python text file takes a string (), not a list.If you want to duplicate matching rows from the input file to the output, as your description implies, I think you want to either replace your with or replace:withandwith The first example joins the elements of  back into a string, inserting a comma between each one. The second one means that  is a list containing all the rows of the input file, rather than an iterator that reads one row at a time. The first method is probably better as it avoids reading a large file into memory, just as long as you realise what it means to get an iterator rather than a list.
 call in  expects a string, whereas you give it a list.You can use join if you want everything to be concatenated (in this example, the values would be separated by dashes) :Hope it'll be helpful
