I am quite new to pandas.  I have a log text file. I am trying to grab few data point from the file. Below is the code that kind of gets me the desired data but not in desired format. I wanted Pandas data frame with two columns.This does not give me output in two column. I am looking for host and user agent as one row.Sample of the text file as below
You can create a dataframe by creating a list of lists, and then use the dataframe constructor.Loop through each line of the file, like you've started doing, then split each line into the different columns. You can use re.split to create a list of the columns, limitting the maximum number of splits to treat the last column as one element. Alternatively, if you know each element is always going to be aligned in the same way, you can use slicing to create that list.You can then use the method in this answer to create the dataframe.
