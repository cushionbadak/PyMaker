My question is related to this  earlier question - Python subprocess usageI am trying to run this command using python nccopy -k 4 "http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/thredds/dodsC/Datasets/ncep.reanalysis2/pressure/air.2014.nc?air[408:603][2][20:34][26:40]" foo.ncWhen I run the above command I should be able to see a file called foo.nc on my disk or a network error stating unable to access that URL or remote URL not found. Currently the ESRL NOAA server is down - so when I run the above command I getsyntax error, unexpected $end, expecting SCAN_ATTR or SCAN_DATASET or SCAN_ERRORcontext: ^NetCDF: Access failureLocation: file nccopy.c; line 1348I should get the same error when I run the python scriptThis is the code I have and I am unable to figure out exactly how to proceed further -I tried splitting up "-k 4" into two arguments and removing the quotes and I still get this error nccopy : invalid format : 4Results of print(sys.argv) data.py ['data.py', '-k', '4', 'http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/thredds/dodsC/Datasets/ncep.reanalysis2/pressure/air.2014.nc?air[480:603][20:34][26:40]', 'foo.nc']
There's two dilemmas here.One being that subprocess processes your arguments and tries to use  as a separate argument.The other being that system calls still goes under normal shell rules, meaning that parameters and commands will be parsed for metacharacters aka special characters. In this case you're wrapping  and .There for you need to separate each parameters and it's value into separate objects in the parameter-list, for instance  should be  and you need to wrap parameters/values in  instead of .Try this,  does the grunt work for you, and i swapped the encapsulation characters around the URL:
Instead of arg1 = "-k 4", use two arguments instead.See also here Python subprocess arguments
If you have a working shell command that runs a single program with multiple arguments and you want to parameterized it e.g., to use a variable filename instead of the hardcoded value then you could use  to create a list of command-line arguments that you could pass to  module and replace the desired argument with a variable e.g.:To run the command using the same Python interpreter as the parent script,  could be used and we can pass a  instead of :Note:one command-line argument per list itemno  in the final codethere are no quotes inside  i.e.,  is used instead of  or  module does not run the shell by default and therefore you don't need to escape shell meta-characters such as a space inside the command-line arguments. And in reverse, if your command uses some shell functionality (e.g., file patterns) then either reimplement the corresponding features in Python (e.g., using  module) or use  and pass the command as a string as is. You might need , to escape variable arguments in this case. Wildcard not working in subprocess call using shlex
