I am trying to create a list with all the newspapers articles from 5 different sources. They are stored in  format. All articles are stored in different files that contain that contain the newspaper and the year (time spam 2005-2015). The problem is that one of the newspapers is available for only 2014-15, therefore when I loop everything together I get error. This is my attempt:My question is; does this code does what I am aiming? (creating a single list with the  of all articles from each newspaper along time); and, how can I program it in a way that I skip the years 2005-2013 for the first newspaper (SDM)
For the skipping part, you can:To know whether the code performs as expected we'd need so sample data.
First of all you need to check the version of python to determine what type of error is thrown when the file name is not found as explained in Python's "open()" throws different errors for "file not found" - how to handle both exceptions?Secondly, just in case there is a problem with some of the files you should check all of the possibilities.One way would beCreate a list of file name prefixes ['SDM', 'Scot', 'AP', 'TH500', 'DRSM')loop over the yearscreate the file names as a loop in the list of namesopen the file in a   pair in order to handle any problems as myfile Alternatively, you can also use  in an if to avoid the try except. However, you should have a try except pair anyways just in case something else goes wrong.read the data into  Note you should also encapsulate this as a  pairclose the file so that you do not have too many open.Now append df to the list you are creating.This should handle the situation.
