I have the following code whereby I would like to find all files in a certain folder (this folder contains .TIF files), then store these names in a .txt file which works so far. However, I don't want the extensions, of anything that would be in the folder.After comments, especially thanks to ShadowRanger, I changed it to the following which produced the same effect. Thank you everyone!:
Remove the extension in a generator expression when you get the filenames with . Change:to:Update: It looks like you're abusing  to do file from directory separation (since you  in the first loop, so you're not actually walking a tree at all), when there are more direct ways to do this. You can replace all of this:on Python 3.5+ (or any version of Python after installing the third party  package using  instead of ), with the more succinct and somewhat faster:which describes what you really want, and by using , guarantees you don't have to individually  each entry in the directory listing to check if it's a file.If you're on older Python, and can't use the  package, at the cost of a  (which  would pay anyway on older Python), you can do:
Replace this line:with something like this:or even simpler: More info on what  but it essentially splits the filename into 2 pieces. The first is the root, which is what you want.
