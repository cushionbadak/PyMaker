So I'm currently (ab)using python notation to create a domain specific language. As part of this I'm overriding comparison functions to return non-boolean values.So, for (mytype1 < mytype2) and (mytype < 0) I can easily do this by defining the __lt__() magic method.However, I cannot figure out how to do so for (0 < mytype) as presumably the magic method would need to be defined on the built-in int type. There doesn't seem to be a __rlt__() function as exists for numeric operations.How do I add support for this comparison where the lhs is of type int (in python3)?
As per the documentation the reflected form of  is .There are no swapped-argument versions of these methods (to be used when the left argument does not support the operation but the right argument does); rather,  and  are each other’s reflection,  and  are each other’s reflection, and  and  are their own reflection. If the operands are of different types, and right operand’s type is a direct or indirect subclass of the left operand’s type, the reflected method of the right operand has priority, otherwise the left operand’s method has priority. Virtual subclassing is not considered.
