Whenever a user doesn't provide suitable parameters to arguments in my script, I raise argparse.ArgumentTypeError with the error string I provided. My problem is that argparse also prints the usage, while it seems irrelevant to me to tell the user how to use my script when he just got a parameter wrong.Is there a way for certain cases of raising argparse.ArgumentTypeError to suppress the usage printout? Will I need to use a custom usage function? Or maybe I shouldn't be using this exception at all?
Where are you raising the ?  In a  function?The definition of  is just ; it doesn't do anything except subclass .It is referenced in , which calls the  function on your argument string.  That method treats  and  in the same way.  It recasts the error as , which adds the argument  (name) to the message.   ends up converting that to a call to .It's the  method that adds the .So simply changing that method might be the solution to your problem.https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#exiting-methodsI'm not sure what happens if your  function returns some other error - it might bubble all the way to the top.The formal way to change the  method is to subclass , but you can kludge a one time change with:This just showed the message, and did not exit.  If I'd stuck closer to the original it would have exited as well.
