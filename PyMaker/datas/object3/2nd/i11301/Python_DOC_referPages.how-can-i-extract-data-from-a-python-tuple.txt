I'm a newbie to Python. For this data, I'm working with  Jupytier iPython. I'm trying to extract numerical data from a csv file to then run Sklearn on. I have :Opened and read  the CSV file with PandasSet the data to a dictionary I set up to organza my data( set up a Pandas DataFrame to see my codes and values )Set up my data in a np array to make it accessible for machine learningReshaped my data to a 2D array for further accessibility for machine learningI've tried setting my data to a target attribute , but I realized that my Lat_reader with pandas is a tuple. I would have to extract data out of my tuple before I can conduct any type of ML.  Basically, my Lat-reader is now a tuple, and Sklearns can't work with a tuple. There is data inside the tuple that I want to work with, but I want to change it from a tuple.Here is my code :Here is a sample of the output:
If you mean basic python syntax, you should go there first.https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequencesHere are some examples:To convert a tuple to a list (since you want something other than a tuple, I figured maybe a list will work)
