please be aware, im new to python:i'm trying to create a defined function that can convert a list into a string, and allows me to put a separator in. The separator has to be ', '.My current thought process is to add each item from a list to an empty string variable, and then I'm trying to make use of the range function to add a separator in. I'm only wanting to use str() and range().
If you wanted to create your own function to convert you could do the following.
First you need to convert the list of int to a list of string.You can use list comprehension : https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.htmlThen, join the list of string with the separator you want.In a more concise way:More information about join here: http://www.diveintopython.net/native_data_types/joining_lists.html
If no string methods (like ) are allowed,  should offer the shortest solution:
