I'm trying to create a file on python without buffer, so its written at the same time I use write(). But for some reason I got an error.This is the line I'm using:And this is the error I got:There is anyway to do an unbuffered write on a file?I'm using python 3 on pyCharm.Thanks
The error isn't from Pycharm.The Python doc says:buffering is an optional integer used to set the buffering policy.  Pass 0 to switch buffering off (only allowed in binary mode)Your code will work in Python 2 but not in Python 3. Because Strings are immutable sequences of Unicode code points in Python 3. You need bytes here. In Python 3 you need to convert your unicode  to  in unbuffered mode.
use Always call flush immediately after the write and it will be "as if" it is unbuffered
