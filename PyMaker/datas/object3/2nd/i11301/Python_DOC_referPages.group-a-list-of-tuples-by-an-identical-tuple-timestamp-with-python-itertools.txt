Natural Text
I got the following un-normalized list of tuples as result from a SQL-query. These are Sensor-Data from several sensors but with the same timestamp. I would like to group all the sensor values with the same timestamp. So that I have a list of tuples for every equal timestamp. I understood that I can use the groupby()-function from the itertools. I do not understand what kind of Key function IÂ need in order to group by the equal 'timestamp'.
In your code,  raises the error . Replace it with , as shown below.
