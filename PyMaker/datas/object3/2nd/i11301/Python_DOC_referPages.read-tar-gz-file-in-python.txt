The docs tell us that None is returned by extractfile() if the member is a not a regular file or link.One possible solution is to skip over the None results:
 can return  if the member is neither a file nor a link. For example your tar archive might contain directories or device files. To fix:
You may try this one
You cannot "read" the content of some special files such as links yet tar supports them and tarfile will extract them alright. When  extracts them, it does not return a file-like object but None. And you get an error because your tarball contains such a special file.One approach is to determine the type of an entry in a tarball you are processing ahead of extracting it: with this information at hand you can decide whether or not you can "read" the file. You can achieve this by calling  returns s that contain detailed information about the type of file contained in the tarball.  The  class has all the attributes and methods you need to determine the type of tar member such as  or  or  or  and then accordingly decide what do to with each member (extract or not, etc).For instance I use these to test the type of file in this patched tarfile to skip extracting special files and process links in a special way:
