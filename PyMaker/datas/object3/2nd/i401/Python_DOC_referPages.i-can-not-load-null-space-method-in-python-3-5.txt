According to documentation, there should be a  function in the  package. I am using python3, but I can not import the function:Is this not strange? What is wrong here? I also can import scipy itself just fine.
There are two problems here. The first is that  wasn't added to scipy until version 1.1.0. The release notes mention this explicitly.You have two workarounds available in this regard. The simplest in the long run is to simply upgrade scipy. The other is to copy the function out of `scipy/linalg/decomp_svd.py:333 on GitHub, stick it in your utilities somewhere, and use that.The second issue is your import syntax. An import statement of the form  only works when  is a module. To import a module attribute, you need to use  notation:Alternatively, you can use  notation, to access the attribute through the module:OrThe error message pretty much tells you exactly what the problem is, but it's a little cryptic if you don't already know what to look for.
