Python newbie here, very good chance I am doing a silly mistake here..After losing a good amount of hair and searching for many hours, I am still not able to convert a whole project to python 3. I have a project made in django framework and it uses python 3.7, and I wanted to incorporate this library into my app. But, because pyshipping uses python 2.7, I thought it may cause compatibility issues. Following this answer,I converted the whole project and tried running this file binpack_simple.py. But it gives me an error I am not able to understand at all. When I run this file using my pycharm terminal when the project iterpreter is set to python 2.7 it runs perfectly, but when I set iterpreter to 3.7, it gives me the following errorHere is my file. Please let me know if I should upload the whole project for clarifications. Here is an online link to the file inside the project.
In Python 3 support for the  method has been removed.  You need to provide a  method for the class instead if you want to compare two instances.  The code for the original  is here.The new method will probably look like:but obviously you should test this thoroughly.
