Starting with the input table below:  This is the code I have that works, but not how I want it to ultimately.Here is the output which copies the  element and appends to the  element:What I want to do is copy the    element and append to the  element, but I do not know how. I figure that I just replace the  with something that will identify the  element, but everything I've tried isn't working. Thanks for the help.Desired output:
