This question already has an answer here:What does the ^ (XOR) operator do?                    2 answers                This python code below I found as part of a problem statement over here:Divide two integers without using multiplication, division and mod operatorGiven a two integers say a and b. Find the quotient after dividing a by b without using multiplication, division and mod operator.I notice the code doesn't work if you don't have bitwise or operator. Why do you need a "bitwise or" instead of a logical "or" operator?
 is an exclusive OR, but Python doesn't have a logical exclusive OR. This code  takes advantage of the fact that  and  so that using the bit-wise exclusive-or has the same effect. (For example, .)Using regular short-circuiting  and , then test (with redundant parentheses) would look like
That is a bitwise XOR operator. See here for more about XORs. 
It works because this is not a bitwise OR operator, but rather a bitwise XOR operator. Check out the Python documentation on bitwise operators.From Wikipedia:Exclusive or or exclusive disjunction is a logical operation that outputs true only when inputs differ (one is true, the other is false).
