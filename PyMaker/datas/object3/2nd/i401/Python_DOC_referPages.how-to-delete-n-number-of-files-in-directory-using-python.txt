I have a cat and dog image dataset. I converted into two folders (cat and dog) each folder contains roughly 10000 images. So Far I don't want 10000 images, I need only 2000 images in each folder. How to automate this in python.I know to delete a file X, I could use similarly to delete a folder But I'm wondering how could i delete randomly n files in each folder effectivelySo Far I tried,The above code does the job for me, but I'm wondering is their effective way so that i could remove complexity in my code.Any help would be appreciable.I'm using ubuntu 17.10, For Now linux based solution is sufficient, but If it compatible with windows also then it's more appreciable.
Your code seems okay to me.A few adjustments I would make:It's better to use the  library so it should be cross-platform. This is because, when you write , the  is not cross platform. Would be better to use .You're wasting a lot of space holding the list of filenames to delete (Two lists of 10000 strings). If it doesn't matter to you which images to keep you could save a little bit of space (20%) by slicing:If it does matter which images to keep, better to generate indices (less space):
Instead of  and , I would use  and the  module. returns a list of  objects that represent files in the  directory whose filenames end with . takes a random sample of 8000 items from a list. deletes a file.
