I want to calculate pi with the chudnowsky algorithm and I want it to be precise soI tried using Decimal module but I couldnt understand how I can use it. The code isbut it gives I look the internet but couldnt find a good source that covers the things and gives examples. How can I square root decimals and if I want a Decimal type result and the operations to be mostly lossless how can I implement it to the code above? Its python 3.6I am new here so I thank you for being tolerant to me.
I don't have too much experience with , but the error you get is because you can't use the  operator with a decimal and a float. The solution is to make the exponent a  too so instead of  you can do .Basically, you can't combine  and  but  are not a problem. You only need to be careful when you divide  because that will result in , so you also need to change  to . When one operand is a  the result will also be a . All the other numbers in your program are integers anyway so now it should work fine.
The module  does not make sense to be used here. You are using  functions, I cite the module documentation:The following functions are provided by this module. Except when explicitly noted otherwise, all return values are floats.Source: https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.htmlmath.factorial  - returns floatBeside that: you recalculate constants: No need to recalculate it - simply use  instead
