Lets say i have variables a,b,c,d,e,f.. every time 2 of the 6 variables will have value = 0 randomly. So my code is like this So the coding will be very long, are there any other approach ?
You can put all numbers into a list and then feed a list comp of that list into the  function - ignoring elements that are 0:Output: is the same as  is Falsy - so  for a  does only use non falsy values of  in : truth value testingyou can exchange the list comp  against a generator comp if you like  to avoid the list creation (not that it matters here ;) )@Mehrdad Dowlatabadi raised an interesting side question - if any other of the params is 0 you get an error due to a mismatch between function parameters and provided parameters from the list comprehension - you can negate that by defining defaults:So if you feed  into it it will still run.
If you want to run a function with the variables that aren't set to 0 you can first make a list of elements that are'nt 0then call the function with elements list as argumentsAs a one liner : 
Make run take a list:then use the filter function: removes all fals-y elements.
