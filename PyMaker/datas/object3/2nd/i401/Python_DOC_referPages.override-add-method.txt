I'm trying to override the  method so that the duplicate will not be added. What went wrong with my code?If , and I do , I am expecting a message of "it already exists". But I got .
Everything is an object in Python, including classes, modules, lists, etc. You access objects by the name they are bound to.When you write , you bind a class object to the name . Since classes are regular objects, you can do something likeThis will produce the same result as if you had called  directly, since the first assignment just binds the class once to another name.When you subsequently do , you discard the class object that the name  was originally bound to, and bind it to a list object instead. This is because an expression in square brackets is always interpreted as a plain .To create an instance of  the class, you have to call the initializer:Now the operation  should print what you originally expected. Note that you aren't normally supposed to call special methods like  directly. Either use , or more rarely, .Another thing to keep in mind is that  already exposes the underlying  via the  attribute. Your  attribute is overkill at this point and actually prevents you from using all the other nice features of . A better implementation would look something likeAll in all, though, what you are probably looking for is .
you have initialize  as variable so it will act as object of list:to work with your code you need to instantiate the object of the class, see below exampleoutput
