I want to print each values of a class, but I don't know how to do it. I understand why my method of doing it doesn't work though.I get the error 
 is specifically looking for an attribute named  in . does not get magically replaced at runtime by the appropriate value.What you need is the getattr function:
You could doWhich will basically scrape out all the attributes of an object. This may or may not be what you want but it is at least a superset of what you want. I suppose you could filter by keys if you have a list of attributes you explicitly care about.
result:a value= 1b value= 2c value= 3
