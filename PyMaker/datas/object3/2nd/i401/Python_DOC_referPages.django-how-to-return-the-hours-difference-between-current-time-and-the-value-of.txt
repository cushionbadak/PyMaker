I try to get time difference between now and a data's last call and monitoring that in the website.my models.py codes are; But I need the  function to return the hours difference also. I have searched the internet but can't find any solution, date() object doesn't return hours or minutes. Is there a way?
The problem is because you are doing datetime.now.date() which looses the time part and you get something like datetime.date(2019, 2, 23). If you want to keep the time as well since you need the hours then remove the .date() so you preserve the time component: Here I use local timezone. Read up on pytz timezones for example pytz.utc for UTC time. with the .date() you have no hours or minuteswithout the .date() you can see you have the hours minutes secs and usecs
To compute the hours diff. you can write your function as follow:Note: The difference between two dates or times returns timedelta object.
