I was exploring Python internals and came across:which is fine but a bit confusing because: why should have an integer class have , ,  and  as attributes? I note that they don't have the  format, but it just seems odd.
Ints have imag and real parts to support mixed numeric arithmetic. It is completely fine (mathematically and in Python) to add an real integer to a complex number. Python supports this by adding the imag and real attributes to the int class. In Python mixed numeric type arithmetic, the "narrower" type is "widened" to the less-narrow type. This means int's get widened to floats and complex numbers when they are used together.See Numeric types - int, float, complex
