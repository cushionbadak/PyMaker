I have a list of 10 drawn rectangles (referenced as cubes in my script) that are affected by gravity. I made a simple collision system for them to stop when they hit the ground. How can I make it so when 2 cubes collide they stop falling like they do with the ground?
Use  to check if to rectangles are intersecting.Create an rectangle () which defines the next position (area) of the cube:Find all intersecting rectanglesAnd don't move (let further "fall") th cube if there is  collision:The check may look like this:Note, since all the cubes are aligned to an 10*10 raster, it is sufficient to check if the origins of the cubes are equal:
