I'm trying to rename a file, but if the file name already exists to just move on. The script stops with  exception raised, although I think I'm telling it to look for that? Yes, when the exception is raised the file does already exist.Traceback is:
os.rename(src, dst, *, src_dir_fd=None, dst_dir_fd=None)  Rename the file or directory src to dst. If dst is a directory, OSError will be raised. On Unix, if dst exists and is a file, it will be replaced silently if the user has permission. The operation may fail on some Unix flavors if src and dst are on different filesystems. If successful, the renaming will be an atomic operation (this is a POSIX requirement). On Windows, if dst already exists, OSError will be raised even if it is a file.

Why not flip your logic? It's often better to check if something can be done first rather than try it and see if it fails.
The code below will try to rename a file. See the preconditions check
