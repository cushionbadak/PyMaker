I&#039;ve been on it for 2 weeks and in the last week I only had 3 headaches which went away with 2 Tylenol. I was having chronic daily headaches that wouldn&#039;t go away no matter what I took. I&#039;m still a little sleepy during the day, but I know that will get better."The above statement is an example of the sentence I've been trying to convert.Can someone suggest a way to convert this into the string format?
