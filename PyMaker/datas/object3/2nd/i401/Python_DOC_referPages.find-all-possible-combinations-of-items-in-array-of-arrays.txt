I have an array of arrays that looks like this:but could also be expanded.I need to feed these to  in all of their possible combinations (, , , , ecc). Using numpy is an option.Though it appears as a simple problem, I have no idea where to start...Yes, I could loop like:and then what? Looping through the arrays means that on my second iteration  would no longer be first and I'd mess up the order. I also would have duplicates.How can I do this? I don't care in which order these functions are called, but I do care that they're not called twice with the same combination and that the arguments are in order.
 does exactly this. It will generate all combinations from your 3 sublists. Then you can unpack them as arguments in your function:Calls
