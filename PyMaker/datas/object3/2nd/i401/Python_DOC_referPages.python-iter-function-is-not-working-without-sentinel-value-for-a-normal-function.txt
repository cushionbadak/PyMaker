Here I defined a normal function:Now when I am iterating using iter function on abc method, I am getting the following error.But now when I am using sentinel, its working.Any idea why the above behaviour happening ?
 expects  to be an iterable, which a function object is not. expects  to be a callable, which it is.  So  will call  until it returns the sentinel value.  
So you chose the second form, which means it will forever loop until the sentinel in this case  is returned.
