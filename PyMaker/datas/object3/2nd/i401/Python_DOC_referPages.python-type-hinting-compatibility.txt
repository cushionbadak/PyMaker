I am writing a code that handles Python AST nodes, that should be compatible for both Python 2 and Python 3.However, Python 3 has , where Python 2 has  and , so I need to use  aliases to handle both cases.If I write my node visitor code using compatibility aliases, like the following, my pre-commit mypy check will complain when using Python 2, that :If I instead use  in the type hint, it will instead complain  if I run it in Python 3. I know that I can use a more general type for the node, but that makes me writing a lot of  in the code which I don't want.How can I resolve this issue?
Mypy knows how to handle Python version checks, and you could use conditional type aliases to pick the right type for the right Python version:You can further save yourself the runtime cost of the  tests by placing that code in a  test.As a side note: if you are handling  in Python 3 to track both  and  components of the  statement, you want to handle both  and  in Python 2, as before Python 2.5, you could only use  or  in one statement.
I was thinking that you could make the script using this code checks for the version of Python.
