I am trying to read lines from bytes like object. Here is a very simple example. I know it can be done in a different way but it's important to keep that flow ().This end up with an error:Python version 3.6.5
 should not be instantiated, it isn't even supposed to have a public constructor. You certainly don't need it here, it is a base class there to document the methods that buffered I/O objects must implement, with default implementations that inheriting classes can build upon. From the  documentation:Base class for binary streams that support some kind of buffering. It inherits . There is no public constructor.You only need to use , it inherits from , it is itself already implementing the methods required to be a buffered I/O object. From the  documenation:It inherits . [...][...] provides or overrides these methods in addition to those from  and : [...]Wrap your  object directly in a  object here:Where the  documentation tells you that the first argument is expected to be a  binary stream, the goal is to tell you you need a subclass of , something that implements that interface.  is such an object, and so are , , , and .In general, you wouldn't create instances of any of the ABCs listed in the Class Hierarchy section of the documentation. They are there to provide documentation, something to test for when you need to check types, and to be a solid base from which to derive custom implementations.
