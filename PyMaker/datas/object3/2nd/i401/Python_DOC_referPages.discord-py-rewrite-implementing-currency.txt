Okay, so I have been wanting to try adding currency to my bot for a while. So, I put my head down and started today, but I am having some issues. I know I will need to use a dictionary of members, and I have that already: . I have got a register command, which adds a member to the dictionary with their ID and amount of currency. However, this doesn't seem to be a good idea. Whenever I re-open the bot, the dictionary gets reset. I am not too sure how to save my dictionary, and would appreciate some help.As a reference, this is my registering command:I am still a bit of a beginner with dictionaries and discord.py, so sorry if I ask a lot of questions to your answer!
I believe it's worth using external database, nice possibility to learn mongodb for example. PyMongo is a way to start.
After saving my dictionary to a  file, I have reached a solution.
