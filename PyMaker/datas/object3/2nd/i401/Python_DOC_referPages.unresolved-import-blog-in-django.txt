I am getting a unresolved import "Blog" in visual studio code. It happened all of a sudden, I am using a venv through conda, I haven't changed anything with the venv, everything is still working, but it's really annoying to have it.As I said, I haven't changed anything in the project that could potentially create this problem intentionally.
If the  module is in a parent directory, then you might need a relative import:Or if it's in the same directory, you'll also need a relative import:More on relative importsAnother option is to set your project root in VS Code.
The problem was just a bug caused by a Visual Studio Code extension called "Visual Studio IntelliCode - Preview"
