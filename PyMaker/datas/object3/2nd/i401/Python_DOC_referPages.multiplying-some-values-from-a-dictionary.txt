I am writing a program that allows users to select options from a menu and based on that, details of the selected option will be printed. I need to multiply the volume and price to get cost. The problem is, my price and volume are in a nested dictionary. If user select option 1> 3AB, it should print out the cost based off 3AB's volume and price. How do i do that?
The problem is that you are storing values as strings in your original dict. To solve it, you can just convert the values to float:Or don't change the code and store the values as numbers:And BTW, your code still has one problem in the following line. You have to define a value to print:
You need numbers in your dict - not string. You can also make your code "snappier" by using a dictionary to call your functions instead of a big if-elif-construct. Using functions to ask for numbers/input is also a good move to cut down on repetetive coding (DRY - dont repeat yourself):Fix numbers in your dict (or directly use numbers):Don't repeat yourself:Mapping functions to inputs and call them:    Output of one run:See Why dict.get(key) instead of dict[key]? on how to avoid KeyError's and string formating for more formating-options.
