I have this code to scrape tagged users ids from medias on twitter:-But I would like to also scrape the usernames  and then organise all these datas in a csv with a column IDS and a column USERNAMES. So my guess is that I have to modify this piece of code first:But I can't find a way to achieve that...-Then I also have a problem with duplicates. As you can see in the code there are two ways to scrape the data:1    2    The first phrase seemed to work but was not efficient enough. Number 2 works fine but seems to give me dupplicates at the end as it goes through all the divs and not only the .I'm sorry if some feel that I'm a bit spammy here as I posted 3 questions in 24h...And thanks to those who helped and will be helping. 
Python has an inbuilt csv module for writing csv files. Also the scroll script that you used did not seem to work as it was not scrolling all the way down and stopped after a certain amount of time. I just got ~ 1400 records in the csv file with your script.I have replaced it with pagedown key. You may want to tweak the  to control the amount you want to scroll down. Even with  pagedowns i got ~2200 records. Note that this number is without removing the duplicates.I have added some additional modifications to write only the unique data to file.OutputIf you want the duplicates just remove the if condition
