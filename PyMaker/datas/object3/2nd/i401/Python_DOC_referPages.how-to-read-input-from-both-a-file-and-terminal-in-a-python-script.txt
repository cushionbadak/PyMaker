I have a Python script which reads some data from a file using shell redirection, e.g.After the file is processed, I want to allow the user to enter some parameters from the terminal. How can I do this?
Redirection lasts until the process terminates. So you can't do what you want. Instead, specify your input file using a command line argument, like this:Use  to pick the name out of the command line and read it like an ordinary file. That will leave  free to do the interactive things you want with .
As you have tagged the question with , I think I can speak of the trick that consist of explicitely opening . This is normally only used for programs asking secrets that should never live in a file. But that would allow to read from the terminal even after starting a script with a redirected stdin.Anyway, except for very special use case, I strongly advice to use a command line parameter instead, to allow the program to read from the specified file, and then normally read from stdin.
