Natural Text
for an assignment, I made a menu and must have it work in a way to execute multiple functions. However, the problem is that when I use the menu and put in an answer that doesn't exist, I cannot get it to work correctly. So when I re-enter an option number for "Incorrect option, try again: ", I do not get the number re-evaluated to execute. Since my code is far from finished, right now I want to be able to choose "4" as an input and get "Incorrect option, try again" as an output and input "1" into this to get the output "Choose the level of difficulty". 
Here a is modified version of your code which I believe does what you are looking for.Let me know if anything is misunderstood or mistaken.
