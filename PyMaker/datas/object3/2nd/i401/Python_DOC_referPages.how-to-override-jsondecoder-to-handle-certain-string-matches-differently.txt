I want to change certain values in a json file (nested dicts and arrays). I thought a handy way to do that would be to take advantage of the JSONDecoder.However, it's not working as I'd expect it to. I've done this exact same approach for getting JSONEncoder to convert np.arrays to lists so it wouldn't break the encoder.After not getting it to do what I wanted, I thought maybe to try the Decoder instead. Same issue, it never calls default for handling strings it seems. Maybe  is never called when handling a string, just when handling other types of objects?
After finding a solution that worked, I found a far superior one liner that didn't come up in previous google searches.The correct answer for my problem is For what it's worth, I also found the object_hook did exactly what I wanted as well:Referenceshttps://gist.github.com/douglasmiranda/5127251https://github.com/russellballestrini/nested-lookuphttps://pypi.org/project/nested-lookup/
