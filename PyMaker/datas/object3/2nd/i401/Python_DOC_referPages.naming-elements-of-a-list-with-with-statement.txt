I want to refer to an element () of a list () with a different name ():And I tried that with the  statement:But I got an error:I thought this would be the way because that's how it's done with file objects:I read the docs for the  statement and it says that the  and  methods are loaded. According to what I understood after reading that and from the , my guess is that sequence elements () do not have an  method.
as the comments already mentioned,  is a literal integer, which doesn't have  and  which are required for the  keyword to work and it would be indeed simpler if you just used  but that would be too easy, what you CAN do (as an exercise don't actually do this)is extend the  class and add  and  like so:this is neat but  is an alias to a LITERAL! if you change ,  will not change!
You seem to want a mutable object which functions as an alias for a specific location in a list. I could see some utility in that (since explicit indices are somewhat ugly in Python). You could create such a class. Here is a proof of concept, implementing the three things that you tried to do with  in your code:For example,The last line shows that there is a limit to what you could achieve here. To make this really useful, you would want to implement many more magic methods (beyond  etc.). Whether or not all this is useful just to avoid , you be the judge.
