My problem - and I don't know why there is a keyword , which should leave the value of 3 and go further. In fact, I have a loop that is infinite - that is, it crashes the program.
It looks like you are trying to iterate through the list until you find a  then . Do something like this:The keyword  will pass to the next iteration of the loop, where  will stop the loop.
The  keyword continues with the next iteration of the loop.In your case, it prevents the statement  to be executed.Here is what happens:Loops through 0,1,2 just fineWhen it evaluates  it proceeds with the next iteration of the loop and  is never executed, hence  remains 3 and never gets incremented. It keeps doing this forever. If you want to exit the loop, you can use the  statement instead of .For more information, you can read on the  keyword here: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html
You're using the  keyword, but I think you want .  Your code is running forever because  never iterates past 3. Once , it enters your if statement and continues the loop. Since it continues, it never iterates after that.
Because you are using the  keyword that skips the rest of the code.Once i reaches 3, it skips over the  command.  It appears that you want to use the keyword .  You could also do:
