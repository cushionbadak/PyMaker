Natural Text
I am trying to edit a text file then send it as email body using a python script but im getting the unicode encoding error. After some research i found the solution as using the method .encode('utf-8') but this doesn't serve me as the sendmail() method only sends strings  Here is the python code snippet Im using:Traceback:
smtpllib.server's sendmail method expects a  inastance; if it gets a  it tries to encode it to ASCII, resulting in a  if the  contains any non-ASCII characters.You can workaround this by encoding the message yourself:This will send this message*:However this workaround will not work if you want to send non-text binary data with your message.A better solution is to use the EmailMessage class from the email package.This sends this message; note the extra headers telling the recipient the encoding used:* Run the command  in a separate terminal to capture the message data.
