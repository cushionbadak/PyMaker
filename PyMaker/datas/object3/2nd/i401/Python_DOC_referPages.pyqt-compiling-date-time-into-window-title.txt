How can I put the compiling date/time into the window title?The following example will (of course) not work, because it will put the date and time into the title when the program was started.Well, I could type in the date and time manually in the source code everytime I'm compiling a new version. However, I'm hoping for a smart and automated solution. Any ideas?The code:Compiling by:The .spec file
One solution is that in .spec a code is written that creates a .py with the data:Then in your .py you import the file constants.py using the values generated in the compilation time:Finally you compile using the .spec:
It sounds like you could use  to grab the timestamp of your EXE file, and then report that in the window title. The only brittle part is making sure you have the path to your EXE known in an absolute fashion...So you'd change your  call above to  instead.
