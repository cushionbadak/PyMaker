I'm trying to make a discord bot, and I read that I need to have an older version of Python so my code will work. I've tried using "import discord" on IDLE but an error message keeps on coming up. How can I use Python 3.6 and keep Python 3.7 on my Windows 10 computer?
i will suggest u using anaconda.just create new environment named 'py36'then set python version is 3.6then run the environment.if u use pyCharm u can use anaconda's interpreter as the Project's interpreter.so problem solved.
Just install it in different folder (e.g. if current one is in C:\Users\noob\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37, install 3.6. to C:\Users\noob\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36).Now, when you'll want to run a script, right click the file and under "edit with IDLE" will be multiple versions to choose. Works on my machine :)
Install in different folder than your old Python 3.6 then update pathUsing Virtualenv and or PyenvUsing DockerHope it help!
