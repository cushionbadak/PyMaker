I can't get the function into scipy freqz form so I tried to solve directly in python, but can't convert the complex to a float variable. Wrong implementation?Gives the following error:
You are probably using the  function from the  module, which as stated in the  module documentationThese functions cannot be used with complex numbers; use the functions of the same name from the cmath module if you require support for complex numbers.So, as suggested you could use  instead. This would take care of your current error arising during the evaluation of . Unfortunately, with your posted code you will then get another error trying to compute the quantity  since  does not support array arguments (neither does  by the way). To resolve that second error you could create an array and evaluate the exponential on each array element, one at a time with a loop.However, since you are already using , it would just be a whole lot simpler to just use .Also adjusting  and  computations to span the whole spectrum, you should get the following:As a side note, the corresponding computation with  would look like:
