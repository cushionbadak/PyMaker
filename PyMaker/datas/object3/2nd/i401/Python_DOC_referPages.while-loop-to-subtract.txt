I am attempting to use a while loop to subtract from the input and then display the amount of items it could get based on the input. Now it randomly selects Food and in cost i am attempting to get it to match the randomly chosen Food to the List.I don't see why cost isn't working? But I also have not a clue how to display a variable amount of properties.
dont use str(randomfood) randomfood is allready str included list and move it in loop. every time it will be diffrent value
As @Patrick Artner suggested,  it's a better choice here (hah!). is a dictionary, to get values from a dictionary one must follow this syntax: 
A couple of things:First, you're converting the sample into a string in a way that will create extra characters around the Food, such as "['Taco']" as opposed to "Taco". You should use RandomFood[0] instead of str(RandomFood).Second, you are calling the item from the list incorrectly. You should use List[RFS] instead of List.RFSSo you're code should look like this:
