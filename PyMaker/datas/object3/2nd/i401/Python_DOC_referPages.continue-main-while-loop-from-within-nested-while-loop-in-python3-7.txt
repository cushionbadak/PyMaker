i decided to make a blackjack game, i have it finished, the only problem im having is that sometimes when you choose to play again, the program uses the same value for the variables. I'm pretty sure ive isolated the problem to the nested  loops, my code can be found here: https://pastebin.com/9zr9qCU6 ive tried to make the  function to return empty list objects for both  and  but that didnt fix it either, is there a way to continue the main  loop from within these nested  loops? or would i have to refactor each nested  loop into a separate function?code:
is there a way to continue the main while loop from within these nested while loops?No. See the Python doc,  always contine the innermost loop.would i have to refactor each nested while loop into a separate function?Yes. That's better. I am tired at reading your code because it is too long to understand quickly. A better pattern to your problem would be this:By using , you find a way to  or  an outer loop from an inner loop.
