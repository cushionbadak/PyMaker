I have a question on creating an r*c matrix with given number of rows and columns.I wrote this which takes r number of rows and c number of columns but the problem is in the output formatting, i require a exact output format and can't seem to get it even after trying for so long, if anyone could help me.see the difference is that mine prints "\n" after spaces and also on the last line. it is not a logical problem, just need help with the formatting.Thank You
You should use  to join a list of strings.This code produces a string of items from , separeted by , but also adds a white space at the end:Instead of that, do this:Or, more compact:You have the same problem with the newlines.  adds them after each line. You don't want them after the last line, so you should join the lines as well and then print them without a newline:
You can invert the problem:print a sublist if it is the first one - without newline after itif it is not the first one, print a newline followed by the next sublistthat way your last line does not have to  at its end:I optimized the code a bit as well - you should not use things like  as variable names - they hide the build in functions of the same name. Your list construction can be streamlined by a list comprehension that chunks your numbers list - see How do you split a list into evenly sized chunks? . You do not need to recompute the length of your sublist - it is  long.You need the index from  to decide if the list is "first" - and you need the  option of print to avoid autoprinting newlines.A simpler version without enumerate could be done using list slicing:
