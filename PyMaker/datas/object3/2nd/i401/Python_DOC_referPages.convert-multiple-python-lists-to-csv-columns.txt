When I print rows it has an extra  at the beginning. But this is not present when you print the two lists ( and ).Is there something wrong with the zip line? Or am I not writing it to the csv file correctly?

A string is a sequence, so passing a list of strings makes it use a string as a sequence of columns and list each character in a separate column. Also per the csv docs, use either of the following to open the file passed to :Full example:Output:
As an addendum on what @mark-tolonen wrote you could also use DictWriter from the builtin csv module.
