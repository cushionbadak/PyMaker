When writing a script, I sometimes use a function to encapsulate exactly what the script does. This is because I might want to call the function from code or run it as a script. Is there any way to avoid repeating the documentation of the function arguments in the help strings in argparse? For example: Since the arguments of the function and the script exactly correspond, you can see that I've had to document them twice ("The first argument", "The second argument"). Its a trivial problem, but its really annoying. Should I just not be using a function at all? 
Here is how I would write it...Ok, you see the magic line (beginning by ), it makes the documentation for the module which becomes:Then, docopt parses that and returns this dictionary:Which can be used to call the function and get the result:I like this solution because it is single line but I will agree with you that it isn't beautiful, I will let you write your own beautiful function that does that automatically for every file :o)
