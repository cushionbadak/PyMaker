Natural Text
I want to dump a dictionary to file, like in Dump Python dictionary to JSON file. But I faced with a problem with encoding:When I simply doI get something like this in terminal:So it is normal, human-readable text. But when I dump the same dictionary to some json file this way:There is strange mess of special characters in the file:I tried to specify ensure_ascii=False like here: Python Saving JSON Files as UTF-8, but it throws UnicodeEncodeError:All in all, how can I dump dictionary to JSON file without messing up with encoding?
You need to open the file specifying the file encoding.This way I have dumped your example data sucessfully.
