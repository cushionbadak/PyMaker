What would I write to iterate over a string and for each letter, if that letter is in a given dictionary (as a key), then add that key's value to an empty list?For example the string 'cat', I want to search a given dictionary for c, a, and t. Then for each value of each letter, add them to a new list that is a sum of points (values).I keep getting: TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterableHere's what I have so far:

Here is your code corrected : 
You can use the operator . Itâ€˜s faster than a list comprehension:
