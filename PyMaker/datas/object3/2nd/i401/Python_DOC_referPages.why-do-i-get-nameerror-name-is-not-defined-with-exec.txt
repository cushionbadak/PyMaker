When I try this code in a console (in PyCharm):it works fine. But when I try to do exactly the same in my program it doesn't work, and I get the exceptionI found that this code doesn't raise errors:But I can't understand why.What's going on?
You're not doing "exactly the same" in your program. That exact code, copied verbatim into a file and run as a Python script, works just fine (albeit with no visible result).What I think you might actually be doing is something like this:The above code does result in the  exception noted in your question, because (to quote the docs),In all cases, if the optional parts are omitted, the code is executed in the current scope.Since the code above imports  into the local scope of , it's not visible to .In fact, the code above is identical in behaviour to the following:â€¦ which also fails, for the same reason.Assuming this is what's actually going on in your real code, a version modified as in your question by adding  arguments to  would work, because then you're explicitly importing  into the global scope, where everything can see it.
