I want to change the behavior of the generator below so that it only yields even numbers. How can I do this? I'm aware that there simpler, clever ways to do this. This is a contrived HR challenge, where the The  function that I wrote does not yield the desired output. I can only change .I cannot change   nor the for loop below. Can I solve this with a decorator?
You can use the built in function Or a generator expression.Or  from the standard library:But if you only can change the  function, the "correct answer" to the challenge probably involves using generator.send() 
You don't need the parens on generator in your loop, and you don't seem to be printing the output of the right generator.  Updated version that works for me:
In your very specific problem, if you can't change the  part then you are pretty cornered because you can't change the instance of generator  that was created for .In what may be a frowned upon answer, in this particular case you might want to update the  to be reassigned to a new  after that:
