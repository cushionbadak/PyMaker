My program to find the second smallest number works as expected, but when running the code to find the second largest number, the second largest output is not correct. I did the second function in a similar way, but flipped the greater than sign. What is the best way to fix the code?
When you assign the new highest number, you need to assign the second highest to the old highest number.
You did not set a variable to hold the largest value. It would work if it you create a  variable to hold the largest value and assigned it to the second largest afterwardsAlso, if would be better if you start the iteration from index 2 of the array as first and second is already assigned.
at the top, where you declareDo you realise that you are accessing the zeroth and first elements in the list, that isAnd incidentally the zeroth element (ie = 1) just happens to be the smallest element in that list, which is why it works for one of the functions but not the other.What should work, is
Why not use heapq?More information on https://docs.python.org/2/library/heapq.html
The simplest approach here is simply using the python builtins  and . Note that we're making a copy of the incoming list, so that the original  sn't affected by the :Output:There's no nead to do any comparisons. We're simply finding the  and , then removing them from a copy, and subsequently taking the  and  from the remainders.Note that I've abstracted  from the functions, but leaving them in the functions would work. This approach allows you to reuse the functions with different lists in your code.Alternatively, as mentioned in another answer here, from @andercruzbr, you can import the  module, and simply do:Output:
