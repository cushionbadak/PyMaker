Natural Text
The problem that I'm having with my test image is what I like to call the "It looks like we don't support this file format." error since thats what it says when I open the image.This is a link to this code and the test image that I used:https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/496421060565139466/548261637782503425/Reading_and_writing_a_file_useing_file_bytes.zip
Image data is not text, don't open images in text mode. Not for reading, and not for writing.In Python, you open files in one of two modes: text mode, and binary mode, using  or  in the  argument. If you use neither,  is implied.Text mode is merely an extra layer on top of binary mode where the binary data is translated from and to text, using a standard text codec. The vast majority of image formats, including PNG, are not text formats, and you can't decode their data with a text codec.So always open these in binary mode, adding in the  character in the file mode:Text codecs are just one form of storing information in a series of bytes, image formats such as PNG are another, and are not designed to have meaning as text. That you can always decode image data as Latin-1 is a coincidence, an accident of how the Latin-1 codec is designed, and not intentional.As a side note: it is usually a bad idea to use , as it catches all exceptions, not just errors with opening a file or decoding errors that will always spring from trying to read PNG data as UTF-8. Use specific exceptions, wherever possible.
