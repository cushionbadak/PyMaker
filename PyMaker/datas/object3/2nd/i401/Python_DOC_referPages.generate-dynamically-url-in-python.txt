A URL is really just a string, any of the usual string manipulation techniques would do here. Your component parts don't have any characters in them that would require URL-encoding here either, making the whole process simpler.If you do have component parts that use characters that are not in the list of unreserved characters, then use the  function to convert those characters to URL-safe components.You could use  with  to join string parts:or you could use a formatted string literal:This approach has the advantage that the components don't have to be strings; if  and  are integers, you don't have to explicitly convert them to strings first.Or, since URL paths work a lot like POSIX filesystem paths, you could use the  class to contruct the path:In all cases, you end up with a final URL to use in :
