I am trying to read the frames using  API. I have a  as an object which I have received using . I have the following frame reader function Traceback:I tried to use as commented in the code but it is not useful in this case. I also tried to convert a float value to integer but it showing the same error. I would appreciate your advice on this. thank you.
In the release notes for the version 2.5.0 of imageio they mention some changes they introduced to the ffmpeg plugin:"The reader of the ffmpeg plugin now always reports inf as the number of frames. Use reader.count_frames() to get the actual number, or estimate it from the fps and duration in the meta data."https://imageio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/releasenotes.html#version-2-5-0-06-02-2019That should fix your problem.
