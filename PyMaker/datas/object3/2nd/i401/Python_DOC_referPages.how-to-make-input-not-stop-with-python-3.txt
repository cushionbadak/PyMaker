This question already has an answer here:Grab user input asynchronously and pass to an Event loop in python                    2 answers                here is my code. So basicly i want to make this to count forever and when i type something is stops -breaks- the but instead it asks for an input for every loop. Is this even possible?
You'll need to split your code into two threads, one which continuously prints and the other which listens for input. When the input listener receives an input it will need to send a message to the printing thread to stop.
