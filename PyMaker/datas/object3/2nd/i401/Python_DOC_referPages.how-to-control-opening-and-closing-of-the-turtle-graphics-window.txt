I am writing a program for generating images using the python turtle graphics module. Is there a way to control when the window opens and closes? I know that  and  close the window, but then it is problem to open it again. Currently I open the window just by assigning  to a variable like this: I looked in documentation and also here but I didn't find anything.
Here's something demonstrating how to hide and redisplay the turtle-graphics window without requiring user input to do so. It uses the tkinter  method to schedule a future call to the function I've named  (if you're interested).It accomplishes this by "reaching under the covers" and getting the underlying  root window and manipulating it. To allow the user to execute several "commands" it reschedules itself to run gain by making a call to  itself (unless the user typed in "exit"). You may not need to that for what you're doing.
