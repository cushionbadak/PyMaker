I was putting this idea How to make a cross-module variable? in action for python3.And was lazy enough to use the variable  instead of the module . Which should make no difference because: This is when it gets funny:  is not  when imported:Does anyone know what happens? (A comment on the given page mentions " is a CPython peculiarity, you really shouldn't use it", but I'm being curious...) 
I don't really know why, but from articleframe globals have a  variable (builtins dictionary, or  builtins module when  equals )so in your first case () and you get  as  module, but in the second case ()  is a  instance and from docs:The value of  is normally either this module or the value  of this moduleâ€™s  attribute.TestWith slightly modified we will get something likeConclusionAs you & @chepner have already noticed  is an implementation detail that can be changed, so we shouldn't rely on it, especially on it being a  module/ object.
