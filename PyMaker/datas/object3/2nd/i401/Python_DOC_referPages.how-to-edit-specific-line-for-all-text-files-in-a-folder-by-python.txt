Natural Text
Here below is my code about how to edit text file.Since python can't just edit a line and save it at the same time,I save the previous text file's content into a list first then write it out.For example,if there are two text files called sample1.txt and sample2.txt in the same folder.Sample1.txtA for apple. Second line.Third line.Sample2.txtFirst line. An apple a day.Third line.Execute pythonSample1.txtbanana Second line.Third line.Sample2.txtFirst line. bananaThird line.That's how I edit specific line for text file.My question is : Is there any method can do the same thing?Like using the other functions or using the other data type rather than list.Thank you everyone.  
Simplify it to this:and then write value of  to file back.
Instead of putting all the lines in a list and writing it, you can read it into memory, replace, and write it using same file.Then you can loop through all of your files and apply this function
The built-in  module makes this quite simple: redirects  into the active file.
