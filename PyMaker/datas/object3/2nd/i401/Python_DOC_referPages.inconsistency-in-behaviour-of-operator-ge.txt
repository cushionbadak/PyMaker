Any explanation for the difference in the behaviour?Later found out:too :)
It's obviously the difference between the way that Python and Numpy deal with arrithmatic operations.  is the same as . If one of the operands is a Numpy object the corresponding method will be called and if the other operand is an array it will perform the comparison in an element-wise manner. That is, if you do the following you'll get the same result:Python in other hand, deals with the situation differently in both 2 and 3 versions. You're presumably using Python-2.X and it has it's related logic (almost ilogical lol) but in python 3 you can't compare objects in different types, unless the respective operation is explicitly implemented for one of the objects. For built-in objects except different numeric types, objects with different types never compare equal. Read https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#comparisons for more details.
