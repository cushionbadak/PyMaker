I am looking for a method to make my python script process data with the same name but located in multiple directories. Specifically I am looking to make images out of the data at different time steps. I have a code that parses the data and creates one image at a time but I would rather have it go through all of the directories and do it all for me rather than doing it manually. The format of the directories/files is as follows: Main directory: filename: 2Dvizualization.pyDir1: td.0000000filename: sqm-wf-k001-st0001.dxfilename: sqm-wf-k001-st0001_gs.dxDir2: td.0000400filename: sqm-wf-k001-st0001.dxfilename: sqm-wf-k001-st0001_gs.dxDir3: td.0000800filename: sqm-wf-k001-st0001.dxfilename: sqm-wf-k001-st0001_gs.dx...Dir_final: td.016400filename: sqm-wf-k001-st0001.dxfilename: sqm-wf-k001-st0001_gs.dxand the script I have written to do it manually is:I would like to save each of the images to some file called sqm****.png.Is there a way to loop over all of these directories and output the images as such? Any insight would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!
You have to go through your directory tree and find the files you want to process.In your case I would wrap your actual code in a function and then define another function to find the files and pass them to your processing function.You can easily walk your directories using os.walk, so this would be an example for your problem:
