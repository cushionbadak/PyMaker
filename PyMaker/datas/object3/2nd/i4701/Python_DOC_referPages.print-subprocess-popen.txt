The error is that you're not passing a single string, but multiple separate arguments:If you look at the  constructor in the docs, that means you're passing  as the  string, passing  as the , and passing  as the .

(It may actually work on Windows, but not on *nix, and you shouldn't do it even on Windows.) In the edited version of your question, you're not doing that, so it's still wrong.While we're at it, you really don't need to create a  object and  with it if that's literally all you're doing. A simpler solution is:Also, if you're having problems debugging a complicated expression like yours, it really helps to break it into separate pieces that you can debug separately (with extra s, or debugger breakpoints):This is essentially the same thing, with nearly the same efficiency, but easier to read and easier to debug.And when I run this with , I get exactly the output you're looking for:
