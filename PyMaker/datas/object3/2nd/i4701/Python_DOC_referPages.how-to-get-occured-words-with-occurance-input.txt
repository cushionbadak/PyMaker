Thanks in advance.edited code;and it gives me error;File "", line 5      if words.count(f) == 2:       ^ IndentationError: expected an indented block
The error message "expected an indented block" means that it expects the code to look like this:Note that each sub-block after a colon is written one more space to the right. Better practice is to use larger indentation, such as four spaces.
