Natural Text
I am trying to replace a selected text with a single word from that selected text using regex. I tried re.sub() but it seems that it takes the second argument "The word that I want to replace it with the text" as a string, not as regex. Here is my string: And here is my code:I get:My goal is: Does Python support replacing two strings using Regex?
Here's another solution (I also rewrote the regex using "non-greedy" modifiers by putting  after  because I find it more readable).The group referenced by  is done with parenthises as an unnamed group. Also used  as a style preference to reduce the number of args:Named group alternative:You can find some docs on group referencing here:https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax
You would need to match the target word in the pattern, as a capturing group - you can't start an entirely new search in the replacement string!Not tested, but this should do the job:Replace With 
What you're looking for is regex capture groups. Instead of selecting the regex and then trying to replace it with another regex, put the part of your regex you want to match inside parenthesis in your select statement, then get it back in the replacement with \1. (the number being the group you included)
