This question already has an answer here:Asking the user for input until they give a valid response                    17 answers                I've 2 questions with the following code:Questions:1 - How can I accept the input as one of positive variable options ('yes','Yes','y','Y') ?2 - How can I have the month variable written in the input question instead of March hardcoded (as it is in this moment)?3 - I don't know how to keep running the code when users users press "Y" then Enter. It keeps repeating the question instead of running the print(month) code. Thank you very much in advance
The below solution resolves several problems with your code.ExplanationTest  versus the sets you have defined.Use  to incorporate a variable in your  string.Use  instead of  to exit a loop after a positive value is entered; if you wish, you can include your "success" tasks inside the loop before .
That's one of the possible solutions (note that I am using list a list). If you want to support even more options without extending a list you might be interested in adding some RegExp.
