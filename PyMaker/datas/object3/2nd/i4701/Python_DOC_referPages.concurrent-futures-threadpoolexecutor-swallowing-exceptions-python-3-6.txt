I'm trying to use  in Python 3.6 on Windows 7 and it seems that the exceptions are silently ignored or stop program execution. Example code:The output:It's hanging there until I kill it with Ctrl+C. However, when I remove  from , Task #1 completes without problem:I need to capture the exceptions raised in functions running in  somehow.Python 3.6 (Minconda), Windows 7 x64.
 returns a future object that represents the result of the computation, once it's available. In order to not ignore the exceptions raised by the job, you need to actually access this result. First, you can change  to return the created futures:Then, have the top-level code wait for the futures to complete, and access their results:Calling  on a future whose execution raised an exception will propagate the exception to the caller. In this case the  will get raised at top-level.
You can handle the exceptions with a  statement. This is how your  method could look like:Output when the method is used within your script:
