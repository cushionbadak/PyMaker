Which of the following describes the behavior of ?cwd  first: look in working directory first, then the pathpath first: look in the path, then the working directoryConsider the following scripts:Change PathChange CwdCombined ScriptSuppose there something named  in both sys.path and the cwd,and that the  in the system path is not the same  in the cwdDid we just import  from sys.path? or   from the cwd?
Only  is used to search for files to load as modules; Python does not look at other directories outside of .¹ The current working directory will be searched only if  (the empty string) is in the path², so if there is an  in both the current working directory and another directory in the path, the one that will be loaded is whichever comes first in the path.You will find that  appears at the front of  automatically when you run the Python interpreter directly (including when you run ). This is standard Python behaviour. However, if you run a script directly (e.g., typing just  where it starts with ) instead that script's directory (e.g.,  if your shell found and ran ) will be added to the front of the path. (The script itself may of course add further items to the front of the path as it runs.)¹ Actually, this is not entirely true;  queries finders in  first. Those can look anywhere they like and may not even use .² You could also use ,  or various similar ideas in the path, though getting tricky like that is just asking for trouble.
