Why do you ask such a thing here?https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html4.3. Installing Additional Python Packages  There are several methods to install additional Python packages:Packages can be installed via the standard Python distutils mode (python setup.py install).  Many packages can also be installed via the setuptools extension or pip wrapper, see https://pip.pypa.io/.https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#installing-packagesInstalling Packages  pip supports installing from PyPI, version control, local projects, and directly from distribution files.The most common scenario is to install from PyPI using Requirement Specifiers           # latest version       # specific version       # minimum version  For more information and examples, see the pip install reference.
Just a suggestion, before you run any command that you don't know what is it, please use  or  to find its path.
