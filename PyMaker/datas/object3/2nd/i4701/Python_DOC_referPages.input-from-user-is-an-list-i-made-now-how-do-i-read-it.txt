Natural Text
Basicly I've been trying to make this word generator, which displays your input in a big font in the console. I'm trying to take the user's input, then put each char individually in a list. So now the first item in the list is 'a' for example (with the input being 'apple' for example). Now there's a list I made called a. I want to print that list by the user's input (a). How do I do so? This is my code:
 contains the wordmake it a dictionary where the letter is the key and the values are in an array: iterate over the count of items in the array with  using : iterate over the word letters, getting the mapped symbols: join with a space: finally join all lines with a newlineThat should get you started. Feel free to try and post your results. We can help you once you have some code.(optional) learn list comprehensions and come up with a one-liner for some unreadable fun
Create a dictionary that maps each letter to the corresponding list:
