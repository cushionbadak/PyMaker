This question already has an answer here:How do I compare 2D lists for equality in Python?                    2 answers                for 2d lists i am using two for loops(nested) and comparing each element with other(d[i][j]==e[i][j])...is there any better method?Assume both lists are of same sizei am new to python with little C backgroundIs it possible without numpy library?      
See Chapter 5 in the Python documentation â€“ Comparing Sequences and Other Types:The comparison uses lexicographical ordering: first the first two items are compared, and if they differ this determines the outcome of the comparison; if they are equal, the next two items are compared, and so on, until either sequence is exhausted. If two items to be compared are themselves sequences of the same type, the lexicographical comparison is carried out recursively. If all items of two sequences compare equal, the sequences are considered equal.You should use the  operator, which is overloaded to work for collections (and pretty much any two comparable objects) too.
