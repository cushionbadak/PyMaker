I have a function that accepts an arbitrary file handle and either loads all the data or allows the data to be loaded lazily if the object supports random access.How can I check if a file object supports random access?
You can use  method to check if the file supports random access.seekable()Return  if the stream supports random access. If , ,  and  will raise .
An alternative approach in line with the Python convention of EAFP is to just assume the file object supports random access and handle the exception that occurs when it doesn't:
