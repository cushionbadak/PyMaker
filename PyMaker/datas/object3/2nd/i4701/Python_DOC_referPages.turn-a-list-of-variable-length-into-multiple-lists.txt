Natural Text
I am writing a script that takes user input of however many characters and I want to put each one of the characters into its own list to be then manipulated.Output:I was able to get it into a single list like this: ['A','V','I'] but that becomes too confusing for what I want to do later.
Consider using  with . Now you can even retrieve your letters by location.I struggle to see how you know which letters to access when the user is inputting a string, so it doesn't make sense to name your variables (or, here, keys) after the letters themselves.
If you really want to have a variable named after itself, Use a mapping thus:Then access it like so:Or, enumerate for an index (thanks jpp):
I think you need to use a for loop and in the for write if-else conditions and for inserting any character that you want into your lists use appned() method.
