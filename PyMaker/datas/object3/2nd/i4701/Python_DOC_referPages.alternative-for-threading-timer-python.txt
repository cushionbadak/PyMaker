I am trying to implement a timer for calling the function for printing the queue after specific time .I am also able to cancel the timer if the queue gets filled before that specified time and print the queue.But after that my timer object behaves abruptly causing timers to overlap for example if the queue gets filled in 2 sec then it prints the queue in 2,8,2,8... time interval instead of 2,10 time interval
I have solved the issue by cancelling the timer to prevent its own duplicacy
You could nest a if statement inside the timer that says if queue is full then disable this if statement then let the timer continue until its done without affecting the queue. I don't think it will cause conflict with your program because the timer is probably a closure.
