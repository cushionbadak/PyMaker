You will also be comparing their left over expenses to an amount of money they need to save every week. I believe I have it all finished except for this problem whenever I run the program, I get the following message:How can I solve this error? What would be the correct way to code this? It would be easier to understand with the original code for my program:

Try this:You have defined the expenses as a tuple.  You can all of the values in the tuple together with .
