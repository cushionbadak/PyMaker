I'm attempting to unit test an asynchronous socket server and using  to make pytest compatible with the async code base. The server, once started, is always up to send a reply via a while loop, and probably spends most of its time awaiting an incoming message in . The problem is there's no way to cancel this task before the unit test framework terminates the event loop and this warning gets issued:Task was destroyed but it is pending!task: < Task pending coro=< Server.new_client() done, defined at /[...path...]/server.py:16> wait_for=< Future pending cb=[< TaskWakeupMethWrapper object at 0x106d7cbe8>()]>>The only task it appears I have access to is the task created by , which seems to not be the same task. That task looks like this:task: < Task pending coro=< start_server() running at  /usr/local/Cellar/python/[...different path...]/streams.py:86>>So calling  on this task is having no effect.How can this unit test be written to cleanly start and start the server for each test and not cut off tasks which may still be running?Here's the example:test_server.pyserver.pyIf you want to run this example just run  and pytest can pick up this plugin.
You have to  after calling .Your fixture should thus look like this:And the  method of your  should look like this:See the documentation for details.
The  method does not completely stop the server. It merely stops accepting new connections. Any connections created before close will continue to execute until finished.According to the documentation (emphasis mine):Stop serving: close listening sockets and set the sockets attribute to None.The sockets that represent existing incoming client connections are left open.The server is closed asynchronously, use the wait_closed() coroutine to wait until the server is closed.In this example, all connections are sent to the infinite  method.A better solution is to create a collection of Tasks in  responsible for executing  logic instead of awaiting the method directly. With this approach, all open Tasks can be terminated cleanly in the  method.
