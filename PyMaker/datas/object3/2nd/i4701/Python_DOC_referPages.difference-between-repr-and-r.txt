Following the PEP 3101, I try to use as often as possible the format() method.In the Explicit Conversion Flag chapter, it is possible to read:!r - convert the value to a string using  repr().Indeed:But:I don't understand why this exception is raised, because a string have always the repr() method !!??I think I miss something ...
It's not saying there is no  method; it's saying the value used for this placeholder has no attribute named . The format string is not an arbitrary Python expression. is roughly the same as , not .
Read carefully the error message. It says  was not found. Note the parenthesis in the attribute name. It is an invalid indentifier.The reason is here:The expression inside curly brackets is a format string and it has its own syntax. You can access items and attributes, but not call functions or build arbitrary expressions.
