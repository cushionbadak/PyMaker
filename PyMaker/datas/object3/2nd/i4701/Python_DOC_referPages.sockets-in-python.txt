im writting an app using python and sockets, here is piece of the server code:this needs two clients to connect, everything is fine except clients don't receive full data:for example one gets:3♠ for other2♠ for you10♣ for other10♦ for youA♣ for otherthe other gets:2♠ for you10♣ for other10♦ for youA♣ for otherwhat should i do?client code:
The problem is that TCP sockets are byte streams, not message streams. When you  some data and the client does a , there's no guarantee that it will receive everything you sent. It may get half the message. It may get multiple messages at once.I've explained this at some length in a blog post—but fortunately, you're actually only hitting half the problem, and it's ultimately the simpler half. You've chosen to use a stream of  messages as your protocol, and  is a self-delimiting (aka framed) protocol. can load pickle after pickle out of anything with a file-like interface. And if your client and server are built around blocking I/O (e.g., using a thread for each direction on the socket), you can simulate  by doing blocking  calls and appending them onto a buffer until you have enough bytes to satisfy the .And, even better, you don't have to do that yourself, because that's exactly what the builtin  does. I haven't done any more than a quick test with this, so I won't promise it's bulletproof, but…On the client side, you probably have something like this:Change it to this:And it just works.Again, you should test this. And you should read either my blog post, or a more complete primer on sockets programming and TCP, to understand what's going on. And really, you're probably better off designing your app around a higher-level framework ( is really cool, especially with the syntactic support in Python 3.5+, or I think Twisted already has a pickle protocol class pre-written for you…). But this may be enough to get you started.
