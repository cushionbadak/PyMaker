I would like to implement a function  that rounds a float to at least  decimal places and at most . I want it to return a string. I have something that works, but it was surprisingly long. Can you write something more pythonic than me?UsageI think you get the idea. Here's what I've got.
You're confusing float rounding with print formatting.*The float  is a different number than . So rounding  to 2 digits makes sense.But the float  is the exact same number as . So rounding  to 2 digits isn't going to do anything; it's still going to be the same thing you started with.Meanwhile, if you want to change the way numbers are printed out, you can do that using the  function, the  method, f-strings,  formatting, etc. For example:See Format Specification Mini-Language for details on how to use f-strings (and  and ), and -Style String Formatting for details on how to use .* Either that, or you're expecting floats to keep track of their precision and preserve it through a chain of operations. If that's what you're after, floats can't do that, but  can, so you may want to look at the  module. But I don't think that's what you want here.
Just some small improvements, but keeping the basic idea (convert value, strip zeroes, strip trailing decimal point).First change is to avoid name clash with builtin functions  and . I think that using functions designed for the particular purpose ( for value formatting,  for stripping from right,  for testing the last character) makes it little bit more pythonic.
