Would like to ask question related to nested lists in Python. I have a nested list I want to perform rounding and dision operation on nested list but keep it grouped as it is now (to make it more clear I need to flatten list perform operations and that unflatten it again in same groups).For example the result for list 'list_1' after division by 2 shoud beThe code I use to perform this for signle list is below:Could you please suggest way to solve this issue. Currently I am getting error Thank you.
Fixing your code -If you're worried about performance, you could multiply by .5 instead of dividing by 2 (you may not see significant differences considering this is a quadratic solution, but it should count for something).The docs have a section just for Nested List Comprehensions, please consider having a read through.
