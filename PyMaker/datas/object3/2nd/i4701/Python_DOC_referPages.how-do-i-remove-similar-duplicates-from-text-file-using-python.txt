I have written the following python code to remove the duplicates:The code above functions correctly and removes the exact same duplicates, but I want to be able to remove duplicates that have 3 or more exact word matches from a line. For instance:The output with the current code is: But I want to remove the phrase 'The apple red' as well because it has 3 matching words in the line. I hope this makes sense. How do I write this in python? 
A very simple approach that may do what you want is to iterate over a list of the sets of words that have been seen in each line so far:yieldsOf course, this ignores some of the subtleties alluded to in the comments to your question. You may be better off with a specialized library such as .
Take a look at string distance functions:Hamming distanceLevenshtein distanceJaroâ€“Winkler distanceThere are also Python packages for fuzzy string matching - I believe this one implements method 2. These aren't going to do the word matching like you mentioned, but the string distance is perhaps a more robust method of achieving your goal.
