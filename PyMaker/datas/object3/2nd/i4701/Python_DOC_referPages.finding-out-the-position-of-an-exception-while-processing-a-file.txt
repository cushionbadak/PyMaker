I'm processing some semi-structured documents in Python and I have some code that reads the file into a tuple and loops through each line and performs a function. Is there a way of finding the exact line in the processed file where an error is encountered?The result should be:
 should help:The above would give an error like: Although as good practice you'd generally replace  with whatever error you're expecting to catch.
In general, it is good practice to use the  keyword when you are reading from a file, especially if you expect an Exception to occur. You can also  to count the lines:It's best to not use  if you know the specific Exception you are expecting because it will catch all Exceptions, even those you don't expect.
