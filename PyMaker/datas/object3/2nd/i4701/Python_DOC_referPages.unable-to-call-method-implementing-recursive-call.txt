I'm a python beginner. When I tried to implement the BinarySearchTree below, I got the following errorAny help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!
The problem is that you've defined your method as a , but then you're trying to use it as a normal method.With a normal method, when you do , it calls, giving you that  value as a  argument.With a static method,  just calls . There is no  argument.So, the error is because you're asking for  but only passing . Just as the exception says, you're one argument short.And meanwhile, you're trying to use that  within the method body, so you can't just get rid of it.If you really want this to be a staticmethod on the tree, since the only thing you're actually doing with  is calling a staticmethod on the class, you can use the class name explicitly, like this:And then your code will work. Well, it'll get rid of that exception; it still has other bugs (like not returning the result of the recursive call back up the chain).But I don't understand why you wanted a staticmethod in the first place.My guess is that you're trying to port what's basically a ML-translated-to-Java design. In Java, putting a bunch of free functions in a useless class counts as OO. In Python, you don't need to do that; you just have free functions on the module. A staticmethod doesn't really give you anything extra here except confusion.Or you can actually translate this to OO. For example, if you merge the tree and node types (or turn the tree into a node handle for the root that passes the method through), you can make  a perfectly normal method. Then you have to put the  check before each recursive call instead of at the top, but that's it.
