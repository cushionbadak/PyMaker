I'm using python3.6 in windows7 and django 1.9I got this error when i run my code.In my code i'm parsing xml data to write a html page. I got that some character is unable to encode properly thats why its throwing an error. this is the character(less than or equal) which is the root cause of the error.My question is how to encode this properly in python3Detailed Error Log:
The error message indicates that you're trying to encode to the Windows-1252 character encoding. That encoding doesn't have a representation of the less than or equal symbol.The answer is to use UTF-8, an unrestricted encoding, instead of Windows-1252, a very restricted encoding. Your question doesn't include much context, but the line  makes me think you're using Python's file protocol. The documentation for  shows how to set the encoding, e.g.Note that "the default encoding is platform dependent (whatever  returns)", which is why you're getting Windows-1252 on Windows 7.
