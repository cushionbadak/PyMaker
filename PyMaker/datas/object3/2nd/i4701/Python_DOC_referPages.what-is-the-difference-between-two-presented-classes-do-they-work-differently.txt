What is the difference between this two implementations of Singleton. Does creating of variable _instance in parent class make it work differently from the second class?
For the code posted, there is no difference.If your subclasses implement  or  however, the first example will fail, as  could return  even when an instance has been set. You really want to use  instead:Other than that, the differences are cosmetic.You also want to use identity testing to check if a singleton implementation work correctly; a subclass could implement the  method and return  even if the two objects are distinct (so not singletons):
Agreed with @Martijin Pieters answer,Besides, provide another way to implement Singleton, called Borg, which share the same state:
