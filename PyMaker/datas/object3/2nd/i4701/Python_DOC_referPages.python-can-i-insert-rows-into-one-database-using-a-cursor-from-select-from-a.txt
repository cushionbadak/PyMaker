I am trying to select data from our main database (postgres) and insert it into a temporary sqlite database for some comparision, analytics and reporting. Is there an easy way to do this in Python? I am trying to do something like this:Get data from the main Postgres db:Insert into SQLite table:So the question is: is there a  that would work for this scenario (either using pyodbc or using sqlite3)?If yes, how to use it? Would the  above work? or should it be modified?Any other suggestions/approaches would also be appreciated in case a function like this doesn't exist in Python. Thanks in advance!
You can look at executemany from pyodbc or sqlite. If you can build a list of parameters from your select, you can pass the list to executemany. Depending on the number of records you plan to insert, performance can be a problem as referenced in this open issue. https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/issues/120
You should pass the result of your select query to .You should also use a parameterized query (? marks), as explained here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Cursor.executeIf you want to avoid loading the entire source database into memory, you can use the following code to process 100 rows at a time:
