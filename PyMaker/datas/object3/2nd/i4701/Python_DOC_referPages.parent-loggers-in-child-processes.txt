In the Logging Cookbook on Python, there are the following comments in the section "A moreelaborate multiprocessing example":What is exactly the problem of having a parent logger in a child process?
The (potential) problem is that if the parent process continues to log as well as the child, they will potentially be logging to the same handlers (because of how  works on POSIX) and you can't guarantee that writing to a single file from two processes concurrently will work correctly. See the first paragraph of this section in the cookbook.
