Natural Text
I have a list of tuples  and an index. I want to check if the index is inside the range of those tuples, for example,  is while  is not. My code to do so is the following: However, I also want to return if the index is in the first second ... segment of the list seg. For example, for the  to return  and for the  to return . How can I do so?
You can use  +  with generator expression:Or, if you want to iterate over:thanks  for the hint about the default option of the  function. (It can be used in cases where the given index is not in any of the ranges represented by the tuples)
As others have pointed out, you can use  to get the indexes. I'd also argue that if you are treating the tuples as ranges, you should make them ranges. This then makes the check to see if the value is inside the range very intuitive: .Obviously using ranges has some cost (if you are in Python 2.x, this is comparatively huge because it will make actual lists of all the values, and unfortunately  return objects without  implemented). If you are doing this kind of thing in lots of places, it's much nicer, however.You may be able to just replace your tuple construction with range construction, depending on the situation, rather than doing the starmap.
Assuming the following:List is orderedFirst number is less than second numberno overlapping
