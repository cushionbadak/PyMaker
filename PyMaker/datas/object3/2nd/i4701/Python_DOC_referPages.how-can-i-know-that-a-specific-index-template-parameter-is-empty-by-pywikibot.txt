you can use  - the regular expression library to search for a pattern:Also, if you are dealing with processing utf8 text, it's better to move to python3 as it has much better support for that.
I've came across a similar situation,Parsing templates with pywikibot seems to me not good enough (using 'extract_templates_and_params_regex_simple' and 'glue_template_and_params' from textlib).My solution finally used - mwparserfromhell.This library is more convenient while trying to parse/change templates (and their arguments).There is a potentially problem in your code, you are not searching for any template, so if somehow two templates will use the same argument you will change both (you can still ignore that, but jfyi).Using mwparserfromhell + pywikibot will be like (using 'page' from your code):
