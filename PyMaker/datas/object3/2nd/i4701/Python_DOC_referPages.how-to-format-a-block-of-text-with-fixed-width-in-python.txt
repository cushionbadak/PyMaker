Natural Text
I'm trying to generate a string which looks like this:where the names and phone numbers vary and need to be interpolated in, and the phone numbers should be aligned. For this example, I've used the following template:Instead of adding the spaces in manually, I'd like the total width of the string to adapt to the longest of  and .So far, all I've been able to come up with following https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/string.html is the following:which producesThe problem is that the total width, , is still hard-coded into the template, and I don't see how to add the  after the name because this produces spaces between the name and the apostrophe. Any ideas how to tackle this?
You can use nested format specifiers, an often overlooked feature:The documentation only mentions them in passing, which probably explains why they're relatively unknown:A format_spec field can also include nested replacement fields within  it. These nested replacement fields may contain a field name,  conversion flag and format specification, but deeper nesting is not  allowed. The replacement fields within the format_spec are substituted  before the format_spec string is interpreted. This allows the  formatting of a value to be dynamically specified.
Here is another solution using f-strings, following https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/#format-specifiers:which producesas required.
