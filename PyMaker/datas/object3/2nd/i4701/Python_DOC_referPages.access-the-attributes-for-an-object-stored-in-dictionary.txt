I am setting some attributes for an object of a class in a function outside the class and store the object in a dictionary. I cannot see the change in stored values of the object, the default initialized values are retrieved.Prints blank, which is the default value. Is the object being deleted from the memory by garbage cleaner after going out of scope? Is there a better way to do this?
You need to use  like:Code:Test Code:Results:
