I'm trying to collect real-time data with , but it doesn't support  for now, so I thought  would be a better option than simple strings, from the standpoint of storage efficiency(8bits vs more than 8 bits). I want to record event times with microsecond precision.From these web pages(https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html, https://pymotw.com/2/time/index.html), I read that timestamps that I get by  is calculated in UTC, but now I think something's different from what I read.I don't understand why they are different. If timestamps are calculated in UTC, I think they should be the same. I have another question. I'd like to know how to add some amount of time to timestamps. For example, I want to know how to do this with timestamps. 
 is the utc time,  is the local time, which depends on your time zone.To add to timestamp, you just need to convert the  to seconds:
