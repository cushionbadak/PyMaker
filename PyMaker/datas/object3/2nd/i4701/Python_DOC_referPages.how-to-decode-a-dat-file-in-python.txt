Natural Text
I'm trying to read bytes from a DAT file. I know the data is supposed to be in either Binary or Hex. But when I try to read the bytes it prints out weird symbols. I'm assuming they are ascii values. I tried converting them but I keep getting the error message that 'str' cannot be converted. Does anyone know how I can decode it? And is read() the correct function to use for this?Here is the link to a screenshot of the weird symbols I get
If your  file is not text, you should open it as a binary file with  (per Python docs): You'll have to decode the bytes yourself:Files opened in binary mode (including 'b' in the mode argument) return contents as bytes objects without any decoding.
