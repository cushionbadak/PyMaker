I am trying to create a program that creates a character by randomly assigning it a race, class, and stats.However I want each stat to have a unique value. So if  is 8, then none of the other stats can be 8. How would I go about doing this? Do I need to delete list entries as choices are made?My code
Create a random permutation of the  list and then assign the ,  etc. in order of the permutation. This has the added benefit that you won't need to reset the list before creating a new character.As a side note, there is no need to assign a default of  to , etc. because they will be changed immediately afterward. 
Like you said in your question you could delete entries from the list:Like it is said in the answer above me, a good solution would also be to use . Plus a hint when you write for example   you declare the variable Strength in that moment and give it a value so you don't have to declare it above it so you can delete all those  and etc.
What you showed us work for 1 character. But what if we want to create hundreds of them. In Python everything is a class and in this case a strongly recommend using it.Look at this simple example:A class can hold variables and other functions and in this case we create three variables (race, cls and stats) and we add a print function to easy print what we wnat.Returned this when I ran it:
You can store the value of random.choice in a temp. variable and use
