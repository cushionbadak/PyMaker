I am a python noob trying to parse through an XML API response using Elementtree. The response contains custom data from a form and I am having trouble trying to access some of the nested elements. Below is my code:Through this call I am able to get this response: I am trying to access the DEALID# (123456789) as well as HELPME inside [CDATA[helpme]] elements. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!

Code below should find and print out each deal id that it finds. finds element which has an attribute  equal to . This is example use of Xpath syntax
