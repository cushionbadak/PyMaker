Natural Text
I have written a script to convert a text file into dictionary..script.pytextfile.txtThe output i have got is Able to convert upto 9th line in the text file. Suggest me where I am going wrong..  
So you need to know two things at any given time while looping over the file:1) Are we on a title level or content level (by indentation) and2) What is the current titleIn the following code, we first check if the current line we are at, is a title (so it does not start with a space) and set the  to that as well as insert that into our dictionary as a key and an empty list as a value.If it is not a title, we just append to corresponding title's list.
You never commit (i.e. run ) the final list to the dictionary.You can simply commit  when you create the row:
Using  to create dictionary with lists as values will make your job easier.Output:A few things to note here:Always use  for file operations.If you want to check the first index, or the first few indices, use The same can be done using :
Try this:
Just for the sake of adding in my 2 cents. This problem is easier to tackle backwards. Consider iterating through your file backwards and then storing the values into a dictionary whenever a header is reached.
Just keep track the line which start with ' ' and you are done with one loop only  :output:
