I'd like different processes to append to the same list:However,What am I doing wrong?EDIT: The problem was that there was traceback in my original code which wasn't printed on the screen. For example if I run the code above and  doesn't exist, the rest of the code isn't evaluated, but there is no exception raised. Is there a way to make multiprocessing print tracebacks so that I can debug the code?
Because you haven't waited tasks to finish.
