I'm trying to develop a script that interacts with  and . I want to write a simple python script that run each cli command and runs an exit code after each call. for example I get a result like thisI want to be able to run an IF statement (if possible) to stop the script if any number other than 0 exit code pops up. keep in mind my script will be making several calls using Saleforce cli commands which should hopefully all result in 0, however just in case one of the many calls fails I need some means of stopping the script. Any advice or help is greatly appreciated!
...will automatically stop on any nonzero exit code. If you didn't want to do the comparison yourself, you could use  and rely on a CalledProcessError being thrown.Community Wiki because this is duplicative of many, many questions on the subject already.
This is my final code based on advice from here and some other articles.
