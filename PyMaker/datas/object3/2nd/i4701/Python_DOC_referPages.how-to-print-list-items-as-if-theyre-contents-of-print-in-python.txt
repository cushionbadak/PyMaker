This question already has an answer here:Pythonic way to print list items                    10 answers                words_list = ['who', 'got', '\n', 'inside', 'your', '\n', 'mind', 'baby']I have this list of words stored as a list element. I wanted to use the elements as contents of the print function. Ex.My desired output would be: 
In Python 3 you can do:because print is just a function and the  operator in this context will unpack elements of your list and put them as positional arguments of the function call.In older versions you'd need to concatenate (join) elements of the array first, possibly converting them to strings, if they are not strings already. This can be done like this:or, more succinctly, using generator expression instead of list comprehension: Yet another alternative is to use the  function, which results in even shorter code:However, if you are on Python 2.6+ but not on Python 3, you can get print as a function by importing it from the future:
