Trying to take an integer and return it from the function as an descending integer.I did it first like this:Because the tests only had numbers that were in descending order; kinda cheezy but hey it worked.. Now I want to do a number that is any number and make it return the largest to smallest number.As you can see i tried to dump the int into a string (n) and manipulate it like an array I suppose.EG:1201 would return 2110
Strings are iterable so you can pass them into  like so: returns a list, so  will return:Passing the list into (link to explanation of the join method) will return:
As other answers noted, this is a sorting problem.  You could use the built in sorting function, but that can take a (relatively) long time, and if you are just starting out, it can be good to write your own implementations rather than rely on library magic.  Because we are only sorting integers between 0 and 9, we can use a faster sorting algorithm than the timsort that python's  uses.  What we do is count the number of occurrences of each digit.  We then construct a number with as many 9s as the we found in the original, then 8s... until 0.  
A nice one-liner (Basically the same as above: turns into a string, reverse sorts it, back into int):
