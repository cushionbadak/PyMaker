When using raw_input in python, a user has to put an input and then press enter.Is there a way for me to code something, where the code will prompt several user inputs at the same time and THEN press enter for the code to run?For example:instead of ...it'll have ...
No,  only allows one string input to be supplied.What you can do is this:Now you just rely on user not having a  character in their name.Or, of course, you can ask separate questions.
One way is to  do like this:And now you have the separate values in .Demonstration:Then you could do  and so forth.You could use the split directly like this:One downside is that if the user does not give three values, you will get an error. If you split afterwards you can perform controls on the input first.Note:This method may cause problem if you want spaces in data, since space is used as a delimiter. Switch to another token in  to allow spaces if needed.
If  will always be letters,  will always be numbers and  will always be letters, and they are in that order, this should work:It means that you won't have to worry about the user inputing a seperator.
