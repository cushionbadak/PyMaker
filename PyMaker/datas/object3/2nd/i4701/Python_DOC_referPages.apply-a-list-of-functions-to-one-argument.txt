Let's say we have a list of functionsand we want to apply them to one argument  to get Clearly we can (edit: and should!) dobut is there any other machinery for this in the standard library, akin to the  function?
Pointless but possible.
The list comprehension here is the preferred method. However, if you wanted to avoid the list comprehension, you can use :But in python3 you would need to wrap the call to  with  since  returns an iterator:But as @jonrsharpe mentioned in the comments, this is not recommended as it wastefully creates a list.Timing ResultsOn my computer running python 2.7The slowest solution (by far) is the generator method suggested by @timgeb in the comments.List comprehension is the fastestBoth solutions using  are second fastest.
