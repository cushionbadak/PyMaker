Natural Text
I get zero error.  but the line is not deleted. This function ask the user what name he or she wants to delete from the text file.
This should help.
Assuming that:you want the user to supply just the name, and not the full 'name:number' pairyour phonebook stores one name:number pair per line I'd do something like this:Using a tempfile like this means that if something goes wrong while processing the file you aren't left with a half-written phonebook, you'll still have the original file unchanged. You're also not reading the entire file into memory with this approach. is Python 3.3+ only, if you're using something older you can use  as long as you're not using Windows.Here's the tempfile documentation. In this case, you can think of  as something like . NamedTemporaryFile saves you from having to find a unique name for your tempfile (so that you don't overwrite an existing file). The  argument creates the tempfile in the same directory as  which is a good idea because  can fail when operating across two different filesystems.
