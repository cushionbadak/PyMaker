List itemI am a newbie to python. I wanted to know Instead of asking the user to give input file with a path, how can I automatically select input files one after another the from a folder. i.e, it should pick the first image file from the folder, do some processing, then pick the 2nd file, then 3rd file... and so on till all the files in that folder have been processed and do action when a condition from a function which is called is satisfied.? I am trying compare_images:This is where I'm calling the compare_images function.But this throws an error. It simply runs and stops without producing any output even on the console or throws error saying unable to find file even when it exists. I feel I'm going wrong in my approach. Help.Please rectify me as to where I'm going wrong. How to copy files only when a condition is met and that condition is drawn from another function?
Based on the changes to the original question, and the clarifying comments below it, let me attempt another answer.Assuming that your  function works as expected (I cannot verify this), the following code should do what you are looking for. This checks if all of the images in the target folder are above the comparison threshold. If so, the file needs to be copied (it is a different image). If not, there's at least one similar-enough image, so the current one is skipped.Note that performance may suffer for a large number of images. Depending on the complexity of the  computations, and the number of images it needs to process, this may not be the most efficient solution.
Take a look at the link I suggested: How can I iterate over files in a given directory?Adapted from that answer:
