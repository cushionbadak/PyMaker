I tried using . This initializes creates the dictionary but when I add a value to any one of the sets all the sets get updated!It seems that all the three values of the dictionary are referring to the same set. I want to initialize all the values of the dictionary to empty sets so that I can perform some operations on these sets in a loop based on the keys later.

You want a  so you don't need to initialize the sets in the first place:
