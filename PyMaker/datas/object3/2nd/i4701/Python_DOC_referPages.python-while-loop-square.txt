I am a beginner at Python and I'm trying to use a  to sum up all of the squared  values in a given  value range.Code: For some reason, this equation returns the input number cubed.Can someone explain why this happens and how to fix it?
You need to perform the  on , the value that is being incremented:
You keep squaring the same number , instead of the one being incremented .
You also don't really need the  loop, avoiding having to manually keep track of which variable is the counting variable and which one is the result variable (which is what you are confusing, as explained e.g. by @Ajax1234 in their answer).It is a lot more Pythonic to use the built-in function , a generator expression and :This would be a lot more readable and better (unless of course you are being forced to use ).
Looks good. You're almost there. It makes it the cube root because you add y to  everytime. Because you code runs until  it runs n times. That means that you add  to . That means that it gives  which equals Hope this was clear enough.
