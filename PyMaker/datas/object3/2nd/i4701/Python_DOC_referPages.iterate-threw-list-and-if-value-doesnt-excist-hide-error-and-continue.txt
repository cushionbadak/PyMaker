I've got a List like:and then comes and for loop like:The strings defined in the result-list are part of a  result file and if they didn't exist there comes an error.I would like that my program doesn't stop cause of an error. It should go on and check if values of the others result values exist. So i do not have to sort every result before i start my program. If itÂ´s not in the list, there is no problem, and if it exists  i get my data.I hope u know what i mean.
