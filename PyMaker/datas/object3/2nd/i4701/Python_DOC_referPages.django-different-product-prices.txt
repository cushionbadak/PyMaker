I am trying to add different prices for the weight of the product and need to save the cost in the order regarding the weight selection by the user. In the Order model I override save method:But this is not what i need.It is likely to trigger a DoesNotExist.How to implement it?
So it looks like you want a table to retrieve price per pound from product and weight.If you store the weight as the max weight for the corresponding price, you can retrieve like Edit:populate this table and you end up with a table kind of like soThe trick to making this work is in that query which grabs the price that corresponds to the product in question and the next weight higher than the amount being ordered.  So if someone is ordering sugar and 5 kg or less they get the price for sugar @ 5kg or less.  If they order 8 kg they get the price for between 5 and 10 kg
