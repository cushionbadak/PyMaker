I use the following function to chunk iterable python objects.  I'm looking to do something similar with a basic JSON file.Like this.Is the term I'm looking for "streaming" JSON data?How do you stream JSON data?As a learning exercise I'm trying to stick with base python functionality for now but answers using other packages are helpful too.
After further thought, using  or  arguments would require reading the entire file into memory first—so to avoid doing that, instead here's something that reads the file incrementally, line-by-line.I had to modify your example JSON file to make it valid JSON (what you have in your question is a Python dictionary). Note that this code is format-specific in the sense that it assumes each JSON object in the array lies entirely on a single line—although it could be changed to handle multiline object definitions if necessary.So here's a sample test input file with valid JSON contents:Code:Output from processing test file:
JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses  conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of  languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and  many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange  language. -https://www.json.org/JSON is a string of text.  You would need to convert it back to python to be iteratable
