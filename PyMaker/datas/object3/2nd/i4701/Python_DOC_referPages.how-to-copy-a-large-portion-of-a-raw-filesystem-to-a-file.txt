I'm working with an arcane data collection filesystem.  It's got a block describing the files and their exact offsets on disk, so I know each files' start byte, end byte and length in bytes.  The goal is to grab one file from the physical disk.  They're big files so performance is paramount.Here's what "works," but very inefficiently:This is slow:  technically works, but it reads the entire file into memory before writing to the destination file.  So it takes much longer than it should.Copying directly using  won't work.  (I assume) the end position can't be specified, so the copy doesn't stop.Here are some questions, each of which could be a solution to this:Is there a copy library (or external utility for Windows 7 that would work with ) that takes start/end byte arguments?Is it possible to create a file-like object that  can use, which references just a portion of another file-like object?Can an exception be raised when an  object seeks past a certain end point?Can  be forced to naturally stop at a given byte offset of the drive (a sort of "fake EOF")?
The obvious way to do this is to just  to the file.The whole point of  is that it buffers the data for you. If you have to read the whole file into a , you're just buffering the , which is pointless.So, just loop around ing a decent-sized buffer from  and  it to  until you reach  bytes.If you look at the  source (which is linked from the  docs), there's no magic inside ; it's a trivial function. As of 3.6 (and I think it's been completely unchanged since  was added somewhere around 2.1â€¦), it looks like this:You can do the same thing, just keeping track of bytes read and stopping at :
