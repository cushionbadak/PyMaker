This question already has an answer here:Correct decoding of base64 to blob?                    1 answer                I am reading some CSV file in Python. The file was uploaded from Windows to AWS S3 and then downloaded using urllib.request. The file should start withbut instead it starts withSo, when this piece of code gets executed:the  variable starts withCan it be some kind of BOM? It doesn't look like any BOM that I am familiar with. I used chardet to find out the file was encoded using Windows-1252 encoding, and when I decode it using that encoding, I getWhen I open the file in Excel or Notepad, it seems fine and it starts with . So, obviously they know how to handle it, but I don't. What am I missing?Update: When I download this file on Mac and read it the same way (using the same code), it is only prepended with , which is UTF-8 BOM. So it is Windows that is adding those other bytes.Update 2: Ok, it's got to be something with , because when I download that file manually from AWS S3 and execute the following Python script:the  variable does not contain those weird bytes, just BOM. It might be a similar issue to the one usr2564301 linked in his comment.
I found a solution with the help of usr2564301's comment. String  was prepended to the HTTP request payload when uploading the file. This answer can can be applied to my issue.
