I have a  file on my disk somewhere. Such a file consists (basically) of a sampling rate together with a wave form given as a long sequence of numbers. Typical Python libraries for loading  files will give both the sampling rate and the data: for example, there is  or .Because the  files might be large and loading them might take a long time, and sometimes I might be interested in their sampling rate before wanting to have access to the waveform, I am looking for a fast way to extract the sampling rate from the  file in Python -- one that does not require reading the entire file.
You can use the  package from the standard library:
