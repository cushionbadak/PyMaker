Why?I thought decimal module solves problems with rounding in floating point arithmetic.How to check the equality of two decimal numbers in Python?
ObservationOrder of operations is critical to understand why you are seeing the result:ExplanationThe reason is given here, excerpt below. Decimal arithmetic is still fundamentally finite precision.You can and should, if it matters to you, reduce precision using . See  documentation for more details.In general decimal is probably going overboard and still will have  rounding errors in rare cases when the number does not have a finite  decimal representation (for example any fraction where the denominator  is not 1 or divisible by 2 or 5 - the factors of the decimal base  (10)).SolutionFor general comparison of floats:What is the best way to compare floats for almost-equality in Python?
