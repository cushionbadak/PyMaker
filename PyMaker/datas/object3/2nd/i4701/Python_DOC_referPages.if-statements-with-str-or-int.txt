My question is relatively simple. Is 'str' easier than 'int' in the following examples?is that faster to run and better thanOr is the one using integers more pythonic, and runs better?What if I were to have multiple things, not just med kit. Would it still be better to use strings? If you want any more information I can edit.
There are hundreds of answer, depending on too many factors.But if in doubt, refer to the Zen of Python:Explicit is better than implicit.andReadability counts.may suggest to go forsince it's more readable
You can look to the Python standard library for a hint of what is most Pythonic.The decimal module and re module both use named constant strings rather than integer constants.In Python 3, the enum module provides IntEnum so that you get the intelligibility of readable names and the benefits of ints (can be sequenced and can do math such as bitwise operations).
If you are just interested in speed there is basically no significant difference with one if statement but using strings will accumulate if you have lots of equality tests.  Here is a test on 10,000,000 runs:Output:
