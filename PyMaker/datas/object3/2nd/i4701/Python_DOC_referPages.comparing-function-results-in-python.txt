I am pretty new to python and I was wondering if anyone could help me out...I am trying to write a script that checks if I have admin on my TS3 server. However I just can't figure it out after a whole day.The api I use is linked here:http://py-ts3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.htmlI think my problem is in this part: It would be great if someone could help :)Thanks in advance!EDITSince I didn't state the question at hand (noob here), this is a sample output:As you can see, the output says that the client does not have admin, eventhough the client db id corresponds with an entry in the list with ids that have admin.
