I successfully imported from the web this  file, which looks like:etc ...I want to extract the values of the key , later compare  with the key values of . This works: , but if I try to ask all the elements of the list it won't, I tried: .I tried iterators and a  function but still has not work yet, mostly because I'm new in data manipulation. It works when I have one dictionary, not with a list of dictionaries. Thanks in advance for other tips. Some links were confusing. 
Sounds like you are using  wrong because you need  as well:Each  grabs a record from your list and you map your function to that.
Using  equals to , and you can see that it won't work, as  has no key named .Try working with a loop:
using your approach to iterate over the whole array to get all the instances of a key,this method might work for you
In which exact way do you want to compare them?Would it be useful getting the values in a way like this?
