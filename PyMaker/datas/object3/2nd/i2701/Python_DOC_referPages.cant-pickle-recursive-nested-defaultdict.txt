I have a recursive nested  class defined assitting in a  file.When I try to pickle it, e.g.I get .What's exactly happening here? 
The  class implements a  method where the second element of the returned tuple (the arguments for the constructor) is always going to be the factory object:That argument is then passed to the  call to re-build the object. The exception is thrown because the  class doesnâ€™t accept an argument. You can override the  method in your subclass:The above produces the exact same elements  returns, except that the second element is now an empty tuple.You could also just accept and ignore a single argument:The  name is commonly used to mean I am ignoring this value.An alternative implementation could just subclass  and provide a custom  method; this method is called for keys not in the dictionary:This works exactly like your version, but doesn't need additional pickle support methods:
