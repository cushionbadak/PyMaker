You are using  that matches any kind of vertical and horizontal whitespaces. If you plan to just match spaces and tabs, replace it with .Besides, you should consider escaping dots in your pattern (they are all outside of character classes) to match literal dots, else, they match any char but a line break char.Also, you do not need a capturing group around the whole pattern, you may always get the whole match via Group 0 (that you may access when iterating all match data objects returned with ).So, you may useSee the regex demo.You may use  to get all matches as a list. Or, if you need a list of tuples containing specific submatches, wrap those parts with capturing parentheses. E.g., to capture the number to one group and the measurement unit into another, use . Note I revamped  into  to make sure the spaces after the number are not captured.Python demo:Output:
