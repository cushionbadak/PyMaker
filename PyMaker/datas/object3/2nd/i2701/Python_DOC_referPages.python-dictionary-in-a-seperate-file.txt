I have a dictionary that's pretty long and I don't want to keep it in the same file as my program. I tried accessing the dictionary but I get an error:Is it possible to use it as a dictionary or to convert it or do I have to put the entire dictionary in the main file? My program is:I'm a beginner so if I'm asking a question that doesn't make sense pls tell me.

To convert that string into an actual dictionary object, you can use eval() a python inbuilt function. To verify if "whenever" key is present in your dictionary.
