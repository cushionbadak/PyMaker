I have these lists which are correct the scenario needed correction is in the explanation part at the end of the question.and I want to compare these lists and if one of them has an item that is unique by means that the [-3] position where is a number as 43001 is unique then that item should be removed. In the end only pairs with same number items should remain.How do I do that?my code:Explanationif the lists are like that:and the item with 43009 should be removed  because it doesn't exist in the  list, and eventually the lists will look like this:and 

You can create a set of unique ids. Then use that set to check for paths containing unique ids and remove them accordingly. Something like this:Hope this helps!
you can create a temporary list with parsed keys from  and then create filtered  according to the keys...
This will even out the larger list, regardless of which one it is, and both will end up having the same number of elements (with the same IDs) in the end. NOTE: Only works if you have two lists as presented in the question itself.
