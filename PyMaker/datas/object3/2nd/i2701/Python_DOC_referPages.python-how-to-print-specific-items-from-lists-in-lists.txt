Use indexing.Ex:Output:
You don't need to use range to achieve your task.Anyway, even if you would like to, there is a mistake in your code in the lineBy definition  returns the first value which is False, otherwise if there is not, it returns the last value in the expression.Thus, in your case it only returns .Indeed, returnssince  and  are both evaluated as True.This is why they are both non-empty sequences. Indeed  would be evaluated as  being empty. For more details see the documentation.You should rather write something likeusing itertools.chain.
range(0,1) and range(2,3) returns => range(2,3)
