I want both these function inside the same class math. using math class object. I can call both these functions.And I also want fibonacii  series comes inside array. 
I would suggest you create a class with static methods:static method have the advantage that they can be used without creating an object of that class. So in your script you can do:The part after main is the part of the script that is being executed if it is the main script. Notice that the class is never used to create a object. But it is used to save your two functions and can be used to call them.
