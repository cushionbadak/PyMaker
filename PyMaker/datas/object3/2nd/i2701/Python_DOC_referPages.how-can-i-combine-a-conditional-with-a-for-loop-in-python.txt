I have a simple example I've drawn up.  I thought it was possible to combine if statements and for loops with minimal effort in Python.  Given:I thought I could condense the for loop to:but this results in invalid syntax.  I'm not too particular on this example, I just want a method of one lining simple if statements with loops.
if you want to filter out all the empty sub list from your original sub lists, you will have to do something like below. this will give you all the non empty sub list.  *edited for syntax
Immediately solved this in the interpreter right after I posted.Not as clean as I'd like, the nested if statement is more readable in my opinion.  I'm open to other suggestions if there is a cleaner way.
I think you can't simplify the syntax to a one-liner in python, but indeed have to type out all the lines chaining for loops and if statements.An exception to this are list comprehensions (see here at 5.1.3). They can be used to produce new lists from lists. An example:
