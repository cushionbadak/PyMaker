I already did some research but i cant find the solution or help for my doubt.Im doing coursera python course, and i have an optional exercise that i not figuring out the solution.So the exercise is a kinda simple, "Write a program that receave a number and check if the receave number has, at least, one equal adjacent number." EX: 12256 (adjacent number), 123456 (doesnt have adjacent number) Only using while loop and/or if statment. So list and lens aren't allowed to use.I did like this:The question, here, is that i not figuring out how to evaluate my if statement to false. Thanks in advance for any help =)
a version that is close to yours. note that the  statement of the  loop is only executed if the while loop terminates normally - not via . you put your  statement after the while loop - it should be inside it. and it should compare  to something else ( and  in my code).
If you need to check each digit of a number, don't convert it into an . Then you can test each digit:The else clause executes if the while loop terminates without encountering . If there is no break, then there were no adjacent same digits. I haven't included any type checking to make sure the input is a number
You sayThe question, here, is that i not figuring out how to evaluate my if statement to false.The solution to this isinstead ofThink about it: is there any possible scenario where  is not going to be equal to itself?
