I'm pretty new at coding so sorry if this is a silly queastion. I've got a problem with this for loop at Python:The problem is that I get two prints, sometimes contradictory ones like  and  for 3, 25, 35 and other numbers.My purpose is to detect prime numbers.I use PyCharm btw.Thank you.
 is a tuple of two values, it's not a range. That means the loop will always iterate two times, one with the value  and one with the value .You need to create an instance of the  class:That  object will create an object that can be iterated over, with the values from  to .
The syntax  does not cycle  between the values , it literally makes  take the values  and then  as the syntax  defines a tuple which you iterate over.You are almost definitely looking for the  function which returns an iterable which you can iterate over in the for-loop so that  takes the range of values from  to  (not including ).So:note that we must also convert the result to an integer with  since range doesn't accept floats (decimals)As for making the prime test work, you don't want to cycle all the way up to half the number, you only need to go up to the square root of the number. Also, whenever you find a divisor, you can  and  out of the loop, but when a number doesn't divide the prime candidate, you can't  as there may be divisors that you haven't checked yet. So we can only  if we complete the  without breaking out of it early. This is most easily achieved with a function:and then we can see it works:
