I know there are plenty of topics about finding indices of given keywords in strings, but my case is a bit differentI have 2 inputs, one is a string and another is a mapping list (or whatever you wanna call it)each word will always map onto a digit in the mapping list. Now I want to find all indices of a given number, say 1, when matching the string.In the above case, it will return [0, 2, 17] (Thakns @rahlf23)My current approach would be zipping each word with a digit by doingwhich gives meand then iterate through the list, find "1", use the word to generate a regex, and then search for indices and append it to a list or something. Rinse and repeat.However this seems really inefficient especially if the  gets really longI'm wondering if there's a better way to deal with it.
You could  the words to their  and use , although you have to add  to each length (for the spaces) and add an initial  for the start of the first word.The last element is not used. Then,  and iterate the pairs and collect them in a dictionary.Alternatively, you could also use a regular expression like  (word-boundary followed by word-character) to find each position a word starts, then proceed as above.
