This question is to get the k biggest value in dic and get the matched key :value pairs. But I got running problem and got KeyError: 1.
The problem is that, each time through the loop, you leave  and  to the key-value pair you just found. Since that was the maximum value, no other value in the dictionary will be larger. So at the end of the loop, you'll still have the same  and . And then you'll try to  again, and it raises a , because you already deleted it.The solution is simple: take the code that sets  and  to the first element, and move it into the outer loop, so it runs every time instead of just the first time:But, while we're at it, there are easier (or at least harder-to-get-subtly-wrong) ways to do this.The most obvious is to just sort the items by value, then take the first :For more on how key functions work, and that , see the Sorting HOWTO.But you can make this more efficient.  obviously has to sort all  values, just to get the top , so it takes  space and  time. If  is a lot smaller than , you can do a lot better by using , which takes only  space and  time:Either way, this doesn't delete the keys from ; if you need that, you can do that manually:
