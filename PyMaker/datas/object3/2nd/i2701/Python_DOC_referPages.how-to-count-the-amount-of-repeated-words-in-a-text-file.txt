Sample of code from vending machine programFrom here, how would I be able to check how much of each item number is stored in the text file (Since a vending machine should only have a limited stock before the item is 'Not Available')?
I hope the comments I have made are self explanatory, but if more information is needed please let me know. Essentially you want to break the information you read from the text file into a list, which allows you to use the list.count() method.Additionally like others have mentioned it would probably be beneficial to avoid writing to a file at all in this task. An alternative would be defining a dictionary with the number of each item in the vending machine such as:
Notwithstanding the fact that this looks like an XY problem, you can use a Counter for this:A Counter is a subclass of , so you can check the count of any item easily:which should print the count of item "9".Ideally, however, you would use some kind of database for this task. It's very inefficient to repeatedly open a file, write to it, close it, open it again, count its contents, and close it again.
