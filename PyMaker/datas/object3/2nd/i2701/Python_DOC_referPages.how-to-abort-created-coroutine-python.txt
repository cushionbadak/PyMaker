How do I abort a created coroutine instance? My use case is a function taking in a coroutine and conditionally creating a tracked task for it (so that all of them could be ed later).Ignoring it (not ing it directly or indirectly) works, but gives a . I'd be OK with a solution that suppresses this warning. Creating a task then immediately cancelling it starts its execution and the cancellation leads to other issues so it's not workable.Checking the condition before the coroutines are created works, but damages maintainability since the same check for condition has to be in all the places before this function is called.
Use the  method:Program finishes fine, no warnings.
