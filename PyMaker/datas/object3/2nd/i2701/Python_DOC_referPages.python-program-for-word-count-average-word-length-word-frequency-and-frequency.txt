Natural Text
Need to write a Python program that analyzes a file and counts:The number of wordsThe average length of a wordHow many times each word occursHow many words start with each letter of the alphabetI've got the code to do the first 2 things:But I'm not sure on how to do the others. Any help is appreciated.Btw, when I say "How many words start with each letter of the alphabet" I mean how many words start with "A", how many start with "B", how many start with "C", etc all the way through to "Z".
There are many ways to achieve this, a more advanced approach would involve an initial simple gathering of the text and its words, then working on the data with ML/DS tools, with which you could extrapolate more statistics (Things like "a new paragraph starts mostly with X words" / "X words are mostly preceeded/succeeded by Y words" etc.)If you just need very basic statistics you can gather them while iterating over each word and do the calculations at the end of it, like:Online Demo here
Interesting challenge you were given, i made a proposition for question 3, how many times a word occurs inside the string. This code is not optimal at all, but it does work.also i used the file  edit: noticed i forgot to create wordlist as it was saved in my ram memoryAnswer to question four: This one wasn't really hard after you have created a list with all the words since strings can be treated like a list and you can easily get the first letter of the string by simply doing  and if its a list with strings
