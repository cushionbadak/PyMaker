I have the need to divide a class field (Value) in Django-admin model with a fixed value (coefficient) in the same class. The result of this operation should populate another field (Points) of the same class. Both values are of same type (integers).For example a user enter a value of '180', then he leaves coefficient to its default '10'. When it saves the new entry it should show up So for the moment I defined  field in Django  which defaults to 10.'Value' field is editable as I said above.I thought to use  to perform math operations between fields however I am not sure if this is the correct tool or there's something simpler.When I set up the following expression on my model I see alot complaints when I make db migrations.Since I am new to Django I appreciate any help on this, maybe I am misunderstanding something obvious.
Method-1Override  method of  model, asMethod-2use  decorator
You can simply override the  method of your model to calculate the  field:You might also want to check for and handle division by zero here.
