I use the python example from https://docs.python.org/3/extending/embedding.html.every thing is right until I added one line  in the 'multiply.py' file.  will return  if i add this line,and  show that .but actually, i have install  with pip,and i run 'multiply.py' with no problem on command line.Is something wrong?
I would recommend installing everything again, because your problem is very strange and I nobody was able to explain it.
