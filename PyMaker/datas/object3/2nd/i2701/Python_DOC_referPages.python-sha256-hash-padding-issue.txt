Natural Text
I have a issue with the padding of a sha256 hash.The script in the link above gets invoked by a .php file, passing the parameter 'code'. Then a list of hashes with corresponding usernames gets read out of a text file and stored into a list.The output of the script with the text file containing only one hash and name looks like this:2244 [['$pbkdf2-sha256$200000$AuCcU0pJidHam1NKyXnPmQ$TmzQ.cWXKnx7u.dd023qoltVxeuaPafEq7Lvyywxf9o\n', 'Fabian'], ['', ''], ['', ''], ['', ''], ['', ''], ['', ''], ['', ''], ['', '']] ['$pbkdf2-sha256$200000$AuCcU0pJidHam1NKyXnPmQ$TmzQ.cWXKnx7u.dd023qoltVxeuaPafEq7Lvyywxf9o\n']As you can see this works perfectly, but a '\n' gets appended to the hash both times it gets printed. I suppose that is the reason why the very last print throws a 'TypeError: Incorrect padding'.The problem is: I don't know how to make this work since both name and hash would get written in the same line if I remove the '\n'. I tried to write the lines in the text file both manually and with a script using but this doesn't solve the problem. Note: the text file looks like this:Has anyone of you been in this situation? Any help or idea is greatly appreciated, thanks in advance!
You can remove the newline escape character after having read a line using rstrip.
