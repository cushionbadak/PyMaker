I can use dict.keys() as the parameter "possibilities" in get_close_matches where "possibilities" expects a list. But why i can't access dict.items() as a normal list like a[0], a[1] (a is a list) ?
In Python 3,  (and also  and ) returns a special dictionary view object.  It behaves like an iterator, but isn't specifically a list.
Dict.items() doesn't return a list. Instead it returns a class of dict_items. If you are interested about the keys alone use Dict.keys(). You cannot access the dictionary using index approach
