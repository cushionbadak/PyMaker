I'm trying to create a quiz, and there is a Syntax error in the  array for the 2nd element. I've tried appending each object to the array through a `for loop but I need each question to have a correct answer.The Questions class is in a diffrent file:Here is the main file:
As Aran-Fey commented, list items must be separated by commas. This is also true for other collections as dictionaries, sets, etc.
As Aran-Fey pointed out, your syntax is incorrect.Also, another small point, what you are creating is a list, not an array. There are both semantic and implementation differences, and since Python has both, it's an important distinction.
