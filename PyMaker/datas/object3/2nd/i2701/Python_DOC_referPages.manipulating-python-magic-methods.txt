I have more of a background with data science libraries or calling methods and attributes from classes. I am experimenting with manipulating magic methods. I am having a difficult time getting  types and returning their opposites. I did something with  and  objects that worked but can't seem to to the same with , ,  or `gt'. Here is my code:This prints the following:As you can see, the results are the same as not using the class at all. I added an  method to print  and it only prints that if I instantiate the object with something like .I would like to enter something like , , or , and return the opposite boolean value, , or , as an exercise. I tried several things such as placing the methods under the  method I created, which didn't work either. I read on this and still don't quite understand how to do this with booleans, integers and floats for that matter. The way the methods are above is how I was able to turn datetime objects into strings with ,  and  methods.Thank you for your help. EDITThanks to your help, I have a better understanding and have completed my small experiment with this code:This prints the following:
If you mean that you want to return the negation of the boolean resulting from the comparison you could do something likeNote that in the comparison  you are using the  method of the int class.
