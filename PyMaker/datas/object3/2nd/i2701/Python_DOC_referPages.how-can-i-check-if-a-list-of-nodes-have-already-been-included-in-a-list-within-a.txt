I have the following list:  which contains 3 lists, each being a list of nodes of a graph.I am also given a tuple of nodes . Now, I will like to check if either of the lists in  has been included in a list in . For example,  is in , in , but  is not in , although there is an overlapping node. Remark: To clarify, I am also checking for sub-list of a list, or whether every item in a list is in another list. For example, I consider [1,3] to be "in" [1,2,3].How can I do this? I tried implementing something similar found at Python 3 How to check if a value is already in a list in a list, but I have reached a mental deadlock.. Some insight on this issue will be great!
You can use  and :Output:
You can use s to compare if the nodes appear in ,  operator for sets is equivalent to . module provides some useful functions,  is equivalent to nested  loops.E.g.:

 is your friend (no installation builtin python module):Output:
Since you're only looking to test the sub-lists as if they were subsets, you can convert the sub-lists to sets and then use  for the test:This outputs:
