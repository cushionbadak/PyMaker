Can anyone explain this code a little. I can't understand what  does here? We already have taken  as input then why ? I couldn't figure it out.
 counts the number of bits in the number .  produces the binary representation (zeros and ones), as as string with the  prefix:so  takes the length of that output string, minus 2 to account for the prefix.See the  documentation:Convert an integer number to a binary string prefixed with “0b”.The length is used to set the width of the columns (via , which adds spaces to the front of a string to create an output  characters wide). Knowing how many characters the widest binary representation needs is helpful here.However, the same information can be gotten directly from the number, with the  method:The other columns are also oversized for the numbers. You could instead calculate max widths for each column, and use  or an f-string to do the formatting:
