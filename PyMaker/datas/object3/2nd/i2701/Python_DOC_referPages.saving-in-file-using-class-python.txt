I'm new to python language.I want to save a line to a file and load a specific line of a file.The problem is that I should read(load) a line of that file as object of another(Grade) class or save a line into file as object of another class(Grade)I did it and I want to see if I did it in right!In save function I checked if data is unique and I avoid using last \n in end of file
The model you're using of saving lines of class entries is inefficient. Instead, you can store your data in a better way. I am assuming each student id is unique and hashable (either a string or integer). So, you could simply have a dictionary that has all the information about each student: Now, if you want to fetch a student's information, you could simply do  to get the data you needed. For instance, you could do:You can easily set this dictionary as an instance variable of your  class. Now, @juanpa.arrivillaga mentioned that you should use  to store that information (if you would like to go back to it later). Pickle allows you to store data like a dictionary into a files and load it. There is also  that can help you do the same thing.
