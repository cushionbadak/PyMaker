I'm trying to read a Json file to transform it into csvI looked on some stackoverflow questions and it helped me but I still have a little problem. There are fields that don't interest me and I don't know how to say to my script to skip these fields.Here is my code : Of course I chose a very sample and short text to illustrate my example.When I run that script I get that : And I would like to know how to display only the item's fields and to skip the fields "year" and "title" at the beggining.So, I would like to get the following output : I need to access only to these fields to write them in a csv file after. So do you have an idea how I could do that ? Thank you very much in advance :)

 parses JSON into a dictionary. You can access the "items" key directly:
