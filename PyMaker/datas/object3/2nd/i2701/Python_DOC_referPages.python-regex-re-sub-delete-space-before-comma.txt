Natural Text
I am trying to make a little text clean program and I've made a sequence of re.subs for this goal. This is the messy string that I'm trying to clean: 'when I try this , the comma    does not get moved to the left ,whereas the full-stop does .also , the first letter of the new sentence gets capitalized ideally .'This is the final piece of output I get:'When I try this , the comma does not get moved to the left ,Whereas the full-stop does. Also , the first letter of the new sentence gets capitalized ideally.'So it did move the duplicate spaces correctly, capitalized the first letter of the sentence, but:it did not insert a space after the commas (ver7)nor did it remove the space before the commas (ver8). Also, it has capitalized Whereas. The comma issue puzzles me because ver 7 and 8 are exactly the same as ver 2 and 5.Thanks in advance!
I think you're overcomplicating things. You can remove all spaces before a full-stop, comma, question mark or exclamation point and insert one after them with this regex:which simply looks for one of  surrounded by some number (which may be 0) of spaces on either side and then replace that with  ( followed by a space), thus removing any spaces before and replacing any spaces afterwards with a single space.Demo at regex101
