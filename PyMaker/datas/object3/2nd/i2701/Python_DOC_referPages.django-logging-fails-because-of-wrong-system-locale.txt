I have a Django app, which fails to log with the error .  The problem is that the system locale is the CentOS default locale, which is ASCII. The admins don't want to change the system-wide locale on their servers, saying that the apps should be able to run in a clean environment. We circumvented the problem for the Django apps themselves by adding this to the uwsgi.ini:However, uwsgi.ini has no effect on the code run as a django management command, and we have a lot of work done in those. What could be the best way to fix that?UPD: We also tried setting the locale in the  file, but that didn't help.
Try setting the default encoding in the  module inside the  folder of your Python distribution. This module is loaded by Python when it starts up and arbitrary site-specific customizations can be placed in here.sitecustomize.pyYou may need to create the module if it doesn't already exist.
