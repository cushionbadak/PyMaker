Natural Text
I am new to Python and Linux. I have a process running in a terminal window that will go indefinitely. The only way to stop it would be for it to crash or for me to hit ctrl+C. This process outputs text to the terminal window that I wish to capture with Python, so I can do some additional processing of that text. I know I need to do something with getting stdout, but no matter what I try, I can't seem to capture the stdout correctly. Here is what I have so far. This will work when my command is a simple "echo blah blah blah". I am guessing this is because the echo process terminates. If I try running the continuous command, the output is never captured. Is this possible to do? 
 will block on reading until reach EOF, use  or  instead:read(size=-1)Read and return up to size bytes. If the argument is omitted, None, or negative, data is read and returned until EOF is reached.eg:see more on the python io doc.
