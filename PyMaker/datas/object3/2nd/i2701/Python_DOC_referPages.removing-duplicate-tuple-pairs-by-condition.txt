How do you remove duplicate tuples from a list based on the condition that if  and  are part of the list, then we only keep the match where ?For example, if we start with the following list of Car ID pairs: then we should remove the  entry and end up with: I tried the following code to grab unique tuples, but it did not do what I described.
Using a dictionary you can do it in linear time.Note that for each tuple  I first check if  already exists and in that case I keep the one with , otherwise it is inserted in the dictionary.
This is a list comprehension that considers all pairs (a, b) in your original list.  It keeps them all except where the reversed pair is also in the list, and the elements are in the order you don't want.Output:
You can use list comprehension:And if an O(n) runtime is important, then use a set, which will take care of duplicates as well but may not guarantee the same order:
