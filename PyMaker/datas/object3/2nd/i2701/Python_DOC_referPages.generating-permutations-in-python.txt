I want to implement a function, generate_perm(m,n), where it takes two arguments, one is for numbers to permutate (m) and second is to what the sum of the permutation must equate to (n). should outputand should output:EDITi havent gotten far
One simple recursive approach without any libraries:
Consider a list You can get all the permutations with and then filter themoutputs Looking at the second example you give, I think what you want is a , not :and which works also for the first case.
