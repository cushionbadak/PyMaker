I'm new to python and was trying to create a list of month names. I noticed something odd:Can anyone explain to me why the length of month names is not 12?Thanky you for any advice!
Quoting the documentation:This follows normal convention of January being month number 1, so it has a length of 13 and  is the empty string.
The reason is because  this is probably to keep things simple for the rest of the months. So January is the first month or month number 1 and is also therefore  and so on. This is probably just meant for simplicity. Since index 0 is empty and index 12 is December there are "13" months.
