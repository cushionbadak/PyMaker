I have a list of tags such as:The following regex search function can pull out all 101 matches when just running:when i try to run the next group of code to just grab the match by itself,  only returns 10 of the full 101 matches the above code returns with and  returns singular matches such as  etc...It appears the  function is causing the issue, even though i thought that  should return all 101 matches originally found in the first script. EDIT: I changed it to  instead of  and now it is returning 10/101 tags with the full match.How can i get all 10 out of the 101 tags though?The new result is here
 returns a  object. See the docs. As for :Return a tuple containing all the subgroups of the match, from 1 up to however many groups are in the pattern.But you don't care about the subgroups here - you just want the full match. For that, you should probably use  or :Returns one or more subgroups of the match. If there is a single argument, the result is a single string; if there are multiple arguments, the result is a tuple with one item per argument. Without arguments, group1 defaults to zero (the whole match is returned).Like this:Output:
Figured it out.The regex did not match anything on the 11th value of the tag list. then fails to pick up the following matches after it does not find anything on the 11th value.Changed the regex from:to:which will matches any character except line breaks, which not picks up the random encoded value in the 11th tag.
