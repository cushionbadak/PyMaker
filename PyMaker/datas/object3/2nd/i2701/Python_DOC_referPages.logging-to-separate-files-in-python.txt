I'm using python's logging module. I've initialized  it as:in every of my modules. Then, in the main file:Now, in the app I'm also using WSGIServer from gevent. The initializer takes a log argument where I can add a logger instance. Since this is an HTTP Server it's very verbose.I would like to log all of my app's regular logs to "log.txt" and WSGIServer's logs to "http-log.txt". I tried this:This logs all HTTP messages into http-log.txt, but also to the main logger.How can I send all but HTTP messages to the default logger (log.txt), and HTTP messages only to http-log.txt?EDIT: Since people are quickly jumping to point that this Logging to two files with different settings has an answer, plese read the linked answer and you'll see they don't use  but rather initialize each logger separately. This is not how I'm using the logging module.
Add the following line to disable propagation:Then, it will no longer propagate messages to its ancestors' handlers which includes the root logger for which you have set up the general log file.
