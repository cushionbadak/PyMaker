When I try to convert a string to bits, it doesn't always work, depending on completely esoteric conditions :First it seemed like it just wouldn't work with strings containing spaces, but it actually doesn't work either with "helloworld" or anything the like. Then why would it ever work with "deadbeef" ?I am completely lost o.o
If you want to convert a string to a hex representation of its bits, that's not what  does.  tries to treat the characters of  as the base-16 representation of an integer.  contains only characters that are valid digits in base 16:None of your other strings have that property.If you want hex digits corresponding to the bits representing a string, first, choose an encoding (UTF8, probably), then use something like :
int( hex_value,16) is used to convert hex string to int. You are facing an error if you pass a invalid hex character.For your use case of converting string to bits you can use bitarray module
