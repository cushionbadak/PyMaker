what is wrong with this code. I am trying to get input like this -4 5 ||3 6and store 4, 3 in S and 5, 6 in E
You can not grow lists like this in python. If you want to add to a list, you have to use the following approach:
In python, when you have a variable which is a list, it has a specific length, and if you try to access a member with a number greater or equal to that length, it will spit out the index error. Now to avoid this you could instantiate the array in one lane using the [] notion like so: (In this code the inputsSp variable is the inputs splitted into the corresponding members: for example inputsSp[i] = ['4', '5', '||', '3', '6'])
You can also do this via:or, the long version:This works by taking in all inputs and then ping the result, which sorts them as you wish. See it on repl.it:
