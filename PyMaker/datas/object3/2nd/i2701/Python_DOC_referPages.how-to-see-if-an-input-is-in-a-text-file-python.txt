Natural Text
So I am a student at a school learning the basics of python. I was given a project that I had to complete. I was given a text file with some names, if the user inputs the name that is in the text file then  it would print a message. If not then it would print another message saying something.I have begun with my code, however, I cant seem to figure out how I can use the if and in command. Can someone give me some hints or solutions?I have tried to put it in a list and then use the if and in command. It didnt work because of append. I dont know how to remove a word from a list. I can use slice method but it would seem too complicated.the text file is named class.txt and the contents are    Ali    Alakazam    Alberto    AJ    Bob    Bobby    Kat    Katie    Timmy    Tim-tamthanks.
I have trouble understanding what you are exactly asking for, hopefully this resolves your question.You can merely read the text file in to a string and check with the if-in statement.
SolutionThis is what you are looking for, from what you descirbed.First step would be to open the file containing the list of whatever you want to check. Next we can run  to assign all of that text to .From there you can run and  and  to return seperate responses.
