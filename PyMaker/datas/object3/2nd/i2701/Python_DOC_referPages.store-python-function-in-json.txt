Say I have a JSON file as such:This over-simplifies what I want to try and do, but basically I am attemptingto story a python UDF into a JSON file. Is there a way to do this so that when I do:I can access those values and do something like:To get expected output: 20NOTE: To my understanding JSON doesn't store functions, so maybe I can store it as a string, and then in my python script parse the string into a function? Not too sure.
If you really need to store a function in an external json file, one turn-around will be to store a lambda function instead, and use the  function to call it from your script. But I don't really recommend it for good practice...config.jsonYour Python fileDemo
Python has a built in module name  that can handle this.  And to get it back...
Something that is worth trying is just saving it as a string.You can do stuff likeThis will create object of the function that you can call. Not really sure what you are trying to do but creating a json file like below should give you what you want to do:(I added the 'func' wrapper because I am assuming you will have multiple functions in one JSON)hope this helps
