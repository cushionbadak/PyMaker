I was working on recommendation system (RS) in python when I came across a serious problem: I couldn't access the set without changing its order.e.g. Once I changed a set to list the order gets change. (In recommendation, system order is very important.)e.g.Here  and  both are categorical variablesAlthough I used other approach, I had to scratch my butt's to change the code because it was giving perfect results using set thing and all other things were just working fine. I was in the final phase of my RS, but because of the set order I had to take other approach.How do we access an set without changing the order?
 is an unordered collection. For an ordered collection, you can use  or . You now have a few options. Your choice should depend on whether you expect repeats in . If you have no repeats, you can use a list comprehension:If you have repeats in , then you need unique items with ordering maintained. For this, you can use , which is equivalent to the  recipe found in the docs:
The lists, the first one is orderedThis works but it's O(NÃ—M)This has a setup cost but it's O(N), if both lists are long...
Since you need ordered sets, I recommend using the ActiveState recipe the Python documentation recommends in the "See also:" at the very end.If you put the recipe's code in a separate file named , it can be ed as a module and used like this:
