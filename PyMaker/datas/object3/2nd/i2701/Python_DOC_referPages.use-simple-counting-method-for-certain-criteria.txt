I have a dataset likeFor this dataset I want to perform a task which will go through my dataset and will count the number of occurrences above a cutoff if the length of occurrence is above M.The cutoff and M will be system arguments.So if the cutoff is 0.32 and M is 1 it will print out a list likeLogic: First two values in second column are above 0.32 and the length of the is greater than M=1 hence it printed out 2 and 4,3,2 so on.I need a help to write the argument so that if x >cutoff and length of broken is >M it will print out the length of broken frames (so the same out put as above). Any help?The structure should look like following (I am not sure how to place the argument in place of XXX)Or maybe there is a simpler way to write it.
You are OK with using numpy, which makes life a lot easier.First off, let's take a look at the file loader.  can do the same thing in one line.Now to create a mask of which values that make up your above-threshold runs:The rest is easy, and based off this question:Now you can apply  to :If you want to work with lists,  also offers a good solution:
