I have a directory that contains a large number of CSV files (more than 1000). I am using python pandas library to count the number of columns in each CSV file.But the problem is that the separator used in some of CSV file is not  onlyHow to tackle this problem:I am storing it as a dictionary.I am getting an error like: I have used , but that didn't work. Edit  :One of the csv is like this :Second one is like:I can't reveal the data. I have just given the column name as the data is sensitive. UpdateAfter a little bit of tweaking and using print status to figure out using the code of andrey-portnoy, I came to know that csv sniffer was identifying the delimiter for "|" as "e" so using an if statement I changed it back to "|". Now it is giving me correct output.Also in place of  , I used  . in following line of code in Andrey's answer : But the problem remains unsolved. I was able to figure out this after a lot of inspection but every time I may not be correct to guess and this can lead to error.  Any help will be awaited.
By specifying the separator as , you make that whole string a separator. Instead, you want to use the Sniffer from the  module to detect the CSV dialect used in each file, in particular the delimiter.For example, for a single file :Don't enable the Python engine by default, as it is much slower.
