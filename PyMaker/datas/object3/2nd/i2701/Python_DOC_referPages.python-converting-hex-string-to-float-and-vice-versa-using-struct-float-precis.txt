When testing my library, Construct, I found out that tests fail when numbers are built then parsed back to a float. Should floats not be represented exactly as in-memory floats?
Floating point is inherently imprecise, but you are packing a double-precision float () into a single-precision () space there. See Basic and interchange formats in the Wikipedia article on IEEE floating point formats; the Python  format uses double precision (see the standard types docs; Floating point numbers are usually implemented using double in C).Use  to use double precision:From the Format characters section:format: , C Type: , Python type: , Standard size: , Footnote: (5)  format: , C Type: , Python type: , Standard size: , Footnote: (5)  For the  and  conversion codes, the packed representation uses the IEEE 754 binary32 (for ) or binary64 (for ) format, regardless of the floating-point format used by the platform.
