I am looking to assign a custom name/identifier to a gevent greenlet. Gevent already assigns a unique name: However, I am not sure how to change this value to a user inputted name. Is it possible to do so? I tried to do something like this and ended up with an attribute error:
 is not a common , but a  obj, which is a special non-data descriptor works like , and for a non-data descriptor:... In contrast, non-data descriptors can be overridden by instances.you could override it simply:read more on the gevent source and the descriptor doc.
Instantiate the class first and then overwrite the method as such;This will replace the constructed name with your own string.
