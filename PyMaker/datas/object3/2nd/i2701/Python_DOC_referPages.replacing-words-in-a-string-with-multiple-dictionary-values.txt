How do I fix this?
You can use  and :Output:
If this was 3.6 and you can change your string, to an  and  you don't need regex to deal with it:
 is a sequence of characters, not the word stream on which your code depends.  takes on the values , , , , ...A quick fix could be: to nest loops for each thing you want to replace:This is still very brute-force, but is at the programming level you're using.  The triple-loop can be replaced with , if you want to learn to use that package.  You can also automate the words you're replacing with a regex for words in angle brackets.  In fact, you can cram this entire process into a single-statement list comprehension, which you assign to .
