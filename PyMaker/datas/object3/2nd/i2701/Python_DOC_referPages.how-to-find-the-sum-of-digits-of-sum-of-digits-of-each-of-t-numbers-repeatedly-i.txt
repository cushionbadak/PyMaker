Here is the code that i wrote to get sum of digits from a number repeated number of times till the sum gets below 10: On running this code it gives me an error like:
You are using recursion to solve this. It is more efficient to simply use a loop:Input:  4, then 999,888,333,111Output: As @Arne suggested changing  to use  instead fits better into pythons Ask forgiveness not permission mindset, and I agree.Still, the variant above also works and is easier to understand for beginners. Here is the  one:For more about input validation I would suggest reading up on it in the answers of Asking the user for input until they give a valid response .
The  you are getting is as a result of using N inside function  without having declared and initialized it. is inside the loop but outside the scope of . The last line  in the loop will call function  and not go back to  where N would have been assigned.I have modified the code to
You can fix this by passing N as a parameter in the P function.If you set value of N inside the function P, python understands it as creating a local variable with that name. This local variable masks the global variable N used outside of the function. So, you better pass N as a parameter to function P.Thanks.
Functions in python declare a new scope, which is why  is not visible in your function. You can circumvent this by passing  along into the inner scope, like this:Python is conservative on write-operations. Only reading from an outer-scope variable is fine, but re-assigning the name  (which is what happens if you write ) makes it check strictly for a local variable of that name. As a consequence, it further assumes that that not-yet-declared variable is where you want to read from in the line above it - which is honestly a bit misleading.
