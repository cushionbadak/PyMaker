If I'm trying to write a file in directory which is already contains file with this name, is there a way to pretend rewriting or making it possible just with receiving permission? For example: I calculated a file model.gz, but in my directory there is another file with this exact the same name, how can I in my .py script make this saving step a little bit more safely,  for example saving it with different name, like: model_(1).gz or something like this? Thank you in advance!
