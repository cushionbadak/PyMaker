I am writing this  code and I'm getting an error. I've searched through the internet and StackOverflow but nothing works for me!The error:    My code:
 inside the for loop is already the relevant item from . It is not a counter and there is no need to say .(Also, you probably want to use a dictionary rather than a list here; then you can find  directly rather than iterating through the list each time.)
The variable  is assigned with each item in the  list with the  statement, and is not an index, so you should access it as an item in the  list:
As the other's have already told you about  being an element of the list, instead of being a counter variable. If you still want to use a counter, you can do something like,The  function creates a range (list) from . You can read more about range, from here.
Because you are not iterating the index in the list but what you are doing is iterating the element present in the products list in the form of the variable "x" . i think the the point will be cleared to you . and checkout the previous answers for the correct code
