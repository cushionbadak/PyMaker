Hi I want to filter elements with / without ,  into two lists. My code doesn't do the job, it seems run through everything twice and cannot replace both  and  at the same time. Where did I do wrong? Code:DataMy output:I want to get output like these:
You are treating those two characters separately, by using a  loop:The first time through the  loop,  is set to . When that character is found in  you create a new string with  removed, and append that to  and  itself is appended to . If the character is not found you append to .The second time through the loop,  is set to , and you do all the same work again.As a result, you always append to either  and , or to  twice for each .You need to delay appending until you have processed all the characters in , and only when the loop is done decide where to append. You could use a flag variable for that:You can also just test for either character to be present, and use  for both. It's safe to do so,  doesn't care if the character you are replacing is not present at all:Rather than use two  calls you can also use a translation table passed to ; this is faster, and much more flexible if you have a variable number of characters to replace. For the latter case, you can use the  function to test for a sequence of characters:
You dont need a loop to run twice on the same list instead you can modify the if condidition
I think the error in your code was found by other answers - but by using a simple RegEx you would get more performance and could easily change it when you have to add new symbols to match:Online demo here
