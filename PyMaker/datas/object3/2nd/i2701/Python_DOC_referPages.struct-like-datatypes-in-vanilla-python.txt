Is there a simple way of creating data objects that are programmatically-similar (without necessarily the memory properties) to C-like 's in vanilla Python (2 or 3), without going through all the class stuff? I'm primarily interested in a quick-and-easy way of creating arbitrary datatypes and accessing their fields by name. Something as simple as: Or, is the only real way of being able to do this using classes?
Python 3.7's data classes offer something very much like what's described in your post:If you're on an older version of Python, named tuples might be a good fit (as AChampion points out in their answer).
@Chris provides a good example of , and would recommend that approach if you are using 3.7.This is what a  looks like:The one limitation with  is you cannot change the values (much like a normal tuple)
What about a dictionary?
