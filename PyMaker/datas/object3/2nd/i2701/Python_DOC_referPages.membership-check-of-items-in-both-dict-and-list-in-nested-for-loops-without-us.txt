I have an ordered dict:  and list of :  I want to order these potential matches into one of two lists: or  If the potential match is a keyword of one of the keys in the dict, then it goes in , else it goes in .  Result of this example should be:,  Here is what I tried:  Essentially, all remaining words that are not a match should simply go to the other list.   Though it works, doesn't seem efficient. It must be a list to preserve order, and lists may overlap.   Note: I asked a similar question previously although in that case the situation and answer called for the use of a python set, as items were unique.  
Output:
