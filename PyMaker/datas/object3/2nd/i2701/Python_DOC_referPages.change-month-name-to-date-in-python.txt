I am trying to change month name to date in python but i m getting an error:My CSV has values such as October in it which I want to change it to 10/01/2018Any help would be appreciated
Can't you just write a function mapping to each? In fact, a dictionary will do.
As an elaboration of the answer by @AdamSmith, a better way to define a mapping between names and dates is to use the  module that already has a list of names:
The whole point of passing a format string like  to  is that you're specifying what format the input strings are going to be in.You can see the documentation, but it's pretty obvious that a format like  is not going to handle strings like . You're asking for a (zero-padded) month number, a slash, a (zero-padded) day number, a slash, and a (zero-padded) (two-digit) years.If you specify a format that actually does match your input, everything works without error:However, that still isn't what you want, because the default year is 1900, not 2018. So, you either need to  that, or pull the month out and build a new datetime object.Also, notice that all of the strings that  knows about are locale-specific. If you've set an English-speaking locale, like , or , then  means the English months, so everything is great. But if you've set, say, , then you're asking it to match the Brazilian Portuguese month names, like  instead of .11. Since I don't actually know Brazilian Portuguese, that was a pretty dumb example for me to pickâ€¦ but Google says it's Outubro, and when Google Translate did so ever lead wrong one?
I'm assuming the data is mostly in the format you have specified () but some outlier rows have month names in them.Without adding any extra dependencies:then
