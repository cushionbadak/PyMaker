But if you don't know what you need, it's better to be fully general like this.Your  does the same thing as the backticks in that example, your pipes are the same as the example's pipes, and your arguments aren't anything special.So:If this seems like a mess, consider that:Your original shell command is a mess.If you actually know exactly what you're expecting the pipeline to do, you can skip a lot of it.All of the stuff you're doing here could just be done directly in Python without the need for this whole mess.You may be happier using a third-party library like .How could you write the whole thing in Python without all this piping? For example, instead of using , you could use Python's  module. Or, since you're not even using a regular expression at all, just a simple  check. And likewise for :
