I have a dict-I want to use list comprehension only to achieve this output-A simple for loop gets it done with -Tried to convert it to list comprehension, I did this-But weirdly for me, I got an output What should be the right list comprehension and why is my list comprehension not working?
You were almost there. The main problem you were facing is due to the order of the for loop.The order of for loop inside the list comprehension is based on the order in which they appear in traditional loop approach. Outer most loop comes first, and then the inner loops subsequently.OUTPUT
for nested  loops in list comprehension the first loop will be the one whose variable you will be using in the second one, like here for example  is used in the second loop, nested for loops in list comprehensions are hard to read therefore you should better avoid it.
You should get  first, then iterate over v : output : Note : In ,  is not defined when you try to iterate over it. @Skam has a great example for this : how to interpret double for loop comprehensionis equivalent to : 
you can try to use itertools.productresult isif you strongly need the list of lists, you can dothe output is:and some tests of the perfomance
