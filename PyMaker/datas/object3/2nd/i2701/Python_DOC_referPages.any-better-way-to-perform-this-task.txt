I want to match the key from the entities list of ids and append the values of the key in the entity mapped list and return it is there any better way to perform this task?? Mapping is a dict.
You can do like this with ,Method 1You can search inside  instead of iterating and match.Complexity: Method 2You can search in the dictionary too like this,Complexity : Demo
I may suggest you to use the map function which can return an iterator that applies a function to every element of a list. For your purpose, the function is  and the list is . it will insert  in the output list if the entity is not a key of  dictionary, as below:  The same with a generator comprehension gives the following:  Using iterators like map or generator objects can save memory because it does not compute and store all the values in memory if you don't need. Instead, it yields one item at a time. Of course the way to do always depend on what you need to do, so you may also prefer using lists directly, no problem with that !
other solution is:because the dict keys is unique list, example:result is:
