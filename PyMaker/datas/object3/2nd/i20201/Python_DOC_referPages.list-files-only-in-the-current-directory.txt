In Python, I only want to list all the files in the current directory ONLY. I do not want files listed from any sub directory or parent.There do seem to be similar solutions out there, but they don't seem to work for me. Here's my code snippet:Let's suppose I have 2 files, holygrail.py and Tim inside my current directory. I have a folder as well and it contains two files - let's call them Arthur and Lancelot - inside it. When I run the script, this is what I get:I am happy with holygrail.py and Tim. But the two files, Arthur and Lancelot, I do not want listed.
Just use  and  instead of .Example:But be careful while applying this to other directory, like which would not work because  is not a full path but relative to the current dir. Therefore, for filtering on another directory, do (Thanks Causality for the hint)
You can use  for this purpose.  If you only want files and not directories, you can filter the results using .example:or

You can use . New function in stdlib starts from Python 3.5.Faster than .  implements .
this can be done with os.walk()python 3.5.2 tested;remove the dirs.clear() line and the files in sub folders are included again.update with references;os.walk documented here and talks about the triple list being created and topdown effects..clear() documented here for emptying a listso by clearing the relevant list from os.walk you can effect its result to your needs.
instead of , just use 
You can improve this code with which will be like following .Or even better if you could point os.walk with current working directory .
My solution is:I think this solution is better
