I am writing a script to launch remote desktop sessions using rdesktop. The relevant portion of the code looks like this:When this happens, the terminal is locked up until I exit the rdesktop session. Would it be possible to launch multiple desktop sessions with this script?
 (py2 docs, py3 docs) is the correct answer here.  waits for the command to complete, while  calls it in the background, and immediately executes the next line.
You can fork the python process or use threads, or run the process in the background.
