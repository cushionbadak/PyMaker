When matching a regular expression in Perl, three variables named ,  and  are set, containing the parts of the input string before the match, the match itself, and the part after.How can I access the same values using Python regular expressions?
No, Python has no explicit support for prematch and postmatch values, but you can use the attributes of a match object to slice the input string; given a matchobject , the equivalents are:: : : Demo:You could also use  to divvie up a string around a regular expression with a group around the whole expression:You can use tuple-unpacking to put that into variables if you like:Do be aware that  will keep on splitting unless you limit it to 1 match with the  parameter:
No, you use the  module in python. The syntax is however a bit different than in Perl, there are no shortcuts as in Perl.Depending on what you are trying to achieve, you can for example use groups.
