Are there any existing libraries to parse a string as an ipv4 or ipv6 address, or at least identify whether a string is an IP address (of either sort)?
Yes, there is  module, that can you help to check if a string is a IPv4/IPv6 address, and to detect its version.But this is not a standard module, so it is not always possible to use it.You also try using the standard  module:For IPv6 addresses you must use .I also want to note, that  will try to convert (and really convert it) addresses like ,  and so on, which do not look like IP addresses.
For IPv4, you can useIf it throws an exception,  is not a valid ip addressFor IPv6, you can use:Again, it throws an exception, if  is not a valid address.
IPv4 + IPv6 solution relying only on standard library. Returns  or  or raises .
You can use the  library. It has valid_ipv4/valid_ipv6 methods:
ipaddr -- Google's IP address manipulation package.Note that a proposal to include a revised version of the package in the Python standard library has recently been accepted (see PEP 3144).

If you know for sure that the address is valid and only trying to decide whether it is ipv4 or ipv6, wouldn't it be sufficient to do just:
I prefer ip_interface because it handles situations both with and without prefix mask, for example, both "10.1.1.1/24" as well as simply "10.1.1.1".  Needless to say, works for both v4 as well as v6
