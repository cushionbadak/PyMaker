 is effectively:Does Python have a built-in function that accomplishes this without setting the initial value?The problem I have with  is that it does not work for other types that support the  operator, e.g. .
Try looking into the python  function: You pass in a function, an iterable, and an optional initializer and it would apply the function cumulatively to all the values.For example:You can change the function based on your iterable, so it's very customizable.
In the case of addition:This will work on iterables that can't be added together using . Similarly, you could perform multiplication using
This is a pretty good use for , which was moved to  in Python 3.Here is an example for chaining multiplication:You can replace  there with one of the other functions from the operator module, or just define your own two-argument function that operates on its arguments.
