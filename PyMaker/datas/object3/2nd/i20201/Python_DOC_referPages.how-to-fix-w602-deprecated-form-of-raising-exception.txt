If I use pylint (via sublimerlinter) I get following warning message: This I how I use exceptions in my code:
Raise your exception like this:From PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code - Programming Recommendations:When raising an exception, use raise  instead of the older form .The paren-using form is preferred because when the exception arguments are long or include string formatting, you don't need to use line continuation characters thanks to the containing parentheses. The older form will be removed in Python 3.
