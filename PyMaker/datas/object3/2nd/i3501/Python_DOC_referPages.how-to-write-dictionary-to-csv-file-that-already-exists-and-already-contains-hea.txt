Natural Text
I'm still kind of new to python, so please excuse my ignorance. I have a CSV file, and it already containers the headers in the first row: ,, and . I have a dictionary that maps the columns' names to their respective integers, and I would like to write this dictionary in the CSV file, with the integers appearing in the next row. However,  keeps getting appended at the end of , as in , and  and  appear in the two cells right next to .I have written text files before, I have read CSV files, and I have also 'opened' non-existing CSV files and written dictionaries to them, but writing dictionaries to existing CSV files is trumping me for some reason.Above, I did not create the headers, because they already existed. I wrote  so that the script can read the second row, instead of later writing the dictionary to the first row. When I finally call , for some reason, it's writing the dictionary values appended to the end of the first row, as described above...What am I doing wrong here?I followed Rakesh's method below, and I got the following errors:
Hoping I understood your question correctly, I think the problem is that your csv file does not have the newline character at the end of the last row. So, I'll check for that first before going ahead and appending the new row.I'm starting with this simple csv file named  which is in the same directory with the script. It's contents initially are:This is the code:This is the file after I run the script.Hope it helps.
