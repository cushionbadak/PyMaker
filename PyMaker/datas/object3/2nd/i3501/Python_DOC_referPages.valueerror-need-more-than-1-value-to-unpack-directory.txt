I know there are a lot of other discussions that answer this same question, but I haven't been able to figure out why I am getting this error. The code I have is trying to add a new name(the key) and telephone number(value) to a .txt file. The first part of inserting the new information into the text file works, but this error shows up whenever it reaches the find portion.Here's the code:and here's the .txt file:John Johnson,123-456-6789Jack Jackson,234-567-8989John Green,999-999-9999The error code that shows up is:
This doesn't reproduce with the example file you gave, butâ€¦ the problem is here:You're calling  with a  value of . This makes sure you get at most two strings back. But you can still get only one string back, if the  doesn't have any commas in it.One way this can happen is if the file has a blank line in it:It should be pretty obvious why I got that exception, right? That's exactly what's happening in your code.Your current code doesn't create any blank lines, but maybe you accidentally added one in a text editor, or an older version of your code wrote extra  values or something.One way to handle this is with a :Notice that I'm actually printing out the line that fails there. That's always better than trying to guess what might have gone wrong.Or, if blank lines are OK according to your design, you can skip over them without a warning:
