I have found a lot of documentation and tutorials such as the official  config docs, the official  cookbook, and this nice tutorial by Fang.Each of them have gotten me near to an answer, but not quite.  My question is this:When using Config Files, how can I use a logger with 2 separate handlers at 2 separate levels?To clarify, here is an example of my YAML file:I want to have two ways to run the logger, where one way () is more verbose than the other.  Moreover, when running the  logger, I want it to have two different levels for the two different handlers.This is a snippet of the code to try to launch the logger:The  line above works correctly.  I say this because when I get to the code which asks to log to the console, I will see  as the name when the log prints out.  (I have edited the yaml, but it contains  in the format.)But there is something wrong with .  Even though it is tied to the name of , none of the rest of the attributes seem to have been set.  Specifically, I see:I don't know the  module well enough to understand where the problem is.  What I want is:When I activate the  logger, I want to launch 2 handlers, one which is at the  level and writes to console, the other which is at the  level and writes to a file.How can this be done?
If I understand the question correctly, the problem is caused by the fact the logger itself has a log level, not just handlers. Logger's log level defaults to , which seems to be set on your logger. If a generated message has a lower priority than the logger's level then it does not even make to the handlers.So try setting logger's  to .  should ignore any messages more verbose than it's own level.As for this part:none of the rest of the attributes seem to have been set.What happens there is logger's  method is called to convert Logger to some sort of string representation in order to render it. Which is not guaranteed to show all the attributes of the object.
Such a long question... Too long for me to understand well.But I think you misunderstand how handlers work. Actually logger itself doesn't output anything but handlers do.So let's say if you set  on  logger, it will pass logs >=  to all handlers. And then  handler will process logs >=  but  will only process logs >= . Setting  on  logger won't let  output logs < . So you do can have two separate levels which one is >=  and goes to console while another is >=  and goes to file.I am presuming I understand you rightly...
