I have an odd problem at which when I run my code below in PyCharm or through the console (python script.py) the flask server takes an extremely long time to boot meaning when trying to access it it shows no content for a good few minutes.The odd thing is that when I run the same code above in the PyCharm debugger, the flask server takes about 5 seconds to boot, massively quicker than the few minutes it takes when run in the console. I would love that kind of speed when running the script normally and cant find a solution due to the problem fixing itself when in debugger!This code snippet is part of a larger application, however I have adapted it to be run on its own and the same problem occurs.I am not running in a virtualenv.All help appreciated.EDIT: The index.html document is very basic and only contains a few scripts and elements therefore I could not see it taking a long time to load.
The problem was with your  installation, but there's another one. You should not wait for your thread with a  loop. The better way is to join your thread, like this:
