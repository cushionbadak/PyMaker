I am trying to build a basic random serial number generator in Python, which inserts each generated S\N into a list.In the end of every generated S\N there is an unnecessary dash (-). For example:Code:Output:I tried different variations but none of them seems to work.Best Regards.
You can simply rstrip() the offending  before appending your SN to its list of serial numbers:If you need to produce lots and fast, you should draw all characters needed at once instead of one character at a time and simply put the spacers between the groups like so: Output:This is similar and (but I think) superior to @CoryKramer solution, he still draws each character individually - and using a function makes it a tad more clear what happens.
This is a bit terse for a one-liner, but it can be done using  in a list comprehension.Basically you can use  over the  for the length of each substring you want, then  to concatenate the substrings using hyphens, then repeat that for the number of total items that you want.
