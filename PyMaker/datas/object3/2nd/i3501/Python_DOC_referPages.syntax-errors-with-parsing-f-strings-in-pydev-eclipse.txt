I've a python project using PyDev in Eclipse. For sample code like below,the code is executed printing the desired output  with right alignment and no errors.However, PyDev parses this code raising error at  character and an error message . But PyDev does support double braces in f-strings since release 6.3.1 (#PyDev-884). If I remove this  character, the string is printed 'left-aligned' (which I don't want) and PyDev doesn't raise any error. This confirms PyDev does support double braces, but the error message is incorrect.On the other hand, PEP 498 for f-strings doesn't mention anything about alignment using f-strings. Is alignment part of the f-string syntax? If it is why is it not mentioned in PEP guide, and why does PyDev parser raise an error?Python: 3.6.3PyDev: 6.3.3Eclipse: Oxygen.2 (4.7.2)Thanks!
This is an issue in PyDev (unfortunately https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/ does not provide a grammar for f-strings and is very light on how the expected parsing should take place -- I'll update PyDev to cover for the provided example).
