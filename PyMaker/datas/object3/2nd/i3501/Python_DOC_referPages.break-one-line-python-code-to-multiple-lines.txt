How to break one line code into multiple descriptive line because i am unable to understand this one line code.Is this correct or not any one help me:
Well, generally you can see any opening bracket and the plus operators in the string as a "breaking point". Working with your example:OK so now we need to unpack what's happening in that join:OK so we've got some string formatting and a bunch of list comprehensions:To do the last stage there was a lot of going back and for as things were expanded. Those list comprehensions are quite terse...There are some questions here though:Where did  come from?What's the  for?etc.Your "expanded" code is not quite equivalent because you don't handle the case where there are no matches /  is empty and you are replacing  each time rather than growing it.
This code is collecting a string representation of , and then building another string with it.You need to define an external list, to account for the list comprehension expression.Further, to break down how  is being assembled, you can expand the list comprehension:Finally, just combine the three parts:
You might want to read up on list comprehensions. basically it's making a list of things like this: so this one is making a list of strings (). I assume  is a hash, but let's pretend it's a number in a range:will make:Comprehensions can become quite complicated with the addition of  statements, and whoever wrote this code is one of those  kind of people, it seems, so their code is hard to follow. Good variable names are SO important.
