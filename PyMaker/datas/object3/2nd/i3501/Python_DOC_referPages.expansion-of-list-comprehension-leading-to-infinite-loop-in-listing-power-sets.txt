I have been trying to solve the problem of listing power sets on Question 78 on Leetcode. I ran into a solution that uses list comprehensions and it works. I tried expanding it and following through with the Python documentation to make sure I get the correct syntax but I seem to be getting into an infinite loop.Given a set of distinct integers, nums, return all possible subsets  (the power set).Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.Example:The code in the solution is:The code with my change is: I think that in each iteration of the  loop, the result is getting bigger and so I wouldn't get to the end of it but why is it not the same case with the list comprehension? What am I missing?
Because first  is resolved, and then once that is computed, the  part happens, which is different from yours where you append 1 by 1. The other solution appends all at once so there is no issue
