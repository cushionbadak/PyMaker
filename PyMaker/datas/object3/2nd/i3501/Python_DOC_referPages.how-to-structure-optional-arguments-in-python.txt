I'm pretty new to python and im wondering whats the best way is to stucture and build my code in a specific data validation case. I'm building cmd line script that takes 3 arguments and save them to variables. The third argument is optional. How should i handle the optional argument. I get promted for "IndexError: list index out of range" when im not specifing the third argument. Whats the most simple and practical why to validate user input with a optional argument?
