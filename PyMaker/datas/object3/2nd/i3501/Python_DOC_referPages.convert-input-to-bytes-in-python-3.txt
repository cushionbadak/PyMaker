This question already has an answer here:Best way to convert string to bytes in Python 3?                    5 answers                Since I started using version 3 of Python I have had many problems with sending string through sockets. I know that to send a string in a socket, a  must be placed before the string to convert it to bytes. But what happens when I have to convert an  to bytes? How is it done?I need to send a message written by keyboard to a socket:However, when I try it, I get the following error:Can someone tell me how I convert  to bytes? I always use version 2.7 and I do not understand why version 3 is so irritating for the handling of sockets.  :(

To do that, you can useIt returns the string encoded as a bytes object. See str.encode
