I'm automating some repository operations and I'm using GitPython for this job. Let's simplify things and assume I'd like to assert whether my function called  method on the repository. Code below:However, I noticed that  class is somewhat special and doesn't implement . Instead, it "delegates" all the traffic to  which uses another method that does the job.My question is how to approach testing this? I'm using pytest with pytest-mock that provides a  fixture and here are my attempts:They both work, but I feel like there is a better way and maybe my approach to testing this is wrong.
Thanks to jonrsharpe who instructed me to use  argument I managed to achieve what I wanted with the following code:Excerpt from the documentation explaining what  does:By default patch() will fail to replace attributes that don’t exist. If you pass in create=True, and the attribute doesn’t exist, patch will create the attribute for you when the patched function is called, and delete it again afterwards.
