This question already has an answer here:Printf width specifier to maintain precision of floating-point value                    7 answers                I want to save a sequence of double into a .txt file, and read them later on in C. How can I achieve this without precision loss? What I don't know to do is how many digits I need to save? I doubt I may not get the exact double I saved if not enough digits are saved. Below is what I have triedI got two (I guess) imprecise representation of my data, .     3.1415899999999999    3.1415926535800001This is undesirable. I want data to be stored as is, so that another program can retrieve them exactly. Any idea?
From C11, use  which is defined exactly for this use: See https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/types/limits. It tells you the number of decimal digits of precision required such that a load of a saved , followed by a save then a reload will mean that the two load steps will always return the same . is normally 17.
