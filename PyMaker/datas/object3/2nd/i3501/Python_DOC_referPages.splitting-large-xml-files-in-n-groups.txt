I have a large xml file with the parent tag having 97k child tags. I want to split into 10 files, each of 10k tags and the last one with the remaining.I have this code for writing one child tag to each file but unable to come up with groups.So assume my sample xml with 10 child tags and I want to create 5 files each with 2 child tags.My sample xml: And my result should be 5 files, each having 2 entries as follows: The below code put each child tag per file but I want here for example 2 tags per file.Thanks in advance!EDIT to add recipes:
You have an iterable of (event, elements) pairs:Now, you want to filter this down to just the  elements:Now you want to group them. Use the  recipe from the  docs:You can obviously change that  to  or whatever once you get things working and want to run it for real.Now, you can just iterate the groups. While we're at it, let's use  so you don't need that manual  stuff. Also, instead of building a string manually and then pointlessly calling  on it, let's just use an f-string.… then iterate the elements within the group—but be careful; if you had an odd number of elements,  will fill in the incomplete last group with  values.11. This isn't that hard to change, but I'm using the recipe directly out of the docs so I don't have to explain how to change it.
