I'm still quite unfamiliar with Python, albeit I have quite a bit of experience with JavaScript, so it's really only the idiosyncrasies of Python that I need to work on. Considering that, and the fact that I know there are some subtle differences between JS RegEx and Python RegEx, I have a question about a Python RegEx statement. Is there any way to make the following statement more concise?The Whole Regular ExpressionBreakdown of the Whole Regular ExpressionI'll break this down further for you. The URL address will always begin with  and always end with , so no need to worry about this, but......is the specific part of the regular expression that matters, which can be broken down even further.URL Structure and Possible Formats of Dynamic Values or  or  or  or Steps , , , and  can be ignored altogether, which leaves us with...The Only Dynamic Values    2.  or  or  or     6.  or It may be my own ignorance or inexperience, but the regular expression I've devised seems clunky so to speak. Is there any way to improve this regular expression?!
Without having any sample URLs to test with, the simplest solution I could find is this:So here's a breakdown of what I did differently:Instead of , I simplified it with Instead of  I used The only issue I saw was that you aren't taking full advantage of your character classes. If you would like to provide a few sample URLs I'd be able to fix any issues you might run into. But as far as I can tell, it does what you need it to.You can also use  if you really want to simplify, but that might not be restrictive enough.
