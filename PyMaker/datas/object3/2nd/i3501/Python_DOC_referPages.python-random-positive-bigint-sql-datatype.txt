This question might generate be a very simple answer of, "Yep, that's fine".  I'm trying to come up with a simple way to generate a random number from between (inclusive) and Should be easy right?  I'm doing this and I think it's working correctly.My concern is that  is the upper bound of  for the SQL datatype.  Does  have an upper bound like the SQL datatype?  Is there some other pythonic way I should be approaching this?
According to docs.python.org , randint returns a random integer N such that a <= N <= b. Alias for randrange(a, b+1). There's nothing about limits.Also, in Python 3 the plain int type is unbounded.So, I think it should be fine.
