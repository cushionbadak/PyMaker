In my Visual Code Studio running python3.6 - my code is saved as  as: !C:\Users\Bones\Anaconda3\python.exe  [1]def readFastq(SRR835775_1.first1000.fastq)Red Error underline def [pylint] E0001:invalid syntax (, line 3).In Anaconda command prompt running python3.6:File "Langmead12Test.py", line 3      def readFastq(SRR835775_1.first1000.fastq)                               ^  SyntaxError: invalid syntaxQuestion(s): I'm a total newb here but I can't seem to understand why VCS throws an error under def and my anaconda command line prompt throws error at the . within the fastq filename. Are these independent errors or different representations of the same error? All thoughts and hints are welcome. Background: I am attempting to execute exercise in ADS1: Practical: Working with sequencing reads. Ben Langmead's Youtube class on reading fastq files ().
