I am having this error:my code is:and the indexing method is attached to the  signal:I am testing if  is not falsy in order to get ... yet, it seems even with NoneType it gets to that part. Where could the problem be?
You already know this, but with your code, that error can only occur if  is . But the truthiness test will fail if  is , so that section of code canâ€™t be reached. You are right about both of these things. The conclusion must be that something is not as it appears with your code. If you try to put together a minimum, verifiable example (a short section of code that others can run to reproduce the problem), then you will probably find the error. That is similar to a structured debugging process (keep narrowing the problem until you find the source), and I often find I discover my errors as I try to write a good question about them. Alternatively, as a first debugging step, it would be helpful to take a closer look at  Is it  or not? You can also make your test a little more precise (although it shouldn't be necessary):This is arguably more 'pythonic' and slightly faster, but I like it less:
