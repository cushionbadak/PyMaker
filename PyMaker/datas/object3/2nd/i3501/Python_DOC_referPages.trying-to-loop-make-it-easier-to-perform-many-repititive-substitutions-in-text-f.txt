Natural Text
I'm a student dealing with this weird old program that takes only files as input and outputs directly to terminal. I have a python script, that makes this input file, and writes the output to a text file. However, on each run I have to change the variables manually in the python script myself. There are five instances of variables, that are all in a constant format. Is there a waY I can loop/array this?My python script : This scriptTakes these values that need to be input, writes them to the input file, runs the other program(that takes the inputs from input file), and writes the output to a csv file. then i change the values in the script.The variables ALAT, ALON, and QBAER and TIME need to be changed on each run, and the values are in an excel sheet. Is there anyway I can do them in one shot? SO FAR, I have been editing each line manually. Hre is what the data looks likehttps://imgur.com/a/waiMZ67
Export the spreadsheet to a csv file; use a csv reader to iterate over the rows; use the row values to update your variables.Assuming the csv has column headers and  is just the  fields concantenated:Uses f-strings which requires Python verion 3.6+.It isn't clear from the question how the  and  fields are derived from the data.There are packages that will work with the excel files directly but the process is the same.If you want to create a new file for each row of data and check it, move the file creation inside the reader loop.  To make things a bit more readable, I've put the text construction into a function.
