I'm trying to find the first repeated character in my string and output that character using python. When checking my code, I can see I'm not index the last character of my code.What am I doing wrong? 
You can do this in an easier way:Output:
Here's a solution with sets, it should be slightly faster than using dicts.
Here is a solution that would stop iteration as soon as it finds a dup
You should use  instead of  because  already stops counting at one less than the designated stop value. Subtracting 1 from the stop value simply makes you skip the last character of  in this case.Please read the documentation of range:https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#range
There were a few issues with your code...1.Remove  from 2.Move back one indent and do  even if you don't go into the if statement3.Indent and do  in the first for loop.See below of how to fix your code...
Nice one-liner generator:Or following the rules in the comments to fit the "abba" case:
The below code prints the first repeated character in a string. I used the functionality of the list to solve this problem.Working fine as well. It gives the result as 'g'.
If complexity is not an issue then this will work fine.
