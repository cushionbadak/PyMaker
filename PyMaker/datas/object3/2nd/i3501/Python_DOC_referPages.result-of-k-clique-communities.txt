There is a function in networkX called k_clique_communities that find k-clique communities in graph, and I run the code on my data.I am confused about the result here. What does list(c[9]) mean?What's the difference between list(c[9]) and list(c[10])?
The documentation for k_clique_communties says that A k-clique community is the union of all cliques of size k that can be reached through adjacent (sharing k-1 nodes) k-cliques.Now each individual list item will a collection of (union of) k-sized cliques thatw each other and shared (k-1) nodes. In your case  returns So this is a union of 4-sized cliques that were adjacent to other and share 3 nodes with each other. You can visualize these only these nodes from your graph and then you will see that these were adjacent cliques sharing 3 nodes with each other.Now to the next part,  and  are nothing but individual list of such union of k-cliques with the properties described above, i.e. it might be the case that there must have multiple union of 4 sized cliques which share 3 nodes in your graph, so you can access the first union at , next at  and so on
 means that  is a list, you are taking the object at index 0, and attempting to initialize a new  with its contents. The difference between  and  is that they are different elements in the list . If you are confused about types, a helpful tip is to throw in a  statement. , in this case, would give you . Here is the doc page on lists for more help getting started.
