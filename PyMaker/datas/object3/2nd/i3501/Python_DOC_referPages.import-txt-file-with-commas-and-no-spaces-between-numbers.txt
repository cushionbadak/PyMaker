Natural Text
I am currently trying to import a .txt file.  I typically like the code:however I have even tried:The problem I am currently running into is that the file I am trying to import has over 1000 rows is supposed to have two columns of numbers.  However, it seperates the two columns with a comma and no space as follows:If I try to import the values with the genfromtxt command it just imports everything as "nan".  If I try importing the values using the "with open" command and replacing all of the commas with spaces I loose the format of having two collumns and over 1000 rows.  Any advice?
It seems to be a comma-separated-value file (csv). Use the python  module or pandas  function... Or if you want genfromtxt, you can use the delimiter parameter: 
you have to split the file.read('\n') instead of replacing the new line :)
