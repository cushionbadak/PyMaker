I am trying to sort out how to pass the boolean value False from the command line to the argparser. My origninal code looked like:From the command line, I typed: python myscript.py -data FalseAlso variations with single & double quotes around False. When I examine the contents of the args namespace, args.data is always True.So I changed the argument definition from bool to str, with a string "True" default as shown below:I then added some massaging of the args to get the boolean value I really wanted:This workaround does work. Is there a better way to do this?
You can use the  or  parameter to  (see the argparse documentation). For example, if you want the default to be  then you could add an argument with :Then  will be  if you run  and  if you run  without the  argument.

If an argument is meant to be a boolean, you should simply use  or , so that the presence of the option itself would result in a  or  value, and the absence of the option would result in a  or  value, respectively.From argparse's documentation:
