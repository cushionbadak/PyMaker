Let's say I have a list of unknown size, then I can access the last element using:However, is there any way to do this via a slice object likewithout knowing the length of my list?Edit:I simplified my Question a bit. I am fine with getting a list back, since I am iterating over the sublist later. I just needed a way of getting the last item of list besides being able to get every second element and so on ...
Yes, just use  as the  argument:This will of course produce a list , rather than the  in your question, because slicing a list always produces a sublist rather than a bare element.
If your objective is to pass arguments which you can use to index a list, you can use :In my opinion, for this specific task,  is cleaner than extracting a list via a slice, then extracting the only element of the list.Note also that this works on a wider range of objects than just lists, e.g. with  as above.
