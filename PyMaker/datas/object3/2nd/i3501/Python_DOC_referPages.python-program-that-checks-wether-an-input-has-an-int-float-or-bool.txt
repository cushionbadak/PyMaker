So I'm trying to make a program here that asks for an input but then checks whether the input has an integer, boolean or float and if it has any of these characters then it will ask for the input again. I want to do that instead of just writing  as if the user inputs an  or  etc it will print error and stop the program.Here is what I have at the moment but it isn't working:If you can help please reply.
It seems you want to check your name only includes alphanumeric characters and potentially whitespace. You can achieve this via  after splitting by whitespace.Remember that  always returns a string, so you need to use string methods to validate user input. You can check for empty strings using  as an additional validation. Use of  or  is inappropriate.In addition, you need to include  within your  loop so that a user is able to re-enter a name. Here's an example:
"checks whether the input has an integer, boolean or float" doesn't really mean anything.  always returns a string, and a string doesn't "have an integer boolean or float", it only has characters, period. You have to rethink and reword your specifications on what is an acceptable input based on this fact (which sets / sequences of characters are allowed or disallowed), and only then will you be able to write the proper validation code.
