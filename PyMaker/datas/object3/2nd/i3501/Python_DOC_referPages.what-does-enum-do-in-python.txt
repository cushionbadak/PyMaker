I understand that enum is a class I can inherit from to make my class iterable over the objects.But what does enum() function do, as shown in this code snippet below?
 is not a class you can inherit from  in the  module is (see the documentation).The  in the code you are describing is a callable object that has previously been put into the list . We can't tell you what it is, or does, without the rest of the code.
Not sure what the topic of the question is.. But to possible answers:enumerate can be used to get the iteration index:On the other hand there is: https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.htmlAnd especially: https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#enum.EnumIt is well documented..
