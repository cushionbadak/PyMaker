I have a python script that communicates to a device over serial interface. There is a function  to be exectuted which sends some commands to the serial interface and waits for  to be triggered by device. If  is not triggered within 5 sec then execute  again.How should I monitor if  is executed or not within a time period of 5 seconds.I am running python 2.7 on windows 10.Thanks
Unfortunately it is hard to provide a generic correct answer without seeing your code and what you are using. What exactly in your code is calling ? Are you using some sort of event loop that allows event registering? If yes, then you should also use that event loop's timing methods to timeout the triggering.A more generic approach would be to use a global variable or attribute to do the monitoring.If you're using threads then maybe an event object is what you want, as they allow waiting with a timeout: https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#event-objects
