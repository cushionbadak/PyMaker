I have 1 year of satellite measurements of the electrons (the instrument was measuring every 4 seconds). This array is called 'electrons'. I also have the corresponding times in format datetime.datetime (called 'time'). I want to average electrons array to get a mean value for every minute instead of every 4 seconds. I wanna put them in a new array 'g'. However, when I write the loops, it becomes extremely slow. Is there any way to make it faster? Here is what I do:Is there a way to avoid the nested loops and make it faster?Maybe there is a way to make it faster using multiprocessing/parallel computing?
Whenever you have a problem regarding iteration, think of .I also advise to define  outside the loop as it would otherwise be instantiated on each  iteration.
The alternative (at least for the 3 inner loops) is to loop on the number of minutes, then use division+remainder to compute hour and day:this is a tradeoff between using 2 divisions/modulos (using the  function allows to do it in one go) at each iteration vs 2 loops. As python loops are expensive, it's worth trying.
If there is any static initialization (for your code)It should be outside the for-loop. Because, everytime that loop runs, that array will be initialized for that many computations.
It looks like you're not using month, day and minute for anything else than calculating seconds.you can make it in just 1 loop with something like this without even having to hard code the days in a month array:
