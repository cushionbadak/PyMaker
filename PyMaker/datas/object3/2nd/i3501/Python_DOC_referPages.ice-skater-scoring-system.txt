This is a program i have been working on but i have had some problems with. When this program is executed it prints the list of skaters and there information twice but i don't want that but i don't know how to fix itwhen i run the program with some test results this is what it prints:as you can see it prints it twice which I don't want.
You need to recreate  each time through the loop.On the first time through the loop,  and  are both empty: you get name and scores, append them to  and append that to . All is good.But then you go through the loop a second time for your next skater. You append their name and scores to  which already has the previous skater's name and scored. Then you append that whole thing to  again. Now  has two copies of , and  has both skaters and their scores.Adding  before you call  should resolve the issue.
You are off to a good start but I would like to warn you against using the variable name . That is the name of a type in Python so instead, you can use  or . In this case, I'd call it . This question covers all the names not to use for variables.When you're adding names and scores to your lists, you never clear them out so you are adding them multiple times.However, I don't think lists would actually be your most useful data structure here. I think a  where the key is the name and the values are the scores would work best.At the start, create a  rather than your lists:When printing the list out, print the  instead:Remove your code to add the items to the listsInstead, add them to a dictionary. Here I made the key the name of the skater and stored both all the remaining scores and the average score.Note, you still need to clear out the score list:The output here would be something like:
