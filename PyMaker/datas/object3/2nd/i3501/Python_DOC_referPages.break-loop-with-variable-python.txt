I'd like to write my loop in a more compact form. When I have code in this form, everything works fine:But when I try to use the code in this form, my loop does not break:Why does my loop in the second situation not break with  inside  ? After changes (All Code):
Your condition  will bind  to , and unless  is  also that will not be evaluated as you are expecting.Better use  combined with :Here you have a minimal exampleEDIT:Since  checks all this code would fail, because you only check from the index  to , for that use a :remember that python slices are not tail inclusive  
  and  are not same. In the first statement every value needs to be equal to  to get the truthy value. But in  the second code if all the values are truthy even they are not equal to  then the expression will return .
