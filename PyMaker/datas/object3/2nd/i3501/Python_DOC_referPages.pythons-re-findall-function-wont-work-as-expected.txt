I'm trying to create a python script that will find all the files from a working directory with a certain name pattern.I have stored all files in a list and then I have tried applying the re.findall method on the list to obtain only a list of files with that name pattern.I have written this code:I get this error at the last line of the code:I have also tried re.findall(all_files) instead of using the 'fileRegex' created prior to that line. Same error. Please tell me what am I doing wrong. Thank you so much for reading my post!Edit(second question):I have followed the answers and it's now working fine. I'm trying to create an archive with the files that match that pattern after I've found them. The archive was created however the way I wrote the code the whole path to the file gets included in the archive (all the folders from / up to the file). I just want the file to be included in the final .zip not the whole directories and subdirectories that make the path to it.Here is the code. The generation of the .zipfile is at the bottom. Please give me a tip how could I solve this I've tried many things but none worked. Thanks:
 works on strings not on lists, so its better you use  over the list to filter the ones that actually matches:     
regex works on strings not lists.  the following works
 doesn't take a list of strings. You need  .
