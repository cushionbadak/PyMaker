I trying to creat a list  from other lists  and been searching for a while now and this is what i have come up withIt prints what i want it to, but my problem is that i canÂ´t get to continue...I need to keep it printing the next and next  untill list  runs out of elements. i have tried nested loop,  in  and extracting every element but this is the closest i have come and could really use some help or directions. 
Here you go my friend!We assume that the length of every list is equal to the total number of the lists (without a)This will work for any number of lists with any lengthSame code with explanations
Use  for the first list (actually, iteratble), and then  all your iterables.
Assuming  are of the same length, you can zip the elements (extending  to the required length first):
Use  with  handling empty values in one list:
The other answers result in lists of tuples. If you want a list of lists, I would suggest doing a list comprehension:
