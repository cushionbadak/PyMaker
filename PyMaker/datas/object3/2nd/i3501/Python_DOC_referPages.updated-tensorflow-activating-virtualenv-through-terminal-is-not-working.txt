macOS High Sierra 10.13.2 â€” MacBook (Retina, 12-inch, Early 2016)Trying to set up Python TensorFlow NOT because I like Python (hate it) but because that was what was recommended NOTE: Not very experienced with Terminals and whatnot, but an okay programmer.NEW PROBLEMS: My computer seemed to have downloaded TensorFlow, but when following the steps to test it, this showed up: EVERYTHING seemed fine when I finished the steps for installation...So, I was thinking today that it would be pretty awesome to see if I could figure out how to set up some sort of neural network programming environment on my computer and eventually found TensorFlow. Everything was going pretty well, I was just following the instructions on this page at the official site for instructions. I installed pip, Virtualenv, nose/tornado (said I needed them, created a Virtualenv environment for Python 3.n, which I updated to today, then got to this step:Activate the Virtualenv environment by issuing one of the following  commands:   I used the command it said to use for bash (wow, these names are horrible and nondescript), but I'm not 100% sure I use bash, almost certain because that is supposed to be the default on Mac and got this:Input:    Error Message Output:  NOTE: There were some other messages, here are screens of the whole shell.Screenshots on my GitHub Pages
You haven't created a virtual environment. There were errors. Please reread carefully your own screenshots, last but one and the last.Cannot copy/paste the error message here from the images. That's one of many reasons why images without text are bad.
