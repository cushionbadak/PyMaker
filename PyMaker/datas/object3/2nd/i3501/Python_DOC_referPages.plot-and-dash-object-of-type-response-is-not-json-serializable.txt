I want to build a Dashboard where most of the content (headers, graphs, etc.) are dependent on a main input from the user. Therefore, I want to create many callbacks so that output is dependent on the user input. But this seems to cause many errors. The current one is: "Object of type 'Response' is not JSON serializable"But more generally, I am also looking for some inputs on my code. Thank you so much! I am really stuck.Note: the error happens then first time I try to use the dropdown menuFull traceback: enter image description here
You don't show what your data looks like, you code snippet doesn't have all of your variables you call and there are some syntax errors. Let's get started.Flask is the being using in the background but you do not need to worry about using  from  or any other similar module. You're just passing html elements and not something serializable like a list.  In all of your callbacks, if you are sending objects to the  attribute of a  it needs to be in a list. e.g.  ==> .As I commented earlier: , doesn't make sense. dict is a type function so it needs parenthesis  not brackets . Also, is not a key/value pair so  will still throw an errorIf you saved a variable with the name  DO NOT DO THAT. It's a function and you don't want to overwrite the name of built-in functions. You give two elements the same ID. This will cause errors. You have  and . This will create a loop that will destroy your application. From what you provided above I was able to put this code together that works. It should be close to what you need. If you are going to use dash I would suggest using  instead of import graph objects. It doesn't really matter but Dash does a nice job of wrapping everything together so you don't have to use  and  and use their other sub-modules. It's also common in Python to not use parentheses on you if statements. read here for style guidelines. PEP8 is also very popular. Style guides will help your code become more readable and keep you from making silly mistakes. Finally,  is actually a function in python and you should not use it as a variable in you callbacks. See documentation for input(). You should not overwrite or use built-in functions or variables for names of your variables or functions. It will confuse the reader and could cause errors in your code.
