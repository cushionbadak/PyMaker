I'm trying to create blocks for a platform game with pygame I'm working on, but can't figure out how to do it. I tried making it so that you could easily just write a "B" in the level list to create a block and in that way build the game's structure. So what I'm basically wondering is how do you find each B:s x and y coordinates, put those in a list and get that to show up on the screen. I have already gotten the player to work how I want it to, so the blocks are the main missing piece now. The code for the platforms(aka blocks) is shown below:After all of the code that is shown above I say:  #all_sprites is the group I made for all spritesAnd then in the game's main while loop I wrote:Any help or other ideas would be greatly appreciated. If you have any links to someone who has done a similar thing that would also be great.
Here's a simple way to create platforms: I define a list of rects (just tuples with four elements in this case), iterate over it to create the platform instances and add them to the sprite groups.If you want to use a list of strings as your level, you can use two  loops and the  function:
