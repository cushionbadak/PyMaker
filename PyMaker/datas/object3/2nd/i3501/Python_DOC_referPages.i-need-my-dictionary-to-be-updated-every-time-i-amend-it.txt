This question already has an answer here:How to save a dictionary to a file?                    9 answers                I made a program which stores, updates, removes passwords for different accounts. However, although the program runs smoothly, whenever I restart the program, the PASSWORDS dictionary gets reset to the value in the program. Is there a way to update the dictionary every time I use the program from Windows CMD?
You need to use  (such as:text file) or database. Store your values here and read from here. If you want to store data that won't be removed after closing your program then this is the key trick. Simplest one is to use file.You can read this documentation to know how to use  in Python.
You need to check the answers here:How to save a dictionary to a file?If you have a realy big password list and/or you want to run this code in parallel, running in more instances in the same time, you may consider using some database or other backend.
