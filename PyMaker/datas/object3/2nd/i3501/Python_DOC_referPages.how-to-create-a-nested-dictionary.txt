so I have some problems with my dictionaries in python. For example I have dictionary like below:And I would like to have nested dictionary that looks something like that.is this possible? I was searching for nested dictionaries but nothing works for me. 
You just need to loop through  and assign the correct values from .Code:Output:The above uses  to check if the value is a list, so you can loop over it and assign the correct values from . It also uses  to ensure  is added if a KeyError was encountered when searching for a key  in . One-liner:But this becomes messy and less maintainable.
First, you hate to put brackets around your keys and values.Then I suggest you do a for loopI have ignored your  thing. But it wont be difficult to implement it if you understand this first example.
