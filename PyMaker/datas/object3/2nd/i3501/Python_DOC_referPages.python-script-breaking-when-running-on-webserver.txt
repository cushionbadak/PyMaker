Natural Text
I'm relatively new to Python (and development in general) so would appreciate any help that can be offered.I've built a script which runs on my local machine, and I want to run it on my webserver if possible as a scheduled task.The script checks for new emails in a dedicated email account, and if certain criteria are met against the subject, a textfile is appended with taskpaper formatted text, which I will have a workflow (iOS) setup to add these tasks into omnifocus.I was originally getting the following error:So I added 'import email', and now I get the following error:I'm not sure where I'm going wrong, as it works locally but not on my server. I can set up a raspberry pi for this, but since I already pay for a webserver, would be great if it could run this for me.My Code:
Probably one of your messages had no  header, and thus wasn't able to get it.The Python documentation for  states the subscription operator returns  if it's called with a non-existing header.__getitem__(name)Return the value of the named header field. name should not include the colon field separator. If the header is missing,  is returned; a  is never raised.Note that if the named field appears more than once in the messageâ€™s headers, exactly which of those field values will be returned is undefined. Use the  method to get the values of all the extant named headers.
