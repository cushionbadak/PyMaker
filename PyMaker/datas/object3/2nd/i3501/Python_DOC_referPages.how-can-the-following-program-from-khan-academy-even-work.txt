I have just started programming. Please state the simplest explanation. My question being, since the user input is assigned to the variable user_input and not the variable number.  how does factorial function recognizes the user input?Also what does it mean by return product function??
When you call ,  is first evaluated to a value, and then that value is given to the  function.  The function binds all the values it receives to the appropriate names in the local symbol table (a mapping between identifiers and values), then begins execution.The  function doesn't know that the value came from your  variable.  In fact, you can call functions using values without assigning them to names first.   and  are also valid function calls.
This program works because this snippet of code:Takes the value of the variable  and passes it to the  variable specified in the  function when the function is called.This works as such because Python is a "Pass By Value" language. The input'ed variable is not used in the function, rather the value associated with it is passed into the function and assigned to a new variable.Extra Info:Java is an example of a "Pass by Reference" Language. I.E. it would use the original variable instead of passing it to a new variable.
The  variable gets passed to the  function with this lineThen the the math is handled inside the  function and returned to be stored in the  variable.
This is because the function factorial takes a number which has been passed it while calling this function. There is no such necessity that the variable name should be same.
