I'm working from a book, very much newbie stuff, and the code below is from the book, and defines a simple class. But for some reason, the author has decided to put a "helper method" called  outside the class. I cannot for the life of me figure out why he would do this, as the method seems integral to teh operation of the class. He writes:The index checking is taken care of by a utility function Iâ€™ve written  for the purpose, check_index.I have tried putting it inside the class (the code below is as it is in the book), but the runtime refuses to find the method - it falls over withMy questions are, why did the author put this "helper method" outside the class, and why does the code not work when I move the method inside the class:When I move the method inside the class, I just slot it in with the other methods. But it is not found by the runtime. Why?
You need to use Ex:And call the function with self Ex: 
Your  still defines a method of , regardless of what you call the first argument, which means you have to call it like a regular instance method (), and if you want to pass it an argument you have to add it after . If you want to define a method on the class itself, you can use  or :
 is not a new-style class. Check thisYou have 2 options:Add  to . In the class, you will use it as . You will need to instantiate an  class object.Add  before . You will use it as
