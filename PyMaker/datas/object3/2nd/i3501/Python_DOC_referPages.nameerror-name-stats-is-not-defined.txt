i am messing about on python trying out classes but i am getting a name error which i dont know how to fix. it works fine when not in a class but now it is it doesnt work i presume this is a obvious problem , or just the whole thing is wrong, and i now look stupid lol, the other variables are things i havent got round to doing yet so ignore them. (yes the stats are ripped straight from fallout")
your problem is that you have the   and the method  you can rename your  attribute to , and also you need to make an object from  class for example
 is a method of your class . That means  exists within the scope of , but out of the scope it is not defined.Then there's another problem: Your  takes an argument with the same name (), and then you set  as an attribute of . That means you override your method  with whatever you pass to the  call (when you set ). You should rename this attribute, maybe to .And in your global scope, you have never instantiated your class . So you could do something like this:This will resolve the error. However I'm not sure if the code will do what you expect it to do. You define a lot of variables within , like  etc. Maybe you'd want to define them as attributes to , so .You can then access them in the global scope via  etc.
