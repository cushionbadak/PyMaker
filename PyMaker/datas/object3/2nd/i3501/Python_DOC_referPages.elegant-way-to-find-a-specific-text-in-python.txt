Natural Text
Is there a more beautiful way to exclude strings from a text than this? Sorry I am fairly new to programming.For example, I want to find bettext[1] by searching through the list of strings.Sorry if it's already been answered, I tried two different but similar stackoverflow answers and tried to apply them to this code but it didn't work
Yes there is!For starters, put all the excluded strings in a list because you are going to do the same thing with them. Then use  to make sure something is true for every item of this list:
There are utils to shorten your code, particularly you can use a list of strings to exclude and  or  with a generator expression in your condition:
First of all, use a container for your strings, not n variables. I suggest a set because  checks will run in constant time.(The set contains , , ..., .)Next, use the  builtin:This is roughly equivalent to:The  may look weird. Mind-parse it as .
