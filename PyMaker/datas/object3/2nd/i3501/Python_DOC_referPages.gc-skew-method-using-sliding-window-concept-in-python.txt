I have completed a beginner's course in python and I am working on a problem to improve my coding skills. In this problem, I have to calculate the GC-skew  by dividing the entire sequence into subsequences of equal length. I am working in a jupyter notebook.I have to create a code so that I'll get the number of C's and G's from the sequence and then calculate GC skew in each window. window size = 5kb with an increment of 1kb.What I have done so far is that first stored the sequence in a list and took user input for length of box/window and increment of the box. Then I tried to create a loop for calculating the number of C's and G's in each window but here I am facing an issue as instead of getting number of C's and G's in a window/box, I am getting number of C's and G's from the entire sequence for number of times the loop is running. I want number total number of C's and total no of G's in each window.Please suggest how can I get the mentioned number of characters and GC skew for each overlapping sliding window/box. Also is there any concept of sliding window in python which I can use it here? 
I hope this would help in understanding,
