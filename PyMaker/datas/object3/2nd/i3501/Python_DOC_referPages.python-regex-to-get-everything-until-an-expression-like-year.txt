I have a data frame column named 'movie_title' which has movie names along with year. Following are two types of movie titles in the above mentioned column.I want to split this into two columns with title and release year. I was able to extract years successfully using following regex:Need help in writing another regex which can extract titles(excluding year info along with brackets). e.g. title1 and title2 should look like:
This does the trick almost:You just need to get rid of the trailing  that it doesn't capture. Will update this answer if I find anything better.Another thought: If you are sure that the year will appear at the end of every movie title, why not just strip the last bit off? So remove  off of every movie string you have?
to get the year and eliminate the parenthesis at the end use the regex "find the first string with at least one digit followed by a parenthesis" the regex looks like this:'\d+(?=\))' 1.) \d means find a digit, the + infront means find at least one of these2.) (?=) means followed by. \) means the character ')'. so (?=\)) means followed by a ')'3.) putting these all together means a string of at least one digit followed by ')'INPUT: City of Lost Children, The (Cité des enfants perdus, La) (1995)OUTPUT: 1995 to get the movie tittle use the regex "get the first string with any number of non digits followed by '(' looks like this: '\D*(?=\()'1.)/D means non digit. with * it means any number of non digits2.)again we see (?=\() means followed by '('3.) all together it means any number of non digits followed by '('INPUT: City of Lost Children, The (Cité des enfants perdus, La) (1995)OUTPUT: City of Lost Children, The (Cité des enfants perdus, La)note: the regex for getting the tittle assumes there are no digits in the tittle.
