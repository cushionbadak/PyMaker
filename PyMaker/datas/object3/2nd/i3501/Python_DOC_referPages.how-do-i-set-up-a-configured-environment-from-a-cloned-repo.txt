I cloned a repo and I'm trying to run my tests and i'm getting an interpreter error:The project downloaded a , solutions view that I opened it with and I thought it set up my enviornment but it doesn't seem to be doing so. Not sure what to do from here.
The best thing you can do is create a (or use an existing) Virtual Environment. It looks like your program is looking for one in the folder "env". Try this:Open a terminal (Windows key + R, then type cmd and press enter)Navigate to your repo folder using Run the command  (if there is no folder called "env" in your repo, use my instructions below)Try running your program again.I hope this helps, post a comment if it doesn't and I'll add as much detail or explanation as you need. Good luck!For Googlers or people who that doesn't help, look for these files in your repo: (a list of plugins you need to set up a virtual environment) (folder containing a virtual environment)SolutionIf a folder named 'venv' or 'virtualenv' does NOT exist,run this command to create it:  (or for Python 3: ). If it does exist, move forward.You have a virtual environment! Now enter into it using:  (on Unix or OSX, see the link above for the Windows command).If  is there, run this command next: . If not, move forward.Run the program again (via whatever method the repo says you should use). If you get 'error: module is not installed' use the command  and run the program again.Keep doing step 4 for each missing module, once the program is working use  to create a requirements file and save yourself the headache next time. :)
