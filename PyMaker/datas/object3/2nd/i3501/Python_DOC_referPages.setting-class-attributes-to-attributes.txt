So I am trying to set a class with attributes that also have attributes in Python 3. Something similar to this:How can I do this in Python. I know that in Matlab you can do this by simply creating a struct but not sure how Python might do this.
Python doesn't have the equivalent of matlab structs. To achieve the behavior you desire, you need to have attr1 be an instance of a class which has a property named attr2. attr2, similarly, must be an instance of a class which has a property named attr3. You can find Python class definition syntax here: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html
