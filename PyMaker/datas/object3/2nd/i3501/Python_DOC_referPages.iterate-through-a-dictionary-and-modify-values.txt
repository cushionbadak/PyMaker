I'm trying to change specific datetime values in a dict into strings by recursively iterating through it's keys. However, when I runI still have datetime objects in the places as they are. What am I doing wrong?EDIT: Updated function code.This function was written because this dict is passed through Flask's jsonify which currently strips the Timezone info and replaces it with GMT. (This is scheduled to be fixed in the next update).I've updated my function keeping in mind some of the feedback, but I am still unable to produce the result. I'm adding some sample data and my output as well. Result:A quick print inserted in the code tells me the datetime remains a datetime, and TZinfo is stripped out by jsonify.Sample Data:UPDATE - 24 Jun 2018Thank you, Patrick, for the answer. I have accepted it as the right one.However, in my edit, I talked about the idea of a list being an element  and so I have added the following code (for those looking for a way around the jsonify bug).
You can simplify your code a bit if you use  which gives you keys and values for iteration directly:Output:
