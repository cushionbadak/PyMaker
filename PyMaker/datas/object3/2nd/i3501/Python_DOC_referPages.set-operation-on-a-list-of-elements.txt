One possibility is to make use of the  module to precompute the multiset union of all elements in , like so:Here,  computes the  in your notation.See Aran-Fey's answer for the same method implemented (more verbosely) using only the standard library.
If I'm understanding correctly, you want the difference for each set and the union of the rest of the sets. I would use a loop and  and :SetupLoop and save results
This is a re-implementation of NPE's answer using  from the standard library:Example:
which means:Outputs:
