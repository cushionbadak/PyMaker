I am looking to brush up on my python so I am writing a small test class. I am making a boy class, and trying to create an instance of Boy called "shy boy" that will say what kind of boy he is (a shy boy) and "hello"Right now I am getting these errors: Thanks!
Speak needs to be passed  as a parameter, since you plan to call it from an instance of the class.For your second issue, your function is named , while the property of the class is named . If you want to print the associated  provided at initialization, just use . If you want to try to use the  function, use . Note the lack of parens for , since it is not a function and thus takes no arguments.(However, I'm a little confused as to why are you trying to pass  as an argument to  if you already have saved it in your ?)
You are missing the  arg in your function names:If you don't specify , Python will default to thinking whatever the first arg you've given it is . Unless you decorate the method with ,  will always be the default first argument, and it is implicitly passed in. Thus, in your method call, you are technically saying . So if the function is only expecting  and you also give it , then it will say "You've given me too many arguments." That takes care of the Argument number errorsFor the string error you are seeing is a class variable, not a function. Thus, saying  is not setting the class variable, it is attempting to call a class method called :You set  on instantiation of the classThat will set the instance variables. To change these, you either need a method defined such asOr you can create a new class
