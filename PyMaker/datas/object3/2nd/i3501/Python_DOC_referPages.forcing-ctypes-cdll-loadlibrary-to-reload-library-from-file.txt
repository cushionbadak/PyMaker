I have the following codeThe problem is that  refers to the original shared library, not the new one. If I delete mylib.so between the calls I get no error.Using  does not help.How can I tell  to actually reload the library from the hard disk?
I don't know how to instruct ctypes how to unload a library (didn't find a way on [Python 3]: ctypes - A foreign function library for Python, but that doesn't mean that there isn't one).It can be done manually, by forcing the loader to (decrement the library's reference count and) unload it via [man7]: DLCLOSE(3P) (also read [man7]: DLOPEN(3) for additional info on loading / unloading libraries).dll.c:code.py:Output:
