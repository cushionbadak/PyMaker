Natural Text
I was trying to make a simple program to extract words from paragraphs in a web page.my code looks like this -First I am getting this warning -UserWarning: No parser was explicitly specified, so I'm using the best available HTML parser for this system ("html.parser"). This usually isn't a problem, but if you run this code on another system, or in a different virtual environment, it may use a different parser and behave differently.The code that caused this warning is on line 17 of the file D:/Projects/Crawler/Main.py. To get rid of this warning, change code that looks like this:to this:and then there is this error in the end:AttributeError:  object has no attribute I have tried searching, but not able to resolve or understand the problem.
You are parsing that page using the paragraph tag , but that tag does not always have textual content associated to it. For instance, if you were to instead run:You would see that you're getting hits off of things like advertisements: .  As others have stated in the comment,  type does not have string methods, which is literally what your error is referring to.A simple way to guard against this would be to wrap a section of your function in a try/except block:
