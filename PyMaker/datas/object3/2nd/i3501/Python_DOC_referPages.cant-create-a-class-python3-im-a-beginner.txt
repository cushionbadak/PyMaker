I want some help for the following question.I created this class.But I can't create objects  from it.I want to make an increment counter. So input these codes, but they doesn't work in the way I assume. Like this:But, actually the result is:How can I get the expected result?
You might be looking to make a subclass of —something that acts just like an , but has some extra behavior.To do this, you use inheritance:Now, when you write , it's a  instance, which is also an  instance, so:So far, you haven't added any new behavior, but if you want to do that, you just add methods:But if you want to add an  method, there's a big problem:  values are immutable. Since  values are  values, they're also immutable. There's no way to write the class this way.You might be looking for a class that uses an , instead of being one. For that, you don't use inheritance, you just create a member:If you want it to print out its  value, you can give it a  method:And now, you can add that  method—it just replaces  with a new value:Finally, you might be looking for the best of both worlds—something that acts as much as possible like an  without actually being one, using an  for storage. This is just like  and friends from the standard library, so you can look at the source for those classes. As you can see, it's a bit more involved, so you probably don't want to try that yet. Plus, you'd have to decide what it means to act "as much as possible like an ", while at the same time being mutable.
There you go.e.g.You can also initialze count by passing the initial value to the constructor.
this is a simple class you can use
