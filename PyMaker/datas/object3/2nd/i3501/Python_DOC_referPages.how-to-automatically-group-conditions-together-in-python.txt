A couple of points  to note:You can use a list or dictionary to store a variable number of variables.Your Boolean series function as NumPy arrays; you can therefore combine a collection of series and use  (or ) to calculate their intersection.You can use a list of Boolean series with NumPy or Pandas:Equivalently, if you wish to name your Boolean filters, you can use a dictionary:Performance benchmarkingPerformance will be very data-dependent, you should also try  as per @Kopytok's solution and check performance with your data.
You can achive it by creating a list of conditions and using :Test case:Using :Using  + :
