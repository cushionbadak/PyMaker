I am working with the  library in python. At some time, I use an argument called  that takes 2 args: a key and a value. The line of code I use is the following:What's wrong here is when I call the help, it displays like this:The name 'key value' is repeated twice. I tried with lists, and generators but the only way i found was creating a little class containing the different values and yielding them when ask to  like this:and I call  like this:And it displays correctly:But I find pretty ugly using a temporary class like , and I feel like there must be another (better) way of doing this. Am I doing it right ?
From scrolling the doc deeply, I've found my answerDifferent values of nargs may cause the metavar to be used multiple  times. Providing a tuple to metavar specifies a different display for  each of the arguments:indeed, this works perfectly fine:
The metavar handler isn't particularly sophisticated, but does take advantage of the information that  class provides.It wasn't obvious as to why your class worked, so I dug into the code.Metavar is handled in the Formatter class with:andSo with your :With the tuple metavar:and with a single string
