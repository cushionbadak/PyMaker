I'm trying to ignore the first XML element using python and found one resolve here but this doesn't work for me.please look at this follow I want to ignore only the first li element and print all.So i found this codeWhere is wrong? this code shows SyntaxError: unsupported function.I don't think li[position()>1] is accepted in python.
According to the Python documentation for XPath, only a small subset of XPath syntax is supported. You can use  to select a particular item by position, but the more general  function is not supported.  Selects all elements that are located at the given position. The position can be either an integer (1 is the first position), the expression  (for the last position), or a position relative to the last position (e.g. ).If you want to ignore the first element you will have to iterate over the collection yourself.
