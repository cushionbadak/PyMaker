I have a method that sends a POST containing a JSON to an Elasticsearch instance. I am trying to write a unit test that verify the contents of the sent JSON, but I am not sure how to go about that. Should I create a local server in python and have it verify the contents of the POST or something else? I currently have this:
Creating a local server would be an overkill, what you can do is use unitest library to patch the  method so it sends the data to your internal assertion method using patch method here  is the link https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock-examples.html. You should look at  section 27.6.2. Patch DecoratorsExample:Full working example belowEDIT:Method  checks if the patched method was called exactly with the parameters specified in its invocation. In this case it is TrueChanging it to for example:Will give:You can also use the  object to check indvidiual parametrs please check the link above for the full specs of what  can doEDIT2Recently found out about this little library for unit testing  https://github.com/getsentry/responses
If you want to verify the sent JSON you should try , which will throw a ValueError if the input you pass can't be decoded as JSON.
