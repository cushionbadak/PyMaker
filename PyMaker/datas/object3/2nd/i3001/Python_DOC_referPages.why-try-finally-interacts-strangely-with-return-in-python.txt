This question already has an answer here:return eats exception                    4 answers                Weird Try-Except-Else-Finally behavior with Return statements                    2 answers                Can someone please explain me why does this work like it does? Python 3.6.3EDIT:This is not exactly duplicate as linked questions raise exceptions in their  and my example uses  which I expected to work. This function looks like it should return 1 yet it returns 2 - so basically  is ignored.  makes a good job of eating any risen exceptions but should it also eat returns?
Because finally is a cleaning up action that is always excuted if added in a try, except,else, finally ;)  You can read Python 3 documentationâ€™s page on Error handlings here:https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.htmlSection: 8.6. Defining Clean-up Actions
