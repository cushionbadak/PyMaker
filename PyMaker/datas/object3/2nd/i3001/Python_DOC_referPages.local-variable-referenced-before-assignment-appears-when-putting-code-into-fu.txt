My code works fine until I try putting it into a function. Once I define the function, indent the code, and call the function, I get the error message "Local variable 'print' referenced before assignment. Why is that popping up when all I'm changing is putting it into a function? I never assign a variable 'print.' Please help!I blocked out the token to access the server I am trying to reach for security.
I never assign a variable 'print.'Yes you do:This is an annotated assignment statement, which annotates  with type , but assigns no value.An annotated assignment always creates a local variable, even if you aren't assigning a value. From the docs:If a name is annotated in a function scope, then this name is local for that scope.In case you're wondering, empty annotated assignments are useful for cases like this:This is the only way you could tell a static type checker like Mypy to verify that  ends up holding an  no matter which  branch you take.
"I assign parsed_json elsewhere in my code"Well that's the issue. You have to pass the variable to the code, or declare it global, but best to avoid this. You could make the simple change like so. Note that you would need to do this for each variable you use in your functionSomething else to simplify you code and help debug would be getting rid of all the try-excepts
