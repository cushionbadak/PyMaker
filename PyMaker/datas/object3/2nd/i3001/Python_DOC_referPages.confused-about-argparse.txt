I am having some trouble understanding how argparse works and I've combed through the documentation but am still having some difficulty understanding.The code above works fine, but once I remove "--row-limit" on line 5, I get a Why does removing the "--row-limit" present me with this error?
 actually adds an attribute to the namespace  for each  call. The name of the attribute is generated from your argument name, here  is transformed to  because you can't have dashes in variable names. See the argparse documentation for details.So when you call , it creates  once you invoke . As Amadan mentioned, you use  later on in your code. But if you remove the  argument from the parser, the attribute   won't exist in .
