I have a list of 27 elements. I need to find all the combinations of selecting 8 elements from the list. So far I have found an algorithm as below.Any suggestion would be really helpfulEdit-What I want to do is to get combinations of 1s and 0s of 28 length pattern where only 8 bits are 0s and I need to discard combinations with 8,7,6,5,4 or 3 consecutive 0s.(First bit of the pattern is always 1) This method I have is really exhaustive. (I'm new to python, please bear with my bad programming)Any better algorithm will be really great.
There's a python inbuilt to find combinations. It's itertools.combinations. This will give you a generator at which you can iterate over to get all the combinations -Or do a  in front of it to get a list of tuples of all the combinations -
