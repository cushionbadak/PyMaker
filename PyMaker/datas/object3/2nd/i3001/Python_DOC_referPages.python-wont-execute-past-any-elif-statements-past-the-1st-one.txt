I'm in the process of writing a rudimentary Connect 4 game, with the board built into the command line, etc.  My problem is that I cant get the code to execute past the 2nd elif statement.  I set it up so that if a certain cell in the grid does not have an underscore, it should proceed to place the piece in the next row.  However, the following move always only replaces whatever piece is in the cell in row 2.  I've tried starting from rows other than the bottom 2 rows, just to try to troubleshoot, but it never gets past the 1st elif statement. Can anyone tell me where I'm going wrong with my elifs?
You should test the cells using , not . Also, you should change the same cell you test on, not the one below it:
