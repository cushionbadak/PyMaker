I am trying to create a webserver in python which can be started and stopped using a tkinter GUI. In tkinter I have a button which will call start() and a button that will call stop().  Initially everything works fine, the server starts when I click the button and it also stops when I click the stop button. When I try to restart the server again using the start button, I get a runtime errorRuntimeError: threads can only be started onceI believe it has something to do with the fact that I have already initialized threading in my init, and I can not figure out how to get this to work.  I have read through the threading docs multiple times, but I am struggling to understand it entirely.  Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.Thank you!
As the python documentation states, the  method of the  object can only be called once.In your case, you can create new instance of the Thread object in the  method:In addition you also may clean the reference to the thread in  method:
