Below is a scraper that uses Beautiful Soup to scrape physician information off of this webpage. As you can see from the html code directly below, each physician has an individual profile on the webpage that displays the physician's name, clinic, profession, taxonomy, and city. As you can see from the sample html code, the physician profiles occasionally have information missing. If this occurs, I would like the scraper to print 'N/A'. I need the scraper to print 'N/A' because I would eventually like to put each div class category (name, clinic, profession, etc.) into an array where the lengths of each column are exactly the same so I can properly export the data to a CSV file. Here is an example of what I want the output to look like compared to  what is actually showing up.I have tried writing an if statement nested within each for loop, but the code does not seem to be looping correctly as the "N/A" only shows up once for each div class section. Does anyone know how to properly nest an if statement with a for loop so I am getting the proper amount of "N/As" in each column? Thanks in advance!
For this problem you can use  from  module (docs here). That way you can define your default values, in this case  and only grab information that exists for each doctor:Prints:EDIT:For getting the output in columns, you can use this example:This prints:
