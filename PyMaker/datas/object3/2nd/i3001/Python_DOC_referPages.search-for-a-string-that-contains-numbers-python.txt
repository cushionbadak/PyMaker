Natural Text
So I have the following code:The line: if '"xe-" + #anynumber + "/" #anynumber + "/" + #anynumber' in line: Is what I'm struggling with syntax-wise.I am looking to see if a line in the file contains the following string: "xe-number/number/number" (ex: "xe-6/1/10"). It will always have this format, but the numbers will change. What sort of syntax would I use to do this most efficiently.Thanks!
You can use regular expressions for this.  Regular expressions allow you to specify a pattern of text (though not all patterns can be expressed as a regular expression).  We can then  that expression into a  object, and use that object to  strings for the pattern.
Sounds like a job for the Regular Expressions library!Is this number a date? You can restrict the amount of digits. The regular expression:  matches "xe-" followed by 3 groups of digit pairs with a slash separator. Each group of digits can be 1 or 2 characters in length.SidenotesYou don't need to close  since the  statement does that for you when you exit the block.I'm not sure what you were trying to accomplish with  when there is no match for the pattern. As it stands, it will just repeat the same  from the previous line, unless you indent that line by 1 level. Or give you an error if the first line doesn't contain the pattern.
You can test a regex with a simple program like with some online tools like https://pythex.org/ , and then make your program, a little sample to point you in the right direction would be:
