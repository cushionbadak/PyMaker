I have a list:and i want to replace the sublist if i received different values:And i want:The number of the sublist elements could change. The only thing that is the same is the Robot id. So i want to make a search, see if the Robot id is on the Online list and replace the sublist with the new one.
You can create a dictionary mapping the  IDs in your new sublists to the actual new sublists, then look up the existing  IDs in that dict and replace accordingly.This will loop over each element in the list once, giving it a complexity of O(n), n being the number of elements in the  list. If, instead, you make  also a dictionary mapping  IDs to sublists, you could get this down to O(k), k being the number of new sublists.If you also want to add elements from  to  if those are not yet present, you should definitely convert  to a  as well; then you can simply  the dict and get the . Ir order matters, make sure to use a  or Python 3.7.
