In the above code, map function taking two parameters, I got the understanding of the second parameter what it does but I am not getting 'int' parameter.
Let's say I type  and then enter at the first prompt:Would take the input "5" and make it into the integer . So we are going from a  to an Then we will get another input prompt because we have input() again in the next line:This time I'll type  and then enter.the  will split this into "123", "324", "541", "123", "134" which is a list (well a ) of strings. Then we'll map  onto them to give ourselves a  of s rather than strings.  converts the strings to integers.When checking out code it is often helpful to try things in a REPL (read execute print, looper). In your command promt just type  or  if you have it installed or use replt.it. Type  then try `a = int("123") + int("321") Wrap this with list(map(int, input().split())) to get a  rather than a .
map(function, iterable) takes a function which to apply to all elements of the list that is passed as second argument.int(x) is a function that returns an integer object constructedfrom a number or string x.Therefore, it will just make a iterable where it applied the int() function to each string from , meaning it casts every entry to int.
