I am not getting why  output is not printed for case 1 and in second case after using  it's working.Case one:OutputCase two:Output
From the Python documentation:reversed(seq)Return a reverse iterator. seq must be an object which has a   method or supports the sequence protocol (the   method and the  method with integer  arguments starting at 0).list([iterable])The constructor builds a list whose items are the same and in the same  order as iterableâ€™s items. iterable may be either a sequence, a  container that supports iteration, or an iterator object. If iterable  is already a list, a copy is made and returned, similar to  iterable[:]. For example,  returns  and   returns . If no argument is given, the  constructor creates a new empty list, .So: will return an iterator that travels backwards through the string.  turns that iterator into a list.  will split a string up into its constituent characters.Thus returns  returns , which is an iteratoryou can convert the iterator into a list using the  operator: returning  or you could iterate through it:which prints out
If you want the reversed string, try the following:This is because reversed outputs an iterator, which doesn't hold values, but rather computes them on the fly. The ''.join part consumes the generator and makes a string.See here for more information on generators/iterators.
