You can convert  format of  to  object like this using , here  is the time zone :
Just parse the string into year, month, day, hour and minute integers and then create a new date time object with those variables. Check out the datetime docs
The following function (not mine) should help you with what you want:You can mess around with the keys next to the % symbols to achieve what you want. You may, however, need to do some light cleaning of your values before you can use them with this function, i.e. replacing 2018-06-07T12:22:00+0200 with 2018-06-07 12:22.
You can use datetime lib. documentationSolution here
