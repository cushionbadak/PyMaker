I must conditionally format rows of an html table that is generated with Python. I previously had to sort table columns and did so using javascript. Rather than conditionally format background-color on html rows how can I modify Python code to do this? where 'results' row is 'success' then row is green, where row is 'fail' then row is red? the code snippet shows how I tried to do this with js only. Code is 2 py files, the js code is at end of code function resultFormating.
So you'll need to add additional logic when you add your table rows:I introduced another variable  that will keep track of rows that pass or fail. Once that has been calculated, you can add that value to the row class () to stylize that row's output.For the record, string building in loops is best accomplised by using the  method. Also, for a cleaner approach you can use  to build out each line. You can see lots of evidence online.Finally, don't use  if you can avoid it. It can easily introduce vulnerabilities. For your case, you can use  to get the variable parameter name from .
