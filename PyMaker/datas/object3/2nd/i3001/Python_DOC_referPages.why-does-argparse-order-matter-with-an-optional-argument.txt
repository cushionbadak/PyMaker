This question already has an answer here:Optional positional arguments with Python's argparse                    1 answer                Allow positional command-line arguments with nargs to be seperated by a flag                    1 answer                I have some code to parse some arguments in a file called "blah.py":If I call this file like so:It works correctly (opt='a', value='b', bool=True).However, if I call this in a different order:I would expect the same result, but the argparse module is printing an  message.  Is this a bug with the argparse module?  Why does it work this way, and what can I do to avoid running into issues like these, as I define the CLI for my script?As my interface is much more complex than the example (having subcommands and many more arguments), I have varying ways to call the interface which requires some arguments to be optional for some calls, but mandatory for others.  I plan to manually verify these cases, and on an error call parser.print_usage and exit.
You might want to look at the "intermixed" options of argparserhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#intermixed-parsingOtherwise, positional arguments always come before optional arguments.
