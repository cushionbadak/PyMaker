I'm trying to understand how I can to realize multiprocessing in my case.I have two functions: def all_url() and def new_file(). The first one returns a list which contains a lot of elements. The second one uses this list for 'for' loop. I want to make multiprocessing for second function new_file() because list which returns from all_url() is too big.Example of code:

Not sure if you really need threading just because you have to wait for a huge list to get generated. Define the  function as a generator and call it in when needed.
