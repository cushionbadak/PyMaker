I have a list that I need to sortThe rules are as follows.if the 2nd item is a number, that will always come laterothers are in their lexicographically sorted order (without changing the ordering of the individual items)In the above example, the expected output isI understand this is some form of indirect sorting but not sure how to approach that. So far, I have separated the list in terms of whether the 2nd and onward items have numbers or not. But not sure how to proceede after that.EDIT:This will outputHow do I proceed afterwards to reach to the output of 
The answer to your direct question is simple.You've already worked out how to split the list into these two lists:Now, you just need to sort each one, and add them together.But this really isn't the right approach in the first place. When looking at how to do a custom sort, the first thing you should do is ask yourself whether some other list, which you could easily transform this one into, would be trivial to sort.For example, imagine you had this:â€¦ where that first value in each tuple is  iff the second word in the string is a number.If that were your list, you could just call  or  on it, and you'd be done.So, can you transform each of your strings into a tuple like that? Sure you can:And how, you can just pass that as the  function to sort your list:That's it.The Sorting HOWTO in the docs covers key functions in more detail, with some nice examples.
We can write sorting key as follows:then use it in  builtin likeor if we don't need old order we can sort  in place (may be more efficient, at least will not occupy additional memory for a new ):More info about differences between  &  could be found in this thread.
