This may seem a naive question but I did not find any answer so far in the web and I do not want to cause any inconsistent behavior in my code. Can I name a variable  in my python code? there is a function named  that's why I have doubts.Example:Can this be treated as any ordinary variable that stores the returned value by  ? or can it behave differently at any point?
 is not a keyword in python, so you can use it as a variable name.Is there any chance of interfering with ? No.To elaborate: there is no function named now() either; it is tied to the  object (it's a class method), and you'll always need  to use it. So it's always distinguished from your variable named .Only if you assign it as follows:Here, the new variable named  equals the  function (not the result of the function). But in this case, you're completely responsible yourself for this assignment. Even then, changing  to something else will not change .Using, howeverassigns the results of the function call to the variable  (not the function itself), and the function remains as is.What is worth paying attention to, is whether you should overwrite built-in functions. This is the list of built-in functions in Python 3.7.You can assign a value to each of these names, but then you effectively lose that function*, and you may get in trouble later on. For example:So try to avoid that ( is another common mistake that should be avoided).But  is not a built-in function, as explained above.* there are ways to retrieve the original built-in function, even after reassignment, but that's outside the scope of this topic.
Below are the keywords that are used in python, Apart from that you can use any keyword you wantI hope that answer your question
 saysNamespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!You can use  as a variable even though there is a function called  because that lives in a different namespace. Every module (like module ) is a namespace, and every class or type inside that module (like ) is a separate namespace. Even inside a function you can create a local variable that has the same name as one defined in the surrounding code:though doing that may confuse readers of your code, including yourself.
It will work as Varibaleoutput:type of "Now" variable is datatype of Variable isfrom this we can say now will work as Simple Variable
