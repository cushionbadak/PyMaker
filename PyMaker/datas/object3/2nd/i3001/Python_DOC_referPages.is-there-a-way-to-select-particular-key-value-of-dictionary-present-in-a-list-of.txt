I am presently using a for loop to print all the required key value pairs of a dictionary. However is there a simpler way to select the required key value pair?The content of out is actually a JSON with list of dictionaries and each dictionary contains a list of dictionaries.
I cannot see an unequivocally simpler way to access the data you require. However, you can apply your logic more efficiently via a list comprehension:Whether or not this is also simpler is open to debate.
You can use map to generate the new list as well. But I think what you are doing is fine, it is much easier to read than the alternatives.
