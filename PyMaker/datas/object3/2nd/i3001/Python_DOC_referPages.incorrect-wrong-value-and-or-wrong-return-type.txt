When I run my code through the tester, this is what I get: Expected: 1.17Actual:   1.17Incorrect! (wrong value and/or wrong return type)I suppose the code does not want a string return type but the reason I have to string it is because the code requires that I return all my values with a floating point number to 2 decimal places whether it is a 0 or not.
