This question already has an answer here:How do you create different variable names while in a loop?                    7 answers                I have a code that needs to declare several class attributes as shown below. However, what if I have 100 molecules, would I need to copy and paste the code and manually change the numbers accordingly 100 times? Or is there a way to declare variables with different names according to the for loop counter? For exampleA quick explanation on what each function does.tensorise_smiles returns 3 tensors (in the form of ndarray) features_to_listedtuple takes in the tensor and another ndarray and returns one ndarray.What I have to do is create an attribute for each molecule 3 times, for the atom, bond, and edge features. However, the problem is if there are many molecules, I have to copy and paste the code many times, changing 1x to 2x, 3x, ..., 100x,... and so on. Is there a better way to do this?Thank you!
You can use setattr.However, I would consider using a dictionary to store all of the data.  For example:This permits you to iterate through all of the features, sort them etc.
