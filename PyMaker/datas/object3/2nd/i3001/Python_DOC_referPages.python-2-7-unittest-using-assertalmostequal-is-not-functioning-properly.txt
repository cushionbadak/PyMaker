My python version is 2.7.13. I need to test using the  module, and the data type I am testing with are floats. In the docs it says to use  for the small discrepancy when comparing floats for equality.This is what I did: I run the above code and it yields a failed test result, like the following:What I am doing wrong, or is this a bug?
Your numbers are not equal to 3 decimal places, as defined by :Test that first and second are approximately (or not approximately) equal by computing the difference, rounding to the given number of decimal places (default 7), and comparing to zero.The difference between your numbers, rounded to 3 decimal places, is .
From the docs:Test that first and second are approximately (or not approximately) equal by computing the difference, rounding to the given number of decimal places (default 7), and comparing to zero. Note that these methods round the values to the given number of decimal places (i.e. like the round() function) and not significant digits.In your case, .
