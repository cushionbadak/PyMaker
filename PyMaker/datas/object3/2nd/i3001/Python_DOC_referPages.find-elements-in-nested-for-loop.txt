I have two lists named  and  in my code. output is  and output is I need to find the 7th and 27th word elements of  (i.e. elements don't count if they are an empty string). It should be  and  but the for-loop I have only prints These are the for-loops I am using:If you have any idea why it isn't working, please let me know!EDIT: I want to print these statements but I also need to delete them
You can also just do 
I created simple function  that filters the iterable in argument  from any empty values. Then you can access the resulting filtered list with values from list :Prints:
Single line of code using  with  and Testing for speed:
Python 2Python 3['Nonsocial Play', 'Groom']
Here is a solution using using  the elements,  to iterate over the resulting iterator along with its index, and  to get only certain range of indexes from it
When the  reaches , print the current item from Deleting items from a sequence while iterating over it doesn't work.Make deques of  and  and use the rotate method to visit the items in .  Design the logic so that  items are popped off when they meet the criteria and  items are popped off when a  item is found.  Keep track of rotations so the order can be reconstructed.
This:
It isn't working because the indentation isn't correct.It would also be a good idea to include a break once the element is found since you are starting a new count after finding the first element. You are also printing be[x] which wrong. It should be y instead as y is the string you want to print.
