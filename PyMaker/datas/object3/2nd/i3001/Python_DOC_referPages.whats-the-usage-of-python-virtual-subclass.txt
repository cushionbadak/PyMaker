I am trying to understand python virtual subclass, example shows as above. instance a virtual subclass doesn't require implement abstract method at all. What's the real use cases of virtual subclass? it seems to me the virtual subclass works like something in the middle of duck type and object inherit. Duck type -- virtual subclass -- object inherit 
Why extend abstract classes with abstract classesSuppose your project were to be more complex. You could have abstract classes such as ,  and  and then concrete classes such as ,  and  (now lets ignore that some dogs swim and some fish walk):In such an implementation, abstract classes "in the middle" are very useful as they consent to avoid repeating code, as in the  example.Surely this code could be also implemented using decorators instead of subclasses on an abstract method , but generally one would prefer abstract subclasses when the code they wrap is significant or at least they lead to a semantical advantage.How they are implemented in pythonIn python you can either create an abstract class by adding to it a method that raises an exception when not overridden, as in:Or, in python ">2.6" you can use , a package that offers basically all you need to create abstract classes, such as decorators and the  (Abstract Base Class):
I read http://masnun.rocks/2017/04/15/interfaces-in-python-protocols-and-abcs/ and it gives me a better understanding. We have duck typing in Python:If it talks and walks like a duck, then it is a duck.However, a  and  both can . But they are not the same thing. Hence, we need to define an interface to distinguish them from each other. (Python does not have an  keyword, so we are actually using abstract classes)Let's me show an example:We have  and  in our program. Both of them implemented  method. Now we want to choose a plane from the hangar, get some people on board, and fly to another city. Apparently, we cannot put people onto a , so we define an interface called (actually, an abstract class) . And we let  to subclass .Everything works fine. When we want to choose a plane, we check if it subclasses . However, the Boeing company developed a package, which has a . We bought the plane (), but it is not recognized as a plane. It does have a  method, but it's not inherited from our  class so our Python interpreter won't recognize it as a plane.The good news is that Python is a flexible language. Thanks for  method of , after we do ,  is a subclass of  now. We can use third-party  like our own built . Hooray!So you see, virtual classes are used when we want to make a class from a third-party package to be a subclass of our own abstract class. We want it to implement our interface, but we cannot change its code, so we tell the interpreter explicitly "it implemented our interface, please treat it as the subclass of our own class". I think normally we wouldn't want to use it, but when you need to, use it cautiously.As Luca Cappelletti said, this is one of many flexibilities that Python allows for, following its philosophy of "we are adults here".
