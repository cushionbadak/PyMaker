How do I implement functionality where a user can only update an entry when the  and  fields of the diary entry are the same?This is what I have implemented.  I have compared the date_created field of the entry model in the db to .Data modelMethodI am currently getting the second return statement.  What could I be doing wrong?
It looks like you have  as a string (str) within .  That will cause an invalid comparison to a Python  object unless you parse the string into the same type:The classmethod  parses a string that looks like a date into a  object.  You need to then grab just the date component from this to enable the comparison that you want.  If you have a differently-formatted date-string, see strftime() and strptime() Behavior.
