I have this YAML file :when I apply my  Python function, I get thisI search the syntax of my YAML file as below, to get the same result (I want factoring my YAML node data)Have you an idea?Here my python flattendict function
In YAML you can have a complex flow node, even in a simple key (i.e. without , markup). This is so in both YAML 1.2 and YAML 1.1. That means that this:is correct YAML. The problem is that a mapping normally loads as a Python  and a sequence as a Python , both of which are mutable, cannot be hashed, and are not allowed as keys for a Python  (try executing ).PyYAML (which supports YAML 1.1) errors out on both of those lines. Since Python has an immutable  in the form of , I decided to implement loading of sequence keys in Python by constructing them as tuples in  (which supports YAML 1.2 and YAML 1.1). So the following works:printing:If you try to load the above YAML in PyYAML it throws an exception:Notes:If you don't want to round-trip, use , it uses the faster C-loader, that also handles keys-that-are-sequences, but it doesn't as smartly dump those back, resulting in  marked explicit keys.A proposal for a  for Python, did not get accepted, so there is no equivalent, not even in the standard library for a  what  is for a , and  doesn't support mappings as keys out of the box. You can of course add this to 's Constructor if you have such a frozendict.Although there is a  in Python, and a set in YAML,  does not currently accept the following as input:Probably needless to say: you cannot change the elements of such a key programmatically without deleting and re-adding the key-value pair.
