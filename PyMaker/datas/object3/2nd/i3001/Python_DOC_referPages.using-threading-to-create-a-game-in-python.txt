I'm attempting to create a scroller (game where the player seems to run an infinite distance until they die).I know that libraries and modules exist (such as ) which make it much easier to create games, but I'm trying to do it without any external modules. I'm running my code in the console window.My code:My problem: I'm using threading (which I'm a complete beginner at), as I need to keep the background moving while checking for any user input. In this case, I'm checking if 'q' is pressed. If it is, I want my character to become 'xo' instead of 'x'. However, when I press 'q', nothing changes.
The problem is that you are passing the  as an argument to  function, which makes a local copy of  for that function, so key is always False in checkForJump. You should access to the global key variable:Although this should work for this simple example, Using global variables to pass messages between threads is not a good idea and can get messy quite easily. You might want to take a look at queue library, a much better way to communicate between threads.
