What I need is- and so on ... 
You are a looking to map values to coordinates. Well, you can just access directly via  with a couple of list operations.For non-numeric indexing, use dictYou can use a dictionary for a variable number of variables. This removes the need to define a large number of variables explicitly.Using letters has the obvious limitation of allowing a maximum of 26 lists. If this is what you wish, there's no need to define letters explicitly, use :Then access via tuple keys. So, to retrieve the 2nd value from the 3rd list, you can use .
You can use  for this:Output:You need to know the dimensions of the list beforehand and the variablenames. I would probably just use the original list ...
Do you just need the values? Then like that:
The example is can be solved with simple tuple unpacking. You can use  to pair your values:This will print:If you want next values, you can do:Output:
