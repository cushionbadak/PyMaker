Say I have two python lists as:I need to get an output as:My approach so far:this gives me result as:which is definitely not the solution I'm looking for. What I think is regular expression could be a handful here but I'm not sure how to approach. Any help in this regard is highly appreciated.Thanks in advance.Edit:Values in ListA and ListB are not necessarily to be in order. Therefore for a particular month/year value in ListA, the same month/year value from ListB has to be matched and picked for both 'Sales' and 'Units sold' component and needs to be concatenated.My main goal here is to get the list which I can use later to generate a statement that I'll be using to write Hive query.Added more explanation as suggested by @andrew_reece
Assuming no additional edge cases that need taking care of, your original code is not bad, just needs a slight update:
Supposing ListA and ListB are sorted:This will print:In my example I firstly concatenate ListB variables together and then join ListA with this new list.
String concatenation can become expensive. In Python 3.6+, you can use more efficient f-strings within a list comprehension:Using , you can avoid the expense of creating new lists:
