I decided to port some of my Python functions to C, mostly following this simple tutorial. Problem is that my C function returns a complex float, and there's no corresponding type in ctypes's documentation. This is is a problem I couldn't solve myself with my limited knowledge on cross-language coding and C, even extended by Google.My C function works like this:So, based on the tutorial, the corresponding Python wrapper (probably) should be something like this:But what should this type be? How should I do this?  If the fact that the function also has a complex argument makes it significantly more complicated, please ignore the complex argument.
Create a small C wrapper function:The  and  pointers hold the real and imaginary parts of  when called, and the real and imaginary parts of the result afterwards.In your Python code, call  using e.g.Note that if  is defined in a binary library you cannot modify, you can always create another dynamic library containing only , that is dynamically linked (in C) to the original binary library.Overall, I don't think the added overhead is significant at all. It is certainly worth testing.
Naively, perhaps split it into two arguments, If that's not an option, perhaps pass the argument to the python function .These are naive solutions; perhaps they don't work but if you haven't considered it and in lack of better responses, may be worth experimenting with.Good luck!
