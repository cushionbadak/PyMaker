I have a Python package  which contains a bunch of modules / classes with this directory structure:The current use case is to use  with a bunch of  flags:Inside  it instantiates a bunch of the classes with  and runs their methods. Something like:This works well when getting non-python / programmers to use my code. But I'd like to also be able to import my package within their Python code and run the same methods in . Something like:QuestionIs there a standard/best way to do this? Note: I don't think users need to see my class structure so I'd rather there be one user facing class which implements all of the methods in Solution 1 (I don't think this is the preferred solution):Add methods from  into :Then users can do the following in their own code (it would look very similar in  as well):Solution 2:Create a  class:If I create this class should I worry about the package and class having the same name? Do I change the hierarchy of the package structure to reflect that  is the forward facing class? 
A good way would to use a  and use Put you  inside you package and this to your :Change your  to:Once you install with , you can call your programfrom the command line:For details see the full documentation.You can still import it with:
