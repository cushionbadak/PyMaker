I am practicing myself in python online and have come across this question.https://www.testdome.com/questions/python/file-owners/11846?visibility=1&skillId=9I dont know how to solve this. When I interchange the Key and Value and I am getting the output with only unique Key-value pairs as belowKindly suggest how to resolve this.
One way is to put the value in the list for "Randy", as in dictionary we can't have multiple keys of same name. Here is the solution for the same,
You can't have the same key in a dict. For your example, use owner as key and the value will be a list of files. Something like this:
Hint: instead of using a single item as the contents of the dict, use a list. Then, using a  loop, gradually populate that list with items:You can see here that we first create a new dictionary, , and then we put the key-value pairs from  into  as value-key. The key here is that each value of  is a list, not just a single item. That's why we check if the value already exists in  before adding it: if it does, then we just add the new  to the list. If not, we create a new list, with just one element: .A  can't have duplicate keys, which is why when you just interchange a dict (e.g. ) the code doesn't work as intended. The first value for  gets overwritten by the second value for .
You can use defaultdict for this:
