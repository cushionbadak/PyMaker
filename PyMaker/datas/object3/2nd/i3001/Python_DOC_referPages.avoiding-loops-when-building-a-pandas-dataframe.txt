I have an initial Pandas DataFrame with three columns, including one which contains a list of strings. The goal is to split each row into as many elements as there are items in the  columns, so that for instance this:becomes this:Currently I'm doing it like this:This works perfectly fine, except it's painfully slow. If  has 100,000 elements, it can easily take up to one hour to compute .Is there a vectorised way of getting to the same result, without having to resort to Python loops?
In essence, you are repeating or chaining values according to your column.So you can use  and  as appropriate. The solution is efficient for a small number of columns, as in your example.
