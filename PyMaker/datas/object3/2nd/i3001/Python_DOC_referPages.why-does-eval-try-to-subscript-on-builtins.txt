Python 2.  Makes sense.Python 3. How/why does  try to subscript ?  I expected the same  here, or perhaps an .Encountered via Python eval error
From the  docs:If the globals dictionary is present and lacks ‘’, the  current globals are copied into globals before expression is parsed.  This means that expression normally has full access to the standard   module and restricted environments are propagated.But you are setting  to  in the globals dictionary, so your code will evaluate to  which leads to:EDIT:Python2.7 raises  if it doesn't find the variable in  - source code.  is defined as:Python3 print different message - see source - the  will not raise  but  so the string is formatted differently, in this case In CPython, the name  can be bound to a module or a dictionary.  That is documented under the execution model:The builtins namespace associated with the execution of a code block is actually found by looking up the name  in its global namespace; this should be a dictionary or a module (in the latter case the module’s dictionary is used).
