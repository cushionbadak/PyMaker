What does %i and ab means in context of the code  in python
The format string  will be completed by the variables after the , in this case: .The  is a placeholder for digits which will be replaced by the string representation of .A more general formula is:'your %s string %d goes %06.2f here' % ('_', 2, 3.141)%s replaces strings%d integers%f floats, which can be modified to be something like: where a is the number of places the string representation of the float should have(including the decimal point), the zero after  means left padded with zeros, and b is the number of decimal places after the point.
% i is used for replacing the %d in 'vals%d.dat' with the value of i (it is supposed to be an integer). If value of i is 10, you would get 'vals10.dat''ab' describes the modes the file 'valsXX.dat' file will be opened:a: open for writing, appending to the end of the file if it existsb: binary modeYour code snippet will open a file named valsXX.dat (being XX the value for variable i) for writing, appending new contents.See the following references:https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/stdtypes.html#old-string-formattinghttps://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open
here's the explanation of the open functionIn general  is a formatter that means formatting as integer,  is a mode instruction to open that means append and binary. You can find all the modes in the link
