I expect that I may have done something wrong whilst typing the vowel checker if argument as I am fairly new to the concept of reading characters in strings. I would appreciate if someone would help me on debugging this code.If that however is not the case, than I would, again, appreciate if someone would help on telling me what I've done wrong.
evaluates as. Since 'a' is truthy in python, this evaluates to .You can either writeoror perhapsor (credit to Onyambu):
