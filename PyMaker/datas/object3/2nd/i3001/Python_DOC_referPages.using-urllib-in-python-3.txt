I have been coding a webcrawler in python 3, and everything seems to be working. So I decided to use urllib to get the source code of the pages I am going to crawl. But I get a name error that says: here is my python code:Sorry if this question has already been asked. Thank you for your help in advance.P.S: the main prblem is with the get_url() function.
Your  function returns a connection object and not a string. So you cannot do a  on it in . You should do a  on your connection object to get a string.Refer:AttributeError: 'HTTPResponse' object has no attribute 'split'https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html
