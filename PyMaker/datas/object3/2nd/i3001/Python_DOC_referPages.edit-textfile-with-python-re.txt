Natural Text
I have a large textfile (>200mb) with 70k rows. Now I want to find some special text in each row an place it again at the end of each row (separated with a $-symbol). N++ and Regex works, but is a bit slow, so I want try it with python.With the code I'll get a "TypeError: must be str, not list" for fn.write(text+run+"\n")Does anyone know the error and also knows if there is an even faster way (code)?
