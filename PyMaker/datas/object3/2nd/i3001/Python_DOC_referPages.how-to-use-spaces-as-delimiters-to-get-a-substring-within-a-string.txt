Natural Text
I have a list of street addresses, some of which have po boxes. What I want to do is remove anything that isn't a po box from the line if it does contain a po box. For example, if there is a list of ['123 whatever drive', '234 anywhere lane po box 3213', 'po box 190 441 bettername street'] this should return ['123 whatever drive', 'po box 3213', 'po box 190'].All I have thus far isWhat I think I can do is use the space after 'box' as a delimiter, grab the next substring of numbers after the space, and use the next space as a delimiter to end the string but I can't think of how to do this.
This should work:Output:
You can use regex, which is easy to test here: https://pythex.org/Will output:
Using list comprehension:I'm using simple string slicing here: if the string  exists in any address , cut off the part of the string before that point. Otherwise, just return the address , and do this for all addresses  in .If you want to get more specific, you could look into using regular expressions instead of string slicing.
