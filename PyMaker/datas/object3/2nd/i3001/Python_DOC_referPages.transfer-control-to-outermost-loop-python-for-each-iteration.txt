Consider the code the expected output is  for each iterationand actual is 
You cannot achieve your desired output with simple nested  loops like that.Incidentally, the  statement says to perform the next iteration of the loop that contains it, skipping any statements that are below it in the block. But your  is at the end of the block, so it has no effect. But even if there was a statement similar to  that passed control back to the outermost  loop it still wouldn't do what you want because the  loop will simply start counting up from 4 again.However, we can achieve your goal by creating an iterator using the built-in  function. We can then use  to get each item from that iterator when we want them.outputIf we change the 1st statement to the output becomes
