I'm trying to append a parameter  at the end of my question url as a signal to show different views. I'm using Django 1.8 and following the url pattern from askbot.This is the url.py:I'm trying to show different displays depending on the value of  in my url.This is the view:I couldn't find information on what the +,%,? do, which is probably where the problem is. Could someone explain how the regex work with the base url? When I enter the url ,  should be set to true, but it's not. What am I missing?
Your url looks like this after all substitutions (%): , so:1. Missing part for 2. You have odd grouping around named group  (which is legal, but not recommended)  So for url like  your url pattern should look like this: (you can change \d+ in the last group for \w+ if you want letters to match too).About non-capturing groups  and meaning of + and ? you can read in the documentation of Python re module.
Change your url patterns to something like this,ORNOTE : It's not good idea to use  like  along with some string or char like urls, ()
