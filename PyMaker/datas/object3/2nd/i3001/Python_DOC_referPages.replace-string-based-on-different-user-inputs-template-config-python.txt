I am now 3 days old with Python so excuse the noob.I am writing a program that will take variables within a template for configurations and effectively do Find and Replace. Only difference being I want it to be graphical for users (which will come later) and I want it to be dynamic so variables can change between templates, ie a template will start with:The configuration below will contain @hostname etc where needed.I have the find and replace working well - however as the program loops between each @variable it will copy my template each time it does it. So in this case I would end up with 3 templates stacked in a txt file.As you can see when it writes all lines, whether unaffected or not, it will do this for each iteration in the loop. I need it to only overwrite affected lines whilst preserving all other unaffected lines. The only way I can get them to output is to output each line with  but this is meaning I am getting 3x the output.I hope that is clear.Thank You
An example from IDLE:Once you have all the data you need (host, user, password) you can use the  operation on a string to replace the s inside said string. If there are multiple curly-brace pairs in the string, you use multiple comma-separated arguments in the method as shown above, in the order they should appear.
I'm not quite clear on what you're trying to do, so this perhaps is more appropriate for a comment, but if you can explain why you're not doing the following, that will help give you advice on how to do what you're trying to do.
