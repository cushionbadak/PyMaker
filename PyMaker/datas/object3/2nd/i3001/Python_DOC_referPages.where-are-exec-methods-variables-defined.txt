I was trying to run a little code that convert a string to a list, when I felt on this problem.First of all here is an example code :When I run this, I get a NameError about , at first I thought that it can be a sort of local variables into the exec() method, but then i realised that i could run this code:Since the fact that I'm not trying to call  from outside the function, and the fact that I can run this code alone, I can't figure out where is the problem.I try some searches on the internet, but due to my lack of knowledge in low-level execution, I can't find keywords that define my specific problem.Thanks for your help.
As explained in the  docs you need to give  an appropriate  dictionary. Eg,outputHowever, it is generally advised that you avoid using , unless you really need it. For details, please see Ned Batchelder's Eval really is dangerous. The info there also applies to .If you simply want to create a list from a string, you can probably use . Eg,output
In CPython, local variables in a function are (usually?) stored in a fixed-size array, in an optimization known as "fast locals". As a result, local variables cannot be dynamically added to a function.The exec function will attempt to add the new local variable to the function, but it will not be read by the return statement because that fixed-size array did not change.
