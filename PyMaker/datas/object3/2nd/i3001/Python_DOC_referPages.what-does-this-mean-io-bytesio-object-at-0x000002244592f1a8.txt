I have a url:Let I run the following code in my python interpreterI get the following responseMy question is: what does this mean? Where is 0x000002244592F1A8? What does 0x000002244592F1A8 refer to?
When python needs to print out an object, and the object doesn't otherwise have a built-in method that tells the interpreter how to print it out (for example,  and python's built-in  and  types do have this sort of instruction), python uses this format:where  is literally a pointer to the object's location in memory. That's what you see here: when you do  in your interpreter, you create an  object. A different method tends to get called when, on the interpreter, you dorather than justand the  class certainly has methods you can use for more useful output, if you look at its documentation. Try assigning it to a variable instead of printing it:
What does 0x000002244592F1A8 refer to?It refers to the identity of the object. The number is an implementation detail (in CPython it happens to be the address of the object in memory, the same number returned by the  builtin), but what you can count on is that the number will be different for every  object currently extant in the process.That kind of information is included in the  of many objects because it can come useful when debugging, allowing one to distinguish different objects that might have identical content.
My understanding is that  here is the formatted  of the object in memory. I say "formatted", because, if you do  on the same object, the representation will be a little different (it will be formatted as an  or a  instead of a pointer address:To convert the  to the format you see, you can do something like this (stolen from this post):This ^^ is not particularly useful, but it just shows you how  lines up with what you are seeing. The reason you are seeing it is just that it is displayed as part of the default  for the  object.
