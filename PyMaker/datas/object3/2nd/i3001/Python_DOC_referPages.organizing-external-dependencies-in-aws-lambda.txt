I am relatively new to python and even newer to Lambda. I have created a lambda function that requires some external dependencies ( and ).My root folder is called , in which I have one single python file . I installed the dependencies via  as per Amazon's instructions e.g.There are now many other files in this root directory and many child directories, which is not a surprise as these dependencies are quite large. For someone else looking at this package it would be difficult to differentiate between files I wrote and external dependencies. For example:Is there any way of shifting all these external dependencies into a sub-folder, e.g.For completeness the imports in  are:Any pointers would be appreciated.
Separating external dependencies from your code is definitely best practice. There are a number of ways you can achieve this in python. By default, python searches for modules in the locations specified here. To specify an additional location (i.e your  dependencies folder), this new location must be added to the python path. You can do this in your  as follows:Then you will be able to import all your dependencies as usual, since the interpreter will check the additional folder during runtime:For more detail, check the answers hereSince your code will be a lambda function, you will always have one handler. But for a more generalised case, or if you start to write multiple files, and need to manage external dependencies in those as well - you can choose to maintain a  file, which sets the dependency path and all imports like so:Then in your files, you can call them with:
