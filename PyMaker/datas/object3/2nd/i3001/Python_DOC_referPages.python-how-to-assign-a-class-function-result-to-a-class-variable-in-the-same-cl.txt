I am a beginner to python and want to understand the python class modules and class variables.I just want to assign a class function's return value to the class variable.I tried in different ways, are these valid in python?Sample code:Errors:
There are a number of issues with your class usage here. Error 1 occurs because in your class definition you've stated that class_member() takes in 'self', which is a reference to the current instance of the class, which you have not created. Error 2 occurred because 'self' has been passed into class_member() as if it was a variable. Error 3 is most likely caused by the class definition not being in the file that requires it.Be sure to check out the Python docs first next time. https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html 
Another way to achieve this is to make dict_1 property of the Example class and then return it in the class_member function.I would recommend to go through this link and read it in detail.
