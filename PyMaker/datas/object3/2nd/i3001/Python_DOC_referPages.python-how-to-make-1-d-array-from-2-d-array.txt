I have . What I want is a function which takes an index and returns the elements in 1D array.I need a fast way to do this.
you can use  and :as suggested in the comments, you may apply the same concept with a function definition:Lambda functions are pretty useful, and let you define operation in a really clear way.In our example, our lambda accept a variable , which represent the index we want of each  in Then you have list comprehension, similarly to lambda function, they are a really powerful tool and a must in pythonIn this situation you should prefear the function definiton, as suggested by PEP-8.
The following list comprehension will work:
You can use :If you want to define new functions for retrieving a specific index, you can do so via :
Here are my two cents using slicing (I have to use additional  for this because your original data was a ):
How about a generator?We could use  to pack them, then create a empty list to store the generated data:The benefits of this is we do not need to produce all data at once.
