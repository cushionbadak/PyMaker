I have been having a path error: No file or directory found for hours. After hours of debugging, I realised that python2 added an invisible  at the end of each line.The input: (trainval.txt)The code I used to debug the errorPython2 output:Python3 output:As annoying as it was, it was that small  who caused the path error. I could not see it in my console until I write the script above. My question is: Why is this  even there? I did not create it. Something somewhere added it there. It would be helpful if someone could tell me what is the use of this small '' , why did it appear in python2 and not in python3 and how to avoid getting bugs due to it. 
there's probably a subtle difference of processing between Windows text file in python 2 & 3 versions.The issue here is that your file has a Windows text format, and contains one or several carriage return chars before the linefeed. A quick & generic fix would be to change:by just:Without arguments  is very smart:it splits according to any kind of whitespace (linefeed, space, carriage return, tab)it removes empty fields (no need for  after all)So use that cross-platform/python version agnostic form unless you need really specific split operation, and your problems will be history.As an aside, don't do  but just , it will read & yield the lines one by one, handy when the file is big so you don't consume too much memory.
