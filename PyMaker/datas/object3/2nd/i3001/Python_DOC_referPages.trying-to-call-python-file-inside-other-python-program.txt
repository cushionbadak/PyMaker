How to call one python file from another python fileExample : I have a file in Now I am working on  and want to call  from . How can I achieve that?Also is it mandatory both should be on same location to call other either programs?

If they're not in the same place, then you need to account for the directory structure, (e.g.  if  is in a file called ).It's possible for two files to not be in the same place, but then the files need to be on the pythonpath. This is a bit complicated for a newbie and I wouldn't recommend going too deep into it until you really understand the language better; all you need to know is that anything you install with , and all of python's built-in modules and libraries, are in a certain folder on the operating system. You can put  in that folder, too, and it will work.
I assume you object to importing the code from a1 into a2 so you'll need the subprocess module:The argument should be the path to a1.py, which can be relative or absolute.I suggest you take a look at the module page https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#module-subprocessAlthough, most of the time importing a1 into a2 will be the better solution.
If both files are in the same directory as shown below:Then you only need to import one into the other:test1.py:test2.py:Results:
