I wanna know how do I create an iteration which would iter several or more than one parameters with different rangesFor example I wanna instantiate several object with iterations that all have different rangesLike there is a triangle function which takes three parameters, how do I use iterations to give one parameter one value from a range e.g. 50 to 100 and another parameter a different one altogetherI know how to instantiate it over one parameter by:But what do I do to instantiate it if it takes more than one parameter
Looks like you will want to use nested for loops.  For example for your three parameter function:
You can try iterating over a Cartesian .GivenCodeDetailsIf you are unfamiliar with list comprehensions, the latter is equivalent to the following code:Per your comment,  pre-sorts arguments, so you interchange them:If your ranges are the same, you can simplify the input with the  parameter, e.g. .
You can't. You need three iterations.See  definition here
