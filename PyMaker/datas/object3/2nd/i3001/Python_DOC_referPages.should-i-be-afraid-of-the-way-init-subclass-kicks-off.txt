I'm using init_subclass in a project, and I sort of balked when I ran into the built in method kicking off when the code first runs in the interpreter -- without being directly referenced via instantiation of the containing class or the sub-classes it enumerates.Can someone tell me what's going on, and point me to any examples of its safe use?Edit --------------------------------------------------Based on the explanations received, original code was retooled into something useful.
Here's a minimal example:Running this:Why is that? According to Python's data model docs:Whenever a class inherits from another class, init_subclass is called on that class. inherits from , so  gets called.Specifically,  invokes init_subclass in the  implementation.The rationale is detailed in PEP 487.
