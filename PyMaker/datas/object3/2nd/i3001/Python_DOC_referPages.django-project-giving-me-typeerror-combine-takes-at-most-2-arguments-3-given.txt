I have deployed my django project on digitalocean and it was working fine so far, until I made some changes to the way I was storing datetimes in my databases. I made them time-aware (before they were naive). Eventually, I ironed out all the bugs and my times were aware, and the project was working fine until I pulled the changes to my production server and when I tried to deploy it, it gave me the following error:TypeError: combine() takes at most 2 arguments (3 given)on this line:For context, this error happens every time I attempt to schedule a lesson with another user. I receive the timings and timezone information from the user, and I am trying to store the starting and ending times of that lesson in my database. Here's the code:I've checked the documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html), the method takes 3 arguments, I'm especially confused because the exact action that's causing the bug in my project (scheduling lessons) works perfectly fine locally. I would guess this has something to do with my local database being sqlite and my production database being postgres, I'm not sure though.Also, yes I have changed USE_TZ to True
Python 2 and Python 3 has different signature for the  methodPython 2 method signature,Python 3 method signature
