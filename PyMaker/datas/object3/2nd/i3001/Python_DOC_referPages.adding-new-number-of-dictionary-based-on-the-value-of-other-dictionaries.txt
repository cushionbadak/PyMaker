My main objective is as below:(1) Calculate the number of "id", "id_value". Then find what which value is not present in "id_value" based on "id". Example, "id" = [1,2,3,4],  "id_value"=[1,2]. Then add a new dictionary of "id_value" into the main({"id_value":3},{"id_value":4}).I tried to use set to find the difference between value within these two variables but with error. Could anyone please assist me. My code is as below:I am getting error for "lambda cannot contain assignment"... can I know why?* I solved this Thank you for commenting 
Not sure if that will produce what you intend, but this is the lambda free version of your current code:
