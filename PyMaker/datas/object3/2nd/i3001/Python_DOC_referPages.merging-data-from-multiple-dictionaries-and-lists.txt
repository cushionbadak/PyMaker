Lets say I have a dictionary of state abbreviations and the corresponding names:I also have a list of dictionaries that has the state abbreviations, as well as other data, including county and county fips codes:As you can see above, we have more than one entry for . What I want to do here is using dictionary 1: stateDict, choose all the entries in list  for 'AL' and then place the state name in a new list with all of the county fips codes that are shown in stateList for 'AL' (or any other state that is in stateDict). So the outcome would look like this:Or perhaps like this (I'm not sure what would be appropriate exactly):Using previously mentioned methods, I would use something like this, but because I am pulling the data for stateInfo, I am somewhat confused. Suggestions?
I used  from the  module. Basically you provide a callable which will set the initial value to that if it's not found:This assumes that every  value in  will have a corresponding key in . If they don't, you'll need to do some error checking.Also, I changed the name of your variables to reflect the actual data.
You can use the setdefault method for dictionaries to simplify the task
Invert your state dictionary firstThen for each state find the 'fips' and add to a dictionary:Finally print it:
