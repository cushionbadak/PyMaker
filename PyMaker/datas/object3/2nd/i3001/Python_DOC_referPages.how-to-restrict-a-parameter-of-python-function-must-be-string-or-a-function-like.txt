For example, the following, the first parameter should be restricted to a string, and the second parameter should be a function. However, this is wrong syntax for both. Anyone can help suggest the correct syntax to impose the type restriction?It gives errorand
You can use the typing module.assuming your function  takes a  a returns a , and that  returns a . Note the code has also been modified to follow python's naming convention and uses  over older style format strings.Also note that these  are just that, hints. They are not checked statically or at runtime. Although, certain IDE's will help you ensure they are correct.
You should use  instead of  and  instead of lambda:That is, unless you have a specific class called  and you are expecting an argument of its type.When you write  you are defining a new lambda, not specifying a type for a function, whence the error.I believe it is also important to point out that types in python are only a useful notation but it does not raise any error by itself, for example I could still call  and don't get any error just by the type hinting (of course I would get an error trying to pass an argument to an int afterwards).
