How does the function  compute the hash value of a tuple? For example:Gives an output
You can check the implementation of this function in C if you're familiar with C programming and some advanced math. It seems that algorithm XORs hashes of each element in tuple and adds some magic.Note that this is CPython's current implementation. Other Python interpreters and even other versions of CPython may have different hash functions. This particular implementation, called SipHash, has been in use since 2013. See PEP 456 -- Secure and interchangeable hash algorithm for a detailed explanation.SipHash is a cryptographic pseudo random function with a 128-bit seed and 64-bit output.... SipHash is a family of pseudorandom functions (a.k.a. keyed hash functions) optimized for speed on short messages. Target applications include network traffic authentication and defense against hash-flooding DoS attacks.
The standard library documentation has a little bit of detail.  Hash functions generally have the properties:If two values are equal, they always have the same hash value; andIf two values are different, they probably have different hash values.There are simpler and harder ways to write these, and faster and slower ways, but the important thing is how rarely different values produce the same hash value.  A good one is tricky, but you usually don't care deeply about the implementation.(In Python you almost never need to directly call ; I wouldn't be surprised if it's part of the dictionary implementation for custom types used as keys.  The  documentation says quite a bit more.)
