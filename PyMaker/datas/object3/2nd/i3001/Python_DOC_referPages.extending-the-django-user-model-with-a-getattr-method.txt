In a Django project, I have a module which extends Django's user model, similar to the following:I've noticed that this works. However, if I try to define a  method, like so:I get the following error upon importing the module:Is it not possible to extend the  model with a  method in this way?
In python 3.7, if you define a module level function called  it will be a module level attribute getter function, similar to a class getattr. Seems like you did that unintentionally. The module level  has a different call signature from the class method.SpecificationThe  function at the module level should  accept one argument which is the name of an attribute and return the  computed value or raise an AttributeError:Try renaming the function to something else, to avoid unintentionally shadowing a reserved function name.This is mentioned in PEP 562:This PEP may break code that uses module level (global) names   and . (But the language reference explicitly reserves all undocumented dunder names, and allows "breakage without  warning")And here's what the language reference says:Any use of  names, in any context, that does not follow  explicitly documented use, is subject to breakage without warning.So you should also rename your custom  function to avoid potential future breakage.
