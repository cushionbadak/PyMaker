In many functions in views.py the is a parameter called vars() that is passed to the render.I want to know what is the use of this parameter and is it better than passing local variable individually to render?
  accepts a 3rd argument to be  vars():   Return the  attribute for a module, class, instance, or any other object with a  attribute.So we can make use of  as an argument in .
