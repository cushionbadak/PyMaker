I have a multi-dtype series  like when I run I get Why is this happening? Shouldn't it return  for the first three in this series?
Pandas string methods follow Python methods closely:Any type which yields an error will give . As per the Python docs,  is only applicable for strings:str.isnumeric() Return true if all characters in the string are numeric characters, and there is at least one character, false  otherwise.As per the Pandas docs,  is equivalent to :Series.str.isnumeric() Check whether all characters in each string in the Series/Index are numeric. Equivalent to .Your series has "object" dtype, this is an all-encompassing type which holds pointers to arbitrary Python objects. These may be a mixture of strings, integers, etc. Therefore, you should expect  values where strings are not found.To accommodate numeric types, you need to convert to strings explicitly, e.g. given a series :
Using the string accessor is converting your numbers to , it is happening before you even try to use :So the 's remain when you use .  Use  first instead:
