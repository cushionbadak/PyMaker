I'm trying to retrieve and print a list of secrets from an azure keyvault use the python sdk.The following returns an paged.SecretItemPaged object:e.g:I'm not sure how to handle this object. The documentation isn't giving me any hints, unless I've just missed something. 
SecretItemPaged page is an iterator object, meaning you can use it inside a for loop directly if you want:or change it to a listNo magic here, it's just the iterator protocol of Python. You can also use , and catch the  exception, etc.Looking at the  method, the doc tells you what kind if object it conveys:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azure-keyvault/azure.keyvault.key_vault_client.keyvaultclient?view=azure-python#get-secretsAnd  is documented here:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azure-keyvault/azure.keyvault.models.secret_item_py3.secretitem?view=azure-pythonNote that all SDK object have a  method if you prefer to work on it as a dict, and not an object with attributes.Do NOT use the  attribute. The iterator protocol implementation hides for you fetching multiple pages from Azure if you have more secrets than the default JSON can handle it. When doing , you might fetch 10 pages and do 10 calls to Azure, you don't know, you don't care :).  is the state of the last page. It is NOT the entire list of elements.(I work at MS in this SDK team)
