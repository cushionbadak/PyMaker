I've created a list which has 5 items, I've then created a  which is a path to a webpage using text and the item value from the listI want to be able to loop through the items in  and create however many lists need creating based on the number of items in So ultimately 10 new lists in this example would be created:This works to loop through each webpage and print values but I can't refer to the lists outside (which are being overwritten each time anyway)but I can't then refer to these new list outside the for loop by adding this after (even though they are being overwritten each time anyway)so this is my attempt to create new lists but to no avail:So ultimately I can reference the list later
If I'm not wrong, you want to create new lists from buyers and prices? This might work -Now you can access  and  outside the for loop. Let me know if I wrongly understood your question
Supposing I understood what the problem is, I Would suggest having a list of lists or a dictionary with values of type list, because not knowing the number of lists to expect, iterable objects are what you're looking forSolution using a list :Solution using dictionaries :For reading data from the dictionary, it is important to know that values in dictionaries are not indexed so we are going to need to read each value from its key like so :
