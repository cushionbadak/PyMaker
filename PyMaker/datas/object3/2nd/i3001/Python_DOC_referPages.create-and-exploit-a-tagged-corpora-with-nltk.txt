Natural Text
I'm trying to create a tagged corpora in Malagasy (my mother tongue). I followed the instructions in the document Python text Processing and natural language processing and the page  https://www.nltk.org/book/ch05.html .I have managed to create my own Part-of-Speech Tagset based on the Universal Part-of-Speech Tagset and a little tagged corpora.This is my code :I have this result:So i can see that it's work, but i read in the document above that i have to train my tagger. So i ask if someone can suggest me how i can do that, cause i read i need to pickle a trained tagger and to train and combin Ngram taggers but i don't understand what pickle means or do. And i don't know if what i'm doing now is the correct path to create and exploit a tagged corpora with NLTK.Thank you
i need to pickle a trained tagger and to train and combin Ngram taggers but i don't understand what pickle means or doAs per this part of your question, Pickle is a library in Python that allows to dump and load binary data on/from your hard drive, related to any python object of your choosing.Info here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.htmlWhat you were suggested to do is however to take a pre-trained tagger, which would likely belong to another language, and add the ngrams extracted from the tagged corpora in Malagasy that you have built. If you have a sufficiently large corpus of tagged documents in your own language, however, it might be more useful for yourself and for the NLP community to develop a tagger specific for Malagasy. After a quick research I could not find any on the internet, and it would thus be useful to prepare one.
