Natural Text
I am trying to unit test a class that I have written in Python called NeuralNetworkModel(). It is a class that takes in a file and trains a ANN model and saves it as a pickle file. Currently I have a very basic unit test that the class is reading in a file as a data frame correctly. My code is below.Error I get when I run this file is I am very new to unit testing and I struggle with it, but I can't work out why my test isn't passing?
Make sure you're naming things correctly.  doesn't recognize , so it never gets called. Rename it to  and it should work.Docs for reference.
