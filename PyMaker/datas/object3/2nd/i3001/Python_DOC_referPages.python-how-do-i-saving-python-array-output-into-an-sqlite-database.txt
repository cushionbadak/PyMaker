Hi i am doing a rasbery project. I am new to this and new with python. I have a python code taking  luminaire lux levels reading from a light sensor. I Want to take these lux levels readings and save them into an Sqlite database table. the code i have for reading the lux is below i want to save the Luminance values as they come in into an Sqlite database table
I recommend following this tutorial on sqllite3 in Python:https://www.pythoncentral.io/introduction-to-sqlite-in-python/Once you've read through that and tried it, you can start working on your specific problem again:First you'll want to initialise a database by creating the tables you're going to be filling with data. This can be done by creating a 'schema' and having the code in the schema be executed when you want to initialise the database. An example schema may look like this:(Obviously your tables will not be the same as these as they will be for holding the light sensor data. You may even only need one table, depending on what exactly you want to store)NOTE: You may  want to look into something like Python's click module (which allows you to create command line commands associated with python code) so that the database can be initialised independantly from the program running. Alternatively, you can just have some code in your program that checks whether it already exists and only initialises it if it doesn'tThe final step is then just to use sqllite code to store the data in the tables (See: the previously linked tutorial)
