Let's consider given a list  and given number is then the output should be  because in output list there is no element greater than  and it is the only list with highest number of consecutive number. Please tell me the code in *NOTE: Please tell the logic without using import module.Here is my codeI am trying to get the explained output for  in my code. Please any one help or suggest any logic.Thanks in advance
Just keep a "max list" and update it as you go.I'm pretty sure that will work
Time for  :How?Make an iterator that returns elements from the iterable as long as the predicate is true.
For grouping elements you can use  from  (docs here). This code snippet will find sublist with maximal consecutive elements that each element <= number (8 in this case): This will print:EDIT (to explain):1.step is to find groups where elements are <= of selected number:Prints:2.step is filter out  groups:Prints:3.step is find sublist with maximum number of elements ( function with  argument, as key we use  function):Prints:
You can use  for finding all sub lists that are less than 8 and then use  to find the biggest listIf you dont want to import  methods  and , you can define it yourself
