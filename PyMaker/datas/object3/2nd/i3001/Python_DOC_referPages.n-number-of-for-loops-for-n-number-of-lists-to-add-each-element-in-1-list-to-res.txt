kk is the number of lists present. l1 ,l2,l3 are the lists. In the following code, I have used 3 for loops to add elements in the 3 lists. Value of variable k could vary and so the lists. I want to know how do I use recursion to achieve this.
Sounds like you're looking for something along the lines of which results in Here  generates the Cartesian product of the input iterables.  If you had some unknown number of iterables in a list you could doto unpack them into argumentsA recursive solution would looks something like this.  Warning: it is going to be worse in every way compared to the  solution.
