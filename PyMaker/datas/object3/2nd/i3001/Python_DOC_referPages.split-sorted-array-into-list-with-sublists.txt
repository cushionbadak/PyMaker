I have a sorted array of float32 Values, I want to split this array into a list of lists containing only the same Values like this:My current approach is this FunctionMy Question now is, is there a more Pythonic way to do this? maybe even with numpy? And is this the most performant way?Thanks a lot!
Approach #1With  as the array, we can use  -Sample run -Approach #2Another more performant way would be to get the splitting indices and then slicing the array and  -Approach #3If you have to get a list of sublists as output, we could re-create with list duplication -BenchmarkingTimings for vectorized approaches on  elements with  unique elements -
You can use  and OutputsTimings for a 6,000,000 sized array
The function  has this exact behavior.
You may join the lists, if you like:
