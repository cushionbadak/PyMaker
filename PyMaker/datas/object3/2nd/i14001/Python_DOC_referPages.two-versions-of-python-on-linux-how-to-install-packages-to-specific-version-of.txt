I am using Linux CentOs server. In my server two version of python were installed - 2.6 and 2.7. Both path are entered in to path variable.I am trying to install pip using following command:But it installed to python2.6 (). So If I am trying to install package to python using pip it goes to python2.6. For example
If you want to have control over what Python version you're using, I'd suggest considering virtual environments.You can then create a stand-alone virtual environment for each project and use the Python version you need.This will create a virtual environment for your project with Python 2.7, install  and deactivate the virtual environment.As for your second question, I recommend using  and ...First, install all the packages you need:Then save the list of packages with their current versions:This will create a  file that you can distribute with the project. When somebody wants to install all the dependencies, they will need to do:For Python 3, virtual environments are supported by default - venv.
Say you have two python versions installed 2.7 and 3.5, Set the Environment variablesset python2 as the env variable for python2.7set python as evn variable for python3.5 Install packages for python2:python2 -m pip install < package-name >Install packages for python3:python -m pip install < package-name >orpip install < package-name>
Try , choose your pipthen simply do  your module
