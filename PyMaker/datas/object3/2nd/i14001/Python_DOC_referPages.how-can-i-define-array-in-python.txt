In python , you can create  , which may be similar to the  in TCL.Examples of lists -Using the  loop above, we iterated over each element of the list and printed it.More details on list - https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists
Arrays can be set up like this, they are called lists in Python.
