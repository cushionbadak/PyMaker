This question already has an answer here:Why accessing to class variable from within the class needs “self.” in Python? [duplicate]                    4 answers                I have two questions regarding this piece of code:Why do I have to use  when I create functions and instance variables? What is the purpose of using it?When we create the  object, we assign it a life of , as . However, can class names take variables inside? Or is it the  function which makes it possible? (I'd expect something like, , when we declare the class).
In python, for class methods, the first argument (which normally people name ) refers to the instance (object) of the class which was used to call the function, It does not have to be named self, but thats the convention.Example -When you do something like -You are setting the  variable inside  (which denotes your current object) to x.When you do -Python internally calls the  method of Enemy with the values for x as 5 (and self as the current object).  is called after object has been created by  method, which is a class method, An SO question to help understand how  and  work - Python's use of __new__ and __init__?
