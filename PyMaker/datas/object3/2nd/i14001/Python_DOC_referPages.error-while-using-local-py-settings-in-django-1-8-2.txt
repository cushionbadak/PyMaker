I wanted to implement settings as explained by "Two Scoops of Django". I referred their book and also their github sample code.I am getting the following error:The problem is solved when I add the following code to  in settings folder:Kindly explain what is happening as there is no code in  in all the examples on internet.I am using Django 1.8.2 on Python 3.4
When you include  in the folder, that folder is marked as a package called , from which you can import modules like your  moduleThis is a fairly standard thing in Python, even if not every Django programmer uses  as a packageFrom Python docs:The  files are required to make Python treat the  directories as containing packages; this is done to prevent  directories with a common name, such as string, from unintentionally  hiding valid modules that occur later on the module search path. In  the simplest case,  can just be an empty file, but it can  also execute initialization code for the package or set the   variable, described later.Source: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packagesmy question is do I need to write from .local import * in init.py  for the package to work?Check your  file it should load the , e.g.Also check the actual value of  in the local module see if it is empty or not (if e.g. you use some variable interpolation)
