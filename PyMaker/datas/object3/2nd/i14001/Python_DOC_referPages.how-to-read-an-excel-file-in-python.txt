However, you're asking for a Python solution, so here's a Python solution!Pandas is a library that provides a DataFrame data structure very similar to an Excel spreadsheet.  It provides a  function, whose documentation you can find here.  Once you have a DataFrame, you could do something like this:You can get Pandas for Python on Windows, but it's a bit difficult.  The easiest way is a Scientific Python distribution for Windows, like Anaconda.  On Linux, installing  is simple as .
Using xlrd 0.9.3 in Python 3.4.1:It puts all values from row  and  in two separate .It then combines each parallel elements of these lists (simply elements with same index) to a tuple using . Then, these generated tuples are combined to a . Using  and list comprehension,  and  are calculated.Output:To install xlrd: (Windows)Download here: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlrdExtract to any directory, then change 's current directory (  ) to the directory where you extracted, then type in cmd Take note that you will extract  two times, first to remove , second to remove .The extracted directory (where you will change your cmd's current directory) will look like this:
