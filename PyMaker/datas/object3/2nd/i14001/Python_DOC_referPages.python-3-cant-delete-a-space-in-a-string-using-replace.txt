I am running into a weird problem.  I load all usernames from the database, then I replace any space found in the username with nothing, so it gets remove.  but it's not working, the space stays there! Here is my codeas an exemple, the first print returns:"MavNandi 7"and the second return the same"MavNandi 7"The space stays there.  I am baffled.  Any clue?
You almost certainly have a string with a space variant in it, not the bog-standard U+0020 SPACE but more likely U+00A0 NO-BREAK SPACE. The two characters look exactly the same when printed:There may be others; the Unicode stardard defines 17 space separators for example, many of these look like a regular space (with varying width).As you can see the interpreter, when echoing the value uses the  escape sequence to differentiate the two. You can produce the same output by using the  function when printing:There is also a  function, this works just like  but replaces any character outside the ASCII range with an escape sequence, making it perhaps easier to see combining characters and distinguish between Unicode glyphs that would otherwise look alike.You could use a regular expression to replace all whitespace characters, including no-break spaces, tabs, newlines and anything else the Unicode standard designates as whitespace:The  character class matches any such whitespace character, the  matches 1 or more such character when replacing; the second argument replaces all such matches with the empty string.Demo:
