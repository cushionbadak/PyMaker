I'm writing a python (2.7.6) script that pulls JSON data from a webserver and publishes it elsewhere. I only want to publish those JSON values that are numeric, e.g. no sub-objects or strings. It's very likely that the numeric values will exceed the size of  (in the C sense of size). My current code looks like this:My concern is the type check. If Python decides that  is no longer appropriate and uses  instead it means some metrics will not get published. And what to do if  gets exceeded?What I really want is a way to check that  is numeric.There is  but that doesn't work for negatives or floats.
You should use  instead of Example -If you want to consider float as well, then -
