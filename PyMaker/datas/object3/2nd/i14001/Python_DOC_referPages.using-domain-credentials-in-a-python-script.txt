I'm following the implementation of a python script example shown here.Basically, this does what I need it to do except that we now want to run the script with the domain credentials without prompting the user for a username and password.  Ideally, we'd want to run this during maintenance windows, and we would rather have a domain account's credentials handle the authentication instead of baking it in to the script for anyone to stumble upon.  Since I'm not really well versed with python, I'm not entirely sure what the capabilities/best practices are in these scenarios.  
If all you're looking for is a way to pass in arguments without prompting the user, you could use the library argparse to pass in command line arguments, see https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.htmlAnother source of information would be an .ini file, which is handled by the module ConfigParser or any other file-based source like XML, shelve, json.All these issues have the weakness, that you have to apply access protection for the file containing the credentials.
