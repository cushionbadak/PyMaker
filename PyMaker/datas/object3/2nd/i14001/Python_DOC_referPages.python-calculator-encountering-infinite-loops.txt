I have been struggling with this for a few hours now and I can't quite wrap my mind around this... so when I run this it immediately goes into a infinite loop of "Must be a number value" from the exception part of the while block. The only thing I can think of  is It's going into an infinite loop because its not reading the main(), or my logic is just completely wrong. Why would it be reading one string from within a structure where nothing seems to exist.. the question " How much is the bill?" never even appears(This should be the 1st thing the user sees).. it just goes right into the loop. I know it must be something really silly that I am missing, but I can't seem to locate why the code is behaving how it is.
there is a missing indention from line 44 until line 68if you're using python 3 you should replace raw_input() with input() (https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html)working Python 3 version:
It seems like you have an indentation problem, fromm the line:until the line:the code need to be with more indentation so it will be part of your main.In addtion, it is better to catch the exception and print its message so you can easily find what cause your exception and fix it,please change this:To this:
