Is there a way to temporary stop catching some exception? The point is that when you have more exceptions which are being catched in a code and you want to comment them because you want to see all the things printed when exception is raised (print exception is not sufficient), you have to comment try, except, code in except, finally, code in finally and change an indent of the code where the exception can be raised. This commenting is very time-consuming when you have to do it many times.
You can just add  keyword inside the except block and it will raise the caught exception back. Found it useful during testing.Example -
