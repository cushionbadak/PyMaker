I'm new to Python. If I have a 'data' variable like this:and I have a list like this:How can I return the sum of  that contain both of those values and append it to the list.The final element in  is the sum of those  that contain  and 

Here is my approach: use the Counter from collections to keep track of the sum. We use the first two items in each sublist as a key, and the last item as the value:Since  behaves like a dictionary, and a dictionary does not take a list as key, we have to turn the list of the first two elements into a tuple (hence ).
