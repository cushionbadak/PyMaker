I'm writing a piece of code that returns profiling information and it would be helpful to be able to dynamically return the implementation of Python in use.Is there a Pythonic way to determine which implementation (e.g. Jython, PyPy) of Python my code is executing on at runtime?  I know that I am able to get version information from :but I'm not sure where to look in the  module to get the implementation that the code is running.
You can use  from the  module in Python 3 or Python 2.  This returns a string that identifies the Python implementation.e.g. and iterating through some responses on the command line: Note as of this answer's date, the possible responses are 'CPython', 'IronPython', 'Jython', 'PyPy', meaning that it's possible that your implementation will not be returned by this  function if it does not identity to the  module as one of these types. is calling  under the hood and attempting to match the response to a regex pattern -- if there's no conditional match, there's no matching string response.
