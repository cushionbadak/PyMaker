Natural Text
 is a Python list and is a part of a JSON object. It can be read as:However when I try and execute this I get an error:The Database however has all the columns specified. I guess it has to do with the format. Not sure though.The query when printed in the command prompt can be seen as:I notice the   in the  line which is the probably issue?
This is indeed the issue. You're using the  version of the list. Instead, use str.join function to make it into a usable string, combined with a list comprehension to quote the strings:This, however, becomes very hard to maintain and read if there's more complex queries with more parameters. The above solution's format statement is already hard to understand, this will get only worse.It is also vulnerable to SQL injection, as roippi has pointed out. They are also right with their suggestion to use parametrized queries.
