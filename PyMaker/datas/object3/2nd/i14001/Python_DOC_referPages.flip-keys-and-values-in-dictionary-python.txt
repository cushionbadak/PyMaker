I have a dictionary called z that looks like this{0: [0.28209479177387814, 0.19947114020071635, 0.10377687435514868, 0.07338133158686996], -1: [0.28209479177387814, 0.19947114020071635, 0.10377687435514868, 0.07338133158686996]}.I want to flip the values and keys to have {0.28209479177387814:0, 0.19947114020071635:0, 0.10377687435514868:0, 0.07338133158686996:0, 0.28209479177387814:-1, 0.19947114020071635:-1, 0.10377687435514868:-1, 0.07338133158686996:-1}The piece of code that seems to work is :but it only works for one of the keys in z and returns this:{0.28209479177387814: -1, 0.07338133158686996: -1, 0.10377687435514868: -1, 0.19947114020071635: -1}what am I doing wrong?
You can't have duplicate keys in a dictionary, but you can pair them together using tuples in a meaningful way.That will produce:Now if you really wanted something interesting, you could sort that and group it together.That creates something like:You could toss those into a dict by doing:Which should finally give:
As you have already seen in the comments on your question, Python dictionaries cannot have duplicate keys, since there would be uncertainty as to a correct single value given a keyThis could be fixed by having parallel structure to the first, so instead of , it would be . The code to generate it would be:See Adam Smith's answer for more details. 
Easiest way to flip key value in a dict is using dict comprehension, which looks like this: . Full example:And your output is this:Cheers!
