I was taking a look at the hierarchy of the built-in python exceptions, and I noticed that  and  have different base classes:Or in code:When I go to the specific description of each exception, I can read following:https://docs.python.org/2/library/exceptions.html#exceptions.GeneratorExitexception GeneratorExitRaised when a generator‘s close() method is called. It directly inherits from BaseException instead of StandardError since it is technically not an error.https://docs.python.org/2/library/exceptions.html#exceptions.StopIterationexception StopIterationRaised by an iterator‘s next() method to signal that there are no further values. This is derived from Exception rather than StandardError, since this is not considered an error in its normal application.Which is not very clear to me. Both are similar in the sense that they do not notify errors, but an "event" to change the flow of the code. So, they are not technically errors, and I understand that they should be separated from the rest of the exceptions... but why is one a subclass of  and the other one a subclass of ?.In general I considered always that  subclasses are errors, and when I write a blind  (for instance calling third party code), I always tried to catch , but maybe that is wrong and I should be catching .
It is quite common to use try: ... except Exception: ... blocks.If GeneratorExit would inherit from Exception you would get the following issue:This example is quite simple but imagine in the try block a more complex operation which, in case of failure, would simply ignore the issue (or print a message) and get to the next iteration.If you would catch the generic Exception, you would end up preventing the user of your generator from breaking the loop without getting a RuntimeError.A better explanation is here.EDIT: answering here as it was too long for a comment.I'd rather say the opposite.  should inherit from  rather than . When you catch  you basically want to catch almost everything.  as PEP-352 states, is for those exceptions which need to be "excepted" in order to allow the user to escape from code that would otherwise catch them. In this way you can, for example, still CTRL-C running code.  falls into that category in order to break loops. An interesting conversation about it on comp.lang.python.
