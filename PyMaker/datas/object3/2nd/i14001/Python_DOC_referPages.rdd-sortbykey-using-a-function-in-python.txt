Lets say my key is not a simple data type but a class, and I need to sort the keys by using a comparison function. In Scala, I can do this by using, . How can I achieve the same functionality in Python? For example, what would be the equivalent code in Python?
In Python, you can create class methods for comparison by using the rich comparison methods:, , , , , You can make these methods do anything you need to compare your class instances, even weird things, but it's a good idea to make them consistent if you want sorting to behave sensibly. :)Here's a fairly simple example of their use in this answer I wrote a month or so ago: Sort a list to form the largest possible number.Here's another cute example from Searching for a partial match in a list of tuples, which creates a wildcard object.
You can pass  argument:Now, lets say you want to sort Points by y coordinate:and result is:
In Python you may use  argument of  method. There was also  function, but this solution wasn't optimal and is now deprecated (or even removed, depending of Python version). Take a look here.
