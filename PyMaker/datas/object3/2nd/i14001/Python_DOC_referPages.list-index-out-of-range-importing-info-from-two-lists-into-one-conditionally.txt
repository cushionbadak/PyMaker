This might seem a bit generic unfortunately, but I'm just so lost...The code seems to work, but it keeps giving me an indexing error.
I think you are unclear about some of these points : function starts from a default value 0 and stop when the value is equal to stop i.e. the  value is not included. For further information, see the docs.Lists in Python are indexed from 0 (like arrays in C).  So if you want to traverse a string with length , you need to define your range as .If you want a more compact code, a few changes might be:
You are indexing from  through to , but the last index in  is , because indexing starts at 0.Remove the  from your range:Rather than use  you can use  to generate indices and access the value; use  to pair up the two lists:
