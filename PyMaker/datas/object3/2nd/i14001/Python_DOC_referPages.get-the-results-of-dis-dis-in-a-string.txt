I am trying to compare the bytecode of two things with difflib, but dis.dis() always prints it to the console. Any way to get the output in a string?
Uses StringIO to redefine std out to a string-like object (python 2.7 solution)
If you're using Python 3.4 or later, you can get that string by using the method :You also might want to take a look at , which returns an iterator of named tuples, each corresponding to a bytecode instruction.
