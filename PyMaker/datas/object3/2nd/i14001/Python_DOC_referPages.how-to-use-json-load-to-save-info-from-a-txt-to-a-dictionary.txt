I am trying to use json.load on a dictionary; however, I am getting this error: Traceback (most recent call last):      File "C:\Python34\Main.py", line 91, in          main()    File "C:\Python34\Main.py", line 87, in main       match_histories = json.load("match_histories.txt")  File "C:\Python34\lib\json__init__.py", line 265, in load     return loads(fp.read(),  AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'read'  Here is my code (I imported json first):Hmm, now I am getting an error with the dump:Traceback (most recent call last):   File "C:\Python34\Main.py", line 91, in      main()  File "C:\Python34\Main.py", line 82, in main   match_histories=get_match_histories(challenger_Ids)  File "C:\Python34\Main.py", line 50, in get_match_histories  json.dump(match_histories, "match_histories.txt")  File "C:\Python34\lib\json__init__.py", line 179, in dump   fp.write(chunk)  AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'write'  After attempting what has been suggested, I changed my code to but I still get the errorFile "C:\Python34\lib\json__init__.py", line 179, in dump     fp.write(chunk)  AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'write'(sorry, I am new to python and programming)
AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'read'As you can see it tries to call  on the passed object, but you've passed a string object not a file (or any other object that implements ) wants a file object, not a string of its path, so use  to open the file then pass it, or something like code below:If you're opening the file to be written, you should the  mode to  like From the docsjson.load(fp, ...)Deserialize fp (a .read()-supporting file-like object containing a  JSON document) to a Python object using this conversion table.And you have same issue with AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'write'json.dump(obj, ...) Serialize obj as a JSON formatted stream to fp (a  .write()-supporting file-like object) using this conversion table.ExampleRun itJSON
