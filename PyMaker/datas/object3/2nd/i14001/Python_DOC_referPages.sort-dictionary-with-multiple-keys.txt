This question already has an answer here:make dictionary with duplicate keys in python                    6 answers                Using Python 3.4, I am trying to sort a dictionary with two identical entries. When I run,I get a nicely printed result. But when I use my actual data, which look more like: the result just drops any repeated rows. What am I doing wrong?(Edited to add: thanks all for helping. Correct answer understood. In case anyone else has this problem, my dictionary's keys were actually tuples. Multiple tuples began with the same value and this confused me)
