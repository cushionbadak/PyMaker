Overview of program:My program will import a data file that the user chooses by using the file explorer. Then, I unpackage the binary file. I then save the newly unpackaged data as a .csv file, so I can later look at the data in excel. The user currently creates the name of the file by typing in the new file name. I then go on and plot all of the data with the matplotlib library.The Whole Code:My issue: I want to run this code on the raspberry pi (python 2.7) with a touchscreen. I would like to avoid typing as much as possible.Question:The user chooses the file that he would like to read using the code below.This creates a variable that equals something like this: "C:/Users/Andrew/Desktop/Python/LOG1.txt" (note: I realize this is a windows filepath, on the pi it creates a linux filepath)Then later I have the user type in the new file name and save the file to a certain directory.I want to take the "LOG1" part of the filepath out of the variable filename1. So basically I delete the "C:/Users/Andrew/Desktop/Python/" and the ".txt" section of the variable but leave the name of the file. I would then like to take this file name "LOG1" and use it for my completeName variable defined above. I would use the code:This would create a csv file named "LOG1.csv"How do I remove the extraneous parts of the filepath??Thank you!!
Maybe os.path.basename() or os.path.splitext() can solve your problem
You can use  and :
If you cam ise python 3.4 you can use pathlib to work with paths. For example:
Something like this will do it quickly:
