I have 3 lists: x, y, and z. All are the same size, but I need to create new lists of x, y, and z, depending on the value at each index of z, as shown below:Does anyone know if there is a tidier, perhaps even more efficient, way of performing the above computation?
Probably the most straightforward way:We use the  function twice to restore the original structure of the data. creates a new iterator object, which yields triples.  filters triples ( is the ). yields exactly 3 tuples and ,  and  receive them.
Not more efficient but a bit tidier:For a different approach using itemgetter:
It's a bit complicated, since you have several lists and need to skip values in all of the lists based on a value from one of them. Here's the best way, I think, using  and list comprehensions:
Use list comprehensions (used as filters) in conjunction with :Or with  is even more beautiful:
