I'm doing a computing course and i have to do python.I'm stuck on a certain question. It says this" Write a program that asks the user to type in 10 items for a list.The user is then asked for the index of the item that needs to be deletedThe item is then deleted from the list.The list needs to be printed before and after the deletion takes place."This is the only code I have so far
You almost have it right. You should have a read of the docs You just need to put  inside the brackets.
There are following steps:Get input from the User. Use raw_input() to get values. Note use input() for Python 3.xe.g.Get delete index number from the user. Index start from 0. Do type casting to convert string to int e.g.Use pop() to delete item from the list.e.g.Handle exception for boundary.
