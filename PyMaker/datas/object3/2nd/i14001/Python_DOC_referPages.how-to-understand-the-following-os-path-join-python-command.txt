I have a snippet like the following.I understand os.path.join is used to join one or more path components intelligently. So does that mean "myfile-{0}".format(os.environ['JOB_ID']) is also a path component? Why would that be? Many thanks for your time and attention. 
Let's analyze your question:What you already know is:  is a variable name,  is a method that creates a directory path out of two (or more) strings.What you're not completely sure about are the arguments of the method:  being some variable declared before is also clear to you, but the expression  is little confusing to you. is a string and and one can call the method  on strings, the zero in the braces  is replaced by the first argument, and if there were  it would be replaced by a second argument. The return value of  is inserted in place of .Let's say the return value is 1, so this would produce the string . And let's say the value of  is . Then the variable  is assigned the value . Pay attention to the slash .  creates the path to the file taking care of the directory separator.That means   is also a path component.
