I am relatively new to programming especially in BASH and python, as well as this site. Sorry for multiple posts!I am trying to get this line into python. I have tried os.popen.Are there any other ways you guys can think of how to do it. I am limited to python v2.6 and cannot upgrade to a newer version, otherwise I would know how to do it in 3.whatever. Thanks!This is what I have in python but it isn't working. Any one have any idea how to rearrange it so it would be the same as the line in BASH.I know these shouldn't be elif. Honestly i'm stumped and don't know where to go from here.
This should run the bash command from python by piping the output through subprocess.Popen and work for python2.6:The output from my system is:You can also open the file with python and pass the file object to the first process:A pure python solution using  to mimic egrep  finding lines that contain any of the substrings from pre in the file and using  to get the second column i.e the digits:Output:Using any in the above code will lazily evaluate and short circuit on a match, if there is no match it will evaluate to False so nothing gets added.Staying truer to egrep we can use re.search compiling the patterns/substrings to check for:Output:And python being python we can put all the logic in a single list comp to get the data:Output:
This gives the same output, but using built-in Python features instead of shelling out for everything:
Something along this line perhaps:Not sure I got the list of desired tags exactly right - feel free to amend those as necessary.
