Natural Text
I feel bad for asking yet another regex question, but this has been driving me crazy for the past week.I am trying to use regular expressions in python to replace some text that looks like this:What I want to do is capture the text inside the  tags, add a tab () in front of each line and then replace all the  by this new lines with the tabs prepended. That is, I want the result to look like:I am using the following snippet.The problem with this is that it matches all the characters before and after the  tags because of the initial and final  and when I perform the replacement, these are removed. If I remove the s, the re does not match anything anymore.I thought this could be a problem with newlines, so I tried replacing all the  with, say, , performing the matching, and then changing the  back to , but I didn't have any luck with this approach.If anyone has a better method of accomplishing what I want to accomplish, I am open to suggestions.Thank you.
You're on the right track. Instead of regex.match, use regex.search. That way you can get rid of the leading and trailing .
