Natural Text
This question is related to my earlier question Accent insensitive search django sqliteAs mentioned in the response there is no direct way to do so. I have come up with a solution, but I am not sure if it is a good one:Use Case: Assume that the database has a table  with one of the column being . As the name implies  contains the text of the news articles which includes several words with accented characters. Let's say one such word present in the  for an article with Primary Key  is . Now, a user can search for either  or  and should be able to get the article with PK  back with the found accented word in bold ().Solution: I add one more column in the table  and make it contain the  (accent removed) version of the text. Now whenever a search query comes, I first determine if the query contains accented character or not by using  and then search accordingly in the corresponding column.Problem: I am duplicating the whole data. Also, there is no way for me to bold the accented keyword if the search query was the non-accented version of the keyword. Any brilliant suggestions? I am using django with sqlite
