What is the role of that  on the second line? Does it checks if there is an argument?
In python, an empty string, or an empty list or set, etc are all  in boolean context, also  is  in boolean context (also number 0 is False) (that is when used in if statement), the check  , checks whether month is not  or  is not empty string (I am guessing month is string, as you call  on it).Only if month is not empty and month is not None, the statements inside  are executed.Examples to show this behavior -Reference for Python Truth value testing .
The line  is a Truth Value Test.This means it checks that the variable  is not one of these values:zero of any numeric type, for example, , ,  (and  if Python 2.7).any empty sequence, for example, , , .any empty mapping, for example, .instances of user-defined classes, if the class defines a  or  method, when that method returns the integer zero or  value .
As per your sample program:if month is list:A list of months are passed to the function The first  checks if the month is not a empty list then you have used a function  on the list and getting a value In second  you are checking if the value is present in the list and returning itIf month is a string:A string month is  passed to the function The first  checks if the month is not a empty string then you have used a function  on the string to capitalize the month In second  you are checking if the capitalized month  is present in the input month and returning it
The  statement is to validate the parameter (i.e., check if it is null).
