Natural Text
i'm trying to print a message on the screen and then also save that in a text file, but if i put it into a variable first, then print it, it displays with things like, and () which i don't want. I'm wondering how I would save the print output to a variable, so that i can then write it to a text file.That is what i have the print as, but if i did this:it would display as this V which I dont want it to.
You're looking for the format string syntax.Now  contains the string in the format you desire and can be printed as well.
