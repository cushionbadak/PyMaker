As per the documentation, there are several implementations of Queues. The ones I'm interested in are the JoinableQueue and the PriorityQueue, as I'd like to have a joinable queue with priorities. It appears that I can only get one of the functionalities in the lower versions. I.e. in 3.5 I can make the distinciton with Queue (which is joinable) and PriorityQueue, but in python below 3.5 there is JoinableQueue and PriorityQueue (see example below).Is it possible to combine them to get a general way to get a joinable PriorityQueue in 3.4?Another approach would be to somehow perhaps influence Queue?
Because of the way  and  are implemented, you can get a  by subclassing both via multiple inheritance, as long as you list  first.The reason this works is that  is very simply implemented:While  is more complicated, the only method both it and  implement is , and crucially,  calls  in its own  implementation, which means it will cooperate with  properly.Here's an example demonstrating that it works:Output:
