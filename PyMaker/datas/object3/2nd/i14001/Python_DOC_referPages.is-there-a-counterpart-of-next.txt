When reading through a file, I know it's possible to get the next line via , but is there a function like, say,  to go to the previous line?In a similar vein, when looping through a file, is it possible to get the second line after the target line?  will only return the line after as a string.
No, there is no counterpart. You can just store previous lines in a variable:For multiple items you could use a  object:You cannot know what comes next until you retrieve it from the iterable, but you can certainly track what came previously.You are not limited to calling  once; if you need to retrieve two lines from the iterable, call  twice, or use  with  to retrieve multiple items.
