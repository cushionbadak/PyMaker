I use  with two arguments and was wondering if there is an equivalent which would accept a more complex sentinel? As an example, in the code belowthe iteration ends upon getting . I would like to have it end after getting, say, a total of two  (not necessarily one after the other - the code above will generate only  after the first ten calls but one can imagine a case where they are interlaced with other values). In essence, I am looking for a way to use a more complex sentinel. Is there such a concept?I know I can resort to the obvious-but-ugly code mentioned in a previous question, hovewer @HappyLeapSecond answer is so elegant I would like to keep the spirit (I went though  but none of the available methods seem to do the job)
You could use  with a stateful . For example:In the example above,  creates a complex predicate function that will stop the iteration on the third multiple of three. In your case,I would like to have it end after getting, say, a total of two you could use .
It could be done using a generator:Here's how it works:I think this keeps things fairly simple (possibly too simple for your use case but your example is quite simple).
