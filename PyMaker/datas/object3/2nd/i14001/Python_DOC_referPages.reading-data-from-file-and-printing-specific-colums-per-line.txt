I have a CSV file containing data in the following format without a header:12345;TO-345;Something;Might be useful as well;etc;44444:33333;and_so_on;1435;TO-345;Something as well;Definately useful;etc;44444:33333;done;And the file goes for another 1000 lines or so.What I'm trying to accomplish with Python is that I want to read the file line by line and be able to call specific columns per line. For example when the column specific for-loop starts with line 0, it could print out the data in column 0 and then continue doing the same for next line all the way to the end of the file (last line).  I have found good examples for similar scenarios but have failed to understand the thing to do exactly what I want.
To extract the information from the file, you could use the csv module.(I took your sample and put it in )In the inner loop, you could select any column you want, the rows are just lists of strings. To get the third column youâ€™d print  instead of the whole row.Alternatively, you can also first load all rows into a list, if you want to loop over it multiple times:
You can start with a simple python code likeThis will print second column from each line of file.
