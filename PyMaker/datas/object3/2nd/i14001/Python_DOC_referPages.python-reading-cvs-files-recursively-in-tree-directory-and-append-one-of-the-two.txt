I have a root directory which contains hundreds sub-folders. Now I want to read the csv files in each sub-folder, their names are the same, say study.csvAfter reading the csv files, I want to create a data frame to store part of the data from those csv files. The new data frame will contain 3 columns. One is the column we newly created to mark the csv file ID, and the other two columns are two of the csv file columns.For example: The structure of original csv file is:The expected data frame I want:So we will read the csv files starting from row 4, for the New column in this data frame, the value will be the same if the rows are from the same csv files. We can regard this new column as the csv file ID. I found that  could help me to traverse the tree directory, but how I can just read two of the specific columns in csv while creating a new column with the ID accordingly? 
To iterate over each CSV file in a root directory (including sub folders), iterate over  and check each file for the  file extention, then pass the filepath and filename into Load each line of the CSV file into a list., then can then separate the values in each line with .Each value is can now be referenced by its row number and its column number like To process a single file, you can iterate using any values for  and  you want:
The csv module is designed for just this kind of situation. You might want to strip the first three lines and use the fourth line to get the headers, though it looks like you're okay with positional indices.You should then be able to write a generator to pass into a data frame.
