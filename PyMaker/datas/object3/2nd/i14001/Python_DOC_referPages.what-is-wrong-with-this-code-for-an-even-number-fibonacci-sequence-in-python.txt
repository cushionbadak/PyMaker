Can somebody please explain what is wrong with this code? In IDLE the page restarts but returns no answer. By the way, I'm a beginner programmer, only just finished the CodeAcademy course.
Since this is for Problem 2 of Project Euler, you're computing the wrong values. It asks for the sum of all even Fibonacci numbers up to a value of four million, not the four millionth value. That would be too large.Since we want to keep generating values, we'll use a generator and combine it with . Then we'll  it down to the even values, and find the . For a solution that doesn't use these features: 
 starts off as 1, which is not odd. Consequently your  loop doesn't run anything in the body, so the loop runs forever. You probably want to always compute the next Fibonacci number, but only increment the count if the  is even. 
Your problem is that you have your count variable inside the if statement. You have created an infinite while loop. Move it outside of the if statement:Also you will have to add more code to make this work properly.
In your while loop, nothing changes when the if statement fails to execute its conditional code. Try the following instead:
