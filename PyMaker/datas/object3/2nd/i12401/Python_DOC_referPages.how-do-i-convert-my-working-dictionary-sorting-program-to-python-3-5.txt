I am new to Python (4 weeks in) and I have a problem with my python program that should sort my dictionary. I have IDs in my dict and some of them are connected to each other (via the sets). Out of this example, I should get an array consisting of two arrays [[1,3,4,7,8,9],[2,5,6,50,70,80]] to mark my two different groups.This program worked on an older python version, but now I have problems converting it to Python 3.5, because the sets work differently and I can't seem to get it running. What do I have to change to make it work on Python 3.5? (I am using WinPython 3.5 with the Spyder environment)
Python replaced the  module with a built-in  type in version 2.4.  To switch to the new type, just get rid of the  line and change each occurrence of  to .  Also note that  can now be equivalently written .
Here's a version of your code that should work on recent versions of Python 2 and on Python 3.I've eliminated the use of the   list with a  set which is passed as an argument to the recursive function. It's more efficient to test sets for membership than to test lists. The speed difference is hardly noticeable for small sets, but quite noticeable for large sets.output
