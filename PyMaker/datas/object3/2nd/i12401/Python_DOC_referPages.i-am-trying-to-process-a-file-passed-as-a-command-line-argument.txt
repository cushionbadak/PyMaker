I am trying to process a file passed as a command line argument.  Right now there is only one argument, but I plan to add others.Here is my code so far:I can't figure out how to pass the argument to file handle to open and process.And yes, I am a n00b.The try block is just there for testing.
You need to pass the filename as a string. Then, you can use open() to open the file from the filename. Refer to the python docs here (7.2 - Reading & Writing Files).
