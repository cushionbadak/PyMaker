Getting strange difference inside Enthought Canopy vs. command line when trying to load and utilize urllib and/or urllib.requestHere's what I mean.  I'm running Python 3.5 on MacOS 10.11.3.  But I've tried this on Windows 10 machine too, and I'm getting the same results.  The difference appears to be between using Canopy and using command line.  I'm trying to do basic screen scraping. Based on reading, I think I should be doing:This works at a command prompt.BUT, inside canopy, this does not work.  Inside canopy I get the errorWhen Canopy tries to execute the from urllib.request import urlopen Inside Canopy, THIS is what works:I would really like to understand what is happening, as I don't want my Canopy python scripts to fail when I run them outside of Canopy.  Also, the Canopy approach does not seem consistent with docs that I've read... I just got there by trial & error.
 is a module that only exists in Python 3. Enthought Canopy Distribution still ships with a version of Python 2.7 (2.7.10 as of the current version 1.6.2).In Python 2.x, you have the choice of using either  or , which expose functions like  at the top level (e.g.  rather than ).If you want your scripts to be able to run through either Python 3.x or in Enthought Canopy's Python distribution, then there are two possible solutions:Use  - this is generally the recommended library to use for interacting with HTTP in Python. It's a third-party module which you can install using standard  or , or from the Canopy Package Index. Your equivalent code would look similar to:Use conditional importing to bring in the current function you need regardless of version. This is just using built-in features of Python and will not require third-party libraries.Your code would then look similar to:
