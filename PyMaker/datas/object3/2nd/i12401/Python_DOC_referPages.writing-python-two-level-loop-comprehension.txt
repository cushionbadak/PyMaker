I have an input file that contains lines of: I'd like read this file into a dictionary where key is the first token of the line and the value is the list of the values. I think something like this would do it, but python gives me an error that name  is not defined. How do I write a comprehension that has two levels of "for" statements like this? 
Use the  module and insert each row into a dictionary:This sidesteps the issue altogether.You can put a  result into a tuple to create a 'loop variable':Here  is bound to the one  result from the tuple, effectively creating a  'assignment'.
Martijn's got you covered for improving the process, but just to directly address the issues you were seeing with your code:First,  is not doing what you think it's doing (although I'm not entirely sure what you think it's doing). You can just get rid of it.Second, Python is trying to resolve this:before it sees what you're defining  as. You can put parentheses around the second comprehension to make it evaluate as you intended:
