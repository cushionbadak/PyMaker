I am able to do this in C but I do not know how to 100% do it in python. 
User  to extract all digits, convert them to integer and then sum the resultsThis is valid only if you have integersEDIT: For general cases, where you might have float number as well, consider the following:EDIT2:So what's happening:1 -  will import and load  module, which is a module used to extract complex string format based on the provided pattern. More details here2 -  will return all matching string in  with the provided pattern 3 - The pattern  breakdown (which can be found here):4 - Now,  will return a list of all matches:5 -  will convert each element from this list from string into float returning a generator:6 - Passing the result of  to  will sum all elements to their total:
