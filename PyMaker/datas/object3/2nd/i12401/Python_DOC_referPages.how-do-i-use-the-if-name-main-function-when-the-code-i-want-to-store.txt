In my code I am trying to use the  function however the variables I want to share are after the code I don't want to run.For example:ProgramA.pyProgramB.pyNow I don't want this code to run when importing the variables  and  to use in my other program, I only want the variables not the code that accompanies them. However when I use the  function and try and save the variables afterwards ProgramB says that the variables aren't defined. Sorry if this is already answered in another question, but so far I have found no solution.
When you  you can then reference  and  which are still the values from ProgramA given from:By referencing  and  like this:Alternatively you could import it like this:You shouldn't use  in ProgramA.  is only equal to  if Python is loading this source code file as the main program, and as it is being imported from ProgramB  does not equal  and therefore the variables  and  are never declared, which is why you get this error. You can use  in ProgramB though.
