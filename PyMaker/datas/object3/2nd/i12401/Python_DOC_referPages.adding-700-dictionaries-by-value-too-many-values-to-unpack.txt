I have a list of 2 lists, each with 700 dictionaries. Each dictionary has a word count, and I want to combine them, such that values of same keys will be added. I tried doing :  and  are 2 lists of dictionaries. But it throws the following error: ValueError: too many values to unpack.Is there any better way of doing this?
You misused ; you wanted  to chain the iterable outputs of your generator expression, not just wrap the generator function as a no-op:That only gets the first  of s though; to get both, we need MOAR CHAINING!:
This iterates each dictionary once so memory usage should be efficient.
