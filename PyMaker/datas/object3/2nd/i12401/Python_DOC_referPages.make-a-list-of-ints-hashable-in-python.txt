I have a lists of integers that I would like to use as keys in python dictionaries.  I'm caching results from a function(s) that takes a list of ints as input.  My current solution:which generates the key '1,3,4,20'.  Seems like there should be a faster/prettier/more-pythonic way to do this.
Just use a tuple as a key. Tuples are immutable and hashable, so they're useful as dictionary keys.Notably they DO care about order, so  won't produce the same value as You could even create a container that does this for you.Don't try to serialize it yourself. If you do, don't use string manipulation -- it's too ugly. If you are sincerely memory starved or you have hundreds of thousands of these records, you could save insignificant space by serializing like:which should give you a unique (incredibly large!) integer to store that will be smaller in memory than the tuple. Don't do this if you can avoid it -- it's very opaque.In the comments you mention you will not have duplicate values in the key, so  is definitely what you're looking for. objects are immutable hashable -like objects. They are order-agnostic and ignore duplicates.
