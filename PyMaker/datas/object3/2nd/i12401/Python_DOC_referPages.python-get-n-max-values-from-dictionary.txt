This question already has an answer here:5 maximum values in a python dictionary                    4 answers                top values from dictionary                    4 answers                Assume we have dictionary:I want to get another dictionary, containing 4 elements with maximum values. E.g. I expect to get:What will be most pythonic and efficient (memory consumption, execution speed - when f.e. I'll have dict with 1000000 elements) way to do this? Generators, lambdas, something another?
 is always the correct answer when the question is "How do I get a small number of maximum values from a huge set of inputs?" It minimizes memory usage and CPU usage better than just about anything else you could do in Python, by using heaps. Example: and slicing the result can win when the number of max items requested is a large percentage of the input, but for huge inputs and small numbers of max items, the memory savings of  will win.For the CS theory geeks, , for an input of size , selecting the  max values, requires  computation, and  storage.  followed by slicing requires  computation and  storage. So for 1024 inputs and 4 selected items, work for  is ~1024 * 2 computation with storage required of 4;  + slicing would be ~1024 * 10 computation with storage of 1024. In practice, Python's TimSort used in  has lower overhead than big-O notation can properly convey, and usually performs better than the big-O notation would indicate, which is why for, say, selecting the top 200 items out of 1024,  + slicing can still win, but  lacks pathological degradation for huge inputs and outputs; it may be slower on occasion, but it's usually not much slower, where sorted can be faster, but it can also be much slower.
Check the source code of  method. It shows the best solution. And of course, the best way is using  instead of .
