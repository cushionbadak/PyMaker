CodeSuppose I have:Note that class  is simply a class that contains a  of a NumPy array . This  is simply a slice of the last  elements in base ( on initialization). has a method  which adds  to the value at position  of the view, and a method  which modifies the view size () and sets the value at position  to .The function  simply creates a  instance and then returns the serialized object using .BehaviorIf I create a local variable and  it twice and  it once, everything works as expected:Now, if I create a local variable out of serialized data, then after executing  the value  (set after calling  twice) seems to be lost:QuestionWhy is this happening and how could I avoid this behavior?
The problem is that after pickling/unpickling the view is no longer a view into base but has its' own copy of the data. See here, unfortunately, there is no answer on how to prevent this.The particular problem can be overcome by defining  and  methods for the class that redefine the view after unpickling.In addition to the view it is necessary to track which part of the base the view looks into. I've chosen to use a slice object, but there are other ways. It is not necessary to pickle the view itself, since it will be reconstructed from the slice upon unpickling.
