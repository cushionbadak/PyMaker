I want to generate something like that in a function that receives 1 argument  using  to generate:That is my last try:and this is what I receive:
Your error is here: is an integer and not an iterable. Perhaps you wanted to use  (Python 2 only) or  (recommended on Python 3) here:Note that this starts iteration at 0, not 1 (up to and including ). You could either use , or simply add 1 to your sum:This hasn't really got anything to do with generators; wether or not you used , trying to loop over a plain  object doesn't work either way.
Because your function declaration doesn not correspond with for loop. You cannot iterate over integer, you should use some iterable instead. The simplest way is to use range:The correct version is:Or, you can do another change to yield sum of some iterable:
Use range to create an iterator to use in your  loop:
