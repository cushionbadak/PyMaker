I need to program the execution of a give method every x minutes.I found two ways to do it: the first is using the  module, and the second is using .First method:The second:What's the difference and if there is one better than the other, which one?
It's not safe in Python 2 - Python 3.2:From the Python 2.7  documentation:In multi-threaded environments, the  class has limitations with respect to thread-safety, inability to insert a new task before the one currently pending in a running scheduler, and holding up the main thread until the event queue is empty. Instead, the preferred approach is to use the  class instead.From the latest Python 3  documentationChanged in version 3.3:  class can be safely used in multi-threaded environments.
