Basically I am converting PHP CodeIgniter's Encryption Method into Python but I stuck while converting PHP's mcrypt_create_iv library into Python.Thanks in Advance.
 is just a PHP interface to OS-level pseudo-random generators (it's not even a part of libmcrypt, contrary to what the function name implies).Python provides such interfaces via the os module and what you need is os.urandom().For example, if you need to translate  into Python, you'd need to write .To clarify a possible confusion:You may've used  or  in PHP, but there is literally no reason to use either of those instead of  - it is just better by all measurable criteria: in particular is NOT suitable for cryptographic purposes, or in other words - it is insecure. can and will block until new entropy data is available. You don't want blocking in a web application and the myth that  is somehow better than  because of blocking has been debunked. is both non-blocking and secure.
