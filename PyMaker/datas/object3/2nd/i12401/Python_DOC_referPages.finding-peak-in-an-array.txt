I'm completely new to Python, thus the question.I'm trying to solve a standard interview question, which is finding a peak in an arrayA peak is defined as a number which is greater than it's left and right neighbor. I'm trying to find the largest such peak.This is my codeThis is the error that I'm getting Any help appreciated
You've got two function definitions for , one with one argument  and the other with three arguments , , and . The second one overwrites the first one.Use two different names for two different functions
You are calling this:But  takes 3 arguments, as the error states. You have only supplied one.Unlike C++ or other languages, you cannot have a function with the same name that takes different arguments (also known as function overloading). You can, however, define optional arguments in the function declaration.

Overloading is not allowed in Python, my suggestion is to use default values instead of two functions
