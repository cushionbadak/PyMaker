I've been trying for the last three days (yeah) to make a image/short video tagging system for my own use but this has proven a challenge beyond me.These are the strings:I have four things that I've tried modifying to achieve what I want with no success:1 Almost there, but it doesn't extend past the first comma.2 This does almost everything, but I haven't found a way to exclude the directory, the (#) and the extension.3 Taken from the internet, captures the "l." and stops there, whole filename, can't use commas as I want, captures (#).4 Taken from regexbuddy (yes I actually bought it in my desperation), captures (#) and extension.@timgebThe intention is to get the filenames without the commas, the (#) and extension, so:
Your question isn't very clear, but I think you want to parse filenames. If that's the case, I wouldn't recommend using  as your primary tool.Instead, have a look at :Now you have a much simpler problem: removing the numbers in parentheses.
Get the basename, substitute integers in parentheses and the extension with the empty string and strip off the whitespace.Demo:
If I got you, you want last tags (kung fu panda, fight.webm) that is after - If you add more content-string then I can normalize code for you. This code just extracts tags and generates a regular list.    import reOutput-Expression  will capture last tags that is after SEE LIVE-DEMO
