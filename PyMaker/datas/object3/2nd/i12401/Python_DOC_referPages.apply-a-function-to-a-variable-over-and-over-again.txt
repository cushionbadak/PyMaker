Is there a better way to apply a function to a variable over and over again, without having to use a for loop (ideally in standard lib too)? Example of what I have now:What I would love is something like
One alternative I could think of is using  with :You'd still need to iterate through it (or call  on it) to get it to execute. This is if the function should act on the same value. If you need it to call itself many times you could also use a decorator (or  but there's no point in adding this since @Austin did):

Unfortunately, there's no builtin or standard library function that does quite what you want.While you can contort an existing function to make it work, a  loop is probably more readable than the code that would require. I, for one, would greately prefer to read your current code than Austin Hasting's very clever version. I can understand the  loop immediately, the  call and the  that ignores its second argument both require quite a bit more thought.So, think carefully before you "simplify" your code and make sure your simplification doesn't actually make the code harder to understand.
