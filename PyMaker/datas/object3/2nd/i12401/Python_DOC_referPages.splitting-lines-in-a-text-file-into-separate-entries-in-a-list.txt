So, I want to code a program that allows the user to do various tasks, one of which I am having some trouble with.-Option A allows the user to search a text file by a job's 'Estimate ID', and it would search the file for that matching ID and return the relevant data in the following format:Estimate Number: (the estimate number)Customer ID: (the customer ID)Estimate Amount: (the final total)Estimate Date: (the estimate data)Status: (the status) Now, below is the format the data is stored in in the text file:E5346,23/09/2015,C107,970,N,0E5347,23/09/2015,C108,1050,E,0E5348,23/09/2015,C109,370,A,200The data is shown as Estimate Number, Estimate Date, Customer ID, Final Total (in £ pounds), Status (E for Estimate, A for Accepted Job or N for Not Accepted), and Amount Paid (in £ pounds). Obviously these are in the wrong order, and the different entries are all on one line, separated by commas, but the format cannot be changed. Below is the code I wrote for this:I had what I thought was the great idea of putting the line into a list, and, as the entries are separated by commas, they would be independent entries in the list, and would print as required, but, it adds the line from the file as one entry; when I print the 1st entry in the list, which I want to be the Estimate Number, it prints the whole line, so I obviously need to split it into the separate entries I want. My question is, how?
Use string.split() to split the string by a delimiter (in this case, the delimiter is ).Your code under the  block will now be as follows:
