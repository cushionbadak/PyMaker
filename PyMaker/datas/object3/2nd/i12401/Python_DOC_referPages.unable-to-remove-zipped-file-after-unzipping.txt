I'm attempting to remove a zipped file after unzipping the contents on windows. The contents can be stored in a folder structure in the zip. I'm using the  statement and thought this would close the file-like object ( var) and zip file. I've removed lines of code relating to saving the source file.The error returned is: I've tried:looping over the  line in case it's a slight timing issueUsing close explicitly instead of the  statmentAttempted on local C drive and mapped D Drive
instead of passing in a string to the  constructor, you can pass it a file like object:
You are opening files inside the zip... which create a file lock on the whole zip file.  close the inner file open first... via source.close() at the end of your loop
Try to close the zipfile before removing.
