I recently received a ZODB file (.fs) which contain a erp5 database. I need to retrieve the data stored but I don't know the database structure. What I need is some lines of code (if possible) to gather the "tables" and the "records" stored in the DB. This is how I get connected to the database.Getting this output:I'll appreciate any help.Thank you!
ZODB is an "object" storage file format.  It doesn't really have "records" and "tables"; it does have a collection of pickled objects, and it's really meant to be used by the particular application that knows about those objects. If your primary goal is just inspecting the contents of the ZODB, you can try eye, which gives you a browser-based interface to the database contents.Looking at the code for  may offer some ideas on how to extract information yourself, although there's an excellent chance you won't be able to get anything useful without using the originating application.There's a longer discussion of this topic here.
