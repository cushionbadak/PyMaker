here a few fix to your codeas mention before the special method of python are  and , all magic method start and end with a .I fix your  because your recursive call were wrong, went you do  the self instance is implicitly pass as the first argument to that function,  is the second and  the third but as defined add_node only take 2 argument so that is a error, so in this case if you want to call the  of  that is done by  and the same apply to every other call to a method of a classtake a look at: a first look at classesbasic customization and magic methodshere sample usage of this treeOther thing is that in python you dot need to define getter or setter unless you want to control what and how a attribute is set or return it in a especial way that is different to the actual object.run this in the IDLE of python or in interactive mode as  or in your favorite interprete of python.
