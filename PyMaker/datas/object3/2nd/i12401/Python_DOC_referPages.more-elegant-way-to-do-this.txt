Natural Text
Pretty simple piece of code, it just seems way to verbose though. Is there a nicer way to do this in one line? Just out of curiosity. It's in python 3.5.
You can write this as:
You can use the / statement in one line as follows:
With an  conditional expression:The result equals  if the expression is  and 0 otherwise.
There's an old BASIC programmers trick for rounding:This relies on your  function just chopping off the decimal point. In the case of Python and your specific example:NOTE: Be careful (and run a test) about negatives. If your predictedClassification is negative, do you want to round/truncate towards zero or away from zero? That is, does a PC of -.5 become -1 or 0? This is a domain issue (meaning you have to decide) but the language may make things complicated for you.
