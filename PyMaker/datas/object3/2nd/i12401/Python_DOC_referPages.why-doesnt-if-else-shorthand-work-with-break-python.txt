I have been trying break out of loop when a condition is matched. I've tried one-liners below:and thisBoth are not working & throwing  while the straight forward works fine.While I've no problem with using it this way, I just want to know why the syntax for above is wrong.
The expression  expression  expression  expression is a ternary operator. The expressions are evaluated.  is a statement. It isn't evaluated, it's executed. You're getting a syntax error because the syntax is not correct.As @hugo Rivera says below, "All expressions are statements, but not all statements are expressions."
All expressions are statements, but not all statements are expressions.The ternary operator  only accepts expressions ,  and , but  is a statement and cannot be used as an expression. Similarly, you can't , , assign, etc... in a ternary operator. See the second link for a full list of statements.
