I'm currently making a program on Python 3 in which I need the user to enter a password that the program will later use. The problem I have right now is that if I simply use  the charcters entered by the user will be visible on-screen - and I would rather have them replaced by asterixes.Of course, I could use pygame and do something like:but that seems a little overkill (also, the pygame display will open in a new window which I something I'd rather avoid). Is there a simple way of doing this?
You can have the user's input completely hidden using the standard getpass module:
