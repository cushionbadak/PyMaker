Let's assume that the function I am taking about is sum()so what I want to do is and output isIs there a way to this with  or ? I can already do it as a loop but it is too expensive for my real data.Any help, advice?
In case of numpy array you should have the fastest results using vectorization:
Could that beOr if you insist on using  use :?
For your specific example, you could use a list comprehension as follows:OutputTo apply a more complex generic function to each item in your list, use :By using the function  you can customise your function as desired.
