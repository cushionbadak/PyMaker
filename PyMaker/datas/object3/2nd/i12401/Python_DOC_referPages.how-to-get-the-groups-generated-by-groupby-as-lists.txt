I am testing  and try to get the groups as lists but can't figure out how to make it work.using the examples here, in How do I use Python's itertools.groupby()?I tried (python 3.5):I thought I should get the first group ("animal") as a list . But I just get an empty list on REPL.What am I doing wrong?How should I extract all three groups as lists?
If you just want the groups, without the keys, you need to realize the group generators as you go, per the docs:Because the source is shared, when the groupby() object is advanced, the previous group is no longer visible. So, if that data is needed later, it should be stored as a list.This means that when you try to -ify the  generator first using , before converting the individual group generators, all but the last group generator will be invalid/empty.(Note that  is just one option; a  or any other container works too).So to do it properly, you'd make sure to ify each group generator before moving on to the next:As a one-liner:or because this many s gets rather ugly/non-Pythonic, and list comprehensions let us do nifty stuff like unpacking to get named values, we can simplify to:
You could use a list comprehension as follows:Output
Quoting from Python Doc on  :   Make an iterator that returns  consecutive keys and groups from the iterable. The key is a function  computing a key value for each element. If not specified or is None,  key defaults to an identity function and returns the element  unchanged. Generally, the iterable needs to already be sorted on the  same key function.
