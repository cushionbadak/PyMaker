Why does  succeed on ?Results:It seems as if this behaviour invites errors where a function does not always return a value. For example:The above test would pass even though it should fail. It is missing an error in the code that should be caught.How should we assert that the value is literally  and not merely false in a boolean context? e.g.
 is falsy, as well as , , , ... does not check whether the given value is  by identity. This behavior is consistent with the  statement:Similarly,  does not check whether a value is , and as such values like , ,  pass the test. See Truth Value Testing for more information.This behavior is also explicitly documented:Test that expr is true (or false).Note that this is equivalent to  and not to If you really want to be sure that a value is  or , use .
Your case is actually pointed out in the documentation:Note that this is equivalent to bool(expr) is True and not to expr is  True (use assertIs(expr, True) for the latter).Source: https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.assertFalse
Python default return value for functions is .Python also implements Duck typing, so some values are threated as falsey, those areempty stringinteger zeroboolean Falseempty listempty tupleSo yes, you should implement it as  if you want to explicitly check the  boolean value. This is not a good idea, in python you can just doYou could design your test cases using boundary-value analysis to check your corner cases.
