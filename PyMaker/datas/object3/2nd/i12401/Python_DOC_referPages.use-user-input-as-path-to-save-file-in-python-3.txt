I'm writing a script to download a file from a website, and I'm able to successfully save the file using a path entered into the code, however if I use an input then things don't work.From here I'll use  to append the file type to the end of the path and then use PycURL to download the file. But getting a user input for the path gives a FileNotFoundError, for example  become  after appending the file type. I've also tried  as well as  however they give the same thing, and ideally I'd like to avoid using double forward/back slashes in the input since they're not very user friendly.If for whatever reason you need any more code/all the code don't hesitate to ask. Thanks :)
