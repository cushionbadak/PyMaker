I am running python 3.4 on the main.py file in the same directory./root directory is not in python path. It is simply the current directory that the script is executing in. All pycache folders were deleted after each testSo why exactly is  important? I thought it was necessary as stated in this post: What is __init__.py for?If you remove the init.py file, Python will no longer look for submodules inside that directory, so attempts to import the module will fail.Right now, it seems to me that  is nothing more than an optional constructor where we do housekeeping and other optional things like specifying the "all" variable, etc. But not a critical item to have.Image showing the results of the test:What is going on here?
Answeressentially we dont need init.py and its purpose is for legacy and optional housekeeping things (2.7 vs 3) you may or may not want to do or need. But at the same time, they have slightly different behavior during more complex parsing which should also be accounted for if you are building something more complexrefer to the following links for more reading materialhttps://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0420/#namespace-packages-todayHow do I create a namespace package in Python?What's the difference between a Python module and a Python package?https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/276888/python-namespace-vs-module-with-underscores
