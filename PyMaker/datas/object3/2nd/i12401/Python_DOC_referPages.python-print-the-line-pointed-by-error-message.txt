To load a json, I use the  method with a  block to get where the error has been occured if it fail.I am getting errors, in the form:I am asking if there is a way to get the line/char pointed by this error.Is there a way in python that return the  from a string?
From Python 3.5 onwards, decoding can raise an  exception. This exception contains a few extra attributes, use those to print out some context. I'd limit this to a small string. Your sample input string has at least 14117247 characters on the first line, probably because your input contains no line separators at all; it is probably not all that helpful to print all those characters:In Python 3.4 and earlier, a  exception is raised. You can parse the  message (the  value) for clues, but this requires manual string parsing. See the  function; reverse its formatting when parsing.For this specific case however (where a value is expected), you'll need 3.4 or newer to get a line and column indicator; before 3.4 the best the module could do was give you the unhelpful message No JSON object could be decoded.
Most likely, no. At least in Python 2.7.  does not provide any means for customizing how it behaves on errors. But you can parse the location from the error message to read the line from your input. The error format can be either  or .
