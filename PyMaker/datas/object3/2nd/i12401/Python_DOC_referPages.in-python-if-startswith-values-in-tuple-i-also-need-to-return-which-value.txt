I have an area codes file I put in a tupleand a file I read into Python full of phone numbers.If a phone number starts with one of the area codes in the tuple, I need to do to things:1 is to keep the number2 is to know which area code did it match, as need to put area codes in brackets.So far, I was only able to do 1:How do I do the second part?
The simple (if not necessarily highest performance) approach is to check each prefix individually, and keep the first match:Since we know  will get exactly one hit, we just pull the hit using .Note: On Python 2, you should start the file with  to get the generator based  (which will also save work by stopping the search when you get a hit). Python 3's  already behaves like this.For potentially higher performance, the way to both test all prefixes at once and figure out which value hit is to use regular expressions:Lastly, one final approach you can use if the area codes are of fixed length. Rather than using , you can slice directly; you know the hit because you sliced it off yourself:
