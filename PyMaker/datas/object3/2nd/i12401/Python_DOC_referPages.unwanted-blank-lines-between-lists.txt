I'm having some trouble with some test code. This code is meant to:read a csv filetake two inputsput the inputs in a listmake a new list with the csv contents + the input listoverwrite the csv with the new list. For example, if 'cats' and 'dogs' were in the file, and I typed in 'zebras' and 'giraffes', I'd expect the csv to look like this when I open it in Notepad:linkHowever blank lines are produced in between the lists when I run the code more than once, and I don't know why.linkI am new to Python and any help is appreciated. 
The solution is:In new versions of Python  now handles newline, but  also does. Then you must tell  that it must not add newline when writing to the file. See API documentation for more explanations.
