I'm learning Python and I'm following official documentation from:Section: 7.2.2. Saving structured data with json for Python 3I'm testing the  function to dump my python set into a file pointer:The file  already exists in my working directory and even if it didn't, statement  would have re-create it, truncated.The  converts my  set into a valid JSON object, so that's fine.Problem is when I use the  method, which actually updates my , but it gets truncated.I've managed to do a reverse workaround like:After which the contents of my  become as expected:Even, this approach works too:Why does this approach fail?:Note that I don't get any errors from the console; just a truncated file.
It looks like you aren't exiting the interactive prompt to check the file. Close the file to flush it:It will close if you exit the interactive prompt as well.
