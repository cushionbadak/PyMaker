I was looking for a regular expression to validate e-mails when I found this:The  expression seems not to work like the documention says it should.This for example prints the first character of the string that is .If i use regular expression  I get an error: . The documentation says that:Special characters lose their special meaning inside sets. is a set and  is a special character.
The statement "special characters lose their special meaning inside sets" is true because the caret character has two special meanings; at the logical start of a regular expression (where it is an anchor), and at the start of a character class (or 'character set' where it forms a 'complementing set of characters').The reported error comes from the  construct which is invalid since the character class is not closed: the  affects the next character(s).In this case the effect is the  does not close the character class and the entire regular expression is "not ended", resulting in the regular expression syntax error.Anyway, the error reported about  has nothing to do with  which is a character class that will match any character except . This, coupled with the incorrectly focused title, probably explains some of the downvotes..
 is a special case. It means "match a single character that is not in the brackets." Have a look at the wiki page for more detail. 
The character  is a special character.
