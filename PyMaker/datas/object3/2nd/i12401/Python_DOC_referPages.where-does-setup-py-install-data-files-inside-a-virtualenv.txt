I've found multiple sources (https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/sourcedist.html#specifying-the-files-to-distribute, http://blog.ionelmc.ro/2014/05/25/python-packaging/, http://blog.ionelmc.ro/2014/06/25/python-packaging-pitfalls/) that suggest that the way to distribute data files in a Python package is to use setuptools's  option and a .  The files in my package thus look like,with the rest of the file (hopefully irrelevant) elided.When I run  or use pip in a virtualenv, I end up with the Python source files themselves, but without  anywhere I can find it.  I'd think this was an error in my packaging, except that when I grab another package with a similar layout, I can't find the data files either.  If I clone the repository for the example package https://github.com/ionelmc/python-nameless and install it using , the package installs in the directory .  However, I can't find any of the data files or tests anywhere in the virtualenv.  Where are they supposed to end up?  How is this supposed to work?My motivation for asking this question is that another contributor on a project wants the tests, which require the data files, to run from a pip install.  Is this the right approach in the first place?
My understanding is that you should just instead of ing it - to be honest, I am actually not sure what  does.Also I do not believe it is required to specify  at all
