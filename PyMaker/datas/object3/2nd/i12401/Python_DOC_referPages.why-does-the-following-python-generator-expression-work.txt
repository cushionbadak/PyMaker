I'm trying to wrap my head around a common generator idiom I encounter in the wild.  I've noticed it (and used it) for a long time but never bothered to question it. An example of the idiom using a toy function:Why does  work as expected?  I get that  is a generator expression, but e.g.  is not a valid generator outside of a function call.Put another way, given that the above code is valid, why does the following code not work: (obviously, making the whole expression a generator does work as expected:)I get that it's a bit of a silly question but the answer isn't immediately intuitive to me.  Is it just a case of "because that's the way the syntax works" or is there something I'm missing?
I  get that  is a generator expression,Actually, it's not. The parentheses are completely superfluous in this case, since there's just a single operator . When you have more operators, parentheses are used to set order of operations.  is not a valid generator outside of a  function call.Actually it is. Inside a function call you can skip the extra parentheses, when the generator is the only argument. So the following two lines are in effect the same. Outside a function call, the generator must have parentheses.
