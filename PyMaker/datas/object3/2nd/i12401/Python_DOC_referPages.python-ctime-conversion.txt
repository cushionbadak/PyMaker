I'm having issues coverting a ctime string over to %Y-%m-%d format. Now I just want to convert to YYYY-MM-DD. Any suggestions? I'm not having luck with traditional reformatting

Use  with  rather than using :I won't tell you the file I used so the output will differ.
You should avoid "Yo-Yo code" and format the file time in the desired format directly without converting it to a string using  first:If you've received -formated time string from an external source then you could parse this () date/time format using  stdlib package:In general, use  to convert a string into datetime object. See Converting string into datetime.
