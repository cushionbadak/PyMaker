What would be the most Pythonic way of determining if an object's type is contained in a specific module?For example, let's say I want to match date, time, and datetime classes from the datetime module.It seems silly creating a matching instance of the three for each loop. Is there some simpler way of saying "if type(obj) in some-module"?
 can check against multiple types:Return true if the object argument is an instance of the  argument, or of a (direct, indirect or virtual) subclass thereof. If object is not an object of the given type, the function always returns false. If  is a tuple of type objects (or recursively, other such tuples), return true if object is an instance of any of the types. If  is not a type or tuple of types and such tuples, a  exception is raised.
