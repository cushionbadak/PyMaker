I have following structure of configuration files:Actually  just check environment variable  (which could be , equivalent to one of 's subfolders) and load corresponding settings.I know only about importing with  which return to me module as local variable and I forced to write something like that:Is there way to do something similar to python's expression: ?
The return value of  is mutable.  You could do something like this:Note that this imports underscore-prefixed things into the global namespace.  If you want to exclude those, write a dictionary comprehension that only includes the things you want.  For example:This does not work with , which returns a read-only value.  It is not reasonably possible to do that ( into a non-global namespace), because Python has to know the names of all local variables at compile time in order to generate the correct  instructions in the bytecode (along with a variety of other interesting problems such as identifying the variables captured by a closure).  You will find that  is illegal inside a function or class:That's not just a matter of " is bad design."  It's a fundamental language limitation and can't be worked around with .
