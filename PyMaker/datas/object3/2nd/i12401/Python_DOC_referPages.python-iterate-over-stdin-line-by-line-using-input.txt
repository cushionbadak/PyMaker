Natural Text
I am trying to get multiple names separated by newlines from the console and put them into a variable. Let's assume I want to get input from the terminal forever (I'll add some code to break out of the loop later). I know how to do it with a while loop and recursion, but I would like to be able to do it with a for loop. In the below example when I get  as input from the terminal I get each letter rather than a whole line at a time:Now, if I use  the  variable becomes :Is there a easy way to get  to give  a whole line rather than individual characters? Or just by the nature of using  I am going to be iterating through the characters in the input? Are there any inherent risks/problems with getting input in this fashion? Is there a "standard" way of getting input in a situation like this?I am using Python 3.5.1 on Ubuntu 15.10.
You can wrap  to strip the newlines; if you can strip all trailing whitespace (usually okay), then it's just:You're on Py3, so that works as is; if you're on Py2, you'll need to add an import, , so you get a lazy, generator based  (that yields the lines as they're requested, rather than slurping  until it ends, then returning a  of all the lines).If you need to limit to newlines, a generator expression can do it:or with an import to allow  to push work to C layer for (slightly) faster code (a matter of 30-some nanoseconds per line faster than the genexpr, but still 40 ns per line slower than the argumentless option at the top of this answer):Like the first solution, on Py2, make sure to get the  from .
I wouldn't recommend you this, but you can create a generator to be used in a  loop to iterate through input line by line:
