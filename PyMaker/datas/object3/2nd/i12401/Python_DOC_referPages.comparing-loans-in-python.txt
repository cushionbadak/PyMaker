I am doing an assignment for my Python class. I almost figured it out but my output is just a little bit different with the one showed in the original problem. When interest rate is 5.125%, I have a Monthly Payment for 189.29, but the output from the problem is 188.28. The original number without format is 189.286. I guess maybe in the finance system, they just simply cut the decimals instead of using "round". I am not sure if there is any way to do that in Python.  Here is the problem.Write a program that lets the user enter the loan amount and loan period in number of years and displays the monthly and total payments for each interest rate starting from 5% to 8%, with an increment of 1/8. Input:Output:Code:
When you work with money use the decimal module. This allows many different rounding modes. For example, round down:Prints:Bankers' rounding would be:Round to nearest with ties going to nearest even integer.
