Natural Text
Hi I am new to programming and python programming. I have a tab delimited txt file that I have imported using  and it looks likeI want to split this data in subarrays with different chromosomes like I was trying something like this but getting an syntax error. I am trying to do so as I want to extract each chromosome data when conditionally.I would really appreciate any suggestion in this regard. 
You cannot make association in a list [] you have to use a dictionary {}
Create a -ionary, which takes a string (or any hashable object) and returns an arbitrary value. Use that to map your 'chr' names to sub-arrays with just those records:You can speed this up by knowing that in Python, the whole "I wish my dictionary had a default value for new keys" problem comes up a lot, and there are some standard solutions:The  creates a new, empty, list. Either the empty list, or a previously existing list, has the  appended.Finally, you can speed that up even more by recognizing that iterating across a list and doing exactly one thing to it is a good use of the  function. Although generally you use the result of whatever you're doing, with map.Finally, if your data happens to be sorted on the key value, you might use the  function, which will handle the grouping logic for you if the data is already sorted. I mention these last two ( and ) because I suspect your dataset may be large, and performance may be an issue.
