I am trying to download the DOM from the Yahoo fantasy football page. The data requires a yahoo user. I am looking for the python library where I can add my user/pass to the request.urllib has HTTPBasicAuthHandler which needs a HTTPPasswordMgr Objectsthe add_password field says I am missing an argument, when I try and pass it the 4 it wants. I am not sure what to put for the realm. I am new to Python.I have found the Requests to look promising, but when I install it, it throws an error and I can not import it properly :\I was hoping this was a bit easier to do in Python!The ideal solution would have someone downloading yahoo DOM data from a page that requires credentials :)
