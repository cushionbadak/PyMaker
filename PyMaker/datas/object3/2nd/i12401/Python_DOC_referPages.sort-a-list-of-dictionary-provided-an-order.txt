I've a listand a list of dictionariesI want to sort this  by the order given in  list, i.e. the output should be the following:I know how to sort by a given , but not when an order is already given. How can I sort it?PS: I already have an O(n^2) solution. Looking for a better solution.
Use index of the  list to sort-Just try if every dictionary has one value and you want sorting by that value-But if you have multiple values for one key then change the index (i.e ) on which you will sort.
Make a mapping of 8 to 0, 7 to 1, ..., 11 to 5 using :And use it as a sorting key:use  instead of  to prevent  in case of value is misisng in .
