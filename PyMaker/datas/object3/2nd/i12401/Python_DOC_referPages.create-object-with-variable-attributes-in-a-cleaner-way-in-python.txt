Am new to python and I had to create an object only with certain attributes that are not . Example:Coming from a Java land I know python is full of short hand so wanted to know if there is a cleaner way for writing the above? Of course my actual object has plenty more attributes. I tried searching but couldn't find anything helpful so am in doubt if its possible or not cause this doesn't scale if there are more than 2 variable attributes.
One way could be using the double-star operator, like this:In plain words: you construct a dictionary with your keyword arguments, and then pass that dictionary preceded by  to the callable.However,  is often (not always) used as a default value for optional arguments. Probably this will work too:without any  or that sort of stuff.
