I found the following line in Python code:Simultaneously, I can find  anywhere. I found that there is a file  in package root and it has  inside.Is this it? How is this defined?UPDATESorry I am new to Python and the question is about Python syntax. I learned, that what is after  is Python file name without a  extension. So, where is this file in this case?
six is a package that helps in writing code that is compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3.One of the problems developers face when writing code for Python2 and 3 is that the names of several modules from the standard library have changed, even though the functionality remains the same.The  module provides those modules under a common name for both Python2 and 3 (mostly by providing the Python2 module under the name of the Python 3 module).So your lineimports  when run with Python3 and imports a mixture of ,  and  with Python2, mimicking the structure of Python3's . See also here.EDIT to address the update of the question:TLDR; There is not necessarily a direct relation between the imported module  and a file on the filesystem in this case. The relevant file is exactly what  points to.Third party modules are defined in a file/directory that is  listed in . Most of the time you can find the name of the file a module is imported from by inspecting the  attribute of the module in question, e.g. . However with  things are not as simple, precisely because the exposed modules might not actually map one to one to actual Python modules but hacked versions of those.
