I'm starting out on making code to carry out Vigenere cipher encryption. First, I want to make the key. The key needs to be repeated over and over till it matches the length of the message to be encrypted so I created a function that would do this for me:The output should look like:But the program just gives me an index out of range error and I have no idea what's going on!Error message:
The reason your code doesn't work:Should have been:You get an  from trying to access  in the line  (where i=3) after you deleted that element.And just for fun, here's an alternate implementation.Prints: Edit - cryptic one-liner solutionIf you want to make everyone who reads your code roll their eyes at you, you could try this:The  function takes an  object - in our case, the  string - and repeats it in an infinite loop. So, if we create  it will generate  forever.The  function allows us to take a "slice" of an iterator object. In Python, "slice" is the term for the  part of the expression  - we "sliced" out a sub-set of the original. Since we don't want our string to be infinitely long - which wouldn't be very useful - we want to just take a slice of the  we created:This takes our iterator -  - and slices it starting from index 0 and ending at index . This will return another iterator - this time, one that isn't infinite. The contents of the iterator are now: .Now, we just need to stitch that  back up into a whole string:Just to give you another tool in your toolbox!
