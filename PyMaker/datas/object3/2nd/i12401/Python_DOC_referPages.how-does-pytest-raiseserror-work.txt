New-ish to Python but I'm trying to understand this slice of code:After reading this tutorial on with, I understand  returns a context manager that sets up and cleans up things before and after  is called. I also understand that  should raise a  if something goes wrong.How does pytest "react" when a ValueError is raised? AFAIK, there's only setting up and cleaning up so I'm not sure how it catches the exception. The end goal for this is to understand the benefits of having pytest as a context manager.
 magic function accepts ,  and  parameters:They are , if the  block ends normally:
I'm not completely sure about pytest but any context manager is passed 3 arguments on its exit, the exc_type, Excepton and Traceback, if no exception was raise all three are none and if the exit returns True then the exception is suppressed as well,better explained here: https://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html#object.exitso if I want to make a simple handler that will show the traceback without stopping the program I could do this:to see the error that was raised without halting the program.
The  construct calls two "magic" methods,  and  at the beginning and end of the code block, respectively. Thus,Can be read as:Except that, as soon mentioned in hir answer,  is called with details on why the code block is exiting: if an exception, what kind, otherwise .So the object returned by  has been configured to expect an exception of TYPE. The  method compares the parameter it receives declaring the actual (if any) exception with the internal data member it has storing the expected exception type, and then decides to pass or fail the test.
