Like this:I have been using the following code:and it returns:    Notice that it always adds an empty element to the beginning of my list.  It's easy enough to drop it, but I'm really looking to understand what is going on here, so I can get the code to treat things consistently.  Thanks.
When using the  method, if the capture group is matched at the start of a string, the "result will start with an empty string". The reason for this is so that  method can behave as the inverse of the  method.It might not make a lot of sense for your case, where the separator matches are of varying sizes, but if you think about the case where the separators were a  character and you wanted to perform a join on them, with the extra empty string it would work:But without it, the initial pipe would be missing:
You can do it with :You said "space" in the question, so the pattern works with space. For matching runs of any whitespace character you can use:The pattern matches one or more whitespace characters or one or more non-whitespace character, for example:
