In statically typed languages to solve the problem below I would use interface (or abstract class etc.). But I wonder if in python there is more "pythonic" way of doing it.So, consider the situation:Above "value provider" is custom class, which has  method. Of course, the idea is that it can be implemented by the user.Now, the question is: what is the best way to implement ? I.e., what is the best way to distinguish between "single value" and "value provider"?The first idea, which came to my mind is to use inheritance: Introduce base class  with empty implementation and tell in documentation, that custom "value providers" must inherit from it. Then in  function just check . What I don't like about this solution is that inheritance seems to be somehow redundant in this case (specifically in case of python), because we cannot even force one, who derive to implement  method. Besides, for someone who wants to implement custom "value provider" this solution implies need to have a dependency on the module, which exposes .The other solution would be to use "trait attribute". I.e. instead of checking base class, check existence of particular attribute with  function. We can check either existence of  method itself. Or, if we afraid, that the name of the method is too common, we could check for dedicated trait attribute, like . Then in documentation tell, that any custom "value provider" must have not only  method, but also . This second solution seems to be better, as it does not abuse inheritance and allows to implement custom "value providers" without being dependent on some additional library, which provides base class.Could someone comment on which solution is preferable (or if there are other better ones), and why?EDIT: Change the example slightly to reflect the fact, that value-provider is going to be stored and used later (probably, multiple times).
I highly suggest using .  Your code will be highly readable and via ducktyping you can later on make it work with other types you have in mind.Regarding not getting confused with other objects having the  function, Python idioms assume the coder is a responsible person and won't try to destoy the system he is implementing the code with, therefore a single  is enough. If the class has  it can be assumed as a value provider and not a value (else, the value is the value itself.  on a value, returning  is rather useless).
