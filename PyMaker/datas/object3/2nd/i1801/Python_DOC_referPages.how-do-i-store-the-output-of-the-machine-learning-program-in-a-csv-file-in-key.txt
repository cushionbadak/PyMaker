This is my following code, the classify() and the end takes a input as an tag and gives the corresponding output.
Not sure what you exactly want, your code isn't really sufficient to clarify or even understand fully.I'm assuming in  you are trying to compute a table of expected vs computed classes (is this what you mean by key and value respectively?). Again assuming further, that those classes are hashable (if you want to treat them as keys, as per what the term 'key' mean in python and context implied by 'key value pair'), you can directly write the  to a csv file using csvwriter which can directly take this list as a param. If you really want key: value pair, then this list can be converted into a  using the builtin with the same name: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict.But a recommended/better way should be provided with the ML/numeric computation library that you're using like:https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.to_csv.html TF dataframes also have to_csv method.
