Natural Text
I am trying to find a way to get two actions done in one line if statement, I can find a lot of answers to perform a single action in if statement one-liner but not for this. Is it even possible? I tried something like this but failed with ValueError - too many values to unpack (expected 2). Thanks.
Python is looking at your code like this:3 things to unpack, only 2 to pack it into.The reason behind the error is operator priority, you can either read lots of  lenghty text here  or google it and find a table like here.Fix it by makeing the tuples explicit with parenthesis:Output:With explicit tuples, no more operator confusion and it works.Keywords for google:    or smth alike
