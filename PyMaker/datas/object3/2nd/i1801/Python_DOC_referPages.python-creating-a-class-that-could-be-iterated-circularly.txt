I want to create, in Python,  a class behaving like a list but that could be iterated circularlyuse case example:it will print abcdathe code I tried so far is the one belowI know the issue is with my methodwhich by the way seems ignored, I can use next even if I don't implement it
This actually already exists with , for example:will keep repeating the element.Next you here mix up the iterable, and the iterator, those are frequently different things.As an iterable we can keep iterating from :Or for an iterator:
Here's a basic non-itertools implementation:Notice that there's no need to implement  since the  class itself, just like , is not an iterator. To get an iterator out of it explicitly, you write:Of course, you can instantiate as many iterators as you'd like.
