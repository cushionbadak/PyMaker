The question exactly is: Create a function (jumpMaximum) that, given any list of integers list, returns a list with the same elements as list,except that the first element has been swapped with the maximum element in list.Note: This function should not print the list, but return it.My code so far is:Now when I run this, I get [3, 2, 3, 4], but this is wrong of course. I made the for loops to iterate through the list and find the maximum. And then I wrote //maximum, list[0] = list[0], maximum// to swap the first element with the max, so I am not sure where it is going wrong.
You could do something like this:OutputThe idea is to use enumerate in conjunction with max to find the index () of the maximum element, then simply swap the elements and return the list.As a side note you should not use names such as list for your variables because it shadows the built-in list.UPDATEIf you cannot use  or , you can do it like this:OutputThe idea is to substitute  and  by the  loop. Also you don't need the nested loops.
