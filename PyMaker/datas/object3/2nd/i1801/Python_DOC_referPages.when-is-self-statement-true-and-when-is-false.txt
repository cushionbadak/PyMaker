Can someone explain this if self.cards condition? When will it be True and when will it be False?
Any object can be tested for truth value in Python. The following values are considered false:NoneFalsezero of any numeric type, for example, , , , .any empty sequence, for example, , , .any empty mapping, for example, .instances of user-defined classes, if the class defines a  or  method, when that method returns the integer zero or bool value .All other values are considered true â€” so objects of many types are always true.In this case cards is  when it is empty because it is a list. When the object is created,  creates the cards empty list, so that if statement's condition is always  when the object is created.
First, you should probably show us when self.cards is used for the first time.Assuming it is some sort of a container(,  or ) it will be true if there are elements in it and false if it is empty.
