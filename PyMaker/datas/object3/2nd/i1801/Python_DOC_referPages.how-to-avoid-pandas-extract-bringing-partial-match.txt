Natural Text
Scenario:-I have a Dataframe as follows full_sentenceBaggageage     a list of key words key_words = [ 'age' ,'man' ] Objective:- I need to see if the word "age" [ individually ] exists in this column and if it exists make that as a separate column Desired output :- full_sentence  |   found_wordBaggage        |    NaNage            |    age Command Used:-Dataframe.str.extract('({})'.format('|'.join(key_words)),flags=re.IGNORECASE,expand=False).astype(str)Output with Mismatchfull_sentence  |   found_wordBaggage        |    ageage            |    age Clarification:-It seems, extract is doing a partial match of the string as well. Can it be made to extract only if the whole word matches. Thanks
Change the regex match to .  in regex means start of line/string and  means end of line/string. You should also change to raw strings with  as above for regex patterns.See the Python3 or the Python2 regex docs for more info.
