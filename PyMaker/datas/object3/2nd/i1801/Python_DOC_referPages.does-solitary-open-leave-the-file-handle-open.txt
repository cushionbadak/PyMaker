This question already has an answer here:Does a File Object Automatically Close when its Reference Count Hits Zero?                    4 answers                Will a single call to open() without assigning it to a variable close the file handle after it is done executing?What about if you call .read() on it?
As per the python docs, the file remains open until you call  on the file object or the garbage collector kicks in and closes it for you.Because of this, prefer to use context managers (i.e. the  statement) when reading files, as they will close the file for you.
