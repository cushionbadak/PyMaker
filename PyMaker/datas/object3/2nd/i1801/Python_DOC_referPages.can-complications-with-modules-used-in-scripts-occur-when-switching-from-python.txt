Currently I have some scripts with Python 3.4 running on my windows server and few running under Python 2.7.Now I want to switch from Python 3.4 to 3.7, but do not install Python 3.7 in parallel. Can this lead to errors in my scripts or is 3.7 to 3.4 easily downward compatible?Thanks for your help!
Your question is probably going to be downvoted to the ground because this is information you can probably find easily. Usually this is information you can get in the release notes: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/But normally all versions of Python 3 are backwards compatible with previous versions of Python 3.
