Natural Text
I want to print a phrase at the end of my function, but my desired output is not printing. There are no errors popping up in python, it just isn't printing and acting like it is ignoring it. wordlist is the list of words the user entered to find how many times each word appears in the website they entered. sitewordlist is the entire list of words in the website.
You're using while-loops to act like for-loops, but you're using the same iterator  in both, and you're not resetting its value to 0 in between. So the second while-loop sees that  is already equal to , and so it doesn't execute the body of the loop.
Problem: in your first  you increase  until it is equal to   - your second  is only entered if  is smaller then  - thats kind of contradictionary. You can use  to count things easily and get a dict from it:Output:Full Counter:While is not really appropriate here. You can simulate Counter using a normal dict and while like so:Output:Or use  in conjunction with a normal / defaultdict:with identical output.
