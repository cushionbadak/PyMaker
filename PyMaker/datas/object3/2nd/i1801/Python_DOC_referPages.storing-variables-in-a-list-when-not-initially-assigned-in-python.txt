Natural Text
Good afternoon. I created an empty list that Is going to be filled by the user. I used an infinite loop to continuously ask the user for numbers that are supposed to be stored in the empty list I created(and breaks when the user specifies) but it doesnt store these numbers. It only just stores the last input number. I have spent a good while trying to figure this on my own but I can't. I need help with this please!
Here:You are always assigning to , because you set  to zero at the top of your loop.If you want to add an element to a list, you should be using .
