I'm trying to make a test for this function from my code:Where  is a string created from :The problem is I cannot assert equality between the result of  and a string because everytime my test (using the  framework) calls the  function, the time variable changes so the strings aren't equal.How can I pass or set up a particular  inside my test so when the name_of_file function is called, I can know the final string I'll get (and so pass the test)?
The fact that the  function is getting the value from a global variable named  in the code is what's making this difficult to solve. You ought to be able to avoid the issue by redefining the function to accept an additional parameter with this value and then passing it to it as an argument whenever it's called.If you can't change the  function and/or how it's used, then the value of the  function returns could be turned into a constant by using the  library, as @wowserx suggested in a comment.
