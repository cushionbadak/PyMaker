Below is a portion of an HTML file: I want to webscrap the highlighted lines only. This is portion of a large fie. For this portion, I tried:But the output was: How do I extract the string containing the address inside the  portion of the image?
I like to parse this sort of thing using the python  function.  The thing to notice is the recurring pattern around the data.This pattern gives you a place of leverage where the code can work, and thus presents an approach for some code:Outputs: The split function cuts the string up into a list, removing the part you split with.So the first split gives , and we just take the 2nd item .  We then re-split this with , which gives everything before the  and some other stuff we don't care about, so the first element is a keeper . We cleanup some whitespace with , then de-quote the result.Using this approach, you can fetch the other values too.  Probably best in a function.
