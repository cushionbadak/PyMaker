How would I exactly go about offsetting the timestamp returned by  by any amount of time such as a day?For example:I need the above offset by a day. Having a minor issue when my script crosses into the daylight savings time conversion but I dont need to see past it however since it loads today also it dies because the python script errors doing work on the date today now.
To simply add a certain delta time onto UTC add a timedelta:Output:More info on python with timezones can be found at  Python UTC datetime object's ISO format doesn't include Z (Zulu or Zero offset)With 3.7  and  even recognize  as  - up to 3.6 the colon would make it crash :)
