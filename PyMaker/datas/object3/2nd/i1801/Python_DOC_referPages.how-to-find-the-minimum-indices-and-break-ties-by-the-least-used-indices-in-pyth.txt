I have a numpy array like the following:I am looking for the minimum indices in each column. I found this using  as follows:This gives me . Since there are ties, I could obtain the following: , where I break the ties by the index that is least used (from the previous indices). In more details:For , we have  and, say, we choose . For , we have  and we have to choose the minimum index from  since these indices are the least used (we already choose  for ). Say, we choose . For , we have  and we have to choose the minimum index from  since these indices are the least used. We continue in this way... For , we have  and we have to choose the minimum index from  since these indices are the least used. Say we choose .For , we have  and we have to choose from  since these indices are the least used. We choose .For , we have  and we have to choose from  since these indices are the least used. Say we choose .I hope it is clear. My question is how to find the minimum indices and break ties by the least used indices in Python?
You could use min combined with a dictionary for keeping the counts of each index:OutputThe idea is to create the following key: , and then use the normal comparison of tuples, so if the values are equal the one with less counts of the corresponding index will be selected, if both counts are equal get the one with lower index will be selected.
