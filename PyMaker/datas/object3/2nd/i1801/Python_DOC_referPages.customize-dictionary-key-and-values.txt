I have a question about change dictionary format. The dictionary is :I want to ask is there a way for me to change the format like below:
You can do the following:Try it online!There are a few moving parts that interact to create this solution:Dict comprehensionsPython has a neat trick where it allows you to embed  loops in iterable and dict declarations to efficiently cycle and modify a set of elements. Here, the outer iterator is : this goes through a sequence of integers starting from 0, and progressively increases by  until it is greater than or equal to the size of the list, which functions to choose the start index of each -sized dict segment. Tuple unpacking is convenient because it returns a dict view of 2-tuples of each dictionary key and its value. Later, we utilize tuple unpacking , where a tuple of variables is flattened into two variables that can then easily form a key-value pair of the currrent dictionary comprehension. (This is only in newer versions of Python.)List slicing is basically a way of getting a sublist. The syntax in relatively straightforward: starting from position , get a sublist up to and excluding the element  (i.e. a sublist of size ).Formatted string literalsPreceding a string with  makes it a formatted string literal. Anything within   is interpreted as literal Python syntax (with the exception of , , and , which may vary behavior by context.) Here, in , it allows us to label each column with a bit of division and a +1 offset to start counting from 1 instead of 0. (This is new to Python 3.6)
