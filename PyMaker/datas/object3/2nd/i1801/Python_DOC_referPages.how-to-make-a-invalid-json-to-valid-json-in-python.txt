my json string:expecting dictcionary:how can i convert first invalid dictionary to valid like 2nd one.
Yes, it's not valid JSON, but you can pass the string to  if you surround it with brackets:
You're dealing with a malformed JSON file here: JSON uses double quotes (") not single quotes ('). Your JSON string can't seem to decide whether it's linewise JSON (but with trailing commas) or just regular JSON (but without [] with line breaks instead). I would highly recommend you fix the input.That said, this code should load the objects from your string:Keep in mind this is tailored specifically for your input. It will break if your input contains escaped linebreaks, escaped quotation chars or some such thing.And that's why it would be best you fixed the input to proper JSON. Then you could  just load the docs withorWhich is much more stable and maintainable.
