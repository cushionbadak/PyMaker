Writing the following codethen asking PyCharm to add type hint to variable  turns the variable declaration intoWhat do the  and  represent? Why does  take those type parameters?
The second and third type parameters represent the type that the generator's  takes, and the type that the generator returns. is a feature introduced way back in Python 2.5 as part of PEP 342, which extended generators to work as coroutines. In PEP 342,  becomes an expression, and  is like , but specifying a value for the  expression the generator is suspended at. (If the generator is suspended at the beginning rather than at a , a non-None value cannot be sent into it.) Looking at the example in the  docs:this generator takes floats in , and returns the rounded value of the  argument.Generator return values were introduced in Python 3.3 as part of PEP 380, as part of subgenerator delegation support. Before PEP 380, it was very awkward to divide a generator into multiple functions, in part because subgenerators had no mechanism like  to communicate results back to their caller. With PEP 380, a generator can  a value, which will be used as the value of a  expression that yields from the generator. In the  documentation example,  returns a string.
