Say I have a list [1,2,3,4,5,6], I split this into two lists A = [1,2,3] and B = [4,5,6]. How can I make a function that picks a value from either list so there is a 50% chance that it is the first item of list A and 50% chance that it is the first item from list B and so on for the rest of the numbers. The first item in the new list will be the first item from one of the two half lists if that makes sense.Then it appends the result onto a new list and reassembled.E.g. first number of the new list being 1 or 4, second number being 2 or 5, third number being 3 or 6 and appending the left over numbers onto the end of the new listsorry if I'm unclear this is for an assignment and it's a bit confusing.
You could do it like so:which produces:The part where you talk about a shuffled list I am not totally following. The created list  can be randomly shuffled however, if that is what you mean by doing:For more info and options look at Python's random module.

Use  to pick randomly from your list. Here is the doc.
