I was reading the code of byterun(a python python interpreter), and I can't understand lines below that something about closure and lambda:The function was called in The second to the last line:What's the function's purpose? And how does it work(especially with 2 lambda)?
The purpose of this  construct is to create a closure cell object, the objects Python uses to implement closure variables. The nested  uses the  variable from the outer , so Python needs to create a closure cell for the  variable. Calling the outer lambda:creates a function object for the inner  with a closure cell for the  variable holding , and the  access:accesses the function object's tuple of closure variables to retrieve and return the closure cell.
