I would like to execute a functionwhere  is a list of unix times. I would like to create a new thread that will run 'in parallel' to this code where it checks the current time. If the current time is equal to one of the object's , a new function called  will be invoked.So I would like to have a thread that is on constant alert for invoking a  function since I might have other cars coming in with their respective time to drive.
You can use  for scheduling execution of a target function in a separate thread after a specified time interval.Timer ObjectsThis class represents an action that should be run only after a certain amount of time has passed â€” a timer. Timer is a subclass of Thread and as such also functions as an example of creating custom threads.Timers are started, as with threads, by calling their start() method. The timer can be stopped (before its action has begun) by calling the cancel() method. The interval the timer will wait before executing its action may not be exactly the same as the interval specified by the user. docsExample Output:
You don't need to check the current time every now and then. You can calculate how many seconds the thread needs to wait and call .Combined with this answer, you get:It outputs:
