I'm using Python 2.7.15, Windows 7ContextI wrote a script to read and tokenize each line of a FileZilla log file (specifications here) for the IP address of the host that initiated the connection to the FileZilla server. I'm having trouble parsing the  field that follows the  character. The script I wrote uses the: construct to read each line. That for-loop stopped prematurely when it encountered a  field that contained the  and  characters. I can't show you the log file since it contains sensitive information but the crux of the problem can be reproduced by reading a textfile that contains those characters on a line. My goal is to extract the IP addresses (which I can do using ) but before that happens, I have to remove those control characters. I do this by creating a copy of the log file where the lines containing those control characters are removed. There's probably a better way, but I'm more curious why the for-loop just stops after encountering the control characters.Reproducing the IssueI reproduced the problem with this code: OutputThe code above creates 2 output files and produces the following in a console window: I step-debugged through the code in Eclipse and immediately after executing the statement, , the handle for that opened file was closed. I had expected it to move onto the third line, printing out  to console and writing it out to  but neither events happened. Instead, execution jumped to .Picture of Local Variable values in Debug Console
You have to open this file in binary mode if you know it contains non-text data:
