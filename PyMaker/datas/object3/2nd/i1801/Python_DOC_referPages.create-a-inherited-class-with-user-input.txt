I'm trying to code a product inventory project. I stumbled across this problem and have been searching since a few days but couldn't find any way to do it. How can I create a class inherited from the base class with user input.. Here is the base class:what I'm trying to achive is that user will be able to add products himself by lets say pressing 2 will ask him to enter the product type (coat) and than the parameters specific to the product which will create a new class inherited from the base class. Like this:I can create instances with user input but creating inherited classes I couldn't figure it out. I appreciate if you could help. Thanks.
While you can generate classes dynamically with the  function, you really do not want to do this here. Code generation to model user-generated data only leads to very, very difficult to manage code that looks up attributes and variable names dynamically.Use a datastructure in your existing class to store user-generated data. All you need is a dictionary:then to create a  product use:where the various values, and the key in  are not literals but variables with user input.Classes model your application, and contain the data. Don't create separate models for the data.
