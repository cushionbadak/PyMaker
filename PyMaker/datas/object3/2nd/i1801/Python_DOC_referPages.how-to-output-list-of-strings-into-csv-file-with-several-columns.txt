I'm trying to build a scraper which puts all swedish parliament members into a .csv file with several columns.I've managed to get the list of names as seen below. I'm having problems with splitting the strings into last names, first names and party, and then writing a .csv file with these three columns, how do I do that?Code:Output:
Here is a code snippet using the pandas library to write a csv. From each fellow-name span we extract the last name, first name, and party, and append the 3 strings as a list to a list. Then we cast that list of lists to a pandas dataframe and write it to csv.
With the output that you have shown, you can add this to a csv file in a loop.take a empty list and append the fields to it rather printing. see below example.Now with the list you can extract the  ,  ,  and write it to a csv file. see below example to write to csv.
As mentioned in the comment of the previous, pandas is overkill. Using csv instead, we have:What's going on in the code: we first split by comma; everything before the comma is a last name. We then split by space, and we know the last thing will be the party. Finally, what's left over is the first name.
