You get  because  is not a module.  is clear about this:target should be a string in the form 'package.module.ClassName'. The  target is imported and the specified object replaced with the new  object, so the target must be importable from the environment you are  calling patch() from. The target is imported when the decorated  function is executed, not at decoration time.This works for me when executed with  from the directory the files are in.BTW you have a couple of typos in your example, e.g. , note the missing  in .Also, try not to use : https://docs.quantifiedcode.com/python-anti-patterns/maintainability/from_module_import_all_used.html#using-wildcard-imports-from-import
