I am using the tool pydoc to automatically generate documentation. Given the function:I am curious if there is a structured way to use markdown to highlight references to function parameter labels? For example:Similar to this question Referencing parameters in a Python docstring which is about using Sphinx instead of pydoc.Also note, that I am curious about referencing the labels (not the types) of the function parameters.
There is no markdown support in Pydoc.Formatting in docstrings is limited to recognising PEP and RFC references,  attribute references and links for existing names (for other classes, methods, and functions) when rendering to HTML, so in in that mode, some names are already going to be marked up. This doesn't extend to argument names however.Pydoc does use  output as the basis for formatting the function, so if you make sure you have informative type hints, then you'll at least get to document the types of the arguments and return value.So a (rather contrived) definition using a generic  definition instead of sticking to , like:comes out in pydoc as
