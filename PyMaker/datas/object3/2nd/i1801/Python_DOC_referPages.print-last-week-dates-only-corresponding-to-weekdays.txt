I have below code:Want I want is just to print weekdays and excluding weekends. So, my desired result should be:Where can I modify my code to achieve aimed results?
Use , which:Return the day of the week as an integer, where Monday is 0 and Sunday is 6.Produces:This gives you the weekdays that fall in the last 7 days.  Or, if you want the previous 7 weekdays, consider:This version is basically the same, with the range stop changed from 7 to 10, and an added  counter.  We increment the counter when we print a date, and once we hit 7, we break the loop (otherwise we may print 8 dates, depending on the day of the week of ).Or, another way:Similar idea, we create a list of 10 previous dates called .  We then filter that list down by filtering out weekend dates.  Then, in the for loop, we only loop over the first 7 elements of the filtered list, so that we print at most 7 dates.
