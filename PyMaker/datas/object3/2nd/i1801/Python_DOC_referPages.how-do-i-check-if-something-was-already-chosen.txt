I have a question, so I want to make an app that gives you a random name from an array after inserting your name, something like this:Type your name: NicoName chosen for you is: JohnSo I made an array with some names, but I want to check if a name was already chosen for someone and if was then remove it from an array or just make it unable to roll from an array.Do u know what I mean?I don't want a situation when name from an array will be printed twice for two different typed names.How to do it?
