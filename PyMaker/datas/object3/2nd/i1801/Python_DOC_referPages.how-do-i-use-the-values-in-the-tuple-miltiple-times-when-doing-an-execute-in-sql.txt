I'm trying to use the execute function of sqlite3 to sanitize the string that I got. However, I can't do it in my case because I can't figure out how to use the values in the tuple more than one time.What I can do is this,However, I learnt that it is open for sqlinjection attacks since the input is being directly used in here. Is there a way I could still use tuples at the end of the execute function multiple times?
sqlite3 puts their sanitation front-and-center in the docs. Use the named placeholder style.https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Cursor.executeThis answer to a previous post could help you visualize the fix as well:https://stackoverflow.com/a/12184247/10553976
