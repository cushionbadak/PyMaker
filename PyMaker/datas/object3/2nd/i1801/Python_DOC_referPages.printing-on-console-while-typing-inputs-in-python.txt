I'm trying to write a chat application in Python as a school project.It should be receiving messages from a server and at the same time, it also should be able to send messages to that server. In order to do that, I created two threads: one waits for the incoming messages and the other one is takes inputs from me to send over. The problem is that it can't print the messages which are coming from the server because the other thread is always asking for input. Is there any way to make the message-receiving thread print the incoming messages while the input function asks for input? Here is the troublesome part of the code:
The basic problem is with the following two lines:There is a big difference in Python between the function object  and the result of calling that object .The  object  never gets created, much less started, because the parameter you are trying to pass in is the result of the call , but the function never returns. You have effectively entered an infinite loop at that point, always asking for user input in the main thread.Instead, you should be passing in the  function object, and using the  parameter to  to let it know that you want to pass in an extra parameter when it does get called. The same applies to :Be careful to include the comma in , or the argument won't be interpreted as a tuple. You can use a list instead if you prefer: .
