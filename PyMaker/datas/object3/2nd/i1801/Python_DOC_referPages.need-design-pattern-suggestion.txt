I need help para to beautify this code :)The method definesAction will call a Class, based on the args. There is some way to  generalizing this piece of code, taking into account that the Class's are similar.Thanks in advanceMain ClassSubClassesConfig FILE
I'm working the assumption that the switches are mutually exclusive (in which case you really want to use a mutually exclusive argument group).You want the argparser action to set the class. If your command-line switch doesn't need to take any arguments, then I'd use  here:On parsing, the above actions set  to  or  when one or the other switch is used. Give the classes a class method or an attribute to determine what configuration section to look in, do not hardcode those names anywhere else.For instance, if both classes have a  attribute, (set to  for  and  for ), then you can use that attribute in your loop creating instances:The idea is to not switch based on  attributes, you can leave this to  as it is already determining the different options for you.If both command-line switches require an additional argument, then create a custom  subclass:then use this as:Now the  argument is set to , so you can use:
