I am trying to learn some new trick with my python code using *args and **kwargs.When calling my program, I want to pass or not two optional parameters which can come in any order. Obviously if no argument are given during the call, the variable should get some default value.in my usual code I would have something like this if i know the exact place of each parameters and that all parameters must be given:but this time, since i want to be able to give any of the two parameters and in any order, i am getting stuck at how i should write it.When doing: i want to have  and   i want to have  and   i want to have  and   i want to have  and   i want to have  and last thing, is there also a way that user can call using  with all small letter and not triggering an error message?Thanks in advance for the help
