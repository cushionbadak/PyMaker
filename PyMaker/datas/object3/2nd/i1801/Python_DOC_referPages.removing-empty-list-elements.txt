I have a list of source code that is getting looked through to find matching a string and returns all matches in a list. The issue is that I get an empty list element each time no match was found.For example : ["matchone","",matchtwo"", .....]The code looks like this: Using "if name_match.findall(source_code[x]) != None:" doesnt change the outcome.On a side note. How can i go through all of the lines of the source code with this def? The range(0,30) is only a workaround. 
just one small change to the last line in your for loopto go through all of your sourcecode change  to 
Simplest without ,  as Python 3 returns an iterator from filter, so should be wrapped in a call to filter  is fastest.From Documents:filter(function, iterable) Construct an iterator from those elements  of iterable for which function returns true. iterable may be either a  sequence, a container which supports iteration, or an iterator. If  function is None, the identity function is assumed, that is, all  elements of iterable that are false are removed.Note that filter(function, iterable) is equivalent to the generator  expression (item for item in iterable if function(item)) if function  is not None and (item for item in iterable if item) if function is  None.
