I have 2 lists: For every ticker in l1 I want to find the closest element from l2 after it, so the output should beThe right way seems to be to explicitely iterate in parallel over both lists in reverse order, but I was hoping for a more "pythonic" solution..EDIT: I do want an optimal complexity solution, which (assuming the lists are sorted), I think is O(max(len(l1), len(l2))).
You could use a list comprehension in combination with  method by passing a  expression.OutputIf you want a more efficient solution you can write your own  sort algorithm.
If your lists are long, it can be worth pre-processing  in order to be able to use  to find the closest date. Then, finding the closest date to a date in  will be O(log(len(l2)) instead of O(len(l2)) with .To address your last comment, here is another solution using iterators and generators, that goes over  and only the necessary part of the start of :Some tests:
Assuming, as in your example, dates are in chronological order, you can take advantage of the fact your lists are sorted. For example, if you are happy to use a 3rd party library, you can use NumPy via , a faster version of  from the standard library:
You can sort with a key function that calculates the time deltas between the two dates.This outputs:Note that the date format string should be , for month, day and year, respectively.
