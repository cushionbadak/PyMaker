I have thousands of records in the 3 list but for simplicity, I am adding a few records. I have to write an output csv file line by line with 3 columns(List1, List2, List3) and the list information for the 3 columns. The 'DealerName' is constant for all records. I am facing trouble because there are commas in List3 which is separating the information in individual columns(different cells). The desired output file should look like thisThanks for the comments. Based on one of the comments, I made some modifications in the code and tried using the following code but it's not giving me the desired output.

Use pandas:Pandas will automatically wrap strings containing comma in a quote, which will read fine.
