The docs for  state:Combinations are emitted in lexicographic sort order. So, if the input iterable is sorted, the combination tuples will be produced in sorted order.Elements are treated as unique based on their position, not on their value. So if the input elements are unique, there will be no repeat values in each combination.[Emphasis mine]What is the exact guarantee being made here? An empirical check shows that elements are always emitted as if byWhat is the meaning of "lexicographixal order" in this case? In particular, I believe that the emphasized sentence is crucial, but I am not 100% of what the connection is. I think it means that the lexicographixal order is applied to the indices of the elements regardless of value, but I'd love to have someone confirm that.
To translate these paragraphs from computer sciencese into English:Combinations are emitted in lexicographic sort order. So, if the input iterable is sorted, the combination tuples will be produced in sorted order."Lexicographic" here is a mathematical term and does not mean alphabetically, but "in whatever order the lexicon defines".early 17th century: modern Latin, from Greek lexikon (biblion) ‘(book) of words’, from lexis ‘word’, from legein ‘speak’.The "lexicon" here being your input. Put plainly, your input defines the order in which the output will be produced. If you want alphabetically sorted output, sort your input.Elements are treated as unique based on their position, not on their value. So if the input elements are unique, there will be no repeat values in each combination.This just says that  will not look at or care about the actual values themselves, it just combines elements by their position. It won't deduplicate based on the values, it deduplicates combinations of positions. If you want unique combinations, deduplicate your input.
