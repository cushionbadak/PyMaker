I'm try to sort a list of objects based on some non-trivial comparison logic, but finding it difficult because in Python the custom sort function takes only 1 argument. In Java, for example, the sort function would have references to  and , making it straightforward to compare them.The expected sorted order should be:I don't know how to even start implementing the required logic, so I would be grateful for a push in the right direction.
You can make sorting a property of your class, then use . The benefit of this method: for no additional effort, you are able to compare objects with each other via comparison operators such as , , .Specify  and  methodsAt a minimum you should specify  and  methods:Adding other comparison methods such as , , etc, may be simplified via :Example
I would use the following  function:OutputThe key function creates a tuple to be used as key, the first element is the letter, the second element is 0 if the node is of type 'start', 1 if is of type 'end'. The last element is negative if it is of type 'start', positive if it is of type 'end'.
You want to use the  argument to  which takes a comparison function of 2 arguments:https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#sortedFor your reference, the  function would compute a derived value from each item being sorted and sort according to that value, e.g. to sort a list of pairs by the second value in the pair you could do:
