I have a setup, where I want to connect from a Windows7 VM to a Linux Server through passwordless SSH with private/public keys.The SSH connection works fine through the Cygwin terminal.With Paramiko, I can connect from my client to my host if I accept missing host keys, but if I try to use  instead, I get the error: Server XXX not found in known_hosts.Is Paramiko at all able to read the  file in Windows/Cygwin? Can I somehow provide the path?My  folder is located under .Thank you a lot for your help,Thomas
I assume you are using .By default, the methods loads  file. What does not match your  location, as on Windows  uses  environment variable, which points to .You can fix that by:Changing your Cygwin configuration somehow (but it can break other things);or creating directory junction from  to  (probably the most portable solution);or explicitly specifying  argument in a call to  (not portable);or setting  environment variable to point to  before running your Python script -  prefers  to  - and Windows does not use  (can break other things).
