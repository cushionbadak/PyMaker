Original(2018.11.01)I have 3 numpy：x、y、z,created by my laser scanner(40 degree / 1 step).I want to used them to build a 3D model.I think it must should be use  matplotlib.triBut I have no idea to decide triangulated dataHere is my data ：https://www.dropbox.com/s/d9p62kv9jcq9bwh/xyz.zip?dl=0And Original model：https://i.imgur.com/XSyONff.jpgCode：Thank so much.Update(2018.11.02)I try this way to decide triangulated dataDelaunay Triangulation of points from 2D surface in 3D with python?code:And my model looks like:https://i.stack.imgur.com/KVPHP.pnghttps://i.stack.imgur.com/LLQsQ.pnghttps://i.stack.imgur.com/HdzFm.pngEven though it has better surface on it,but there is a big hole over my model.Any idea to fixs it?
Assuming you want to reduce the complexity, i.e find triangles in your files to reduce the complexity. You may look into fitting a convex hull to your points, see here fore more info Based on the file you provided this produces a surf plot of the object.
