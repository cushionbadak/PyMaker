So, I have a variable that outputs either a 0 or 1. Now, I want to run it 10,000 times and get the average of it.So basically, I want to know what what the chance is that my dice roll returns 7. 
You can use random.choices() to create 10000 6-sided dice two times, - zip() them, sum() each tuple and feed it into collections.Counterto count it. See the dice example for code comments that explain the code a bit.Coint-toss (0,1) example for 10k tosses of 2 coins and summed value:Output:Math:You get 25% for 0, 25% for 2 and 50% for 1.6-sided dice example for 10k of 2 dice rolled and summed:Output:    Doku:collections.Counter(...)zip(...)random.choices(population, weights=None, *, cum_weights=None, k=1)sum(...)map(function,...)tuple(...)Formatting: format mini language to align the numbers in the output ( , ,  )
Well, to execute the roll 10,000 times, you could use a for loop as such:One way to find the average would be to include an if statement within said loop, such as:Hope that helps.Edit: Just realized that you have a variable named "count" as well. I'm unsure if that would interfere with the loop, so if you encounter any problems, try renaming the variable.
