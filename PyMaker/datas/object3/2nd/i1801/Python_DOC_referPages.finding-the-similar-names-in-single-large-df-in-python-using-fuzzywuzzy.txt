I tried many methods so far including Fuzzywuzzy using Now this code has two data sets and when I convert df[Name] into two and match with the above method the first one by default becomes 100% since the list is duplicate. My exact code is I am in doubt if the above is the best way to approach my problem. My end result should be all similar like companies making a group.The below answer did not help as wellfinding-similar-contact-names-within-table
You can use  to create a list of values & get ratio for each value pair with  then select rows greater than your threshold ratio.Edit: Use  to get close matches for your values.
You can also try exploring libraries like difflib and fuzzysetYou can try using it like below with your dataframes  and :Please explore fuzzy-string-comparison for more info.Let me know if this helps.
