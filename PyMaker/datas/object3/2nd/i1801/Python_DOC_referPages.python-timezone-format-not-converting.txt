With this function:I am getting this error:ValueError: time data 'Sun, 28 Oct 2018 07:33:13 -0400 (EDT)' does not  match format '%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %z (%Z)'I've looked over it a dozen times and I can't figure out what I am doing wrong.My Python Version:
There is no support for  on input for anything other than your current timezone. Only the strings in the  tuple plus  and  will ever be recognised:Since you also have the offset from UTC in the string (the  part), just remove the timezone name from your input and don't bother trying to parse it:I used  here to remove everything starting at the last space, but it depends on what kind of inputs that you have how to best remove the timezone name part in your application. Without it, the  section is not needed and you get a correct  object.When debugging  issues, you want to compartmentalise the issue. You can bisect the input and template parts to see where the issue lies, or try out the different components one by one. It could be a single directive that causes the issue, or multiple, so I usually go for single-step removing of directives until one works.
