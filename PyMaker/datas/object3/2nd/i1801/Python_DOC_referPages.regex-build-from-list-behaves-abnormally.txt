Below is my code:Output:Expected Output:So, I have a list of regexps that I want to join using OR operator. I do so expecting output to be OR joined string. To my surprise it didn't join and it removed the \b too. This happens only inside the class while accessing self. I tried directly joining outside of class which worked but I can't understand why this is not working. Could someone help me in understanding this?EDIT:
 is backspace character which is causing your pipe to be removed (just like when you press backspace). You need to bypass backspace.you can bypass it by replacing  with .
