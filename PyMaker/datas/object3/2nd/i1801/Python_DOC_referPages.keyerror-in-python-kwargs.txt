Only the first print command works. I cannot figure out why. I want to display a different prefix and suffix depending on what is passed in.
Referencing to a key that  does not have will raise an error.Also, current code seems to only select the prefix even though suffix and prefix are both provided.Looping through a  pair of the , you might want to change your code as follows.
The problem you're having is,  will NOT contain keys that are not specified. When you try to index a non-existent key of a dictionary, it will raise a ,The most straightforward solution is to check if the key exists before trying to access it:There are also better Pythonic way to do this. As mentioned,  is a decent option for a default value:This way, if  is not in the dictionary, the value will be  which evaluates to boolean false and perfectly does the trick.Of course, if you don't really need random keyword arguments, try default arguments:IMO this might be a better solution unless you're trying to learn about keyword argument packs.
The problem is you use , It will raise key error when you don't pass key parameter prefix in  calling .To fix it you can use , it will return default None when you don't pass prefix keyword paramter.
 will return the item with key  in sFox if it exist, or else raise an .Even worse,  might still not execute your code even if  does exist in , since  might store the value .I think what you're actually trying to do with this line is to test if  contains an item with key . In Python, the syntax  is used for that. Your program rewritten in it would look like this:Now to answer your other question: Only the first part ever gets executed since you  in that part, i.e., leave the function. If you want both parts to execute, you must return only after you've added your suffixes and prefixes. Here's an example:Finally, to add a bit of syntactic sugar to the mix - take a look at python default parameter values. With those you can define your function like this:
