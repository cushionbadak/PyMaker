Natural Text
I am struggling on a very simple thing.I would like to print a string with a certain format:"array" is an numpy array and include the arguments (size: (1,3)) I'd like to print. But I am getting the following error message:TypeError: only size-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalarsThis works fineBut I do have my data as an numpy array. Is there a simple way to convert the array to use the values as arguments for formatted printing pint()?
Pass to tuple:Or use the new format
the % formatter expects a tuple if there are multiple items to format into the string, this should fix it
It is not working because both are not same object.that is the first array is numpy.ndarrayand second array which works is tuple.soin order to run the first numpy.ndarray try the following linearray1 = np.array([123.456789, 1.23456, 12.3456])print("My First number is %3.4f, second %1.2f and third %2.9f" , array1[0], array1[1],array1[2])
