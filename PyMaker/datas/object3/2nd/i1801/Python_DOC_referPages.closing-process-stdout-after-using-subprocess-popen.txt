Assume using  method to run a basic Shell command -  which gives a list of files in the CWD. Your code will go something like this.Instead of multiple lines, you decide to put it in a single line and end up withI don't see where the  fits here. Is there any way I could close the stdout of this subprocess? I am using . I know about  in Python 2.7 but I have to stick to 2.6. Is there any potential security or performance issue that I might end up with if I keep opening the output PIPE streams and not closing them?
Probably you can use a with statment for auto close and write the code using oneliner. But before that some ground work can be done. Check out the below code.
