I have a dataset which is a list and its elements are again a list. For example, myList = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],.......,[7,8,9],[11,12,14]]. I want to randomly pick a bunch of elements from this list - say,[4,5,6] and [11,12,14]. How to achieve this? I tried the following:Apparently, the above code does not work. The error message is: "list indices must be integers or slices, not list"Can anyone help me with this? My actual intention is to sample data points(lists) from the original dataset(list) to create a batch of data for training an ML algorithm. 
Use  which takes an additional parameter to specify the number of random items to select from population:
You have an error in last line but still I think it's closest to what you intended ( using numpy )
You Can consider random - Random variable generators, Where as if you are looking  to pick any number of list element then as @Austin suggested use  with random but the fair choice is random.Using  would be ...While using  Note Look at The random Doc  hererandom.sample(population, k) Return a k length list of unique elements  chosen from the population sequence or set. Used for random sampling  without replacement.random.choices(population, weights=None, *, cum_weights=None, k=1)  Return a k sized list of elements chosen from the population with  replacement. If the population is empty, raises IndexError.
