I have an XML in string format that looks more or less like this:As you can see in this example, the first  is missing . What I would like to do is to find every  that is missing this  and add it manually.This is part of a bigger Python script, and I've tried using regex methods re.findall and re.search to find all missing substrings and then using re.sub to add said substring, but I couldn't make it work at all.Any help would be appreciated :)Thanks
Don't even bother with a regex solution. Since XML is a non-regular language, a regular expression solution is bound to fail (if not today then tomorrow, as soon as the XML string changes).Use a proper XML tool and search for the required tag. If it is missing, add it.You just need to make sure your input string is in a valid XML form (which means a root element and no spaces in tag names).
It can be done without regex. Use Python XML libray.Fisrt load xml from string and then look if each child element has "property4":Please note that in order to load xml from string you need valid, and well formated xml.
What I would like to do is to find every "item" that is missing this "property 4" and add it manually.  I've tried using regex methods re.findall and re.search to find all missing substrings and then using re.sub to add said substring, but I couldn't make it work at all.A fit regex for your string format is  â€” it essentially matches an  from its start up to (not including) its end tag, but only if nowhere in it the  appears. This can be incorporated in a single  call:
