The value printed by my code below iswhy did this simple math question not return 0.000037275?(.00003550 * .05)= .000001775 + .00003550 = .0000372575
This is a precision issue caused by how decimal number are stored in the memory. All numbers, integers and decimals, are stored in the form of binary (1s and 0s). Therefore, some decimals cannot be stored with 100% precision, thus messing the calculation too.In python, you can use the  and  module to make your calculation more accurate (this is the official documentation for that)
