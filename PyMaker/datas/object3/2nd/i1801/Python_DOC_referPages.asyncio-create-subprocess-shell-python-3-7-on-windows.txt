I'm trying to test some asyncio functionality on Windows. I'm using Python 3.7.This complains bitterly about some NotImplementedErrorI've tried several loop types (Protractor and Default). I've tried different functions through the shell and directly invoking the program (_shell and _exec in the subprocess lingo). Nothing seems to work. For a much hype I've read about asyncio, it can't possibly be a Linux only thing. I must be doing something wrong. Can you please point me in the right direction.The specific error I get is the following:Also, I got the same error when trying to run the notepad.
The problem is that, despite appearances, you're not actually using the .  creates a new event loop based on the current loop creation policy, which you've never changed. Creating a new loop for each run is normally a feature because it guarantees cleanup of the resources associated with the loop - but in this case it's incompatible with the example from the documentation.A quick fix is to change  to . A better fix is to set the event loop policy to one that creates the proactor loop.
