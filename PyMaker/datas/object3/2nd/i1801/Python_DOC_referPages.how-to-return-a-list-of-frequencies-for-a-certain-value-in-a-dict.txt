So I have a dict, which contains keys corresponding to a list, which contains str. I want to collect all the same values in said list and sum them together. Perhaps my explanation was confusing so I'll provide an example:How would I create this function? I was thinking of somehow making a for loop like this:I am still unsure about how to format this especially how to count the values and collect them, thanks in advance for any suggestions!
You can un-nest the dict's values and apply a .If you don't like the nested generator comprehension, the un-nesting can be done with .Without imports and with traditional loops, it would look like this:
Something like this should do the trick:
If you don't want to import any libraries you can do as follows:You check if the value is already in the created dict 'foobar'. If it is you add its value by one. If its not, then you add the value as a key and define its value as one. :)
