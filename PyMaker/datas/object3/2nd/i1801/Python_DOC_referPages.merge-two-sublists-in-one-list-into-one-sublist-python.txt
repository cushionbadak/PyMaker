You can use a recursive form of the breadth-first search:Output:This will also work on input with a greater number of overlaps:Output:
You can use  with a custom  function to create a new list:
You could “de-overlap” the list simply using this function:The only assumption here is that the input to  is a list of pairs of a comparable type (typically numbers), where each pair is a list of length 2.Pairs are sorted internally, then sorted by the first item, then merged if the max of the previous pair is ≥ the min of the current pair. If merging should not happen when they are equal, the 9th line of  should become
