I'm a novice programmer (if that!)im working on a simple project at work that will swallow a HP network switch config file and spit out a png image of the switch, with coloured ports that match the colour of the vlan associated with those portscurrently i have this working just fine in a manual fashion.I import a blank switch png filethen i specify the current colour of the switch ports for interfaces 1&2i then specify the colour of the vlan i want to assign to them.i run a command that says "if any pixels in the image match x,x,x colour then change them to the value of trunkport"then spit out that new image file with the colour changeshere's an example:this is works just fine however the end goal is to use a switch config file to make this assignments.these cfg files are full of useless text but there is one group of lines that im interested inthey look like this i wanted to ask if there was a way to search this .txt file for the string "trunk" then if it gets a hit on trunk, look at the next numbers that follow it. it sees and interprets those to be the same as then assign the value of "trunkport" to those variables.i hope that makes sense, please let me know if not. the idea behind this is that a large number of switches will share this same format of config and this program can be used to visually map out the vlan colours using just the cfg file.any help would be really appreciated!!
You can match the lines you are interested in by using the  module. If your data is in a file called  you can get it like:Now you have a list of lines that start with 'trunk'. See https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#module-re for details of how to do regex in Python. Now you can get the numbers if they are immediately after 'trunk' like this:(This could also be done with a regex as Idlehands suggests).Finally, you can add those numbers to a dict to access them
