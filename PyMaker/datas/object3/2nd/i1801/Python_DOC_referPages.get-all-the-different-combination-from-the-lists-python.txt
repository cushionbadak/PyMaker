I have the following two dictionaries:Every value of key is a preference order by the key. I am trying to accomplish with python is that how to get all the possible combinations of preference order.So one preference order will be that when you only flip the values of the key "ad" and the rest will be the same. It is listed belowOther can be when the "ad" preferences will remain the same and "bigd" preference will be different. We have to iterate through all the list in both dictionaries and find all 2^3 * 3*2 possibilities. Can someone please help me with that? 
You can get them using itertools:Output:Note that you have 2**3 * (3*2)**2 = 288 different outputs.
