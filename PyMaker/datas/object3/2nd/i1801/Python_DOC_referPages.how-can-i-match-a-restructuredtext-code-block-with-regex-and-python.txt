Natural Text
I am trying to extract a  from a  document using Python and regex. The code blocks in the document are defined by adding a  directive to the text and then indenting by a few spaces. Here is an example from my test document:So far I have this regex:The problem with this pattern is that it selects only the first part and last part of the test string. I need help in writing a pattern that can capture everything within the  code block excluding the  directive.You can see the progress I have made with this here.
If you insist on using regex, the following should do the trick, given provided example:The trick, I believe, is to use nested parenthesis and the MULTILINE or M flag.The resulting  object(s) will have 3 groups, as defined by the parenthesis:group 1: the '.. code-block:' headergroup 2: the contents of the code blockgroup 3: an empty group as a result of the extra grouping parenthesis.To retrieve group , use . Note that indexing of groups starts at  and passing  or no arguments will result in the entire matching string.
