I'm writing a simple parser for exercise and I have a problem with saving downloaded data to a dictionary.This is an example of the data that I want to parse:I want to create dictionary with "a","b","c" or any letter, as a key (I cant hard code it) with dictionary as a value that contains place where images were taken and list of images.But when I want to read my saved data I'm getting  as a value
Try to use  from python stdlib. It's very convenient in situations like this:Explanation: the first time you access  (which is a dictionary) with a not existing key, a new entry for such a key will be created. This entry is going to be again a defaultdict, but the first try you access it with a not existing key, again a new (nested this time) entry will be created. And this entry will be a . So, then you can safely append a new element to such a list.UPD: Here is a way to implement the same requirement but without :
Because  create a new 2nd layer dictionary everytime.This is a possible solution. It is the cleanest solution, but it shows step by step. It creates a new dict and list if the key is not in the last layer dict. But it append value to the list if the dict has the key.
