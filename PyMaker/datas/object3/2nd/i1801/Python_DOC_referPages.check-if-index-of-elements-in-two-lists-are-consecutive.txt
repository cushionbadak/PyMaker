If list1 is defined as and list2 is defined as The function will return True because list 2 contains  in the same order.However if list 2 was defined as ,  the sequence is  therefore it will return False.The if statement is where I am confused because I'm not sure how to check for consecutive numbers in two different lists.
Take a single item from the input list and scan forward over the second list until you have a match, then take the next item, continue forward, etc.Using iterators, taking the next value to test is simple enough. Create an iterator for  with , and then the  function gives you the next item in the list order. When that call raises  you know you have tested all the values in the first list:Demo:Note that the function also returns  if  is empty (the empty list is always an ordered subset) and  if  is not empty but  is (an empty list can never be a superset).
The following will work, based on the  method's  parameter:This iteratively looks up the elements of  in  while moving ahead the start index for the lookup appropriately until any element can't be found in the remainder of  or all are found.
get the index list for each item in the original list in the second list and check if any combination of them are in ascending order
