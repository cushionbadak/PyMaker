This is for an exercise we are doing in uni. I am trying to get all k1-9 and p1-9 strings in the txt file and change them so that each k(n) = 1*n and each p(n) = 0*n (i.e p5= 00000, k3= 111, p2= 00). I have managed to gather the k1-9 and p1-9 in a list called codes but I dont know how to proceed. Printing codes is like this.:
You could use sub:OutputExplanationThe pattern  matches a  or a  followed by any digit between  and . For the sub part let's look at the documentation:Return the string obtained by replacing the leftmost non-overlapping  occurrences of pattern in string by the replacement repl.It turns out that  can be a function, that receives a match object. In this case the  takes the second matching group (number of repetitions) cast it to int an multiplies for the first matching group, the letter k or p. Note that I used as input the example in your question joined by space.
Here is a more classic approach. I continued based on your code, and just replaced values as described in code comments.
