i'm currently using Visual Studio Code to learn how to use tkinter, i did find some tutorials on youtube to create a mouse event function here. i'm completely a newbie in programming.here's my code:i don't know why there's no output when i click somewhere inside the frame. when i click left right or middle button on mouse should return "left" "right" "middle" in output window, i did check the terminal window too and nothing was returned there. check the youtube link above for my reference of what i am doing.here's the terminal output:PS C:\Users\abdull\Documents!! Code\single file> cd 'c:\Users\abdull\Documents!! Code\single file'; ${env:PYTHONIOENCODING}='UTF-8'; ${env:PYTHONUNBUFFERED}='1'; & 'C:\Users\abdull\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32\python.exe' 'c:\Users\abdull.vscode\extensions\ms-python.python-2018.9.2\pythonFiles\experimental\ptvsd_launcher.py' '59359' 'c:\Users\abdull\Documents!! Code\single file\gtktest.py'ps: sorry for my bad grammar, (2nd language)Operating system : Windows 10mouse = logitech m331
