As best I can describe it, I have two lists of strings and I want to return all results from list A that contain any of the strings in list B. Here are details:How do I return I've been looking into list comprehensions, doing something like below but I can't seem to make it work. Am I on the right track?
You were close, use any:More detailed:Output
You can use any() to check if any element of your list  is in x:Output:
First, I would construct a  of the years for the O(1) lookup time.1Now, keep only the elements of  that end with an element of .1 If you have very small lists (two elements certainly qualify) keep the lists. Sets have O(1) lookup but the hashing still introduces overhead.
