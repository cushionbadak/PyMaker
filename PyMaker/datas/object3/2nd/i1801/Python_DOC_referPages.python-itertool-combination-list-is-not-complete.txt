I have a list with 11 elements and i need all possible tuples with a length of 4 out of it. So I found the function  in Itertools.However, it delivers only 210 tuples instead of 11^4 = 14641. I checked with the  function and many of them are missing. What can I do, or what is the problem?
 gives you tuples in sorted order, no repeats.  It sounds like you instead want :
Sure - you get all the combinations of your list (which contains 10 elements). returns all distinct unordered numbers in your list combined as 4 elements.The number of possible combinations is 10 over 4 - this is (10*9*8*7 / 4*3*2*1) - which is exactly 210.See also Combinations Calculator is maybe what you want - it returns all ordered combinations - e.g. it would yield [0 5 6 12], [5 0 6 12] whereas  would only yield [0 5 6 12] in that case. But  is also not 11^4, but 10*9*8*7 elements. Correct would be 10^4 in your case maybe - and you have to use  if you really want something like [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,5], etc.
You are looking for permutation not combination. Combinations not returning [1, 2, 3, 4] and [1, 3, 2, 4]They only return different value sets. You can use permutation as followif you want to get values like follow[1, 1, 1, 2] and [1, 1, 2, 1]You need to write  as @Patrick Haugh mentioned
