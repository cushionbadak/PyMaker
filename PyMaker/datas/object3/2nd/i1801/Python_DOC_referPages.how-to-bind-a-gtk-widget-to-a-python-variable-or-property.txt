I would like to separate my model (property) from the view (gtk widget).For example: my model has a "level" property.I would like to bind the "level" to   and to a  so that a change to the variable e.g.  will be reflected in the widgets and a change in the widgets will set the property.This is common practice in many frameworks (WPF).How to do this with python+gtk ?or is there a library for doing this binding?
Official documentation provides exhaustive answer on bindings.What you need exactly is bind_property_full method with custom function for transformation from GtkScrollbar's value (which is a number) to GtkLabel's string.
