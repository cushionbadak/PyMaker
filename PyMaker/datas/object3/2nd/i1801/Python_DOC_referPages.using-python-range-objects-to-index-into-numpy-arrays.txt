I've seen it once or twice before, but I can't seem to find any official docs on it: Using python  objects as indices in numpy.Let's trigger an index error just to confirm that ranges are not in the official range (pun intended) of legal indexing methods:Now, a slight divergence between numpy and its docs is not entirely unheard of and does not necessarily indicate that a feature is not intended (see for example here).So, does anybody know why this works at all? And if it is an intended feature what are the exact semantics / what is it good for? And are there any ND generalizations?
Not a proper answer, but too long for comment.In fact, it seems to work with about any indexable object:I think the relevant lines in NumPy's code are below this comment in :But I'm not entirely sure. For some reason, this hangs if you remove the , even though there is a , so at some point it seems to be iterating through the given object until  is raised.
Just to wrap this up (thanks to @WarrenWeckesser in the comments): This behavior is actually documented. One only has to realize that  objects are python sequences in the strict sense.So this is just a case of fancy indexing. Be warned, though, that it is very slow:
