i´m trying to make a program to find the limit of a function, however, i can´t find any effective way to ask the user to input a function, or convert any kind of user input into one, the best way i found was using:however, using this method, everytime i run into a loop, the user will be asked to input the function over and over, which in this case makes it unusable. I greetly apreciate any feedbackSorry if the post or my english is bad, i apoligize for it, i am new here and not a native english speaker, if it helps here is the complete code (with everything in french)
You can use the  function to compile the user's input into an AST object so that your  function can  the AST object instead of asking the user for input again:
