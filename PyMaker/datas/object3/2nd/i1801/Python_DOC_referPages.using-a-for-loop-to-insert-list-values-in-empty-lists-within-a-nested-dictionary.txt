I have a nested dictionary:Suppose I have a listHow would I make a for loop statement that inserts my new list into all the empty lists with the key 'gyms_visited'?the new dictionary should look like this 
Just iterate over the values of  and assign  to the key If you were to simply assign  then you will come into trouble as soon as you change any value in 
You can use a dictionary comprehension:Output:
Try this:Nested dictionary comprehension would work.Output:I actually like @aydow's solution, In addition to it, you can do it like:Or:
You can also just  the list:and as you can see here, all the lists have a different  and not referencing the same object:In terms of performance,  is O(N), where N = 3 is the length of list you want to extend. This most likely is a series of  calls, which are O(1) each. This will be the same for copying using  or , which is O(N).
