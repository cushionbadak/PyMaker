I know it can be done, but I never remember how.How can you reimport a module in python? The scenario is as follows: I import a module interactively and tinker with it, but then I face an error. I fix the error in the .py file and then I want to reimport the fixed module without quitting python. How can I do it ?
This should work:From the Python docsReload a previously imported module. The argument must be a module object, so it must have been successfully imported before. This is useful if you have edited the module source file using an external editor and want to try out the new version without leaving the Python interpreter.If running Python 3.4 and up, do , then do .Don't forget the caveats of using this method: When a module is reloaded, its dictionary (containing the module’s global variables) is retained. Redefinitions of names will override the old definitions, so this is generally not a problem. If the new version of a module does not define a name that was defined by the old version, the old definition remains.If a module imports objects from another module using , calling  for the other module does not redefine the objects imported from it — one way around this is to re-execute the from statement, another is to use  and qualified names () instead.If a module instantiates instances of a class, reloading the module that defines the class does not affect the method definitions of the instances — they continue to use the old class definition. The same is true for derived classes.
In python 3,  is no longer a built in function.If you are using python 3.4+ you should use  from the  library instead:If you are using python 3.2 or 3.3 you should:instead. See http://docs.python.org/3.0/library/imp.html#imp.reloadIf you are using , definitely consider using the  extension:
Actually, in Python 3 the module  is marked as DEPRECATED. Well, at least that's true for 3.4.Instead the  function from the  module should be used:https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.reloadBut be aware that this library had some API-changes with the last two minor versions.
