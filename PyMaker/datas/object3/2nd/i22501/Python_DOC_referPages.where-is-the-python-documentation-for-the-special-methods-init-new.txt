Where is a complete list of the special double-underscore/dunder methods that can be used in classes? (e.g., , , , )
Please take a look at the special method names section in the Python language reference.
Dive Into Python has an excellent appendix for them.
Here is a complete reference of all the Python magic methods.
If, like me, you want a plain, unadorned list, here it is.  I compiled it based on the Python documentation link from the accepted answer.
See Python Quick reference
Do this if you prefer reading documentation from a CLI instead of the browser. 
For somebody who is relatively new to Python, and for whom the documentation is often not quite accessible enough (like myself): somebody wrote a nice introduction with lots of examples on how the special (magic) methods work, how to use them, etc.
Familiarize yourself with the dir function.
Python's double underscore ("dunder") methods are also known as datamodel methods because they are at the core of Python's data model, providing a protocol for  customizing (overloading) built-in methods. This is the reason why they are listed in the "Data Model" section of the Python's documentation.
