I've written a buffer class that provides a File-like interface with , , , ,  methods to a simple string in memory. Of course it is incomplete (e.g. I didn't write ). It's purpose is to be filled by a background thread from some external data source, but let a user treat it like a file. I'd expect it to contain a relatively small amount of data (maybe 50K max)Is there a better way to do this instead of writing it from scratch?
You can use the standard Python modules  or  to obtain an in-memory buffer which implements the file interface. is implemented in C, and will be faster, so you should use that version if possible.If you're using Python 3 you should use the  instead of  and  instead of .
I think you might be looking for .
