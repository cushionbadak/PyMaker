I was just pleasantly surprised to came across the documentation of Python's compiler package, but noticed that it's gone in Python 3.0, without any clear replacement or explanation.I can't seem to find any discussion on python-dev about how this decision was made - does anyone have any insight inot this decision?
I believe the functionality is now built in:compileast
To provide specific references to the decision trail:https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-3000/2007-May/007577.htmlPEP 3108And, for what it's worth, I started Python3 port of the compiler package, to be maintained outside of the stdlib:https://github.com/pfalcon/python-compilerhttps://pypi.org/project/python-compiler/
For what it's worth, I started a port of the  package to Python3: https://github.com/pfalcon/python-compiler . At the time of writing, it generates bytecode compatible with CPython3.5, and can compiler entire standard library of that version.
