I am using the built-in module to insert a few instances, so they can be accessed globally for debugging purposes. The problem with the  module is that it is a module in a main script and is a dict in modules, but as my script depending on cases can be a main script or a module, I have to do this:Is there a workaround, shorter than this? More importantly, why does  behave this way?Here is a script to see this. Create a module a.py:Create a module b.py:Now run python a.py:
I think you want the  module (note the singular).See the docs:27.3.  — Built-in objectsCPython implementation detail: Most modules have the name  (note the ) made available as part of their globals. The value of  is normally either this module or the value of this modules’s [sic]  attribute. Since this is an implementation detail, it may not be used by alternate implementations of Python.
