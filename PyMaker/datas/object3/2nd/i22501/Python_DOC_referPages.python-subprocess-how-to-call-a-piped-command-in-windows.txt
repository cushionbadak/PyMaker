How do I run this command with subprocess?I tried:but got:Things I've noticed:Running the command on the windowsconsole works fine. If I remove theECHO bosco| part, it runs fine thethe popen call above.  So I thinkthis problem is related to echo or|.
First and foremost, you don't actually need a pipe; you are just sending input. You can use subprocess.communicate for that.Secondly, don't specify the command as a string; that's messy as soon as filenames with spaces are involved.Thirdly, if you really wanted to execute a piped command, just call the shell. On Windows, I believe it's .Finally, single back slashes can be dangerous:  is , but  is a new line. Use os.path.join() or os.sep or, if specified outside python, just a forward slash.
You were right, the ECHO is the problem. Without the shell=True option the ECHO command cannot be found.This fails with the error you saw:This passes: prints Ni and a 0
