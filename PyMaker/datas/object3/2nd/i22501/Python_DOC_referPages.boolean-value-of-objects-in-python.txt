As we know, Python has boolean values for objects: If a class has a  method, every instance of it for which  happens to return 0 will be evaluated as a boolean  (for example, the empty list).In fact, every iterable, empty custom object is evaluated as  if it appears in boolean expression.Now suppose I have a class  with attribute . How can I define its truth value, so that, say, it will be evaluated to  and  otherwise?For example:so,  should print .
Refer to the Python docs for .
In Python < 3.0 :You have to use  to achieve what you want. It's a method that is called automatically by Python when evaluating an object in a boolean context. It must return a boolean that will be used as the value to evaluate.E.G :In Python => 3.0 :Same thing, except the method has been renamed to the much more obvious .
