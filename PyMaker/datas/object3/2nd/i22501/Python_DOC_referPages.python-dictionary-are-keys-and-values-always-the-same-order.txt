It looks like the lists returned by  and  methods of a dictionary are always a 1-to-1 mapping (assuming the dictionary is not altered between calling the 2 methods).For example:If you do not alter the dictionary between calling  and calling , is it wrong to assume the above for-loop will always print True?  I could not find any documentation confirming this.
Found this:If , , ,  , , and   are called with no  intervening modifications to the  dictionary, the lists will directly  correspond.On 2.x documentation and 3.x documentation.
Yes, what you observed is indeed a guaranteed property -- keys(), values() and items() return lists in congruent order if the dict is not altered.  iterkeys() &c also iterate in the same order as the corresponding lists.
Yes it is guaranteed in python 2.x:If keys, values and items views are iterated over with no  intervening  modifications to the dictionary, the order of  items will directly  correspond.
According to http://docs.python.org/dev/py3k/library/stdtypes.html#dictionary-view-objects , the keys(), values() and items() methods of a dict will return corresponding iterators whose orders correspond. However, I am unable to find a reference to the official documentation for python 2.x for the same thing.So as far as I can tell, the answer is yes, but only in python 3.0+
For what it's worth, some heavy used production code I have written is based on this assumption and I never had a problem with it. I know that doesn't make it true though :-)If you don't want to take the risk I would use iteritems() if you can.
Good references to the docs. Here's how you can guarantee the order regardless of the documentation / implementation:
Yes. Starting with CPython 3.6, dictionaries return items in the order you inserted them. The documentation hasn't been updated yet, ignore the part that says this is an implementation detail. This is already guaranteed in CPython 3.6 and will be required for all other Python implementations starting with Python 3.7. 
I wasn't satisfied with these answers since I wanted to ensure the exported values had the same ordering even when using different dicts.Here you specify the key order upfront, the returned values will always have the same order even if the dict changes, or you use a different dict.
