Natural Text
I'm running the python code below which evaluates mean of an array:From the matlab script below, it can be seen output return to y. I want to catch this output from python.The solution must be applicable to the other matlab function. The 'mean' function is just an example. 
Use  to write needed text into . Just add an extra argument  in the beginning. A few things to note: Changed the Python command to , which allows  piping. In Matlab command, use  to write wanted info into . This can separate code ouput from Matlab's header lines. Back into Python, use  to catch  output. The exception  handles exit event of Matlab ( is closed). EDIT: for a function that gives multiple outputssay a Matlab function isThe point is use  to throw the output, while doing all other things as you always do normally in Matlab. Method 1 - in-line scriptMethod 2 - standalone scriptFirst create a new  scriptNote that  is to be assigned when calling from Python; scripts share the same stack. (Remember NOT to  the workspace in the caller script. )Then, call the script from PythonStoring Matlab result in a Python variableWhen passing data through  /  pipe: Refer to this and . When handling serious data like  or binary: Write the data into an external file with Matlab. Then read this file with Python. A protocol with which both side talk with each other should be defined.
