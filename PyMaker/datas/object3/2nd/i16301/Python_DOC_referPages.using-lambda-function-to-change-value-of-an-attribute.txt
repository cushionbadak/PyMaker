Can I use lambda function to loop over a list of class objects and change value of an attribute (for all objects or for the one that meet a certain condition)?
Unfortunately, that’s not possible since the body of a lambda only allows for simple expressions while a  is a statement. So you can’t use a lambda there. You could however still use the map solution:Note that  will contain the same students as  though, so you don’t really need to capture the output (or return something from ). Also note that in Python 3,  returns a generator which you need to iterate on first. You can call  on it to do that: .Finally, a better solution for this would be to use a simple loop. That way, you don’t have overhead of needing a function or create a duplicate students list, and you would also make the intention very clear:
Lambda functions can only contain expressions, not statements.  Assignment in Python is a statement.  Lambdas cannot do assignments.  Additionally, assignment statements do not evaluate to their values, so your map would not produce a list of students.You want this:This does not give you a new list, it modifies the old list, but your old list would be modified anyway, you aren't doing anything to produce new Students.
You can use , which will apply the change to the objects. A big plus is that you can continue using the same list.From the docs:The function assigns the value to the attribute, provided the object allows it. For example,  is equivalent to .The equivalency of which is:If you really want a new list:The above approach doesn't return a new list; instead returning  (the return value of ). Adding an  comparison with the object you want in the array (in this case ) will amend that, though.The comparison is equivalent to  which will always yield the latter. Also note that the new list is identical to the old one.
Using a simple for-loop to retrieve the  to update the  for each is good enough like others said, but if you still want to use a  to update the values, you may need to leverage the  function:Output:In this case, what actually does the updating is the , and the  just yields . So the returned result makes no sense and I put a  to clarify this. A more concise form would be this:Besides, if only considering what you want to do, you don't need to use a  at all (probably more confusing though):Furthermore, a  can be discarded either:As you can see, no "trick" codes above seem more concise than what other answers post:So maybe the so-called "one-liner" is useful just when it comes to having fun... :)  
Q:  "Can I use lambda function to loop over a list of class objects and change value of an attribute"A: Yes....but you shouldn't.  It's poor coding style, inefficient, and only appropriate for things like code golfYou should write it like the other two answers have suggested....but if you really wanted to...Prints: ...or even:[Same output]
