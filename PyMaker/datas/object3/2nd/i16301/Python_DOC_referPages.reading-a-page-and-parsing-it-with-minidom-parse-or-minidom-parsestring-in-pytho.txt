The reason you're getting this error is that the page isn't valid XML. It's HTML 5. The  right at the top tells you this, even if you ignore the content type. You can't parse HTML with an XML parser.*If you want to stick with what's in the stdlib, you can use  (Python 3.x) /  (2.x).** However, you may want to consider third-party libraries like  (which, despite the name, can parse HTML), , or  (which wraps up a lower-level parser in a really nice interface).* Well, unless it's XHTML, or the XML output of HTML5, but that's not the case here.** Do not use  unless you're using an old version of Python without a working . This module is deprecated for a reason.
