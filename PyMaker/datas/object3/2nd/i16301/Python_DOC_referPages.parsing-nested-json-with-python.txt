After submitting a request I have received the following json back:I captured the response in variable j , and am trying to parse it:What am I doing wrong?
You've got a JSON string representation of a dictionary. But you're trying to use that string as a dictionary. That won't work; you need to parse it first, using the  module:(There are libraries that can wrap up the whole "send a request, get a response, pull the body out of the response, make sure the content-type is right for JSON, parse it, raise an exception if anything goes wrong" for you. But if you're not using one, you can't skip any of the steps.)
