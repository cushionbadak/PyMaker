Same question as this, but for python. If I have a listI would like to print it something like the default output of the ls command in bash, something likeThe goal being maximization of visually parsable data on the screen at one time. I can only find the pprint library, which for simple lists either prints as default or one per line. Does something like this exist already?
Thank you everyone for your thoughts and for clarifying that there indeed is no extant solution for this. I coded up exactly what I wanted, code below. In a terminal with a width of 80 charactersprinted asA look at the code shows there is obviously some overhead figuring out how to size the columns, with more entries and wider terminals requiring more calculation, but moving the number of entries up from 8 to 50000 didn't have much lag time, so I think I'm happy with it.This code relies on the get_terminal_size function here.
Now you should be able to use , or , or other tools to get the formatting however you want.But if you want to do it manually, it's not too hard to do anything you want. For example:So:This still won't give you exactly what  does; for example,  has some heuristics that try to make sure that filenames that are "too long" don't count toward the max width, and instead span multiple columns. If you really want to do everything exactly the same as , you probably need to look at the source code and translate from C to Pythonâ€¦Also, take a look at . Whenever a module's documentation starts off with a link to the source code, that means the module was meant to serve as useful sample code, as well as to be useful on its own. So, if you want to look at the rules it uses to determine when to split lines (based on the  flag as well as the widths), you should be able to figure it out from there.
