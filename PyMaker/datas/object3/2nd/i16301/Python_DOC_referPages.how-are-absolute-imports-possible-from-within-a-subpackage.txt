There's something that's bothering me about imports in packages.Imagine I have the following directory structure:Inside mod1.py I have the following code to import mod2.py:I have a main.py file in the directory containing pack that imports pack/sub1/mod1.pyHow does mod1.py have access to pack? pack is not in the same directory as mod1.py. Does python automatically add the topmost package to sys.path?
You can investigate this by inspecting  in an interactive interpreter. What you'll find is that the first element of it is the location of the script the interpreter was told to run. This means that when you run your script at the top level (the location of the  package), that location is added to  automatically. It doesn't have anything to do with the actual package structure, so if you ran  as a script you would have things break (this is probably why you put your script at the top level!).Note that in Python 2, you also have the issue of implicit relative imports, which doesn't impact the issue you're asking about, but might come up if you had a few more modules involved. If you added  to , you could import it from  with just , with the  prefix being figured out implicitly. This implicit behavior is generally considered a bad thing, and in Python 3 such implicit relative imports are not allowed (you can also disable them in Python 2 with ). To import  from  you'd need to either name it in full, or use an explicit relative import: To tie this relative import business back to your question, if you wanted to avoid relying on  being part of  (or, more realistically, protect against changes to 's name), you could modify your import of  from  to be an explicit relative import. Just use .
