I'm trying to learn python and wanted to attempt having multiple classes interact with each other. I want to store a string from class A in a variable of class b. I have been trying to use *args because I call the class other times without arguments. I cant seem to figure it out. I keep coming up with dead ends.Here is my codeCan anyone tell me why Storage() is not seeing my argument?Sorry for the code length. I probably should have made an example.
It looks like you are confusing classes with object instances. By the way, when you call main() from  within main(), it's a recursion not a return.
