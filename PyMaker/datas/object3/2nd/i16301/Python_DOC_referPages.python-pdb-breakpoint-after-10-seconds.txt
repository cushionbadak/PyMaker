On some occasions, my python program won't response because there seems to be a deadlock. Since I have no idea where this deadlock happens, I'd like to set a breakpoint or dump the stack of all threads after 10 seconds in order to learn what my program is waiting for. 
Use the  module and put e.g.  calls in strategic places through your program. You can disable these messages by one single setting () if you want to. And you can choose if you want to write them to e.g. stderr or to a file.
And then ctrl-c at your leisure. The  will cause pdb to drop into debugger prompt.
Well, as it turns out, it was because my database was locked (a connection wasn't closed) and when the tests were tearing down (and the database schema was being erased so that the database is clean for the next tests), psycopg2 just ignored the KeyboardInterrupt exception.I solved me problem using the faulthandler module (for earlier versions, there is a pypi repo). Fault handler allows me to dump the stack trace to any file (including sys.stderr) after a period of time (repeatingly) using . That allowed me to set the breakpoint where my program stopped responding and tackle the issue down effectively.
