I am trying to write in some URL into a sqlite database. I have gotten this to work without the URL. It even works if I replaces the  'Volumes/data/rc3/2/sdss/SDSS_r_0_0.fits' with a number .It seems like it is mistakening the URL as a column as it is throwing the error: but I am not sure what to do. Thanks in advance.
Never try to create SQL statements by embedding the values with string formatting commands. Instead, use SQL parameters.Instead of this:â€¦ do this:This is explained at the very top of the  documentation. But briefly, the reasons to do things this way are (in rough order of importance):Avoids SQL injection if any of the data may come from malicious or incompetent users or external programs.Means you don't have to worry about how to quote/escape strings, format numbers, etc.Makes errors from inappropriate value types clearer and easier to debug.Allows the SQL engine to see your 1000 separate inserts as the exact same statement with different values, instead of 1000 completely different statements, making it more likely it can cache or otherwise optimize.Allows you to use , which can be more readable than a loop, and also may give the SQL engine more optimization opportunities.In your case, it's the second one you were running into. You're trying to use the string  as a value. That's an expression, asking sqlite to divide the  column by the  column, divide that by , etc. If you wanted the string to be stored as a string, you need to put it in quotes.But, again, don't try to fix this by adding quotes; just use parameters.
