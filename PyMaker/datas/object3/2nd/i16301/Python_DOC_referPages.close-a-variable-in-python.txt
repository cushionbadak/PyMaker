This question already has an answer here:How to safely open/close files in python 2.4                    4 answers                I have the following code:And in one of the exercises in my book it says "Have your script also do a  on the  and  variables. Itâ€™s important to close files when you are done with them.How can I close the variables?
 will close the file parser.  However I would suggest the use of  instead:This ensures that the file parser is closed correctly and also make for cleaner more pythonic code.
Do  and  after their respective print statements.EDIT: As others have already pointed out, using the  statement is a much better option.
Your book text is being unclear and imprecise. What they want you to do is call the  method on the file objects:andA better idea would be to use the  statement to have Python close files for you automatically; file objects are context managers:The  statement tells the file object that a block begins (entering the context), and when the indented section ends the statement informs the file object the block has completed (exiting the context). A file object automatically closes itself at that point. 
Use .It's also worth noting that you are not closing a varibale, but rather a handle on the file.
