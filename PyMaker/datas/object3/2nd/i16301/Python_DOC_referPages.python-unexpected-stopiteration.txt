This is my codethat produces the  error, caused by . Why?The documentation says that  function does not raise the  if the default value is provided, and I expected it to get me the first item from the generator (the  instance) and set the  attribute to .
Because  only yields a single value, you can only call  on it once.The right hand side of your expression () is evaluated before the left hand side, and thus exhausts the generator.Calling  on the left hand side will then raise .
Your  generator function yields just one value. After that it is exhausted and raises .That's because there is no loop in  to yield more than once, a generator function does not, on its own, loop, just because you can use it in a loop.Note that for an assignment, Python executes the right-hand-side expression first, before figuring out what to assign it to. So the  is called first, the  for the assignment is called second.The body of the  function is executed just like any other Python function, with the addition of pausing.  on the generator un-pauses the code, and the code then runs until the next  statement is executed. That statement then pauses the generator again. If the function instead ends (returns),  is raised.In your  generator that means:when you call  a new generator object is created. The function body is paused.you call  on it the first time. The code starts running, creates an instance of  and yields that instance. The function is paused again.you call  on it a second time. The code starts running, reaches the end of the function, and returns.  is raised.If you add a loop to , or simply add a second  line, your code works:or
