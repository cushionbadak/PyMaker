I'm using Python 3, and the peek() method for buffered file I/O doesn't seem to work as documented. For example, the following code illustrates the problem -- it prints 8192 as the length of the byte string returned by :I sometimes want to peek at the next byte without moving the file pointer, but since the above doesn't work I'm doing something this in those places instead:That works, but feels like a kludge. Am I misunderstanding something about how peek() works?
From the Python docs:peek([size])Return bytes from the stream without advancing the position. At most one single read on the raw stream is done to satisfy the call. The number of bytes returned may be less or more than requested.Emphasis mine.Since the file pointer isn't moved in , it doesn't really matter if  reads more than the amount you want. Just take a substring after you peek:
