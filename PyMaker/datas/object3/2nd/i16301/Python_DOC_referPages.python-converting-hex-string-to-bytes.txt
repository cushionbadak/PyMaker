I'm trying to make byte frame which I will send via UDP. I have class Frame which has attributes sync, frameSize, data, checksum etc. I'm using hex strings for value representation. Like this:Now, I need to concatenate this hex values together and convert them to byte array like this?!But when I print converted value I don't get the same values or I don't know to read python notation correctly:So, first word is converted ok (AA01 -> \xaa\x01) but (0034 -> \x004D) it's not the same. I tried to use bytearray.fromhex because I can use spaces between bytes but I got same result. Can you help me to send same hex words via UDP?
Python displays any byte that can represent a printable ASCII character as that character.  is the same as , but as it opted to print the ASCII character in the representation.So  is really the same as ,  is the same as , and  is the same as , because:This is just the representation of the bytes value; the value is entirely correct and you don't need to do anything else.If it helps, you can visualise the  values as hex again using :and you'll see that , ,  and  are once again represented by the correct hexadecimal characters.
