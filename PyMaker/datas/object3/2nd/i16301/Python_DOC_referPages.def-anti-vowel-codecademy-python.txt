Natural Text
I am a bit stuck on creating the anti_vowel definition:Define a function called anti_vowel that takes one string, text, as input and returns the text with all of the vowels removedThis is my attempt:My code returns the input as separate characters.This is the error I get:Could someone please point me in the right direction?
Consider:Or, as pointed out in comments, using an actual list comprehension inside join is better:
will make it back into a string from a list.
You're returning the list. Using join function you can convert the list to corresponding string.Try:instead of 
You're looking for str.join which takes an iterable (like a list) as an argument and returns the string formed by using the object as a separator between each element of that iterable. For example:Note that there are better ways to implement your function. (use THIS  in Python2, which iirc is what Codecademy uses for their interpreter, it's changed between versions) is BORN to delete characters from strings.And using your method, there's even an incremental improvement to be made. Any time you bothDon't need to keep something in order andDon't need to have more than one of somethingYou should strongly consider using a  instead of a . The  takes slightly longer to build for the first time, but lookups are MUCH faster. Remember that if you unroll that list comp you have:As you can see that's a LOT of lookups to that list. Instead use a set, whose lookup time is BLINDINGLY fast. Either use the literal declaration:or you can create one from any iterable by calling  with the iter as an argument
This is my solution:
This is my solution:
another simple way to solve this problem...
