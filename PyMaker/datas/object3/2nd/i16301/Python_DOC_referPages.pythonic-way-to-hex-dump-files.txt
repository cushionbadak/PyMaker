my question is simple:Is there any way to code in a pythonic way that bash command?Obviously, without using os, popen, or any shortcut ;)EDIT: although I've not explicitly specified, it would be great if the code was functional in Python3.xThanks!
If you only care about Python 2.x,  will encode a chunk of binary data into hex. So:(IIRC,  by default prints 32 pairs of hex per line; if not, just change that  to  or whatever it isâ€¦)If the two-argument  looks baffling, click the help link; it's not too complicated once you get the idea.If you care about Python 3.x,  only works for codecs that convert Unicode strings to bytes; any codecs that convert the other way around (or any other combination), you have to use  to do it explicitly:Or it may be better to use :If you want to do something besides print them out, rather than read the whole file into memory, you probably want to make an iterator. You could just put this in a function and change that  to a , and that function returns exactly the iterator you want. Or use a genexpr or  call:
The standard library is your friend.  Try binascii.hexlify().
Simply  the whole file and . What could be more pythonic?
