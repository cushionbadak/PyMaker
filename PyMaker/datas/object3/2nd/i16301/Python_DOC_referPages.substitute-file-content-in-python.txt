Natural Text
This question already has an answer here:Confused by python file mode “w+”                    6 answers                I imagine this is a question asked already twenty thousand times, but I cannot understand why the file is always empty. I want to open a file, remove a string from the whole file and then rewrite the content, but the file ends up being empty. This is the code I use:But the file is always empty. If I instead use "r+" then the content is appended and I have a duplicate text in the file. I'm using Python 3.3 . What am I missing?
Opening the file in  mode truncates the file. So, your  is guaranteed to return nothing.You can do this by opening the file in  mode, reading it, then calling , then writing. Or by opening the file in  mode, reading it, closing it, reopening it in  mode, and writing. Or, better, by writing a temporary file and moving it over the original (which gives you "atomic" behavior—no possibility of ending up with a half-written file).
