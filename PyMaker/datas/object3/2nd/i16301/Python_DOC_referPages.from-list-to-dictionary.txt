One thing I do not understand is why ? If a  is not in  , shouldn't that  since it is the first time for that company to appear?  
If a company is not in  company_to_placements, shouldn't that company_to_placements[company] = [1] since it is the first time for that company to appear?No, because you are explicitly adding the company in the next line. However, you cannot use the  method yet if there is not yet a list in the dictionary for a given key:Because there is no  key at first, trying to use that key to retrieve a list and call  on that list object fails; a  is thrown.The  test simply creates the initial empty list, the next line then adds the integer to the list.The code could be simplified to:using the  method to add an empty list to the dictionary if the  key is not yet present.Another option would be to use  object to materialise a new list every time you try and access a key that isn't yet present:
