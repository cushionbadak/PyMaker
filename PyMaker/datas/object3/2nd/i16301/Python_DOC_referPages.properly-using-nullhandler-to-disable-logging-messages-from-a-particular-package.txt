I want to stop an external module to flood my logging file, like in this question:Disable logging for a particular packageThe config file inspired by the answer is below. I use python3.2My problem is, it does not work: the line 'handlers=nullHandler' raises this:And I find no way to use this nullHandler.The config file is:Other attempts that failed: tried without defining a [handler_nullHandler], using either nullHandler or NullHandler as formatter, it always fails the same way.Note that if I disable the RPIO_logger (by removing RPIO from the [loggers] keys sections), then the rest works fine.So, what's the proper way to use the nullHandler?
In your  section, you only list . So, when you read in that config, it builds a  dictionary with only . So, when you try to use , you get a , because it's not in the dictionary.I'm guessing this was a simple typo, but if not, see Configuration file format in the docs:The file must contain sections called [loggers], [handlers] and [formatters] which identify by name the entities of each type which are defined in the file. For each such entity, there is a separate section which identifies how that entity is configured.In other words, just having a  section doesn't create a handler named ; having  in the  section does that.
