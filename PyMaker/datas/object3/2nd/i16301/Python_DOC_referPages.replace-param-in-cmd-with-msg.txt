How would I replace all {x} in the command data with their respective values from msg?I have a regex for this in Perl that does the trick but will that work with Python?Output
If the commands are as simple as you show them, then use .Just split the parameter string into a list and feed  with it.If  might have an additional parameter then create a new message string. Strip the command from the message () and prepend it with a dummy command.
