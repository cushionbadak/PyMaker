I have a loop reading from a com port...How can I perform the above pseudo code in the comments above? Is it even possible?
ser.read() will return the next byte read.Examples :
One way could be using , but you'd have to write some initialization code around it, e.g. creating a window. Should not be overly hard, though.Under MS Windows, you can use msvcrt.getch() to read the character; don't forget to check msvcrt.kbhit() if you don't want to block on reading.
