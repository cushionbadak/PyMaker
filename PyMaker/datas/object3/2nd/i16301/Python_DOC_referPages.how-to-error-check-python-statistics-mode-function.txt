There is a question similar to this existing but does not quite fit my situation.  I'm using Python 3.4 and want to use the mode function of the statistics module, however when there is not a mode python terminates program and gives me an error.  Is there an if statement I could write to check if there are duplicates in my list, and if not display a print message before the mode function begins, and prevent the mode function from running?So far I have:I am a beginner so it's a bit hard to convey my problem properly, please excuse incorrect terminology.
Check with a set:     If you have dups the length of the set will be shorter than the length of your list.Set cannot have duplicate items:
According to the documentation, . Thus, simply having duplicates in the list will not ensure that there is a mode. A preferred solution would be to use the exception mechanism, e.g.:
A common coding style in Python is that it's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission. You should use a try-except block:A few other notes:In Python, common style is to use  rather than  for variables, though  is commonly used for classes.Just as in Java and other languages, typically variables are  while classes are . 
If more than one item is duplicated the same number of times, the  check will not suffice.
