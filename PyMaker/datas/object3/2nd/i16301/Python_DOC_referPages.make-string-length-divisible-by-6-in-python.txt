I want the program to take a users input and format its length so it is divisible by six, by adding the characters of the string onto the end of the string, until :Examples (using numbers as a stand in for whatever character could be situated at that point): I am getting stuff like this:
Using a while loop as in your example:
You could try something like this (code written/tested in Python 3.4):Results:
Here is a solution based on pre-computing the length that is needed to pad up to the next multiple of 6.
This just called for the use of itertools.
The following might be quicker. Just precompute the length necessary to pad up to next multiple of 6.
One problem is that in the first while loop, you are simply concatenating the string with itself. Instead concatenated the original string with the number of characters from the other string required to make a string divisible by 6.Here is some pseudocode below:
