This question already has an answer here:What is the Python equivalent of `set -x` in shell?                    3 answers                I'd like to run my python script in such a way that every line is printed as it is executed (for debugging purposes), like how you can add  to a bash script. Is this possible? If not, what other strategies are there for debugging python that don't involve adding log lines everywhere? I usually use pdb but this isn't always suitable for time sensitive applications eg networking.
Use the  module.
