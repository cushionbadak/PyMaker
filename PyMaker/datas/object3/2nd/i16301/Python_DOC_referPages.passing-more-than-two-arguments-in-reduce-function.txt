I am aware that Python reduce only accepts a function with two arguments. However, is there a way to make more than two arguments available to the function? I don't want to make it a global variable because that would be visible for all other imports. The following snippet might help describing the problem (Please read the comments in the snippets):Please provide some insight into this kind of problem.
I think what you're looking for is partial function application, which you can do using functools.Example:
Strictly speaking, the function passed to reduce will always be called with two arguments. However, these types of functions will often access variables in an outer scope. Since I'm unclear on your exact problem, let's implement  in terms of :Also, Chris Martin's solution involving  is perfectly correct as well. Applying it to the above would look like this:
You could as well just use a lambda:
