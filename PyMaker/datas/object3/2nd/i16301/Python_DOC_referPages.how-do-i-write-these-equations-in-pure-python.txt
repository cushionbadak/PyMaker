Given these example equations with all but the word degrees in broken python: degrees  degrees and degrees  degrees How can I can I write these in functional python to get the correct values for L and lamtha?
 requires that you pass radians to it when you call it. If you pass your input as degrees, you will not get the correct result - convert to radians before you call .The return value of  won't be in degrees or radians - it's just a ratio, so there's nothing to convert there.
It's necessary to convert all degrees where degrees are called for into into radians when operating on them or along with  and similar functions that require radians as an argument. Finally, if I need to, I can convert the resulting lamtha into degrees with .
