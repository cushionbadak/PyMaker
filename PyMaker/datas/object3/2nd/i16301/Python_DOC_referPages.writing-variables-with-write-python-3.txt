Natural Text
I am trying to write a string + datetime to a text file with Python. I'm trying to make a basic logger, that will log the datetime in a format of; "Full weekday, day number, Full month name, full year, 12 hour format, minute, second, AM/PM, UTC". I read that file.write() can only take strings and not integers or dates etc. So how would I would I make this work to be written to the text file?EDIT: not quite sure why but I read on one post that f.seek(0) did something and it worked for them. lol. I just left it in there. Sorry.
You can format your data into a string; with string formatting, for example:You can also make use of 's ability to convert all arguments to a string and automatic newlines, and have it write to the file:If you can avoid it, don't reinvent the logging wheel and use the  module. It can be configured to take a different date format:
