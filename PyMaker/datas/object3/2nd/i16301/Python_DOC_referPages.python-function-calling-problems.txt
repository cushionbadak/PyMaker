Natural Text
I just started learning python 2 days ago and Im trying to make some kind of text based adventure to practice , the only problem Im having is with functions:The idea behind this is to call the menu function , which gives a value equal to user's input , which gets fed into the action function when the latter is called and does something depending on the user choice.Cant tell what im doing wrong though , as the code doesnt seem to work. Thanks in advance
It looks like you are using Python 3.x.  In that version,  returns a string object like  did in Python 2.x.  This means that the return value of the function  will always be a string.Because of this, you need to compare  with strings rather than integers:I also changed the second  to  since  could never equal both  and .
You're calling  function twice. The first time it gets called choice is not passed to And the value returned from  is a string so you should compare strings in  instead of comparing  with integers
 is a string and you are comparing  where  is
