Ansi to UTF-8 using python causing errorI tried the answer there to convert ansi to utf-8.But I got "TypeError: 'encoding' is an invalid keyword argument for this function"I tried with, too, and got same error.Then I triedand still got the same error. Also I tried with cp1252, too, but got the same error. I learned from several stackoverflow questions that is frequently arising error message in python 2.xBut mainly answerers were suggesting using python 3 in some way or the other.Is it really impossible to convert ansi txt to utf-8 txt in python 2.x ? (I use 2.7)
For Python2.7, Use  in both locations.The above program runs without errors on my PC.
This is how you can convert ansi to utf-8 in Python 2 (you just use normal file objects):
TypeError: 'encoding' is an invalid keyword argument for this functionUse io, it will work in both 2.7 and 3.6 python version
I had the same issue when I did try to write bytes to file.So my point is, bytes are already encoded. So when you use encoding keyword this leads to an error.
