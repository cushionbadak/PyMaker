I'm trying to write a program in python that uses commands and files that are os dependent and I don't have access to a mac. What is the exact system name for the  command?Better yet what is the  answer. I have windows which of course is 'windows' and I have Linux which in my case is 'Linux' but what is mac? So right now I need the output for os.name() and platform.system(). Preferably a more recent version of OS X like either mountain lion or Maverick. 
The platform name for all OS X releases is : uses , and you can look up responses on the uname Wikipedia page.
