I have the following xml file I want to write python 3 code using ElementTree to get all country names. So the end result should be a  or  of ['Liechtenstein','Singapore','Panama']I am trying to do this using Xpath but getting nowhere. So my code is as followsHowever the above does not work as I feel my xpath is wrong.
