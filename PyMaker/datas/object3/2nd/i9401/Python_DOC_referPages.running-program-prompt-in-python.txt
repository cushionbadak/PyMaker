I would like to know how I can use command prompt in python. Here is the thing, I need to run a program which is python based,and I used to do it in command prompt. However, I need to run this program multiple times and, thus, would like to automate it. The program need to run with files in a specific folder, and it uses a config file located in the same specific folder. Finally, I also need it to give a log file once it finishes each process. I used to do all this in command prompt: I tried using python:However, it didn't seem to work. (I did omit the log file thing in this first step)Any tips on how to proceed or where I can learn something about it?
You need to split up your shell command into separate arguments passed into Popen. Read the documentationAlso, you may need to escape the backslashes in the Windows filepath. You may also need to enclose quotes IE
