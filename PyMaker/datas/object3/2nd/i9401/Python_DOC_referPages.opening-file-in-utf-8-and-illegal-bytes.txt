Natural Text
I think my file may be mixed encoding and it is a pretty wierd file. The program I made works fine when I open a more normally encoded file. I have been extremely confused for the past 4 hours with how to get this working properly.actually probably quite a bit longer than 4 >.>.Python throws out the errorThe idea is to open 2 very large files with about 100000 lines of code and compare file 1 to file 2 for unique lines. I found someone using a set to do this and so far after testing it with a quick txt file I created in notepad it has worked fine.It seems like the file that I am trying to open however has invalid bytes for utf-8 inside of it. I would like to remove these invaid bytes before passing it into the tuple. Any help would be much obliged as I have actually tried to google for the correct way to do this but haven't found or understood a correct solution. I will actually link 1 of the files in case it helps since it is quite abnormal. Also is there a way to actually check the bytes that are invalid in notepad++. I was curious to find out what was causing the error. Viewing the file in notepad++ as a utf-8 encoded file seems to display text fine.http://www.mediafire.com/file/5uax2g962ad1ali/file1.txtIs there no way to have python just ignore these bytes?
Your problem can be boiled down to You can fix it by changing how the decoder handles errors. The choices are "strict" (default), "replace" (put ? in) and "ignore" (skip). UTF-8 has the interesting property that it can figure out where the next character starts so you shouldn't loose too much....and you can make the set from the get go
