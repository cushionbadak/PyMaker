I am trying to create a python script that calls 5 other python scripts to run simultaneously while passing in an array and then each of the 5 scripts perform an operation on that array and return a different array to the initial script. The initial script then realize when the 5 have returned values and then performs operations on these 5 arrays.I think the solution is something like     ,  but I'm unsure of how to proceed. 
You can use a thread pool to run all of the commands in parallel. I also changed over to the  module which grabs program outputs:
