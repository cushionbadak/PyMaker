This question already has an answer here:Multiple assignment and evaluation order in Python                    8 answers                I am testing a python script, where I have to constantly store the old values of 2 variables and then return them through a function. For this I took fibonacci series as an example:Everything works perfectly as expected here, and the output is also as expected. I however tried to write it in a different way, where instead of using an extra variable "c", I can still do the swap of old values efficiently, and I practically bumped on this (though have no idea how the assignment is working here) :Instead of the line:Used:So a detailed explanation will be appreciated.
It is a feature of Python.The right side of the assignment is an expression that creates a new tuple. The other side of the assignment immediately unpacks that (unreferenced) tuple to the names a and b.After the assignment, the new tuple is unreferenced and marked for garbage collection, and the values bound to a and b have been swapped.check thistuple and sequencesHope this helps.
