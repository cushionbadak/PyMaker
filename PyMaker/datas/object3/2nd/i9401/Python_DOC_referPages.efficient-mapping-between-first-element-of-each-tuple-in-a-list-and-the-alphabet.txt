I am new with Python so excuse if the question above is basic. I would appreciate any example code for me to understand and learn.
You can use  and a dictionary comprehension:or if you want to do it in a more 'functional' way:
Sure, you can achieve that using dictionary comprehension and using  library:

You may create your desired  using  as:OR, even better to use it with  as:Value hold by  will be: Explanation:You were almost there.  returns a string but you may iterate the string and access the item based on index (same as you do with ). For example:As an additional piece of information even though you don't need this: If you want to convert the  into , you may type-cast it as:
