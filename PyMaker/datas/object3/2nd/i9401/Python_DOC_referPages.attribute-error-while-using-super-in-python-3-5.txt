This is a piece of Python code to learn inheritance. But when I try to run it in Pycharm, I get the following error: /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/bin/python3.5  /Users/venkat/PycharmProjects/PythonOneVideo/main.py The Tiger has the  sound  roars Senegal Traceback (most recent call last):   File  "/Users/venkat/PycharmProjects/PythonOneVideo/main.py", line 41, in        leopard.ToString()   File "/Users/venkat/PycharmProjects/PythonOneVideo/main.py", line 35, in  ToString      print(self.__name) AttributeError: 'Panther' object has no attribute '_Panther__name'Process finished with exit code 1What's wrong with calling the super class constructor?Why this error has happened and how to solve this?Any help would be appreciated.
several issues:python 3 syntax for : name mangling: instance variables starting with  (two underscores) will get  prepended to them. child classes will not be able to access them the usual way.: why not  (and do not print inside ; just return a )?and what are the class variables ( etc) for? why not just have them as instance variables ()?this works bus is incomplete...
Remove the two leading underscore from your attributes:Output:The two leading underscores make your attributes "private".This is done my name mangling, i.e. adding  in front of all attributes with two leading underscores. This prevents the inheritance you do from working.
Your error stems from the name mangling Python performs when you prepend a variable name with .  If you simply use names without the double trailing underscores, this works fine:and prints out:
