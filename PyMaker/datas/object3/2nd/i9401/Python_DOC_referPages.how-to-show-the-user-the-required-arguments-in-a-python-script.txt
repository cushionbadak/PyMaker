I have a Python script that I run from the command line.  The script, which uses , requires the following six (6) arguments:I run this script multiple times per day and have therefore memorized the sequence of arguments.  But, there are others who might run the script infrequently and not know the required arguments (and/or the sequence).  Is there a way for them to query the argument list (along with an example of each argument)?  Perhaps the doc string?Thanks!

I have not personally used this one.Use  from the standard library. For example:This will generate an  option to use with help text per argument.

This can ofcourse also be implemented in a simple :
