I have a program (NLTK-NER) which provides me with this list:As you can see "Barak" and "Obama" are words of type "PERSON", and I want to merge them (and words of type "LOCATION") together, like this:How can I approach this problem?
What we're looking to do here, essentially, is group some items of  together â€¦ so it stands to reason that  can help. First of all, we need a key function that treats items with the tags  or  as similar, and all other items as distinct.This is slightly complicated by the fact that we need a way to distinguish adjacent items that have the same tag (other than  or ), e.g.  etc. We can use  for that:Now that we know what we're going to provide as input to , we can write our key function:Notice that the structure of  in the assignment matches the structure of each item in our enumerated list.Once we've got that, we can write another function to do the actual merging:Here it is in action:
This is the first thing it came to my mind, pretty sure it could be optimised but is a good start.
