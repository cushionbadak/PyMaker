How would you test a simple method that calls another method?  Im attempting to test the wssender method currently.and the test code There are two issues.   When running this test i get. (ws is a web socket)and wssender does not return anything so i'm not sure what to test in this case.
How's this?Output
I assume "class Worker(self)" is a typo and that it's really "class Worker(object)" (or any other base class).wrt/ the first issue, you forgot to instanciate  in your test - you want:Totally unrelated but  is not a good name for a method -  is a noon, methods are actions and should use verbs, so  (or just  FWIW) would be better.Now with the second issue, you have a couple options. If what you want to test is the message formatting, just split it in another method:so now you can test  in isolation.If you want to test that  calls  (and calls it with the expected argument), you will have to mock . You can do this manually:Or you can use the  library, cf Tacg's answer.
