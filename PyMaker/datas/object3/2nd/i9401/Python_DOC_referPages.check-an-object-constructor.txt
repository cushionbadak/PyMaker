I'm developing a Flask-Python app and I'd like to know how do I get an object class/constructor.I want this because I had to merge two different arrays and now I have a result array with objects of both classes.Imagine this:I merged both arrays in birthdate order and I have a final array:But now I want to print them on my PetPerson.html. How do I differentiate both of them if the variable for birthdate is different?Any idea?Best regards
