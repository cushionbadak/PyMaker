This is very first I am writing command line tool apps. Apps has few custom command which forks a repo from github and CD's into it. Command can also submit new code and rise new pull request. There might be also some application login before submit/pull-request also.After few research i found , there are serval options such as  - Bash  - Ruby - python(i know python but don't have any problem learning ruby as well. It hard to write business logic in Bash, so bash is not i am looking for)Ruby seems to be more rich when it come to command like tool. Thor is a famous lib for doing this in rubyPython can also do same stuff with command line with Cement Framework and click.Wanted to know which one is preferred when it comes to writing command line apps like this. 
Both work just fine. I would prefer python because it is easy to deploy. But the main take-away is cmd.The Cmd class provides a simple framework for writing line-oriented command interpreters. These are often useful for test harnesses, administrative tools, and prototypes that will later be wrapped in a more sophisticated interface.But I'm pretty sure Ruby has something like that as well. So, people who knows Ruby better, can use Ruby.
