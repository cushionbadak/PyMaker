I'm having a problem trying to get the PowerShell virtualenvwrapper installed.Bellow is the process I'm going through:/******Experienced Python/Django developers often choose to instead run their Python apps within independent Python virtual environments.These allow developers to have multiple different Django environments on a single computer, allowing them to create new websites (using the latest version of Django)while still maintaining websites that rely on older versions.The Django developer team itself recommends that you use Python virtual environments.******/1. Access PowerShell as admincd C:\mkdir Djangocd Django2. Get Python 3.5.2 (32 bits is the one I suggest) - https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-352/Customize the location: C:\Python35-32(make sure is installed in your path)Once youâ€™ve installed Python,open up a PowerShell window andpythonThis is what you will see:------------------- (CTRL + Z to exit the Python prompt)3. Get PipSave the following script as get-pip.py:https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py(if you can not find it, ask me for a copy)python get-pip.pyTo check if everything is working, just type pip at the command line:pipThen, if all goes ok,pip install --upgrade setuptoolspip install ez_setup4. Install virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper-powershellpip install virtualenv(all good)pip install virtualenvwrapper-powershell(having a problem here)What can I do here?Thank you for the support
virtualenvwrapper-powershell interacts nicely with Python 2.7.(https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenvwrapper-powershell/2.7.1)So, I suggest to install that as the system python AND then install Python 3.5.2 outside of the path.Following steps:Install Python 2.7 ON the pathInstall Python 3.5.2 OFF the pathpippip install --upgrade setuptoolspip install ez_setuppip install virtualenvpip install virtualenvwrapper-powershell
