Hey i'm trying to use modulo with big float numbers but python don't seems to like those big numbers. My goal is to check if the division of 2 integers give me an integer or not (so if  or not)Example:How can I improve the precision of the result / or find a clever way to check if the division give me an integer?
For integers  and , the fraction  is an integer if and only if .  As long as  and  are integers, you don't have to worry about floating point errors or special numerical classes or anything.  Just make sure that  and  are actually represented as integers and not floats.  And since python can handle large integers, this works for integers longer than 64 bits, e.g:
not all fractions can be represented exactly as floats. your approach will therefore not work (as expected).what you might try is the  module:this a way you could use :
Another option is the  module.With your first example:and the result will be With the second example, you would need to set the precision to 50:again, the result of  would be 
You can just use  to test for real or natural number value:
