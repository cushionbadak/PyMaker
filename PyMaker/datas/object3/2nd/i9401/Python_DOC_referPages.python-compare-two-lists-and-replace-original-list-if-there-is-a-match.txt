If there is a match, replace the original value in  with the one from . If there is no match, keep the original value.Desired Output:Eventually I also want to write this new  as a file containing the items, one per line.I've tried:***EDITING QUESTION to account for lists that have 15k+ lines to find a faster way to do this.
You could use a list comprehension containing a generator expression:Note that I'm assuming if the same 3 character prefix occurs multiple times in  that you only wish to take the first instance.
This is a solution that mutates the original list, replacing only those where the desired match exists:Of course if you don’t want to modify the original list, you can create a coopy of it first using .You can also follow your own idea but in that case, you have to make sure that you are primarily iterating over  and won’t add items multiple times:You can also use  here instead of that utility variable :
Try the following with :Output:
You can use a combination of  and  for this:I hope this helps.
