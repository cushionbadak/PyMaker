In the following lineI am getting a traceback as follow:printing os:all of the sudden it is set to NoneI dont think I am programmatically setting to None..Is it possible for os being set to None somehow other than by a programmer?or any ways to debug this besides manually looking over thousands of lines of code?  This function is called within a threadAnother weird thing.... I've changed the code to:TracebackAnd im also importing sys. I am definitely not creating variables for both os and sys...something is wiping all the imports?
The error is exactly what is wrong - You have set a variable with a name of , thus when running  you are trying to run  on a string, integer, or some other variable.
