Both the current answers don't address the problem of locating the  by the desired size which is not straightforward at the first glance.The idea is to not dive into string parsing too much, but extract the complete  JS array into the Python list via , then filter the list by the desired size. Of course, we should first locate the desired JS object - for this we'll use a regular expression - remember, this is not HTML parsing at this point and doing that with a regular expression is pretty much okay - this famous answer does not apply in this case.Complete implementation:Prints  at the moment.By the way, we could have also used a JavaScript parser, like  - here is a sample working solution:Extracting text from script tag using BeautifulSoup in Python
you can find it using regex:edit:I suppose you can get the whole content of  in a variable  (either , ,  or simply ).before we start, let's define some variables:then using regex find a dictionary as text and convert to  via  This is what you get:Now you can easily get any information you need.
Assuming you can get the block of code into a string format, and assuming the format of the code doesn't change too much, you could do something like this:
