I have tried to fix it and have looked over my code many times, but nothing really seems wrong.I had unpacked the module to 3 values and tried run the program, but it gave me the error that I was giving too many values:PS C:\dir1> python exlp.py ramen lucid chubbyTraceback (most recent call last):File "exlp.py", line 54, in ValueError: too many values to unpackAfter a while I figured out that it was counting the file name as a value. I have no clue why this is happening, but here is my code:Thank you!
Because that's what it does.The list of command line arguments passed to a Python  script.  is the script name (it is operating system dependent  whether this is a full pathname or not). If the command was executed  using the  command line option to the interpreter,  is set to  the string . If no script name was passed to the Python  interpreter,  is the empty string.To loop over the standard input, or the list of files given on the  command line, see the fileinput module.Either account for that value or slice that list:
