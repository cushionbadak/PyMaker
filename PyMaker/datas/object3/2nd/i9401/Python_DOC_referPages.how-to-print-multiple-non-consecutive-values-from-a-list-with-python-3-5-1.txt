I have created a list and want to choose a handful of items to print from the list. Below, I'd just like to print out "bear" at index 0 and "kangaroo" at index 3. My syntax is not correct:Traceback (most recent call last):   File "", line 1, in   print (animals[0,3]) TypeError: list indices must be integers  or slices, not tupleI tried with a space between the indexes but it still gives an error:Traceback (most recent call last):   File "", line 1, in   print (animals[0, 3]) TypeError: list indices must be  integers or slices, not tupleI am able to print a single value or a range from 0-3, for example, with:How can I print multiple non-consecutive list elements?
To pick arbitrary items from a list you can use :
Slicing with a tuple as in  is not supported for Python's  type. If you want certain arbitrary values, you will have to index them separately.
 is the subset you want. Unlike numpy arrays, native Python lists do not accept lists as indices.You need to wrap the generator expression in  to print it because it does not have an acceptable  or  on its own. You could also use  for an acceptable effect: . 
Python's list type does not support that by default. Return a slice object representing the set of indices specified by range(start, stop, step).Either creating a subclass to implement by yourself or getting specified values indirectly. e.g.:
