I've gone through the HOWTO and the  module docs several times, and I'm still confused about how optionality and grouping interact in Python regexes. What I want is to match everything inside a group, or not at all, but I'm finding that substrings are matching. Here's a minimal example:I expected that not to match, since I have the entire string  marked as optional. What (part of the docs) am I not understanding??A version of the problem that's closer to what I'm actually interested in is as follows:Why is that whitespace not being forced to match?EDIT 2017-01-04The answers thus far are helpful, but I think I didn't explain my need sufficiently clearly.In short, I want a regex that will match  or  (in their entirety) or  or  (in there entirety) and nothing else.So I see that what's happening is that it's matching on  and then not caring about what's further downstream. How do I get it to match only on  or nothing at all?
Let's look what is matched:It's empty string. Why?Because  here means zero or one time (just like ). So the first group can match either to string  or to empty string (which we have).Here is a quote from the docs:  Causes the resulting RE to match 0 or 1 repetitions of the preceding RE. ab? will match either ‘a’ or ‘ab’.
For what you're describing I don't think you want to use an optional match. I think you want exactly the regexes you have but without the .For your first example:For your second example:
With the  in both cases, you're saying you want either 0 or 1 occurances of the group. So in   you either match "test" with doesn't match, or an empty string, which will be the very first part of the string.In the second one,  you have the four matches of "distance", "mileage" or "distance between" or "mileage between".None of these though have to be the whole string, so there can be test before or after. Otherwise you need  if you only want the start, or  to only match the end, or finally  to only match the whole string.
