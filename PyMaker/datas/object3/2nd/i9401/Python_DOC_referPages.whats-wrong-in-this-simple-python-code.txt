Why is it not giving out correct total of first even fibonacci numbers upto 4 mn?
There are other answers already addressing specific bugs in your code, so I want to offer a completely different implementation that achieves your stated goal:giving out correct total of first even fibonacci numbers upto 4 mnIf you want to find the sum of the even Fibonacci numbers up to some limit, the code below might be a more functional way of achieving it. It's based on composing Python generators, which should help make the code easier to follow and more reusable.OutputEditIt's ambiguous what exactly OP is asking.If OP wants to sum the even Fibonacci terms until the sum would surpass 4,000,000, then the answer is what I stated above - 1089154.If OP wants to sum all even Fibonacci terms under 4,000,000, then the expression  would change to  and the answer would be 4613732.
I recognize this as Problem 2 on Project Euler. For some reason, @Tagc is getting the wrong answer. I used a generator as well but not a list. Here was my solution:Output:
just for fun, this is an one liner versionhere takewhile will stop the iteration when the condition is no longer satisfied the same way as the others answers
