I just wrote a function that looked like this:Can anything bad come of this? Should there ideally be something inside the while loop?
maybe putting time.sleep(1) in the while loop will require less cycles? Or
 seconds does just that without burning through CPU cycles. your loop keeps the CPU fully busy. i do not know for you but i consider this bad.
