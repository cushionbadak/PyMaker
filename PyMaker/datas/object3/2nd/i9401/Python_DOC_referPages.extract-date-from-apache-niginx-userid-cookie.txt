Both webservers Apache and Nginx can give visitors uniqid cookie with mod_unique_id/userid modules. Such a cookie looks like four uint32 values encoded to base64 string. Second byte is a timestamp when the cookie was issued.I'd like to extract the date and time of it.This line seems to me especially "artificial". How to make all code  more "pythonic" and faster?
I don't know what you mean exactly by "artificial" and "pythonic", but at least on my machine, that code is incorrect. And it's incorrect in a way that will give you bogus data which might not be noticed.The  format code for  does not specify a byte order, which on my (x86) machine results in an incorrect timestamp. The documentation says that omitting the byte order will cause it to default to your machine's byte order. But in mod_uid version 2, the cookie uses network byte order.  Specify network byte order with the format code .If by "pythonic" you mean spread it across a few lines instead of packing it into one, here is how that could look:
