I have a log with entries in the following format:How do I fetch only the timestamp component (eg. ) using regular expressions?I have to implement the final product in python, but the requirement is to have part of an automated regression suite in bash/perl (with the final product eventually being in Python).
If the format is fixed in terms of space delimiters, you can simply split, get a slice of a date string and load it to  object via :
Grep is most often used in this scenario if you are working with syslog.  But as the post is also tagged with Python.  This example uses regular expressions with re:Define the pattern to match:Then use re.findall to return all non-overlapping matches of pattern in txt:Output:If you want to then use datetime:Output:You can then utilise these datetime objects:Output:
The regex to match the timestamp is:.With grep that can be used like this (if your log file was called ):In python you can use that like so:You can use this to get an actual datetime object from the string (expanding on above code):
Two approaches: with and without using regular expressions1) using  function:2) usign  and  functions:The output in both cases will be a below:

If you just wanted to list the dates, rather than grep, perhaps:
