I have a simple python project fro learning with two files  and When I executed it runs both  and When I execute it invokes  twice.I want to know why  is called twice when i call Is it like the static code in java where when we call the class all the datain static code is automatically triggered. What is the relevance of  in python and benefits of it getting executed when package is imported/loaded or called for processing.Please help me understand the concepts better.
The following command is used to execute a Python module or package:Where  is the name of the module/package without .py extension.if the name matches a script, it is byte-compiled and executed,if the name matches a directory with a  file and a  file, the directory is considered as being a Python package and is loaded first. Then the  script is executed.if the name contains dots, e.g.: "mylib.mypkg.mymodule", Python browse each package and sub-package matching the dotted name and load it. Then it execute the last module (or last package which must contain a  file). A (short) description is done in the official documentation: 29.4. main â€” Top-level script environment.Your problemIf you run this command:It loads (and run) the   and : this is the normal behavior.If you run this command:It should fail if you leave the ".py" extension.If it runs, the command loads the  package first: it execute the  first. Then it runs it again.
It is used to define a folder as a package, which contains required modules and resources.You can use is as an empty file or add docs about the package or setup initial conditions for the module.Please checkout the python documentation. Also, as mentioned by Natecat,  gets executed whenever you load a package. That's why when you explicitly call , it loads the package (1st load) then executes  (2nd load).
