I'm trying to write a simple game and need to write some informations in a file. This is how the code looks like so far:In the last line there is an exception at the last bracket: "Parameter 'file' unfilled. So the code can't get the information out of the function I'm using in the last line.Would be great, if someone could help me! Thank you!
This is my attempt to correct your code as best I could. As pointed out in the comments, you need to set  to an instance of the  class by instantiating it as .Because you're passing the player's name, password and the file to store credentials in to the  constructor, you don't need to pass these as arguments to , which is why I remove all parameters for that.I should point out that this implementation is very simple and incomplete, designed only to address your immediate issues. My implementation will result in file handles remaining open after each call to the  constructor. If you opt for this sort of approach, you may want to read the Python documentation on input and output operations.Console OutputPlayersAndPasswords.txt
