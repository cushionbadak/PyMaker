I'm currently trying to make an executable using py2exe. I use Python 3.6. The script I'm using imports openpyxl and pptx and runs fine when I use Pycharm or run the script using the command window. The output produces the error: IndexError: tuple index out of rangeBelow you can find the cmd output:What causes the IndexError? Edit: here is the  file
Python 3.6 completely redesigned the bytecode for CPython (it's not a "byte" code at all anymore, it's a wordcode, where all opcodes are two bytes wide instead of 1-3).The failure you're seeing occurs in  opcode parsing code, which, given the most recent posted version of  only claims support for 3.3 and 3.4, could not possibly have knowledge of, or support for, the new wordcode opcodes; they hadn't even been conceived of at the time  was last updated. The bytecode often changes in small ways from version to version that could break even Python 3.5 (given only 3.3 and 3.4 support is claimed explicitly), but 3.6 is 100% guaranteed to fail.
I had same problem, as workaround I used cx_freeze.My app is based on wxPython, windows 10, python 3.6, cx_freeze 5.5.1This is the setup file that I used and I got msi file on dist folder.then 
Dennis, a few hours later than you, i test the same thing without luck, i have installed Python 3.6 and by the moment, it doesn't work.I try a walkaround, i've installed Python 3.4.3, and try this:1) enter in your script folder2) deactivate any antivirus that you have (weird thing, know by another SO question xD)2) call the python 3.4.3 interpreter by his absolute path, in my case, i've installed in:3) execute the commandhope that help like me
