Keep getting the same thing every time I try to run the program,  is not defined.  How do I get rid of it?Yes, I do have another problem I sure wish I could figure out as well, I can't get  to install correctly, it keep trying to install to Python 2.7, which I don't have any 2.7 interpreter installed, only 3.4.3 is installed on the computer.  I have a strange feeling that might be causing me some other issues as well with some some other programs.
Just because you have the line  or the  doesn't mean that  is available as a name in your script.This is specified in the documentation for the  statement specifically in the section dealing with the  form; see the examples there to see what becomes available and what doesn't.Therefore, when you :it fails when trying to find the name . Either just use , as imported and bound to your namespace, in the  clause:or, if you need the name for  available in your namespace,  instead of  and use the original  clause.As for the installation issue, try using  instead of .
