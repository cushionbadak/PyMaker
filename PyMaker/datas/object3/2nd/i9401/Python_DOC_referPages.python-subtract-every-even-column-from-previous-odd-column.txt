You can accomplish this using pandas. You can select the even- and odd-indexed columns separately and then subtract them.@hiro protagonist, I didn't know you could do that StringIO magic. That's spicy.Note that the even/odd terms may be counterintuitive because python is 0-indexed, meaning that the signal columns are actually even-indexed and the background columns odd-indexed. If I understand your question properly, this is contrary to your use of the even/odd terminology. Just pointing out the difference to avoid confusion. contains columns which are the difference between the signal and background columns. You probably want to rename these column names, though.
with output:if you know what  means and how  works this should be easily understood.
