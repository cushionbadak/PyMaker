I've got the following bash script:$PER variables are floating numbers as u might have noticed so I cannot use them normaly in the nested if conditional. I'd like to do this conditional iteration in python but I have no clue how do it whithin a bash script also I dont know how to import the value of the variables $PER2 and $PER3 into python. Could I write directly python code in the same bash script invvoking python somehow?Thank you for your help, first time facing this.
You can use  to execute a piece of python code from the command line. If you want bash to interpolate your environment variables, you should use double quotes around CMD. You can return a value by calling sys.exit, but keep in mind that true and false in Python have the reverse meaning in bash.So your code would be:
It is possible to feed Python code to the standard input of  executable with the help of here document syntax:In order to avoid parameter substitution (interpretation within the block), quote the first limit string: .If you want to assign the output to a variable, use command substitution:Note, it is not recommended to use back quotes for command substitution, as it is impossible to nest them, and the form  is more readable.
maybe this helps? takes  as input and runs it.but then why not rewrite all in python? bash commands can nicely be executed with  which is included in python or (need to install that) .
