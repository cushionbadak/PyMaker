I am trying to edit python scripts in first time and it drives me crazy :( .I have some directory with *.py files, that I added to PyCharm as Interpreter Paths, for correct auto completion.So, I have some class I am Java and C++ programmer and I am used to class type variables.I know, that in scripts this variable will have value with type .But, when indexer of the PyCharm indexed that *.py files, he knows, that  var has value . But how can specify, that in code variable  has type of class ?May be I should use something like "editor hits", to force auto completion for ?For example, code where  must be auto completed to .How to specify variable types in this case (may be via something like editor hints)? Thank you very much!
Python 3.6:Other python:It called "type hints"
You can use type hinting with pycharm using the @type docstring.orYou can also specify the full path to the class including the module if just the class name did not work.  You can also use PEP484 in PyCharm to specify the type of member variables:
