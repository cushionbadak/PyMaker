Natural Text
I have a text file contains meteorological data, which include fields like station name, latitude, temperature, pressure, etc.All the station's data are in a single line as followsThis should be separated to show them as a list of all data in order, ie.I tried several regular expressions, but I got no luck unfortunately, This is a sample when I tried to get the floats and integers only:but it simply gets nothing!, also I tried this for scientific numbers, and got nothing as well!Notice that I want a regex to find all forms at once, but sadly I even failed to parse each form separately!What am I doing wrong? and how to get this done?
