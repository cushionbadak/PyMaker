I'm new to python's ascynio feature and I have a server that processes websocket requests from a browser. Here's a simplified version of how it works:You have one loop looking for web socket requests coming in from the client. When it gets one, it processes it and puts the value onto a queue. Another loop is looking for values on that queue and when it finds one it sends processed value back out on the web socket. Pretty straight forward and it works.What I want to do now it introduce a timer. When requests comes and and is done processing, instead of putting a response back on the queue immediately, I want to start a timer for 1 minute. When the timer is finished, then I want to put the response on the queue.I've tried something like:It doesn't work though. The  method is never called. If I removed the  decorator and , then  does get called but then call to  doesn't work.I think I'm misunderstanding something fundamental here. How do you do this?
Insted of a timer, use  and   :Working example:
