I am trying to make a countdown timer that prints the time remaining, and when you input something, it prints what you inputted. My problem is I don't want to wait for the input, just keep running the timer. My incorrect code:You could say I want to have the timer printing the time in the background.
Here's a function that will timeout if no input is given:You can easily modify it so it shows the remaining time by changing the timeout value on  to , and looping  times.
Standard input and standard output (accessed via  and ) are not a good choice for writing interactive asynchronous user interface (UI).  Python support a few UIs via it's standard library.  For example, curses is a text based user interface available on many POSIX systems.  Here is an exmaple code for showing a countdown timer while accepting a number from the user:
