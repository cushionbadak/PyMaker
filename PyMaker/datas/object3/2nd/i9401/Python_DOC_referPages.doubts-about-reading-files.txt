I have a Python file with this struct:A string I want to extract plus some other information, like integersFor example: There are a bunch of lines following the model. And to extract what I would like, I thought in ask for Python read the characters WHILE the character is different of SPACE. When character is space, go to next line and continue doing it.However, I don't know how to implement that... could you guys help me?[UPDATED]I would like to store each information (Room, car, fan...) in a list.
You can read through a file line by line (and execute some action for every line) like this:Then use  to form an array, adding a new item whenever it reads a space. So:And you can manipulate the info in the array however you'd like.In order to access specific information from line in your new array, run a simple for loop like so:The more pythonic way would be to use a dictionary of arrays like this:As long as the data is in the same order, this will append every nth element to its own array.Hope this helps!
Your question is a bit confusing, but I think https://docs.python.org/3/ would be useful for you.To read a file, you can use . For each line in the file, you could use the  method to make a list. Ultimately, it would look something like this:The variable data would a be a list of lists.
