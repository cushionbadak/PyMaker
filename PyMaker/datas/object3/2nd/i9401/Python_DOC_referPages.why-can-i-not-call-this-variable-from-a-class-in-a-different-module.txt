I've got this Tkinter thing going with Python 3.5.  I'm trying to pass the contents of an entry-box over to a different module so I can do something else with it.  I'm making the Tkinter window like this:So, that works OK.  At least the  call in  reports  and not an error.I have another module called pdf.py and that has a call in it that fails when I try to pull in  like this:I've tried everything I can think of.  Let's see, how about:I've made  global in and out of the  call.I've done this in various places in pdf.py:in conjunction with permutations of the last slew of calls...Nothing works.I can print it find in its own module, but I can't get it to show up outside of there.  How do I do this?
Not entirely sure but I guess that your issue is related to the following linemeaning that your class  is not instantiated as can be seen in [0]. Moving the creation of the  class, that is using the following code snippetwill at least allow you to import the variable  from that module.However, I strongly recommand to not instantiate the class at the end of the module because it is reinstantiated every time your import that module!EDIT1:I would do it as follows:and then in Now let me clarify that when you call  via  you will end up with exactly one GUI being opened up. This is however not the case if you import the module as can be seen in . Hence, we directly instantiate one GUI object via function invocation which must be done manually (see line 3 with the unmistakable inline comment in ).[0] https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#executing-modules-as-scripts
The whole point of the  block is to only execute its contents when that file is run directly, and not when it is imported. So if you do want to import the  instance, you should not create it within that block.
