This question already has an answer here:Python title() with apostrophes                    5 answers                first post so go easy on me. I am trying to make it to where when I run my class the name of the restaurant comes back like a title. The problem I ran into was with joe's it comes back as Joe'S with a capital S when I use title(). When I use capitalize() Joe's comes back fine but burger king comes back as Burger king with a lower case k. I am trying to find out how to simplify this so I can have the capitalized letter of each word, without capitalizing the S after the apostrophe. The example I am working on is from Python Crash Course chapter 9. I am running Geany with python version 3.xx. Thanks for all the help.
Just split and join in open_restaurant
