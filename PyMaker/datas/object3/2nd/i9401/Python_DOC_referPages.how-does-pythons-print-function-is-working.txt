Natural Text
I'm interested how does Python's print function determines what is the string encoding, and how to handle it?For example I've got the string:What is going on under the hood of python?UpdateI'm interested in CPython 2.7 implementation of python
It uses the encoding in , which comes from the environment it's running in.
The  in front of the string makes a difference.The '' in front of the string values means the string has been represented as unicode. It is a way to represent more characters than normal ascii can manage.The default encoding for Python source code is UTF-8, so you can simply include a Unicode character in a string literal.More info here
