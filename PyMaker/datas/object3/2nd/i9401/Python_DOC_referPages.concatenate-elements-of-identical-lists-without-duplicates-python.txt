I've 2 identical lists as shown:I concatenate each element in them,Can you help me remove the duplicate combinations that may occur ?(For ex: AA,..FF and also AB,AC,BC, etc)Thanks in advance!
You simply perform a comparison and constraints it to  being less than :Because of the order constraint if  is printed, this means that  is less than , so it means the constraint  will fail and thus  will not be printed.
Use itertools.combinations. In this case code gets much simpler. You need only one list,  automatically generates you only unique combinations. So you have no to filter 'AA' or 'CB' passing only 'BC'.I've formatted output to see you have clean result.
