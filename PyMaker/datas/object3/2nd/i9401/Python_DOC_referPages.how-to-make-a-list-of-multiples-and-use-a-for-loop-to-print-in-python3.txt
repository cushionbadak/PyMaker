This question already has an answer here:How do you check whether a number is divisible by another number (Python)?                    9 answers                The question in my book I am working through (I am new to programming) is:Threes: Make a list of the multiples of 3 from 3 to 30. Use a for loop to print the numbers in your list.I have tried a few different things to do this, but in my book Python Crash Course, it doesn't explain the syntax or show me examples on how to do multiples. Only exponents. I have reread the chapter several times over and still am not able to find the tutorial on how to do this. And also, being that I am new to programming, I don't exactly know the keywords or phrases I should be searching for.It would be of great help to me (I've been confused by this for over an hour) if someone could explain this to me and give me an example.
It's easy, you can use the  function to iterate over a sequence of numbers and then create the list by examining the result of  (modulus 3). If it is zero, you got a multiple, if not, you don't:This can be mushed into a single line called a comprehension:As for printing, you can tackle it, you use a similar  loop through the list  created and then use the  function!Since you're new to the language, go over to the Python homepage and read the official tutorial on the language, it is nicely written and will help you much more than any answer can.
