Whenever I enter 'n2' higher than 255, it shows enter first number. I want it to show enter second number.Image
 starts the whole  loop over: it doesn't go back to before the last  statement or anything like that. So your second  effectively starts your program over. You need to get rid of this , and use some other method to redo this input.
The problem is the  statement in the first .  does not mean "go on". It means, "ignore the rest of the while/for loop, and repeat from its next iteration". So, actually, the next time you are at the input prompt, are not entering , you are again the the same line and entering  again. Remove the  statement.Take a look at how  and  statements work, they are pretty much the same in all languages (that I know of at least)
