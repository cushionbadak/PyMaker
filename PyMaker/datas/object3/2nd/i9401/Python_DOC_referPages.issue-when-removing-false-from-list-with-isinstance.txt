So, I was messing around removing non-integers from a list in Python (very exciting stuff). I came across an issue with the following code that I cannot seem to resolve:I'm trying to remove all non int items in the list but the the above code does not remove False.What I want: What I'm getting: Any help figuring this out would be much appreciated!
Your issue is that  is a subclass of :Therefore, all bools are ints (where False is 0 and True is 1) and could be used for indexing and such. You can test  instead. 
In Python,  is a subclass of :This means that you need a more refined check. You could, for example, check that .For background, see PEP 285:Another, unrelated, issue is that you're modifying a list while iterating over it. Have a read of Modifying list while iterating and links therein.This results in a subtle bug in your code. For example, it fails to remove  from the following list (try it!):One clean way to fix this is by using a list comprehension.
Check not if an item is an instance of something. Check its type directly:[1, 2, 3]
A clear way to do it. Output
You are making two errors here:Assuming  works with  (others have explained how  actually sub-classes from ).Altering a list while you iterate through itThis may be one of those cases where explicitly testing using  is warranted:which yields the wanted result; notice how  is copied with  assuring we iterate over all its contents despite removing from it.In a comprehension form, this is prettier:
Bool is a subclass of Int, furthermore type() and isinstance() should not be confused. This is because before boolean became its own class "1"s and "0"s represented True and False respectively.As a result you should use type() due to inheritance.This is a non-destructive modified list because sometimes modifying a list you're iterating through can cause errors or be a pain at least.
