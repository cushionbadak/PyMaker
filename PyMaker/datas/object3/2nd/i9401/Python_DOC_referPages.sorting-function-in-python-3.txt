I would like to use an older python script with  function, but it doesn't work in Python 3. It raises an error:I know that I should avoid the  function and use the key function instead, but I don't know how (I don't know Python and I am not a programmer). Could you please help me to change the following part according to this?Thank you.
Just return the first and last element of each tuple you are sorting, but reverse the result:That's exactly what the  version was comparing on, but in reverse, and the  method will do so too.
