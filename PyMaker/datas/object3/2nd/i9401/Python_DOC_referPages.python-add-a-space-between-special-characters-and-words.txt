Natural Text
I am working on a data science project and I have an issue. I have an array full of string like the following string and I want to add a space between the words and between the special charactersand I expect something like that:My last try:
You could simply scan the complete line and selectively add space for each character that is neither alphabet nor a space.this works for example you have given.
Use regular expressions to accomplish that task, specifically  together with a backreference in order to surround the matched characters with spaces.
