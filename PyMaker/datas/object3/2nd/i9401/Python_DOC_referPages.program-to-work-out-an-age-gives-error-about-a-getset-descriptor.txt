I am trying to write a very simple Python program to work out someone's age and I think, in theory, it should work however every time I try to run it, it throws this error: I have tried turning  and   (same things) in to integers. It worked but didn't make a difference as the both are already integers. This is my code:
 does not give you the current year. It gives you an unbound descriptor object instead (the  in your error):Don't worry too much about the exact type of object here, that's just an implementation detail needed to make instances of a built-in immutable type like  work. It just means you don't have an instance of the  type, so there is no  value for that instance either.If you want the current year, use : gives you a  instance, the one representing the current time and date. That instance has a valid  attribute.You could also use  of course:
