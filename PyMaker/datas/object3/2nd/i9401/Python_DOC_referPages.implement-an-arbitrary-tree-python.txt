It seems no similar topic exists.I am required to build a tree from a line of integers for future processing. This line contains 𝑛 integer numbers from −1 to 𝑛 − 1 — parents of nodes. If the 𝑖-th one of them (0 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛 − 1) is −1, node 𝑖 is the root, otherwise it’s 0-based index of the parent of 𝑖-th node.e.g. I should be able to do the remaining job but not very clear about the processing of constructing this tree.
You could use  where values would be  of children to represent the tree. This would make construction of the tree trivial since for every node you can just append the current index to parent children. Here's an example using  with  as default factory:Output:Update: Here's an additional example of tree traversal which counts the number of nodes in the tree. For every node visited it returns 1 + sum of child nodes:
