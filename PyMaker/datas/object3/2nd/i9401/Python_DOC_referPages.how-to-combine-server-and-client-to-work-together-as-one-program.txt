Yes, there's a such function.From :In order to be notified of incoming connections on a socket, you can         use select(2), poll(2), or epoll(7).  A readable event will be         delivered when a new connection is attempted and you may then call         accept() to get a socket for that connection.In python you can use  combined with the timeout parameter:
