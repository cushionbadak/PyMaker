I am trying to open a HDF5 file in order to read it with python, so that I can do more things with it later. There is an error when I run the program to read the file. The program is below:If I run the program I end up seeing this error:Am I just missing some modules to read the file, or is this something else. It will open the .h5 file if I use an h5 file veiwer program. Thank you
Your string:is full of broken/illegal escapes (thankfully they will be turned into SyntaxErrors, though you are using Python 2), and some that actually do work, so Python thinks  is really equal to:  (note those 's).Your options:Use a raw string by prefixing the string literal with Don't use backslashes for paths. Python will convert forward slashes to backslashes for Windows paths.Double-backslash.
The answer that @NickT posted fixed the orginal problem I had. The problem that is shown in the new version is due to the hd5 folder names in the hd5 file not matching the folder names that the code provided.
