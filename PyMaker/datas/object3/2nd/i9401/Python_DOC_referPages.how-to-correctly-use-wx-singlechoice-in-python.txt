Im quite new in python and I would like to show a SingleChoiceDialog box with a list of strings from an sqlite query but I do something wrong and the list in the box shows just the last of the value of the variable list.The query:The Dialog box:When I run this, the Dialog box shows just the last value of the list and not all the list.I think this is because the Dialog box wants me to have an other form of list.My list  outputs the value as:  but the Dialog box is probably expecting the value in this form: . Can someone help me? Thanks.
A simple way to achieve this is to create your list from the returned sql statement using only the first element i.e. item[0].or you could use:as mentioned by Mike Driscoll but you still need only the first element
The  widget does indeed require a normal list in the form of  as you surmised. What you are probably getting is a list of lists and the widget doesn't know how to display that correctly.I would just use a list comprehension to extract the items from the row. Something like this should work:I hope this helps.
