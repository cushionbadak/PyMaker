This question already has an answer here:Empty list boolean value                    3 answers                I thought  is a list but not a Boolean expression that can be True or False? But why does the function consider the list  to be True?
Any expression can be used as the condition in  or . See https://docs.python.org/2.4/lib/truth.html for how the truth value of the expression is evaluated.
As far as I know, any expression of any type will be considered "True" unless it's an empty list/tuple, an empty string (which could technically also be considered a list of characters) or the number 0.P.S. Just as a fun fact, the number 0.000001 returns True.
As stated in the python documentation on "Truth Value Testing":The following values are considered false: [...] any empty sequence, for example, , , . [...] All other values are considered true â€” so objects of many types are always true.So any not-empty list will be evaluated as  and any python object can be evaluated in a boolean context (if it doesn't throw an Exception in it's  or  method, like for example ).
Maybe something like this ?You really need this?SAnyway take a look here : https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#truth-value-testing
