I'm at my wits end.Can't find anything else that helps with this.
Python's dictionaries aren't JS objects. When you create a dict, you aren't creating a dynamic object whose properties you can change at runtime as in JS. Instead the dictionary knows how to store pairs of keys and values and does so by overriding the operator [] ().On a more implementation level - calling  /  is really a shorthand for  and since  uses  as opposed to  the function call fails.Thus, there's no way to set (or get for that matter) the dict's items using generic attribute functions.However, you can create your custom dict class that does support that operation (although I wouldn't recommend it):
You can assign dict values directly, setattr() is not needed.
'setattr()' refers to something else. When you write  you're trying to access the field , dict class has no attribute , so it gives an error. is a completely different thing, and it's how dict members should be accessed.More about settatr() Here
Dictionaries are subscriptable, the key:value pairs are items instead of attributes. Items are accessed using a subscript notation:Attributes are accessed using dot notationoperator.itemgetter is similar to getattr:
 does not work with a dictionary because it does not have an .  I can make a simple class and instance: sets an item in the  of , and the resulting attribute can be accessed with  syntax.But a  object does not have a .I add items to the dict with the dictionary indexing notation:The dictionary class inherits from , but in way that does not give each instance a .  Thus  has nothing to act on.If for some reason the  syntax is awkward, you can use  as a function:Or use the  methodActually, a dictionary does have attributes.  For example its  method can be fetched with .   returns a different error in this example.Without the  we can't add an attribute to a dictionary.  And many, if not all, of the existing attributes are read only.  I don't know if a dictionary has an attributes that can be changed.Actually a dictionary is an :I just imported .  It too lacks a .  But I was able to use .  I think that  is the correct error message when the attribute does not already exist, and it cannot add new ones.==============I'd have to double check the documentation on this, but I think  delegates to .So the error message is determined by the  class, not .Even instances that have a  might raise errors if  is used wrong.  For example a number is not a valid attribute name:But  can set attributes that can't be accessed with the  syntax: is another way of accessing the  of an instance:
docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#setattrThis is the counterpart of getattr(). The arguments are an object,  a string and an arbitrary value. The string may name an existing  attribute or a new attribute. The function assigns the value to the  attribute, provided the object allows itOBJECT is not a DICTIONARY. And I probably confusing my JS work (syntax) with the Python code I'm always writing at the same timeSo the error message is confusing:AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'type'It should be more like:'setattr() is for objects not dictionaries'.Thanks everyone.
