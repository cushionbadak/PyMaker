I have a list of lists, which contain pairs of strings; What I need to achieve is a list of tuples, where the elements (e.g. ) are integers, and currently I'm unsure on the best way to achieve this. I have browsed other questions but most are related to a list of tuples.
Or:
Sort of a functional-programming style approach would involve using the built-in  function:Note that the  call is needed on Python3.x to convert the "map" object to a list.
