How can I test environment variables using pytest and tox?validate.pytest_validate.pyIf I set the environment variables in the  file:The test passes, but I would like to keep the test isolated. 
The environment variables should be provided by your test, not by your test runner. One option is to use mock and patch . Alternatively you can just provide the environment variables in your test case's  and reset them in .
I had a problem with the  variable getting set before the test would run.The  module had to be reloaded within the test to work properly using test_validate.py
