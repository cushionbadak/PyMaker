first time here.I did a bit of searching on my own beforeposting a question, however,I couldn't find the exact answer to it.I've done such things before in C/C++ but here I'm a bit confused.  I want to print this : this way:  automatically, in a loop.First variable from every table in first row, second in second row, etc...I tried with 2 for loops but I'm doing it wrong because I run out of indexes.EDIT - this part is solved but one more questionI have:  and it has to look like this:  "function should be able to manage lists with different lengths andcount how much space is needed for a string (for every column separately)".Every string has to be centered in it's column.I tried to print previous table having a zipped object but I am out of ideas what comes next in this situation

Here you go this works regardless of what the information in the list is.
