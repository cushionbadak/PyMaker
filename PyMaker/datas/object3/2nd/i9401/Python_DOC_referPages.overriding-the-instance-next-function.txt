I'm trying to override an object's next function using the code below (python 2.7).When the object's  method is called directly, the new function is invoked. However when I call the builtin  function on my object (which, according to the docs, should call the instance's next method), the ORIGINAL function is invoked.Can someone explain this behaviour?
If I'm reading this source correctly it seems like the iterator is set when the class is defined. I might read it wrong though. I'm guessing it's for fast lookup of the  function (setting it as a slot) since it's used in loops etc.Given that, the following seems to do what you're after:
