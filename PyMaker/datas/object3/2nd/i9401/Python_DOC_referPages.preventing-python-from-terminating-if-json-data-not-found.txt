While iterating through json there are some files which does not have the field i am parsing (using iterator as  ). Python is terminating the execution with error  I wanted give a default test_category_list if no key found. How I will do that in python ?
 accepts a second argument that is returned if no key is found (you can return any python object; for the example i return the string ):or you catch the  in a  block:note: be sure to only catch the  and not any other kind of exception that might occur there.you could also check if the key exists before you access it (); this is discouraged: the common python coding style prefers EAFP over LBYL.
One option is to use exceptions. They attempt to run the code in the 'try' section, and if that fails they run the except and continue through the script.
