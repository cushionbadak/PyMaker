I am trying to append  in a string using string formats.I am trying to get the below output: Try 1 :Error :Try 2:Error :How do I include a  in my formatted string?
To include a percent  into a string which will be used for a printf style string format, simply escape the  by including a double percent (Docs)
In your first try, the way you use "%" is wrong; the code below could work for your first try.Since the "%" is special in python string, so you need to add a "%" before the real "%" to escape.In your second try, there is nothing wrong in your print, you forgot a  in your  line. ;-)
just put the % there, no need to set the variablethe output isa : [" name like '%FTa0213' "]
You can escape the percent sign by doubling it.outputHowever, I think it's clearer to use the  method:
