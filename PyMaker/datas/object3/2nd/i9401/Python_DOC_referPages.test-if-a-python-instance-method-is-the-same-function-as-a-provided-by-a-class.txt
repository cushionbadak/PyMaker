I have a variable that points to a specific class instance's method.Lets say there is a class called  that implements a method .A single instance called  is created for , and a variable  is assigned with client's .For example, lets assume I have the following simplified code:I have little actual control over  and how it's used, I cannot change that.I would now want to make sure  has the .The trivial test  does not work, as  is a bound method of a specific  instance.I also cannot get the  instance directly (but a way to get the  of a bound method is a valid option, if only I knew how to do that)
 is either a function object (Python 3), or an unbound method (Python 2).  on the other hand, is a bound method. Methods are wrappers around a function object, recording the instance they are bound to (if there is an instance) to pass in as the  argument. See the Python descriptor How-to as to how Python produces methods from functions.You can unwrap both a bound method and an unbound method to get the underlying function object that they wrap, and test that, with the  attribute:If you need to make your code compatible with both Python 2 and 3, you could create a simple helper function:and use that:
