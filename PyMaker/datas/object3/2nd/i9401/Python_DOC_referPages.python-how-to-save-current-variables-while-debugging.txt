I have a general debugging question in python (pycharm IDE if it matters)Lets say I have code which is made up of 2 blocks:Is there a way to save the current variables at the end of running code block 1, so that I can "rewind" back to those variables states and debug from there, without having the re-run the entire script to recompute those variables?
I am unaware of a general solution to this problem.  But an application specific solution can be constructed using various methods for serializing objects, but I would suggest pickle for this problem.Like so much else, there is a small example already on SO.
You can certainly "save" the current variables at the end of running code block 1. Just store the variables in a dictionary and write that to a file after the first code block finishes.Here's a very minimal example, since you provided no data:
