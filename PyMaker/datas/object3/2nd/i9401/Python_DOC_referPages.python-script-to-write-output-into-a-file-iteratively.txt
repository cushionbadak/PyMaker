First of all I am a newbie, and has no background on coding.i am trying to create a python script that will create an xml api file which can be used later,i have a csv file where each line is for one api call. I might have 200+ such lines. I am trying to read one line at time and print the xml data into a file, lets say file-1.xml I can print the data with out any issues, but I could not find a way to redirect this output a file which should be named iteratively (e.g for i in range(1..200) or something)

So instead of  all through your template and  at the end, use  and  at the end. Just a suggestion, though. See PEP 3101.
You just need to open the file and  to it, much like you read from files. To keep track of which number we're on, we'll use
