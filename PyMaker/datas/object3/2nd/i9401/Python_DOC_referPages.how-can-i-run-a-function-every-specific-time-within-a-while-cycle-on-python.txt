I'm working in a project with OCR using a webcam. I would like to know how can I run a function every 3 seconds (for example) while the principal code still running. The code is very long. So I use the following to exemplify:I used  after the statments of  function but it pause the continuous capture of the frame. I don't want it. I need something like a software interruption. When the flag shoots, the code of function run but the while cycle continues working.I'm using python 2.7 on Windows 7.I hope you understand my purpose. I rode about daemon and threads but I can't interpret so much.
You can use it like this
Probably best to do this with threads (see multiprocessing), but easy solution belowNote: Does not fire exactly every 3 seconds as opencv functions take time and probably wait for your webcam to give frames.Note 2: If not using any kind of multi threading your OCR code WILL block your webcam captures, so make your OCR fast or look into above link. 
Here is a rather simple solution using threads. You mentioned about not able to exit the app using ctrl-C. This is because the thread is a separate task and you will have to hit ctrl-C again to kill that thread. To fix it, I've catched  and stopped the task accordingly. Try this out. The code is pretty self-explanatory, but let me know in case you have any doubts.
