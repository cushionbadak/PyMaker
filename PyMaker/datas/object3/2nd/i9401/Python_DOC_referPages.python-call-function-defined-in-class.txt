So I am making a game and I am using Tkinter and Python 2.7, and I want to store map data in files. I am trying to make a menu to open the file and set to a variable. I am having trouble defining a function to use on the Tkinter Button.The Tkinter window opens but when I click the button it gives an error.Code:Also, how can I access the  variable in  (so it would be , right) in another file?Let me know if you need any additional information.Also, 
Here's a simple GUI class that stores the data from a map file in the  attribute.To test this code I created a set of simple text files using this Bash command:And here's the Python 3 code. To run it on Python 2, just change the Tkinter import statement to , and add  before the other import statements.I've added a  that lets us test that we have actually loaded the data correctly.Unless these maps are huge it would probably be more convenient to store all of them at once. You could store them in a list, but it'd probably be better to store them in a dictionary, using the base name (minus the  extension) as the key.
