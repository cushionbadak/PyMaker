There is a couple things wrong with your code and I'm guessing you maybe coming from a JavaScript background.The issues are as follows.You are missing the  at the end of your  statements.You can't use  or  in Python the correct one to use is  and .You also have incorrect indentation for your  statements.Updated code below.Don't forget to hash the passwords.https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html
You need to add  after each if, for or while statement.The operators  or  doesnt exist, you can use  or  insteadIn this line:  you can use the operator  to evaluate that the variable is in a list, souch as In your case could be
