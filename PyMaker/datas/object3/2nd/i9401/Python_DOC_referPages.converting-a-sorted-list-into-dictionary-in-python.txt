I have a dictionary, sayI have sorted the dictionary based on the values using the  method and the result is a list of tuplesBut, when I try to convert this list of tuples back to dictionary, it's back again to the old structure:I want the sorted list to be made into dictionary as it is. I have used  and manually used for loop to assign the values. But it's again leading to the same result.Could anyone help me on this?
The keys in a dictionary are, because of the dictionary's underlying structure (hash map), unordered. You have to order the keys yourself when you iterate the keys (i.e. by doing  or some other sorting method - if you want to sort by value, you still have to do that manually).
Instead of using an unordered  you could use  which remembers the the insertion order:It supports the same operations like a normal  (from the documentation of OrderedDict):Return an instance of a dict subclass, supporting the usual dict methods. An OrderedDict is a dict that remembers the order that keys were first inserted. If a new entry overwrites an existing entry, the original insertion position is left unchanged. Deleting an entry and reinserting it will move it to the end.
You can refer below code to print the sorted dictionary for the given data:data = [('name3', 290), ('name1', 294), ('name2', 349), ('name4', 380)]print(sorted(dict(data).items()))
