Natural Text
I have some python code where I'm trying to parse out a specific section of a string so that I can grab a list of usernames.  I think I have the regex down (I tested it online and it appears to work) but when I run my test code, it doesn't seem to actually grab what I need, as I get an error:if parsed_mod_string.group(1):  AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has  no attribute 'group'Which I'm understanding as basically, my code isn't returning anything with my regex comparison.  My code is below, could someone help me identify where I went wrong?
Per the documentation :If zero or more characters at the beginning of string match the regular expression..That is,  is an "anchored" search function.Compare this to :Scan through string looking for the first location where [the pattern matches..]
