I'm learning Flask by building a blackjack game. I've written a  module that contains the game logic. In it, I define the dealer's shoe as such: (this is an excerpt)Now, in my 'trygame.html' template, I would like to be able to deal new cards, with the  property decreasing with every new card dealt. Unfortunately, this is currently not working. With a single deck, the counter remains at 51 (after the first card has been dealt).Here is my current  view:Now, I suspect the issue comes with always reinitializing the shoe object. The button on the template is simply defined as:I am unsure how to proceed at this point, as I'm not 100% certain where the issue lies. I have attempted creating a session, but I do not know how to store a class instance in it, with its methods available. Additionally, I'm not sure if it's a wise idea to do this in the first place. I'd like to avoid the user being able to see the content of the cards dictionary.I was hoping I could do something like this:But it's not working.What exactly IS the issue?What are my options? , , ? What is best practice in this scenario, and could you provide a working example?
Try reading up on these things, SQLAlchemy in Flask and Sessions in Flask. You can use both of these. The database, or SQLAlchemy, will store the card indefinitely until you delete them. The session will store the cards on the client side until they delete them, either the browser is closed or the client manually deletes a session. For the problem you are trying to solve, a card dealing game, I suggest using sessions. Here is a bit of example code.
