I have a project and I try to find correct algoritm and method for that.I have a file called ADUserIPmap.txt which is located one of the Active Directory's path.This file includes lines like this:I have to replace third column (1482857637) with givenName of that user. And this givenName data comes from a powershell command output like this.Python script will work on Active Directory and powershell command as well.After all of these steps done, I will send these informations to a firewall with xml api.Question1) ADUserIPmap.txt is a log file and lines will increase constantly. I don't want to read all file again and again. What is the correct method for this case? 2) Are there any simple way to get GivenName field from Active DirectoryThanks
Q1) After reading the file the first time, assign the current position to a variable. Then jump there before iterating.If you need to persist , use pickleIf you want to persist multiple things, put them in a dictionary and pickle the dictionary.Q2)  Looks like there are a few active directory libraries in PyPi
