I have the following problem:I need to load several data files. The files are named by my device like:With other words, there are no leading zeros. Therefore, if I get the filenames viathey are ordered alphabetically, meaning "meas100.dat" will be the first one. This is obviously not what I want to achieve. The question is what is the most elegant way of doing this?The (unelegant) way I came up with is: load the filenamesextract the filenumberorder the filenumber (get the indices)order the filenames with those indices I am pretty sure python has something build in that can do this while loading the files...
Perhaps this will suit your problem:Output:
There is a pythonic way to do this by using pathlib module:this is the files in my ternimal:this is the files in python:looks like the  has do this sort for you, you can take a try.
Using   to get only numbers from filename - and  will use them to sort filenames.result
