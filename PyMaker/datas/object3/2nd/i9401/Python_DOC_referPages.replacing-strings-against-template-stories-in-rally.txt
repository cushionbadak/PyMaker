I can successfully obtain user story information with my Python code; however, I want to replace a specific string located in the details and user story name. For instance, the string could be $projectName and I'd like to replace it with a user inputted value. Is there something which helps to code for this or is there a working example? I am stuck because this isn't necessarily a file to edit and the Hierarchy output also creates a block for me to develop something that works.Here is my code for pulling the data:Here is the output I get, scrubbed, of course:=====================================================So, with PyRal, I would have to send an update to each user story this code pulls, only on the rows which contain the string; however, I would somehow have to store each FormattedID: and the associated Name: field to update, this is where I am stuck, on how to actually store this so it can be iterated over and updated.
