i am just trying to do the basic opening of the file while monitoring whether it's still opened or not, but it just opens it and exits. any suggestions to why that happens? 
This only works on Windows with  because the default program for the extension is used to open the given file, it's the equivalent of using The problem is thatdoes not what you want.  returns  while the program is running, and the exit code of the program when it has finished. If the program were to terminate with an exit code other then 0 before reaching this loop, then it would just keep looping and consuming CPU. If the program is still running or has completed successfully then the loop is not entered at all.Checking wheather a process is still runing using  should be done by checking , or better use .Some programs however allow only one active instance, if you try to start a second instance it will instead open the file in the open window and exit immediately. In that case there is no easy way to know wheather the file is still open in the application. So the behaviour also depends on the registered program.
Don't use  to open a file. As you can see in the documentation  it is used to run child programs in a new process. But if you want to open a file for reading doThe file will be opened at the beginning of the  statement and closed afterwards.
 is meant to create new processes (as in, execute another program from your python script), not open files. You can use the  module to execute the function that opens the file in a different process, instead ofuse:and change function  so it opens a file and asks about it's state. Something like this:
