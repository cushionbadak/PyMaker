Natural Text
I want to open a series of sub-folders in a folder and find some text files and print some lines of the text files. I am using this:This working perfectly only with in one folder but this cannot access the sub-folders as well.so i heard about the os.walk() module. Does anyone know how I can use the os.walk() module to to access sub-folders and extract and paste a particular line in a separate txt file ?
Using  and generator expression to get all file paths in current directory recursively: in the above code is a list of file names. You need to iterate them to get file paths. is used to make a path by joining parent directory  and file name .
