For example I have a comma delimited string , and I want to get an array with each entry prepended with a value :I know it is possible to split the string using .split() and then to iterate the resulting array to build a new array with the value prepended for each entry, but I was wondering if there was a more elegant way to do that in Python ?
First, you split the string by the comma to get a list of strings:Next, you want to add something to each value in that list. The most elegant way to do that is to have a list comprehension in which you just prefix the value. That leaves you the following code:
For splitting a string you can use  function (passing the the separator you want to split by) And then to apply a function to all the elements you can define a function that applies you logic to a element and then by using it with  function to apply it to all elements in list.Example (Python 3) -
