I'm studying about Python using pyDev and realized that when I have an  and want to use a value of it, pyDev does not suggest which value to use. For example:it does not suggest  after , and neither other values. What should I do?
Thank you for your answers. I found what I wanted in enum documentation.Having a AutoNumber class that extends Enum and numerates automatically overriding new().
For the short-term use the class syntax.For the long-term ask the PyDev folks to support the  style.
