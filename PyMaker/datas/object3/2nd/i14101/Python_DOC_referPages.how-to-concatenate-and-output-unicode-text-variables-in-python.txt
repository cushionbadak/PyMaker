My title terms might not be correct and may be a reason why I can't find this simple thing from websites.I have a list of string variables. How do I actually concatenate them and output a real unicode sentence in Python?I will get only strings like '\u280F' but not real character. But if I do:correct symbols shows up, which is: ‚†èAnd I'm sure there is a more elegant way to get a range of the symbols from u2800 to u283F...
Conver the strings to integers (using  with  16), the use  ( if you're using Python 3.x) to convert the number into unicode object.
If you are stuck with  input; you could use  codecs, to get Unicode ():Otherwise, generate range of integers directly:It produces the same output in this case.
