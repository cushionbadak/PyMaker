I have my own name saved as a string under the variable name.I want to find the character code for each character in my name and then add them all up using a for loop. This is what I've started with, no idea if it's staring about the right way
Kasra solution is the correct one, but you asked for a "for loop"...so here it is:or
You can use  to apply the  function on all of your characters and then use  function to calculate the sum :You can also use a list comprehension to apply  on your characters but when you are dealing with built-in function  has slightly more performance! So I suggest .Also for longest strings you can use a generator expression within ,that doesn't create a list and can save a lots of memory:
