I am working on a small command line application based on the Cmd Python module. I can't see how to show the last command in the console prompt so that it can be edited by the user and re-submitted. The question is not about how to store the last command. It is about how to shows it in the prompt and allow the user to edit it
From the docs for cmd,  has a parameter:Cmd.use_rawinput A flag, defaulting to true. If true, cmdloop() uses  raw_input() to display a prompt and read the next command; if false,  sys.stdout.write() and sys.stdin.readline() are used. (This means that  by importing readline, on systems that support it, the interpreter  will automatically support Emacs-like line editing and command-history  keystrokes.)I.e., you can use the up arrow to bring up the last command:In the final line above, I pressed the up arrow and it remembered my last command.
Just use readline library. You can find example in python doc:https://docs.python.org/3/library/readline.html
