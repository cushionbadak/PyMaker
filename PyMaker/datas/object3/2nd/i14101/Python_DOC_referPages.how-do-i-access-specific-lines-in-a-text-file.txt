This question already has an answer here:Reading specific lines only                    25 answers                How do I access specific lines (ie #10-#20) in a text file? I tried  but it doesn't work.
You can do this with .Whether you should use  or  for the first argument to  depends on whether you consider the first line of a file line 0, or line 1. Also note that the strings in  will each end with a newline character.
I think this is what you want will now contain lines from line#10 to line#20
