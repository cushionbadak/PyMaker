(Update) I need to find stationary distribution of a Markov Chain with 4.5 million states. It means I need to solve a linear system with 4.5 million equations. Each state is a vector of size 6. I am trying to store each state in a list. The following in part of my effort in creating all admissible states. I am trying to loop through a big set of numbers and create a set of vectors. Here is a simplified version of my code:which will give me:my question is: is there a neater, nicer, more efficient way of doing this in Python?Thank you
If you are looking for a one line code that would create the same vector , you can use list comprehension in python.Example -Though I do not think this is in anyway neater or more efficient.Though after some testing using  , we can see that list comprehension may be a little bit faster -
I completely don't get what you are trying to archive with your lists.You could get the same output with this:
