My title is not very descriptive, but it is difficult to explain it in one line. Hopefully you can see what I mean below: Here is the dictionary: I want to work with each key in the dictionary, go over the list (value for that key in the dictionary) and do some tests, if the test passes, then I want to recover the elements that passed with its corresponding pair. Again, here is an example below to explain what I mean (I apologise for not making it very clear yet, please bear with me):so what I was expecting is/ desired output:I haven't worked it out correctly though, I am getting an index error for the taxid[i]:What I am achieving is that the threshold check works correctly, but I think I am going wrong with the indexing, maybe the way I do the i =+1 and instead of printing the corresponding id of the pair, it can't correspond them correctly and it gives me errors. Please comment where I need to give any further clarification, and your help is greatly appreciated. I have been trying to solve it for some time. Thank you. 
You're using  and increasing it every time you see a score, so it's the total number of scores you've looked at so far (regardless of the key), not the location of the id corresponding to a score.  You could fix this, but @MorganThrapp's idea to change the data structure is a good one.  Using a dictionary or a namedtuple would be a better idea, because then you wouldn't have to remember what each element in a tuple corresponds to (i.e. does score come first or does id?), but you could use  to pair up values:and sogiveswhere we don't have to use indices at all.
The initialization and incrementation of  variable is done at wrong places.See the corrected version:Output:
