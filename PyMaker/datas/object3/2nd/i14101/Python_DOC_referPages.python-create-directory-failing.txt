I am using some pretty standard code:I remove the directory and the check at  drops through to . I one-step beyond that and hit the error message at . However, when I check, the directory was created successfully. What am I missing??
 does not indicate whether it succeeded through its return value: it always returns . is -y, therefore,  is always , which triggers your  code path.Fortunately, you don't need any of that. If  fails, it'll throw an .You should catch the exception, not check the return value:If no  is thrown, that means the directory was successfully created.
You don't need to call  (or );  has  parameter.And as @Thomas Orozco mentioned, you shouldn't check ' return value because  indicates errors by raising an exception instead:Note: Unlike -based solution; it raises an error if the path exists but it is not a directory (or a symlink to a directory).There could be issues with the  parameter, see the note for versions of Python before 3.4.1
