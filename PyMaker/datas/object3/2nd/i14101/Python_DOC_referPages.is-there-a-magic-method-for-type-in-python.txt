I was wondering if there was a magic method in Python that supported the type() built-in function, that would allow you to set a custom value to be returned.
No, there is no such method. An instance's type is not something you can dynamically alter when querying for it, as that would be type-specific behaviour, but you suddenly cannot determine the type that is defining that behaviour!You can assign a different class to , but then you'd materially alter the behaviour of that instance, and it is not the instance itself that then changes type when  is applied to the instance.Rather than using , use the  and  functions instead, and use abstract base types; it is the type object that is then responsible for claiming a specific class or instance as a subclass or instance of the given type, respectively. They can do this via the  and  hooks.
