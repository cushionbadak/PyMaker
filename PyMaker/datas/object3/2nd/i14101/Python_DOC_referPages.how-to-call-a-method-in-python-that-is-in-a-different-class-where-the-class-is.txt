I have a file named  which contains a class called . I have a second file named , which contains a class named .  class contains 2 methods. One called  which clears the list box in the main window, and one called  which is a recursive function for writing the scouts stored in a file to the list box. I would like to be able to call the  and  from my class . How do i achieve this?upon trying  then calling  i received the error that  requires arg In my  file:In :In  class:My Error:Thank you in advance
This question has been asked times and times again - and is nothing Python-specific. To call a method on an instance of another class, you need to have a reference to this instance. The very obvious solution is to pass this reference, either at call time:or at instanciation time:Note that in both cases,  doesn't need to know about class  - it just gets an instance as param and that's it. So if  and  live in different modules, the module containing  doesn't have to import the one containing :which avoids the circular import error you obviously have given your traceback.
At the beginning of , put the lineThen you can just call, e.g., EDIT after OP posted code sample: is an instance method and as such can only be called on an instance, not on the class itself. You first have to instantiate an object of type .
Based on your question and on your comment to @niceguy's answer, it's clear that the solution to your problem is to go read the python tutorial: Very soon you'll learn about modules (including ) and classes (including , and calling class methods).Edit: If you already understand about classes and instances, then here's your problem spelled out: Your class name is , your instance is . You should be calling your functions on , e.g. ; not on .
