I have a file that has an obnoxious preface to the header. So it looks like this:I want to  skip past everything and use the tab sep header names for my code. This is what I have so far:This code gets this error:I tried to print the rows, to see where I was in the file, and I changed the "range(14)" to range 5, but when I print the row, I get this:So I am not really sure the right way to skip those top lines. Any help would be appreciated. 
A  reads the first line from the file when it's instantiated, to get the headers for subsequent rows. Therefore it uses  as the header row, then you skip the next 14 rows.Instead, skip the rows before creating the :
You could wrap the  with an  iterator object to slice-off the lines of the preface when creating the , instead of the providing it directly to the constructor. This works because the  constructor will accept any "object which supports the iterator protocol and returns a string each time its  method is called" according to the csv docs. This also applies to s because they use an underlying  instance internally.
