I am using concurrent.futures to multithread an app I am writing.I start the app by importing IPAddress from netaddr:Next, I take some input files and I pass them all into my function being multithreaded:Then I wait get the results as completed and append them to an output var:The issue I have is that I keep getting the excetion from future:Here is the ip_compare function:Any idea why futures is not recognizing the loaded module?When my IDE stops the execution of the script because of the error, I can clearly see that IPAddress is defined in the memory:
Ok so the issue was that I was importing netaddr from within main:I moved this to the top of the script and everything worked fine. I am curious as to why this worked though, if anyone can answer that.
