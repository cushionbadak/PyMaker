Natural Text
For example, I have:I want it to print only I am new to python. Could someone help me with this? 
We can filter out the unwanted characters with :Or, if you don't want multiple spaces or leading/trailing spaces:
You can split the string by the undesired character groups and then proceed to join and strip space: 
Edit1To correct misunderstanding I can suggest use regexp for this.Edit2Comments for code above.re.sub() function replaces by second parameter all tokens that match given pattern. Quick training you can pass here regexone.comThat part of code finds all yours symbols using given regex and replaces them by empty string.That regex has a folowing parts[^] - that tells find all symbols that not between [ and ]. ^ symbol used for negation.\^\^ - your ^^ symbols shielded using backslashes\|\| - your || symbols\&\& - your && symbolsAll of them grouped using "or" statement ( "|" symbol )In the end you have ^^ | || | && without backslashes tells, find ^^ or || or &&and in [^ ^^ | || | &&], finds every symbol that not ^^ or || or &&But if you coding at first time, or you don't know python syntax yet, i recommend you just learn python at simplest examples, and after that learn regex syntax.
