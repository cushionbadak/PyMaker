Given an list of integers does exists a default method find the max distance between values?So if I have this arrayThe max step between the values is 15. Does the list object has a method for do that?
No,  objects have no standard "adjacent differences" method or the like. However, using the  function mentioned in the  recipes:...you can (concisely and efficiently) define
No, but it's trivial to code:
You can do:This uses  and . It computes the difference between all consecutive elements and returns the max of those.
That is using pure python and gives you the desired output "15".If you like to work with "numpy" you could do:
The list object does not. However, it is pretty quick to write a function that does that:Or if you prefer even shorter:
It is possible to use the  function, but it is not that elegant as you need some way to keep track of the previous value:The solution works by returing the previous value and the accumulated max calculation as a tuple for each iteration.Also what is the expected outcome for [10,20,30,5]? Is it 10 or 25? If 25 then you need to add  to your calculation.
