I am using python 3.4.2, windows 8.1 and I have a GUI "reload 0.py" that sums two values when I press a button, and shows the result in a box. I have another GUI "reload1.py" with a button. I want to open and "reload0.py" when I press the button in "reload1.py".I am using this in the buttonbut I am getting the following errorIf I run "reload0.py" alone, it works, if I put the command in python shell, it works, but when I put the same command in the "reload1.py" button it does not work.
I've never seen anyone code callback functions and guis using exec so i cannot tell you why it is not working.You should put the code in result0.py into a class or function,That way you can simply import the function/class and use it in a callbackLet us assume the code below is result0.pyNow in result1.py we import the SomeWindow and bind it to the callbackIf you are just getting started with gui programming, you might want to take a look at the model view controller (MVC) design patternhttp://tkinter.unpythonic.net/wiki/ToyMVCSome good tkinter references are: http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/http://infohost.nmt.edu/tcc/help/pubs/tkinter/web/index.htmlhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#module-tkinterAlso tkinter 8.6 was released in March 2015 but most documentation and tutorials for 8.5 still apply.
