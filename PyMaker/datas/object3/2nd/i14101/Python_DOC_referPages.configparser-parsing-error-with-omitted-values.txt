I'm using Python's old-fashioned  module to read config-files from the filesystem.To check whether a user-provided config-file uses correct 'syntax' I compare all section keys and subkeys to a reference config-file  containing all allowed section keys and subkeys with ommited values.Parsing the user-specific file is not a big deal and works pretty well. However, reading the reference-config leads to a  as follows:The file  contains of the following lines:To read the above mentioned config-file I use the following code:However, ommiting values in a config file should not cause a ParsingError since the docs tell:Values can be omitted, in which case the key/value delimiter may also  be left out.Update:I just copied and pasted the contents of the given example from the docs into my  file and got a similar ParsingError with NoValue-keys not containing any whitespaces:
The easy way:according to configparse docs
