Learning python I encountered the following problem. I already have some list with integer numbers (for example ). Then I'm trying to create list (for example ) with following numbers pattern:Example:Here is my first implementation:Here is my second implementation:I guess second one is much better because it does not contain append method and initialize list with concrete size. Also  consists with float point number which is not correct. I wonder whether there is a simpler version of the implementation of this algorithm. After that algorithm I'm creating :Maybe I can reverse  list during creating  for  "on fly" like  works in for looping, so that I can simplify algorithm above.
If numpy is an option, you can do it with :
You can use  and 
Why can't you just do
