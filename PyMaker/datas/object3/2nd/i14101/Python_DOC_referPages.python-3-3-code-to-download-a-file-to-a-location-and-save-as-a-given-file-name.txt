Natural Text
For example I would like to save the .pdf file @ http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.07825 with the filename: 'Data Assimilation- A Mathematical Introduction' at the location 'D://arXiv'.But I have many such files. So, my input is of the form of a .csv file with rows given by (semi-colon is the delimiter): I found some code here: https://github.com/ravisvi/IDMBut that is a bit advanced for me to parse. I want to start with something simpler. The above seems to have more functionality than I need right now - threading, pausing etc.So can you please write me a very minimal code to do the above:save the file 'Data Assimilation- A Mathematical Introduction' from 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.07825' at 'D://arXiv'?I think I will be able to generalize it to deal with a .csv file.Or, hint me a place to get started. (The github repository already has a solution, and it is too perfect! I want something simpler.) My guess is, with Python, a task as above should be possible with no more than 10 lines of code. So tell me important ingredients of the code, and perhaps I can figure it out. Thanks!
I would use the  module, you can just .Then, the code is simple:
Using Python 3.6.5Here is a method that can create a folder and save the file in a folder. dataURL - Complete URL path data_path - Where the file needs to be saved. tgz_path - Name of the datafile with the extension.
