I've been having trouble combining to different listsI'm trying to get a list of names and a list of scores, while taking the top n students scores with the names showing.I'm also unsure where to put the return function in it
I'm going to assume you have some data that looks like:and you're trying to get the top  (for ease of use, we'll use ) names, as sorted by score. There's lots of ways to do this, the easiest way is to use a dictionary. We want to end up with:And we can do that in a few different ways, but  is crucial no matter how. The easiest to understand is probably using a dict comprehension.More compact, but possibly harder to understand, is using the  constructorNow all you have to do is to get the dictionary in some sort of a sorted state. There's a bajillion different questions on Stack Overflow on how to sort a dictionary, which I will leave you to read to understand why what I'm doing makes sense, but:This should give you something like:So slice off the first  items to get  tuples.(this also uses string formatting, which is worth learning on its own)
