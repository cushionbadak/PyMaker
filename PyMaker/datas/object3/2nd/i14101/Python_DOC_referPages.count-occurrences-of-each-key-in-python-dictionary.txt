I have a python dictionary object that looks somewhat like this:Now for each 'sign' key, I'd like to count how many times each value occurs.This however, prints number of times 'sign' appears in the dictionary, instead of getting the value of the  and counting the number of times a particular value appears.For example, the output I'd like to see is:And so on. What should I change to get the desired output?
Use  and its  method:
You can use  module, with a simple generator expression, like thisThis will give you a dictionary which has the  as keys and their number of occurrences as the values.You can do the same with a normal dictionary, like thisThe  method, accepts a second parameter, which will be the default value to be returned if the key is not found in the dictionary. So, if the current sign is not in , it will give  instead.
