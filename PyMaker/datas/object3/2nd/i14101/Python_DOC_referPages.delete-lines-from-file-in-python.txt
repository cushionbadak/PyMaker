I have a file formated like thisï¼šI want to process the file so that all blocks with second line is 0 can be deleted and left the file asI tried the snippet below, but it can only see the 0/1 then remove the line, but I want to delete the line with floats above 0/1, not the line with floats below 0/1.Is there any other way I can choose which line to include and which not?Or maybe there's a way to process the file backwards?
