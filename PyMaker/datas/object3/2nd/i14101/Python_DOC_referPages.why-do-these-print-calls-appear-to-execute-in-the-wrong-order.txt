weird.py:Python session:Why does "toplevel" print before "f"?This doesn't happen if the  or the  are removed.
Because stdout and stderr are line buffered. They buffer characters and only flush when you have a complete line.By setting  you ensure there is no complete line and the buffer isn't flushed until later when the Python interactive interpreter outputs  and flushes the buffer explicitly.If you remove  you output to  again, and you printed  as  adds a newline, thus flushing the  buffer.You can explicitly force a flush by setting the  argument to the  function (Python 3.3 and up) or by calling .
