I am trying my hand at writing my first  but am a little lost. I would like this  to check that a  came from a particular address before executing the main function.At the moment I have:@app.route /venue/login (this code has been simplified)1) I am sure there are a few issues with what I am doing but I first need to understand why I am getting the error:I thought I was only passing an  to .2) Are my  statements correct?Any help would be greatly appreciated!
Consider using Flask-Login instead to handle authentication and redirect if the user is not logged in.  (Or closely examine how it works.)  It handles this much more robustly than the function you've written.The function you've written is not a decorator, and has many other issues.  First, it needs to be properly structured.  It needs 3 layers:Layer 1 function takes the the url parameter and produces a decorator.Layer 2 function decorates a function and returns a wrapped function.Layer 3 is the decorated view. contains the entire url, not just the path matching a route.  Use  to get the path.  There is no guarantee that a client's browser will send a referrer, or the correct referrer, so you should not rely on this value.The decorated function needs to accept arbitrary arguments that may be passed to the view.  The decorated function should properly wrap the original function by using .It is not a good idea to just render different templates from the same view.  Rather than rendering  or , you should be redirecting to the relevant views.  If you need to pass messages along with the redirect, put them in the .
The key to understanding python decorator is this:is equivalent with:Now you can understand why your code does not work: returns a function  that takes no argument, so  can not be a decorator.You can define a decorator that take no arguments with 2 levels of inner functions. To make a decorator that takes argument(s), you need another level of inner function, as davidism's code shows.Here is what happens:
