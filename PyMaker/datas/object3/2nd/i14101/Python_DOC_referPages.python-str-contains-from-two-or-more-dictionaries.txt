I want to check if a string contains one or more values from two dictionaries.For some reason, it only writes  for the first match in the dictionaries, i.e. . For and , nothing happens.I know that I can combine the dictionaries to one as seen below, but I would prefer not to.The data is written and retrieved with help of a .The code copies the column  to column  and by doing this is supposed to substitute each cell to  if it contains ,  or .
Why don't you start by breaking down this data, like this:Now, it's much easier to work with these strings. Given this is a sample of your dictionaries:You can exploit "dictonary views" which behave like sets in Python:So now, we have a set-like object we can use to filter on the data and set "Equity":If you are concerned about not joining these dictionaries like that, you might want to consider using something like a ChainMap: https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.ChainMap That's Python 3 standard library, but backports to Python 2 should exist.
