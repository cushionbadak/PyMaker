I'm just trying to implement a simple Observer pattern in Python and am running into an issue. This is my code:In here, I would like to eliminate the busy waiting in Observer.wait() (the line time.sleep(5). How can I perhaps signal to this function?
You don't need to have the  function at all -- just do what you need to in  (process the data, log the data, mutilate/spindle/fold the data, whatever).If you are using threading, check out the Queue.Queue class:  it allows for multiple threads to synchronize on data availability without busy-waiting -- just have the  method push data into a , and  can wait on it.  Note that there is probably a more elegant solution using some of the other features found in the Threading module.As a side note, you also don't need the double-underscore in  -- just  is fine.
You can use  to suspend a function at one point, waiting for some value (blocked, without doing busy waiting).On the other side you call  to resume its execution:Note the additional  at the end of  which prevents a  exception from being d when you call .
