Say I have some lists like so:And I append them to a larger list:And now I have smaller lists like such:How would I iterate through my 'myBigList' list, and pull out the first value of all the smaller lists and store those values in A, the second values of all my shorter lists, in B, and the shorter of all the third in c? I appreciate all the help.
