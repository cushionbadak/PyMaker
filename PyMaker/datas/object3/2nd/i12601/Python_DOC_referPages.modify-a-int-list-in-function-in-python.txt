I want to rotate k element in a list in python. For example, n = 7, k = 3, and the array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is rotated to [5,6,7,1,2,3,4].Here is the statement I wrote. It seems to work in the command line.But when I encapsulate it in a function like:I want to modify nums directly, but this function doesn't work.I know that I can use a for loop like:but I want to know why the previous method doesn't work?
What you want is a slice assignment:This mutates the list that was passed in, so the change is visible after the function returns.  Assigning just to  merely makes  point to a different list inside the function; it doesn't affect the original list.
Are you sure you want to modify nums?  You need not create a separate list even if you do not modify nums.  One advantage of the following approach is that it will work with any sequence.If you insist on modifying nums as you say, you can still do so.  E.g.,
The  that is inside the function is only within that function. So you need to return it from that function. One way is like this (python 2.7 code, add parentheses to  if you use 3.x):
