I'm just learning Python but have about 16 years experience with PERL and PHP. I'm trying to get the output of ngrep and write it to a log file using Python while also tailing the log file. I've seen some examples online but some seem old and outdated and others use shell=True which is discouraged.In perl I just use something similar to the followingI've gotten tail to work but ngrep doesn't. I'd like to be able to run this infinately and output the stream from ngrep to the log file after filtering. I couldn't get the output from ngrep to show in stdout so that's as far as I've gotten. I was expecting to be able to see the data file tail as the log file was updated and see the output from ngrep. For now i was just using bash to run the following. Thanks!Here's what I got so far...Updated This seems to work now. I wouldn't know how to improve on it though. 
To emulate your perl code in Python:It starts  process passing  variable and appends the output to the log file while allowing you to modify it in Python. See Python: read streaming input from subprocess.communicate() (there could be buffering issues: check whether  supports  option like  and if you want to tail  then pass  to , to enable line-buffering (only usable in the text-mode) or call  after ).You could emulate  in pure Python too.If you want to read output from several processes concurrently (,  in your case) then you need to able to read pipes without blocking e.g., using threads, async.io.
