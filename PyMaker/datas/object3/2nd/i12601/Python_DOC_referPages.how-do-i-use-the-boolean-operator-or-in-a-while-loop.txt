For this while loop, I want it continue with these conditions:- line is not equal to '\n'OR- line is not equal to ''Why doesn't this statement represent the above situation?
You have to readas The empty string evaluates to  in a boolean context, so your expression is equivalent towhich is equivalent toYou either need to write the expression like @houcros suggested, asor as I would suggest, aswhich I think is easier to read. In your particular case, for this particular program, a simplewould suffice, too - if  consists only of whitespace (check if that is what you actually want),  will be , which evaluates to  as already mentioned. 
While you say you want " is not equal to  OR  is not equal to ", I think you really want " is not equal to  AND line is not equal to ".  Otherwise, your condition is trivially true (because  cannot both be equal to  and be empty).Therefore, I believe the condition you are looking for is:or equivalently,
I believe it should be
