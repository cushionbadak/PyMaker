Is it possible to assign a value and increment the assigned value on the same line in Python? Something like this:Edit:I need it in a context where I'm creating an Excel sheet:Edit 2: Solution:It's not possible, but I have created an easy fix:
No that’s not possible in Python.Assignments (or augmented assignments) are statements and as such may not appear on the right-hand side of another assignment. You can only assign expressions to variables.The reason for this is most likely to avoid confusions from side effects which are easily caused in other languages that support this.However, normal assignments do support multiple targets, so you can assign the same expression to multiple variables. This of course still only allows you to have a single expression on the right-hand side (still no statement). In your case, since you want  and  to end up with the same value, you could write it like this:Note that since you’re doing  you are no longer using an augmented assignment and as such could have different effects for some types (not for integers though).
Not a pretty one but you can do something like this.
You can do it using a function,here I use the lambda function. There is no exact python equivalent of  or  in c.
