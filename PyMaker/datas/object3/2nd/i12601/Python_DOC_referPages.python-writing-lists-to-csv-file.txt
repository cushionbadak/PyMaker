I’m teaching myself programming, using Python as my initial weapon of choice. I have learnt a few basics and decided to set myself the challenge of asking the user for a list of names, adding the names to a list and then finally writing the names to a  file.Below is my code. It works. My question is what would you do differently, i.e. how could this code be improved for readability and efficiency. Would you approach the situation differently, structure it differently, call different functions? I am interested in, and would appreciate a great deal, the feedback from more experienced programmers.In particular, I find certain parts clunky; such as having to specify to the user the required format for data entry. If I were to simply request the data (name age location) without the commas however, then each record, when written to , would simply end up as one record per cell (Excel) – this is not the desired result.    
I try to write down your demands:Parse the input string according to its structure (whatever) and save results into a listFormat the result into CSV-format stringwrite the string to a CSV fileFirst of all, I would highly recommend you to read the a Python string operation and formatting tutorial like Google Developer Tutorial. When you understand the basic operation, have a look at official documentation to see available string processing methods in Python.Your logic to write the code is right, but there are two meaningless lines:It's not necessary to lower "done" since it is already lower-case.Here you open and close the questList.csv every loop, which is useless and costly. You could open the file at the beginning, then save all lines with a for loop, and close it at the end.This is a sample using the same logic and different input format:Be aware that there are many ways to fulfil your demands, with different logics and methodologies.
