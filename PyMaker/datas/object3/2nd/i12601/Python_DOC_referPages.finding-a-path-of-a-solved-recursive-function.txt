In the code below, I got the optimal value of a recursive function that I set.Now I want to get the values that helped build it - I mean, know which choice (or a "ride" (this is my decision)) was used in each step, and return that also as a string/array/somehow.thestory : i have 6 rides, in every step i need to choose whether to go on the ride im on again, or switch. every ride has a fun rate for each time i go on it and i want to maximize the fun. right now i have the optimal value but not the rides that i went on that led me to itThe function F is the main focus here.
Your function F can return a pair of two values: first - optimal answer, second - optimal path as a list of indexes.
