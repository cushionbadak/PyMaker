I'm trying to re-structure a json file with python. The json is an json-array where each element is a dictionary. In these dictionaries there are a lot of repeated values for some key that is important to me, so I want to put all the other keys of every dictionary in an array for the same value of the important key, creating a json with a different structure.Then for each different value of some key I want initialize an array. The problem is that the number of different values for this key is a priori unknown. An example in code that I want:P.S.: if you know a more efficient way to re-structure a json please let me a link, example or something. You will notice I'm "very beginner" with python.EDIT: example of input and output
