I was testing my code and I thought that this piece of code was correct:but it's not, since when I input "a", this is what I get:ValueError does not catch InvalidOperation.I don't want the program to stop because of that, I want it to keep asking for input until it satisfies the condition. How do I do it?

You can catch any of the following exceptions to deal with the  exception, from the specific to the (very) generic: is not in that hierarchy, but catching  would also catch  since it is a subclass. Generally speaking, you rarely want to catch  since that catches all possible exceptions, including  and .You can catch multiple exceptions in the same handler:would catch both your original  exceptions, and all signal exceptions raised by the  module.
