So this is what I have:And I want to make a new list where the sublists only have the elements that are shared with ALL the previous sublists.It should look like this:I tried converting the integers to strings and iterating over it, but I can't seem to get the right result. I'm new to python, so any help is much appreciated!
If you don't care about the order of the items, you can use a  based approach:Here,  contains the resulting list of lists. The important line is  which calculates the intersection between the previous and the current item.
You can use accumulatewhich producesbut it doesn't guarantee the items of the sublists will be in the same order.In case you do care about the order of the items, you can do it manuallyOr just ignore sets and use lists instead, but sets are faster, since they are hashed and intersection is a core functionality.
One line answer:The explanation:in the 'st loop,  it should be union the items in .
