This is mostly syntactic sugar but I'd like to access the items of a dictionary as object properties.Example:and I'd like to haveEdit: some code of a potential solution with a nested structure with dot notation: device.property.field
You want  and , though you'll have to roll your own class (I'm not aware of any builtins, though  might work if you don't need to change values much)If you just want to access a sub-dictionary that way, you just change  to Note that  is used after any other lookups fail, but if you want to ensure that your function is called first, you can use Also note that  does not exist on  until after  is called. My initial version of this would throw a maximum recursion depth exceeded, because as you created the class it would go to set  in init, call , which would try to get  so it could set  on it. Naturally it can't find  yet, and so it will try to call  again... which can't find  and round and round it goes.Another option would be to use a class-level variable instead, but that's probably not at all what you want :)
 already exists, it's named :
