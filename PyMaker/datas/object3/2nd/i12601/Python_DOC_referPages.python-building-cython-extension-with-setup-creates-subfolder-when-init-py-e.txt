I am trying to compile a simple  module using the following :I have the following folder structure:If I run the following:I get an extra  subfolder like this:But if I remove the  file, I get the  file in the same folder as .I did not find where this behavior is documented, but I would like to keep  in the same folder as  but without having to delete  each time I run . How can I achieve that?
As mentioned in the comments, the  should not live inside your package. As far as I know the build_ext commands has no option (apart from ) to specify a target path. You can find some documentation here. Also this question deals with a similar topic.To adapts the required package structure your package would have to look like:You will get an extension that lives in the verifier package:You can then import verifier_c from the verifier package. For example from  this would look like:You can manage a separate package (and folder) for each Cython extension or create one sub folder that contains all of them. You have to pass the other modules to  as well. It can handle a glob pattern, list of glob patterns or a list of  objects. The latter can be handy to specify cython compiler directives I hope this help :)
