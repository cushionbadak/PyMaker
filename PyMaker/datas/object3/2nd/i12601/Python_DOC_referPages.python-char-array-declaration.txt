Is there a way to declare a char array of a fixed size in python as in C for exampleI also want to initializa all the characters with NULL.
You can't have a fixed size string.  (Python doesn't work like that).  But you can easily initialize a string to 100 characters:
You can use array (an array in python have fixed type signature, but not fixed size):Notice that i initialize the default to '\0' couse in python you must initialize it with a value, and array have not fixed size (it is dynamic) but this will do.Another option is to initialize the array and appende the values later, so instead of full of NULL (None in python) it will be just empty and grow at your will:
Another way is to use numpy.chararray:Results:
