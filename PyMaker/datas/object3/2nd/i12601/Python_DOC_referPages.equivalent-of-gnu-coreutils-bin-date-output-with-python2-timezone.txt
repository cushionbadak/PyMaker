I want to have a datetime formatted like  in Python2.  If I do it naively with  the timezone part appears empty.  I've learned that Python2 doesn't have support for  objects, but there's a 3rd-party  module.Unfortunately, in order to construct a  with  I still need to name the timezone explicitly.  What I would like to have is a combination of  and a default , so that I get current time in local timezone.Compare the following three outputs:The second one is what I want, sans the need to specify the timezone explicitly.  On the other hand,  doesn't need any hint to look the timezone up:Looking at the source code for  I can see that when compiled with glibc it relies on  field being part of , but otherwise will require  environment variable to be set.Any ideas how to make this work with Python2 w/o hard-coding the timezone?
On a platform with  (non-Windows), to print the current local time in a given format:To reproduce it portably, you need  that finds  tzinfo that corresponds to your local timezone:,  are not portable.This code works even during a DST transition when the local time may be ambiguous.
