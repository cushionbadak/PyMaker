I am new to python. i am learning some basic stuff. I was doing some operation on python list like this  when i execute this piece of code it gives me only one empty list like this. Why it is not giving me 3  empty list? some what like this  
It says right in the Python docs or  equivalent to adding  to itself  timeswhere  is a sequence and  is an . For exampleThis is consistent with other sequences as well, such as If you wanted a list of 3 empty lists you could say
it doesn't multiply lists it's multiply items inside the listfor example
The rules of arithmetic(operators in programming) still apply, you can't multiple with '0' or empty value and get something different, you get the original value that you had before.
