Natural Text
In the Example 5 of  I ran into a problem. I went ahead and converted the inches to centimeters and the pounds to kilograms. I ran into an error though with the formatter and the syntax error read . My inches to cm and pounds to kg is fine but it didn't show the variable in the string. It looked like this:I was having a hard time posting the variables because it wants to be posted a certain way. The variables aren't the issue I'm confused why my variable didn't print using the formatter. I even tried it with  instead of  but it still wouldn't print the name variable. Can someone tell me what I did wrong?
use :
Your string formatting is acting on this :As  is not found in the above string, the interpreter fails.A way to do what you want :Or if you'd like to show  on 2 digits.
You can do in two common ways - Using the old way ():References: https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#string-formattingUsing the new way () References: https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#string-formattingPlease note using  is a good practice since it's the new way. You can read more about these on this website: https://pyformat.info/ 
if you want to keep your syntax:the string referenced in the first print section needs to follow immediately.
