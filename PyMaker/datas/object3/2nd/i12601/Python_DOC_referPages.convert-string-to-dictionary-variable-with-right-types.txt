Is there a simple way to retrieve them with the correct types?Any advice would be helpful and deeply appreciated.
If you only have to deal with basic data types, save and load your data JSON-serialized. will be {'baz': 42, 'biz': True, 'foo': 'bar'}
I would use the  module to  Python data structures as serializable data and then .
