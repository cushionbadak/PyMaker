This question already has an answer here:Return None if Dictionary key is not available                    11 answers                So the above represents a common pattern in Javascript for accessing the items of an object.What is the most commonly used equivalent practice in Python for accessing items of a dict?Would it be like so?If not, what is the best practice? Thanks.
