7.2  Write a program that prompts for a file name, then opens that file and reads through the file, looking for lines of the form:Count these lines and extract the floating point values from each of the lines and compute the average of those values and produce an output as shown below.You can download the sample data at http://www.pythonlearn.com/code/mbox-short.txt when you are testing below enter mbox-short.txt as the file name.This is what I did and got the output but is it the right way to do it?:However, in few other sides, this one, and GitHub the code has been written differently. Can anyone explain it to me?1)What does  do here? Remove blank spaces and print it on the next line right? So how does that help? And what will  be then? Sorry is this sounds silly but this is my 3rd day into Python and I'm just trying to learn.2) Lots others have used sum this way:How does this work?
 will split a single string into multiples as a list, using either blank space or whatever character you pass as the parameter. By taking  you're using the second of the resulting strings, since indexes start at 0. will ignore leading spaces, so if you split on  and it leaves some spaces it doesn't matter.
 split a string into a list. Check the examples in the document for more deatils. By the way: is list index in this case. As the above example:It's:: Return a floating point number constructed from a number or string .It's easy to understand:If you don't do the convert, Python will raise  when you run  between string object and float object like the above example.And however,  ignores spaces. So:
In your file input you have  always appearing like - . So there is space due to which your  splits the required line like this:Since by default space is argument for split command.
