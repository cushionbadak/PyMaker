My code :For line 5 it gives me this error :TypeError : randint() takes exactly 3 arguments (4 given)I am trying to create 2 random numbers with 1 random operation and input it together for the user.When I input the question how will python know if the answer is right or wrong? Or do I have to say:
 only takes 2 arguments and choice a number between them randomly. You need use  in this case like: gives you  (or something like that) because  is a string, not a variable when you use it. I think you mean:To check the answer is correct or not, you can simply use  here like below (Don't always use it since it's dangerous. However you can always use  - a safe version of  instead, but actually it's useless in this case):Remember,  is important here., actually it runs string as Python code. For example:The dangerous part of it is, it can run everything if it's Python code! Another example:So we can do something dangerous like . Hmm...don't really try it.Anyways,  is more safe since you can't use it to run function. For example:
Maybe this will do:
You have a couple of issues here. One is that you are concatenating the string "oper" rather than your variable  in your second  line.The other is the one your error message is referring to. The explanation is that  is intended to generate a random integer. Since you actually want to choose a random operator, you need to choose at random from a group of operators. The approach suggested in @KevinGuan's answer is to use the string '+-*' and use  to select one of the characters. You could also use  if that is easier for you to read.As for your PS, you'll need to figure out the answer to the question in your code. Something like:
