From the Python documentation:https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#the-power-operatorThe power operator binds more tightly than unary operators on its  left; it binds less tightly than unary operators on its right. Thus, in an unparenthesized sequence of power and unary operators, the  operators are evaluated from right to left (this does not constrain  the evaluation order for the operands):  results in .
It is related with operator precedence.Try is being evaluated first and then . Hence, you got .In case of  function,  is being evaluated first.See reference on https://docs.python.org/2/reference/expressions.html#the-power-operator
Since its working on 1 not -1 as a whole. This will give expected result.
