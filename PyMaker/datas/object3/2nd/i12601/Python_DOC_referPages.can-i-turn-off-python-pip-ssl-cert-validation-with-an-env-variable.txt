I have a really bad network that uses a MITM cert to snoop on everyone's convos. This means I need to turn it off, for example, in node I use .Is there a similar way to do this in Python to get around this issue?Pretend I am security deficient (which I am). In my example for node I just configure an environmental variable and be done. This has me using a pem file (which I have no idea where to get). I tried downloading the cert chain but couldn't get it to a pem file. Is there really no more straight forward way to accomplish this? Honestly the way the network is set up I don't think I can even import just one cert.I tried using this...Still confirming that this isn't a red herring thanks to our proxy.Also I've tried adding  and  instead of the command line option. Still get the following result...Also might be important...
I have the exact same issue on my network.  I did this to install pillow:...and it worked great for me.  Hope it helps.
When I need to ignore the certificate validation chains I have used the following code:The above code will tell your SSL instance in your python to ignore unverified errors.  You can also modify your SSL.py file directly to change the behavior.  You may want to also take a look at: https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html#ssl.SSLContext
