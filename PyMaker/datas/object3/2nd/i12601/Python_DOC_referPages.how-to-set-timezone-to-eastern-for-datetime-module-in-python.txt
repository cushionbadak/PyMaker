This question already has an answer here:Python get current time in right timezone [duplicate]                    1 answer                I'm utilizing the datetime module to produce the current date. However, when I run this after 7PM, the current date becomes tomorrow's date. I'm not sure how to set the time zone for the following moduleI've read the documentation but have not found how to set this yet.
Your date is a "naive" datetime, it doesn't have a timezone (). Then you have to localize this datetime by setting a timezone. Use  module to do that.Here is an example :Read pytz documentation for more information
While  doesn't have a way to select a time zone,  does. You need to create a subclass of tzinfo with the information for your desired time zone:For example, the Eastern Standard Time (UTC-5:00, no DST):After making a class for your timezone, you would then get the  you wanted with:(Replace  with your timezone class name)There is also a library available, pytz, that would make this much easier for you.
