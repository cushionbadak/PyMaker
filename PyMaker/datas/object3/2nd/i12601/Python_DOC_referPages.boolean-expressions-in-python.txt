I have a Python script I'm running that tests for the conjunction of two conditions, one of which is easy to verify and the other hard.  Say I write it as  in Python.  Will the interpreter always check  first and then return  if ?  Is the interpreter optimized in general to resolve these kinds of statements as quickly as possible?
Yes, both  and  are so called short-circuit operators. The evaluation of an  expression ends as soon as a value is falsy, the evaluation of an  expression ends as soon as a value is truthy.You can find the relevant documentation here.Here is a piece of code with which you can observe this behavior yourself:So with that in mind, always use .
Just open up a REPL and try:That means that Python indeed evaluates boolean statements lazily.P.S. It's a duplicate
From Python Documentation:The expression x and y first evaluates x; if x is false, its value is  returned; otherwise, y is evaluated and the resulting value is  returned.So as long as  is , the expression will be evaluated to 
Yes, python evaluates if statements lazily. For example, in following code:Python interpreter will first check f() statement and if f() is False, it will immediately jump on else statement.
