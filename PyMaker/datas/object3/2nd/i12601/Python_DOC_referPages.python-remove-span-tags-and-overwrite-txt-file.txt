Natural Text
I want to remove span tags from a text document before I ping it, or else it will fail, but I cannot get it to remove the span tags and either save the file again without the tag or save the new results into a array to save.I have tried to decompose or unwrap and cannot get the results I want.
Ah... return a list, you can't just use  on a list. Instead, just replace  with .And then, your code works, you just need write the output into a file right?
As said above, you don't need to use , only .I'm not sure if extract works, does it?Here's my solution, it simply removes span tags(which I think is what you asked):I am sure there is a way to opened a file for both reading and writing, but I just open and reopened the file twice.
