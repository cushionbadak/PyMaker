I have a method that asks the user to select the file that they want to parse and then it passes that file path to the parse method:All of it seems to be working as intended, but I am getting a:when trying to open filename (line 3 in the code). I have tried to convert filename to to both a string-type and a byte-type and neither seem to work.Here is the output:I am not sure what I am doing wrong. 
It is not the filename to be blamed here, but the fact you are opening the file with:Where the  mode specifies that the file will be opened in binary mode, that is, the contents of the file are treated as  objects. Documentation: appended to the mode opens the file in binary mode: now the data is read and written in the form of bytes objects. This mode should be used for all files that donâ€™t contain text.Then you attempt to search within it with  with a string pattern, and, as the  gracefully points out, this isn't allowed.Removing  from the mode and simply using  will do the trick.Note: Python 2.x doesn't exhibit this behavior on Unix machines. This is a result of the segregation of  and  objects as distinct types in .
