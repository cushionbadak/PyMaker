Defer statements look like function calls, but are not executed until they are popped.Go example of how it works:Outputs: Go example of a usecase:
To emulate  example, you could use :OutputIt is easy to emulate the mutex case:
I've made one there (compatible with 2.x):Source of  is:
Python's with statement serves a similar purpose to Go's defer.The similar code in Python is:
A defer implementation partly inspired by @DenisKolodin answer is available as part of pygolang, 2:
