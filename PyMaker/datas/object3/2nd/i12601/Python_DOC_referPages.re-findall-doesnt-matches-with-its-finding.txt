Natural Text
I have a text file which includes lines like this:I'm selecting a random line with this function:let's say it returned When I check it with this condition, it returns Why these two strings are not matching?
You are expecting that  returns the whole line but it returns the matched part:I suggest you use a pattern that matches the whole line, for example:Your final code would look like:A solution a bit more concise would be:
 does return the match only not the whole . Quoting from Python Docs. :re.findall(pattern, string, flags=0) Return all non-overlapping  matches of pattern in string, as a list of strings. The string is  scanned left-to-right, and matches are returned in the order found. If  one or more groups are present in the pattern, return a list of  groups; this will be a list of tuples if the pattern has more than one  group. Empty matches are included in the result unless they touch the  beginning of another match.DEMO:That's being said, if your requirement is to find if  exits in , then you really don't need  for that:
