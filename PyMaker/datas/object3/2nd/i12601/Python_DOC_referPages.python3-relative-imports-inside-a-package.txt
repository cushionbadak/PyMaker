The problem is that no matter which approach I try, I get this error:I should note that I want this to work "out of the box" which means that I do not want to import things using their absolute paths and I do not want to change my path variable. None of these solutions seem very pythonic and its driving me slowly up the wall. Is there really no way to do this?I've tried a bunch of stuff already, including examples below, but they all seem to produce the same result:And I've tried overwriting the  variable in each of the  files as well as doing the imports as shown here: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#submodulesCan anyone tell me how to structure the imports (for example) in the file  in such a way as to have access to all the classes/functions that are found in mymodule1.py for unit testing the package?
If  contains:And if the unit tests were launched from the directory containing the package (in this case, ) using the following command:The tests are discovered and run correctly with relative imports:
