Natural Text
Currently, the first part of my code works correctly. If it detects that the first character (index 0) is a vowel it stops and adds "yay" to the end of word.The second part is intended to capture consonants up to the first vowel. This works correctly.The problem occurs when I try to take the original word and slice off everything up to the first vowel and create a new substring out of it. This would mean that if the user inputs "hello" it should output "ellohay". I can get "hellohay" but can't figure out how to capture those initial consonants and slice them out.
Using regex would probably be your best bet:This basically non-greedily searches the string until it hits a vowel, and makes two groups of the consonants and the vowel+following string, and manipulates them accordingly. 
if you want to drop all leading chars until you hit a vowel you can use itertools.dropwhile:output: ellohay means we want to drop all chars until we find a character in vowels. If you want to work for upper or lowercase add the uppercase vowels to the set or switch the lambda to 
This code looks rather strange. For instance, the second   is never reached.Instead of this you may want to:Find the position of first vowel - let it be check if  > 0
