On Linux OS, the python code below provides the directories inside the current directory.Because  is deprecated, I'm migrating this call to However for some reason this doesn't work, I get the following error
 only works if globbing is being performed; in , the whole string is being evaluated by a shell which is wrapping the actual  process, and the shell is performing the expansion. When you use the  based , it's passing the literal string  to , and  doesn't expand globs on its own.You could pass a  and  to , but that's just reopening the performance, security and stability holes that  has. Easier is to avoid subprocesses at all, just use the  module or one of // instead of using subprocesses at all.For example, in Python 3.5 with , you can get all the directories in the working directory extremely efficiently with:On earlier versions of Python,  +  can be used to do the same thing slightly less efficiently (it involves a  of each entry which  can avoid, but for small directories and/or local filesystems, the  cost is trivial):
