I am new to Python and am trying to implement multiple 'or' conditions to a single variable. I would like to know and understand the best way to format the following:I want to compare '1' to numbers 5-10. Would it be something along the lines of:Numbers 1,2,7,8,9 and 10 are valid. Numbers 3,4,5,and 6 must be checked as less than to the variable of 'word'.How would i do this?
In Python,  is bitwise-or.  You want:Per the question update, the following is one way to check for a specific set of values:The equivalent and/or logic would be:But you can see the  way is simpler.
Like mentioned, you can also do.or in range.or will be true if any of them are true.  and will be true if ALL of them are true.
In addition to @mark-tolonen's answer, there's several ways to check if a range of numbers is less than something. One way would be explicitly using a loop:Alternatively, you can solve it with a combination of  and  (which however is harder to read if you are new to python, you can find the docs for  and  here):Yet another alternative would be to check whether the largest element of your sequence of numbers (5-10 in your example) is less than . If so, they are all less than , if not, then not.
