Natural Text
I am running a python script that checks a text file on my server and then turns on a relay dependent on what it reads. If it turns on the relay after a time delay the script sends a GET request to update the text file on the server to then turn the relay off. The program runs all ok for some time. I can turn on and off the relay ans it updates the server when the time delay has time out.If i leave the program running and  do nothing after some time i get the following error.this is the python scriptIt cant be a URL no found as the URL exists and the program runs all ok at the beginning.Is the script wrong, or is it requesting data to often 
It sounds to me like your internet connection or DNS resolution randomly dies.The "Name or service not known" error happens when for some reason, the URL cannot be resolved via DNS.
