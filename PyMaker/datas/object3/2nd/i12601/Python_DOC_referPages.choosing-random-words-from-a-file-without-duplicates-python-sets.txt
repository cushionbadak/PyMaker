Natural Text
I'm attempting to create a program which selects 10 words from a text file which contains 10+ words. For the purpose of the program when importing these 10 words from the text file, I must not import the same words twice! Currently I'm utilising a set for this however I'm greeted by a syntax error. I have some knowledge of sets and know they cannot hold the same value twice. As of now I'm clueless on how to solve this any help would be much appreciated. THANKS!Relevent Code: (FileSelection)= open file dialogerror code:
You can just use  (2/3), so you don't have to do that yourself. You also don't need the call to  bigblind's answer suggests, because  can take a set as an argument:That way, you can replace the entire body of that function with this:I also left out that  statement, which you don't need. It's only necessary if you're assigning a new value to the variable, but all you need to do is call one of its functions, .
This happens because is trying to access the set as if it is a list (or some other datastructure that implements ). To solve this, change your call to  to:This converts the set to a list before passing it to .
You can just use  to get 10 distinct elements instead of repeatedly trying to add to a set using a loop.
