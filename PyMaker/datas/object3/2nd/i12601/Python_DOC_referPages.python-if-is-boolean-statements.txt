I am having a problem in a simple expression which is the following.When I enter 10 as an input it prints nothing as an output. With my elementary school math, I can easily assume that this should print all the numbers which can be divided by 10.So the problem should be in the  statement. It doesn't enter to .I am using PyCharm Community Edition and Python 3.4
You should use  instead of  in this case because: checks if two object's  are the same, and  checks if two object's values are the same.Well,  gives  and that's treated as . Let's see:I think you mean  right?So your code should look like:Demo:Just got an idea to improve your code, you don't need  in this case since  has a  argument. From the document:The arguments to the range constructor must be integers (either built-in int or any object that implements the  special method). If the  argument is omitted, it defaults to 1. If the start argument is omitted, it defaults to 0. If step is zero,  is raised.For a positive step, the contents of a range r are determined by the formula  where  and .So as the document says, you can also set the  instead of use  to check all the numbers which can be divided by  manually use . For example:
