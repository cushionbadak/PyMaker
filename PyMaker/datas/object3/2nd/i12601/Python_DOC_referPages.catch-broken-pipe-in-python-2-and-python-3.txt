I try to write some code to catch a Broken Pipe Error. The code should run in Python 2.x and Python 3.x.In Python 2.x a broken pipe is represented by a This was changed in Python 3.x - a broken pipe now is a Also the syntax of exception handling has changed a bit (see https://stackoverflow.com/a/34463112/263589) so what I need to do would be something like:There's (at least) one remaining problem: In Python 2.x there is no , so whenever there is an exception in  Python 2.x would throw another exception and complain that it doesn't know . As  is deprecated in Python 3.x a similar problem could arise in Python 3.x in the near future.What can I do to make this code run in Python 2.x and Python 3.x?
If all you care about are broken pipe errors, then you might want to catch  and simply check whether it's indeed a broken pipe error. You can do so using the exception's  attribute, which is present in both Python 2 and Python 3, which means, you don't need different Python 2 vs. 3 logic (I'd argue the intent is a little clearer this way):If you do care about more than broken pipes, thefourtheye's answer is appropriate and idiomatic.
You can try using  and if it throws a , then fall back to , like thisAnd then use it like this
