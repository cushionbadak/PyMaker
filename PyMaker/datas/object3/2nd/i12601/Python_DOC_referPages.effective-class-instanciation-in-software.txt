I have written a  module which holds a class named .To use it I only have to create an instance of :then use it this way:The thing is I am planning to use this class for console logs, in a software:As one might guess, this call will be often made, in almost every module. So at this point, I'd like to know which practice is best. Either I stick with this way, and I will have to import the module  and to declare an instance of  at the beginning of each module, or I can make a general function in the  module, like this:then in my software:But here I would have to create an instance of  everytime I want to print a coloured message, which would be heavy and should probably be avoided.Which leaves me with a third choice, I could create a general instance of  in my  module, which would look like:So I have two choices: either declaring a general instance in each of my software modules, or declaring a general instance in the  module. Or something else I have not thought about.I would embrace any suggestion.
Daniel's suggestion in the comments is good. But if you really want to do this yourself, I recommend using a hidden instance in the module, rather than creating a new temporary instance in each function call. The "hidden instance" approach is used in the standard library, eg, that's what the  module does for the standard random functions.
