Write a function named lineIndex that takes a file name, fName,  as a parameter and returns a dictionary, d, that indexes the   words in fName by line number, with the first line in fName  being numbered 0.  Each word in fName should be a key in the returned dictionary d,  and the corresponding value should be a list of the line numbers  on which the word occurs. A line number should occur no more   than one time in a given list of line numbers.**I tried numerous ways but couldn't find a solution. What I have accomplished, I am not sure how to remove repeating words.Sample inputCorrect outputEdit 2:
You're close - what you need to utilise is a  - it can only contain one unique element per key - so that'll handle the repeating words for you. You also missed out line numbers from your code, so look at  for that. Then you can look at  which does the creation of a default value for keys that are not existent for you.Purely using builtins, then:
A version without imports:You can use the setdefault method of dictionaries. It looks for the key and returns the value if the key is there. If it cannot find the key it it returns  a new list that can appended to immediately.
