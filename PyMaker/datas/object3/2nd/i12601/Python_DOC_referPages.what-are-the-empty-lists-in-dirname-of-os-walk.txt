When using python 3.5  and looking at the dirname output I get a lot of empty lists (returned ).  I have no idea why.Output:
Quoting from Python Documentation:   Generate the file names in a directory tree by walking the tree either top-down  or bottom-up. For each directory in the tree rooted at directory top  (including top itself), it yields a 3-tuple (dirpath, dirnames,  filenames).dirpath is a string, the path to the directory. dirnames is a list of  the names of the subdirectories in dirpath (excluding '.' and '..').  filenames is a list of the names of the non-directory files in  dirpath. Note that the names in the lists contain no path components.  To get a full path (which begins with top) to a file or directory in  dirpath, do os.path.join(dirpath, name).Since  has only two empty directories  and , so you will get :
The call  returns a tuple . You print the  element of this tuple, , which is the list of subdirectories in a given directory. Your directories  and  apparently do not contain any subdirectories, hence the empty lists.
According to  documentation what  returns is a 3-tuple .Let's say you have a directory :Then looping over generator returned by  will produce the following tuples:Since you're extracting first elements from the 3-tuples and getting empty lists, that means these are directories that contain no subdirectories in them.
