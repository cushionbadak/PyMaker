I was trying to install ctypes module in windows 7 python3.5 and RHEL6.x python3.3 but is not accepting with the error..and when I use python version 2.6.6 it gives the error.....omittedI usually download the .tar.gz package then install it using "python3 setup.py install" as I don't have direct internet access in my server. So how can this work!!
You don't need to install ctypes at all; it is part of the Python standard library, as of Python 2.5 onwards. See the module documentation. 1.0.2 is ancient, don't use it. It was written for Python 2.3 and 2.4 and was never adjusted to run on Python 3, which is why you get the syntax error. You got the errors with Python 2 because you are missing the Python development headers (provided by the  RPM).
