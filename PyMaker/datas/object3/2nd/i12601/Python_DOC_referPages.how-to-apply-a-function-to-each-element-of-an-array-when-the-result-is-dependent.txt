I have an array:What is the most efficient (vectorized) way to calculate an array where each resulting element is (Pseudocode):I could do this with the following inefficient code (factor = 0.5):The result of this damping function would be:
You a looking for Haskell's  alternative in Python (Haskell example):There is an  function in  module:With NumPy you may use  function, however, according to this answer, there is a bug in the implementation, that is why we should use a cast. Unfortunately, I'm not very familiar with NumPy, and, probably, there is a better way:
I would like to post how the @soon code works, or how to implement it with :Its not the best performance nor the cutier one but gives you an idea of how to do it.
