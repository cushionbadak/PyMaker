All money amount is going to one bill. Example: sum is 1550, but it's going to 4x500 bill with -50 balance. What I need to change in this code? Do I need to add percents where "price" is? Don't pay attention to how large bills are. I have tried to make , but it didn't worked.
First let's start with variable names that mean something; instead of  make it , instead of  make it , etc.Now your code starts to look likewhich reads, "while amount is greater than 0 repeatedly subtract five hundred". So if amount is (for example) $37 - greater than $0 - you subtract, and now have one $500 bill and $-463 remaining. Instead, tryI rearranged the  condition to emphasize that it is redundant - if the  fails, the  wouldn't have done anything anyway. Let's get rid of that . The same is true of your initial ; if it fails, all of the  conditions would have failed anyway.Now, with a bit of rearranging, your code looks like... you may notice a certain amount of similarity in these operations! This is usually a sign that you should use a loop. We want to do this with 500s, then 200s, then 100s, etc...Now there is one more change to make: instead of using a  loop to inch our way up to the right number of bills, we can use the  (integer divison) and  (modulus) operators to get the answer directly. I am also going to make the  statement optional - if we have 0 $500 bills, we don't really need to be told about it.
