I want to find efficiently permutations of a vector which has tied values. E.g., if  I would want to obtain as output all combinations of  and so on, but I don't want to obtain  twice which is what the standard  would give. I tried the following but it works really SLOW when  in len:The question is of more general "speed-up" nature, actually. The main time is spent on creating the permutations of long vectors - even without the duplicity, creation of permutations of a vector of 12 unique values takes a "infinity". Is there a possibility to call the itertools iteratively without accessing the entire permutations data but working on bunches of it? 
Try this if perm_vector is small:This should give you unique values, because now it becomes a set, which by default delete duplications.If perm_vector is large, you might want to try backtracking:
How about this:
