Natural Text
The problem:All in all, I want to remove, take off, get rid off the extra blank line that is contained within a variable which is essentially a line which has been read from a .txt fileIn more detail:So the scenario is this:I have a program which takes data from two .txt files, and combines parts of the data from each file to make a new file with data from bothIn the second  loop, the program searches the .txt file which has the average speeds for the same numberplate registration as was searched for in the first  loop, and splits the line which has this registration using the commas within the text file:QM03 EZM,1.0,1118.5The average speed is '1118.5', as it is the third split of the line.However...When writing the line with desired registration from the list shown below it seems to add a newline which I do not wantAn example of this list is:CO31 RGK, Niall Davidson, YP3 2GPQM03 EZM, Timothy Rogers, RI8 4BXEX97 VXM, Pedro Keller, QX20 6PCAnd an example of the output isIS13 PMR, Janet Bleacher, XG3 8KW2236.9QM03 EZM, Timothy Rogers, RI8 4BX1118.5As you can see, the speeds of the car are different, one is travelling at  and the other at , showing the string on the second line of each re-run of the program is the one taken from the second original file (the one with the speeds)I just want to get rid of this blank line, not within the original file, but within the  variable once it has been read from the filePlease help! I've searched everywhere and have not found anything specific to this problem, Thanks in advance!
Instead of writing it straight away to the file, how about first saving it in variables first and writing it at once.You can do it like this,In this way it will be much easier to format the strings as you want.
Ockhius answer is of course right but to remove unwanted characters at the beginning and end of a string: str.strip([chars])
Your problem is not the  (new line character) that magically spawn in .It is the  function to write strings to file. Every call of the  starts a new line in the output file. Maybe you should concatenate output string and write all to the file.
