Natural Text
In Python 2 at least,  doesn't recognise certain characters.(The first  is to demonstrate that Python itself recognises  as a newline.)Certainly Unicode contains the character , and it has a name, specifically "LINE FEED".NB.  and  both give a KeyError: undefined character name.
The  lookup relies on column 2 of the UnicodeData.txt database in the standard (Python 2.7 uses Unicode 5.2.0).If that name starts with  it is ignored. All control codes, including newlines, are in that category; the first column has no name other than :Column 10 is the old, Unicode 1.0 name, and should not be used, according to the standard. In other words,  has no name, other than the generic , which the Python database ignores (as it is not unique).Python 3.3 added support for NameAliases.txt, which lets you look up names by alias; so ,  or , etc, all reference .  However, the  method does not support aliases, nor could it (which would it pick?):Added support for Unicode name aliases and named sequences. Both  and  now resolve name aliases, and  resolves named sequences too.TL;DR:  is not the official name for , it is but an alias for it. Python 3.3 and up let you look up characters by alias.
