Debugging the following problem, post problem and code reference I am debugging. My question is, I think this if condition check if not necessary, and could be removed safely? If I am wrong, please feel free to correct me. Thanks.Given two strings where first string may contain wild card characters and second string is a normal string. Write a function that returns true if the two strings match. The following are allowed wild card characters in first string.For example,  matches with  match. And string  matches with  (note  at the end of first string). But  doesnâ€™t match with  as character  is not present in second string.thanks in advance,Lin
That  statement is critical to the proper operation of the function. Removing it will have disastrous consequences. For example, assume that  and . In other words, the function was called as . Then the  statement will cause the function to return  (which is correct since there is no  in ). Without the  statement, the code will proceed to the lineThe call  will evaluate to  which will return . But when the code calls , the call is equivalent to , and the result is infinite recursion.
