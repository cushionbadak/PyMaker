I understand that in python, whenever you access a class/instance variable, it will call  method to get the result. However I can also use  directly, and get what I want.I am a little confused about what is the difference? Also when I use , is it calling  or  internally?Thanks in advance.
 method is for lower level attribute processing.Default implementation tries to find the name in the internal  (or ). If the attribute is not found, it calls .UPDATE (as in the comment):They are different ways for finding attributes in the Python data model. They are internal methods designed to fallback properly in any possible situation. A clue: "The machinery is in  which transforms  into ." from docs.python.org/3/howto/descriptor.html
Not every python object has a dictionary where it's attributes are stored, there are slots, properties and attributes, that are calculated, wenn needed. You can also overwrite  and . Attribute access is more complicated, than a simple dictionary lookup. So the normal way to access attribute is bywenn you have a variable with attribute name:Normally you shouldn't use the internal attributes .
Attributes in  are only a subset of all attributes that an object has.Consider this class:An instance  of this class will have attributes ,  and  (and few others). The  will find them all, but only the 'ab' is stored in the . The other two can be found in .
