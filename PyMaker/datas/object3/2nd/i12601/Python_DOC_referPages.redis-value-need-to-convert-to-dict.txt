You're looking for . Set the response callback for the RPOP command to or call  on each element of the Redis list you receive in the loopOf course, you can also use , but  is much safer.
If you don't care about security, just use built-in eval(). returns
I tried following:To modify to your case, you have to do the import at the beginning and instead of print r do print ast.literal_eval(r).For your 'match' statement, I'd take a two step approach (and also check if the dictionary has the proper key).
