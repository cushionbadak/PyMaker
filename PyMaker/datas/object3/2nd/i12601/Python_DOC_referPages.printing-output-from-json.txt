I am still new to python, and brand new to json. I am trying to go through output that is in json. I am not yet sure which fields will need to be printed out, but I do know that two of them will be needed.How could I change:to print out say, field one, and field two? I figure if I can print field one, and two, I can play around with it until I find the right fields. I imagine this is a derp level question, but being able to print specific fields is what I need to be able to do.

You could have find it easily in  python's json documentation.Here data is a  type object.

For avoiding this issue you can use the  method.This will return  in case of missing key.
