This question already has an answer here:Open files in 'rt' and 'wt' modes                    4 answers                I am puzzled over some code I wrote a while back ( yep no comments gotcha!) and it's to do with an  flag in . Does it exist because I can't find anything on it and if not is python ( I use 3.4) just ignoring the 't' part.
Yes, it's valid. Check the docs on the  function:The available modes are:In text mode (the default, or when  is included in the   argument), the contents of the file are returned as , the bytes  having been first decoded using a platform-dependent encoding or using  the specified encoding if given.
't' is for text mode. On some OSes it makes the difference when reading or writing..
No, the 't' means text mode. You can omit this as text mode is the default for opening a file.Python docs Open
