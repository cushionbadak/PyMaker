I am going through functions in Learning Python, this one is giving me a little trouble understanding, was wondering if anyone could help me understand it better, more specifically the When I run the first function, it doesn't matter what I put as the first argument, then the second argument has to be a list, and it just spits the list back as written. I'm confused on when you combine the functions and print them together how it gives the max and min.
You seem to be misunderstanding how the starred function argument works. When you call your function as ,  becomes a tuple of one element equal to . Therefore the body of the loop never gets executed and the value of  does not matter. The function is supposed to be invoked as . This way  gets the value  and the loop goes through its elements.Clarification: The answer is based on what you wrote. Your code snippet is correct and works exactly as intended.
I haven't read that book so I don't know the context, but it looks that function () is not well named.  It does not return two values, it only returns one -- and which one depends on the testing function you give it.  If you pass in the  function:you'll get , and if you pass in the  function:you'll get .
