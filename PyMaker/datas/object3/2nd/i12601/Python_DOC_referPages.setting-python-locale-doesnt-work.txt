So I've been trying to set the Python locale. I want to because I want to use the weekday name in local language (using ). But currently the weekday is printed in English even though I tried setting the locale several ways. I am running this on a RPi2 with Ubuntu Mate. I have tried the solutions in this topic What is the correct way to set Python's locale on Windows?I tried explicitly setting locale to :I also tried setting an empty string, a suggested in the last answer:In both cases when I tryI see But I still get the weekday in English! Haven't been able to find much about this on the internetz except for the above topic and I couldn't get this fixed.Edit:I have tried all 3 options. The first one returns a weird result:It seems like nothing is saved. Am I wrong in assuming you set your locale once and then the system will remember this? The second option:Even though I am trying to get a Dutch weekday name I still get an English name in return. Besides that this method starts counting from sunday and not monday. Am I doing anything wrong? The third suggestion got me my weekday name, thanks! But I'm still wondering why the first doesn't work? I am using this script on my own device and would like to work with a correct global locale.Edit2:yes, calling locale.setlocale() in Python does not affect future python processes. Configure environment variables instead, see How to set all locale settings in Ubuntu.Ok! So that is why it didn't work. I assumed I had set the locale for any future use in Python, like an environment variable but then only for Python.I have a bash script creating files and this Python script should delete it after some time (learning to code, didn't know Python when I wrote the Bash script). Bash's "date" method seems to pick up the locale some way or the other. I'll go ahead and see what I can fix for Python. This is what I see when I type :
