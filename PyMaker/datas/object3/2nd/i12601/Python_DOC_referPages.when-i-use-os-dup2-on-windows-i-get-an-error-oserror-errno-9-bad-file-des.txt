If you've read the documentation about  you would know that this won't work in Windows, Quoting from Python Documentation:Return the socketâ€™s file descriptor (a small integer). This is useful with select.select().Under Windows the small integer returned by this method cannot be used where a file descriptor can be used (such as os.fdopen()). Unix  does not have this limitation.Note:I've tried your code in Ubuntu (Linux System) and it worked fine without any tweeking.
