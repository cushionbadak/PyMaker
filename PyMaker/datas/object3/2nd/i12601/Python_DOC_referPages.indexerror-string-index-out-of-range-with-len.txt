I'm currently trying to make a simple code (basically mad-libs) and I made a variable called . The user is supposed to type in something like months or days. If a user inputs month or day, an  statement is supposed to add an  to make it plural:When I test this code out, it gives me this error:I know that  means the string is longer than I thought it was but I am using .
Indexes in Python begin with 0, i.e. the first element in a string, list, tuple, etc. is: . Hence the last element of  is . So  addresses the element after the last element, which of course causes an IndexError. Use  instead, or better yet: .Often you will find slicing  helpful, too, because it returns  for an empty string instead of raising an IndexError.C.f. http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_lists.htm
If a string is of length 5, like , then the max index is  since indexing is zero-based (starts from 0, not 1).You can avoid calculating the length by using relative offsets for the index. So, if you want the last character, use -1, like this:
The right code is:The length of  is , but the largest index of  is  since the index starts from zero.Or you can just use  to get and judge the tail element.
