I have a string of binary. I need to convert this to a wav file. Is there any existing library to achieve that goal? If so how would I write the bytes to an audio file in preferably Java or Python, but any language works.    
See the documentation for Wave_write Objects included with Python's standard library. You will need to open a WAV file first in  (write only) mode, and then use the appropriate methods:Wave_write.close()Wave_write.setnchannels(n)Wave_write.setsampwidth(n)Wave_write.setframerate(n)Wave_write.setnframes(n)Wave_write.setcomptype(type, name)Wave_write.setparams(tuple)Wave_write.tell()Wave_write.writeframesraw(data)Wave_write.writeframes(data)
