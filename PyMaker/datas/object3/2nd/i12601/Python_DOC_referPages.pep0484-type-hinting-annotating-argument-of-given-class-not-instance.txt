Let me explain with some sample, first.Suppose there is a web API client module (MyAPIClient), a mapper class that converts arbitrary response into Python object (ObjectMapper), and a class that represents response object (User and Message).As shown in the sample above, ObjectMapper receives an argument named "mapping_class." This is NOT an instance of the class, but a class itself as shown in MyAPIClient#get_current_user and MyAPIClient#get_message. My question is how I should annotate this mapping_class in the ObjectMapper#__init__ which is currently marked as "???" in the sample above.
Class itself is callable, that returns instance of that class. Solution can be:
