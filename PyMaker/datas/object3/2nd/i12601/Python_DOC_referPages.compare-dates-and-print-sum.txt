My program must compare dates and print sum of that day/date.dates will be always on ascending order.file:result:This is my program nowmy result now with this program:Problem is i print every date and price, i need to make one date and sum of all prices for that date.
I'd suggest use   to sum the numbers, and use  to keep order like below:However, since you want keep order, I'd also suggest that use . Here's another example, maybe more simple than the above one:Demo:
which (on the given input) producesas desired.Edit: a lambda is a way to make a nameless function that returns a single value;  is exactly the same asI have rewritten it as a separate function instead of a lambda ;-) Hope that helps.Edit2: in this example  takesand converts it to(ie a sub-list for each day). You can then easily get the per-day subtotals (which is what the  line is doing).Edit3: I have added in the start-date and end-date checking.
You don't need to convert to datetime, just use an OrderedDict to group and sum:Output:If you want to look up a particular date you can access using the datestring.
Just read the data into a list that ends up looking like this:Then use this bit of code:I haven't tested this, but this is the right idea. Depending on how much data you're working with, you might want to use a solution that keeps the data sorted as it goes. That would require a lot of data to be necessary though. You could use  from the  library in such a case.
I found using dict to accumulate the price easier to understand, however you may disagree:This was the output:
