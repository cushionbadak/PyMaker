My goal with this code is that when you put in a certain number, you will get printed the number and some other output, based on what you typed. For some reason, what I have here gives the error "ValueError: incomplete format". It has something to do with the %. What does the error mean, and how do I fix it? Thanks!
it's expecting another character to follow the  in the string to tell it how to represent  in the string.use  or  to correct the issue.

an easy way:
