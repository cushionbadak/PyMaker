I want to print a C string using the Python  statement. The array  contains the ASCIIZ C string . My motivation is to convert the C string to a Python string such that I can use all of the Python string methods. I have a struct:I want to print the string "vendorName" which is ASCIIZ. I can print it using printf like this:I have tried this  but it just prints the address. Based on information from Jamie Nicholl-Shelley, I tried  but that gives . I want simply  Note that  prints correctly.
It looks like you've figured out most of it and are just confused about string encoding.  You've managed to get to a  object:The bytes object is what it sounds like, just a sequence of bytes -- it's only as a convenience for the user that it's shown in a stringlike way.  Unlike a string, each component is an integer:But since we know that we're using ascii, we can decode this bytes object into a Python string, and then use all of the usual methods on it:
You are printing the address as that is what you have asked the code to do.You have told it that it is a string type, but not declared it as a string in the function, instead use a pointer to the data at the addressCompared to print(), which figures this out for you as it a c++ based function
