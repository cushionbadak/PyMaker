I am trying to save the state of the random number generator in my code to file, to then later read it back in. The tuple generated is of the form: tuple(str, ndarray of 624 uints, int, int, float)The returned tuple has the following items:the string ‘MT19937’.a 1-D array of 624 unsigned integer keys.an integer pos.an integer has_gauss.a float cached_gaussian.Is there a simple way to write this to file, then read it back in in the format it was originally generated?This is what I have so far:This does print to file, but I am unsure how to convert the string output back into the original format.Many thanksRyan
