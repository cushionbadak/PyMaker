I have a XML file like this:These are the cordinates of the shapes that I have to work with.What I'm trying to do is the get ALL the cordinates of these shapes and store them seperately.In order to make math calculations.Like getting x1=50 x2=50 x3=90 y1=50 y2=90 y3=90 for the first one(red)How can I compile these lines and store cordinates?EDIT:I solved it and wanted to share with people.This code gets the values and colours for X and Y cordinates of the shapes and stores them in the list. Thanks for the suggestions below:So right now what is does is this for every item first 3 points are x cordinates and second points are for the y cordinates and the last element is the colour of the shape:
One way to get the values is to get them in a list and this is how you can do it using regex:And then you can do this inside a loop to get all the list of values in another list and process it further.
I would use the ElementTree module in order to parse the file. It's much more simple to get the  attributes this way and then you can parse them using a regex.
