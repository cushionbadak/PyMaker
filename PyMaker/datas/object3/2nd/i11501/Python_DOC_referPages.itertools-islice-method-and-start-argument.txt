The documentation of itertools.islice says:Make an iterator that returns selected elements from the iterable. If start is non-zero, then elements from the iterable are skipped until start is reached. Afterward, elements are returned consecutively unless step is set higher than one which results in items being skipped.Usage says:  Shouldn't the first version return CDEFG ... skipping first two elements that is AB
You're misreading. It has two call profiles:If you only pass two arguments, the second argument is the  argument, as if you passed  as the  argument. To get the behavior you expected, you'd do:But understand that this is inefficient for large  values; under the hood,  is iterating and discarding until it reaches the desired  position, you haven't bypassed the work of iterating (just optimized it a bit by doing it at the C layer in CPython).
