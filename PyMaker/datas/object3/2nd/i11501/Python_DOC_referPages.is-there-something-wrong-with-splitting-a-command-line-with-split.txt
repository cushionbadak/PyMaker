In most answers (I found) to the question "How to run an external command" I see something along the linesIf you want to run  you need to use What I normally do when I know what I will be running is to call  to have visually the command line in one piece (it is usually a variable).Is there anything inherently wrong with using  as opposed to building the list manually (again, when the command is known). Or are these answers crafted to explicitly show that a list is needed?I tried to find some drawbacks (multiple spaces, escaped spaces, ...) but I do not see where that approach could go wrong?Note: this question is specifically about the robustness of splitting on spaces, not the security issues or other (very important) considerations as such.
Observe that this works:But this does not:And this does work:RecommendationIn python philosphy, explicit is better than implicit.  Thus, of those three forms, use this one:This avoids all preprocessing and shows you clearly and unambiguously and explicitly what will be executed and what its arguments are.
If you are really certain that there are no issues with unescaped characters (including spaces in filenames), then I don't see any problem.But you might find it easier to use  instead. Just note that if you want to use the result code, it should be right shifted by 8 bits:Alternatively (more robust, but also more work to type...):Then you let the shell handle the splitting.Edit: also mention subprocess.
