Natural Text
I have a   that stores travel dates of people. I'd like to add a column that shows the length of the stay. To do this the  needs to be parsed, converted to a  and subtracted.  seems to be treating the  conversion as a whole series and not individual   as a I get . I like to do this with a non-looping option as the actual dataset is quite large, but need a bit of help.Desired Output:
Use  to split the  column into two separate columns.Then use  to parse the columns as dates.Computing the  can then be done by subtracting the date columns and adding 1:yieldsThe regex pattern  means returns a DataFrame with the matching text from groups #1 and #2 in columns.
