I am trying to read data from a file and then build a dictionary out of the file. With this dictionary, I want to plot a graph with the keys of the dictionary as the X graph and the values of the dictionary as the markup values. However, the key values are strings and I just need to label them. I tried the following code, which throws an error stating that the key value is a string. And this is the error that I get on my console.I am unable to proceed further, can someone help in this regard?Thanks in advance!!!
Try using  if this is truly csv data.  might be able to help you. Ideally key names aren't mixed through the data, but would be defined positionally based on the first row, with rows like:if you don't want to put keys in the csv at all, you could define a sequence of the key names:Remember that when working with csv (and also readlines), each value is read as a string, so if rows contain different data types you'll have to convert the individual keys to get ints or floats.ref: csv https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html?highlight=csv#csv.DictReader
