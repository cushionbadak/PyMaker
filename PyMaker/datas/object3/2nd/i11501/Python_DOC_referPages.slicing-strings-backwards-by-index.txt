I have a string that looks like this:What I want is to get the string that ends with the first ')' and backwards until the associated '('. Then I use that string and replace it with something else. This way I can repeat the operation until I get a string that has no '(' or ')'.So far, my code is something like this:That works and after the first iteration I get what I want:But in the next iteration, I get:What I want for the second iteration is:So that after I use replace, original_string looks like this:This way, during the 3rd iteration:and after replacing,I am new to python so I'm not sure if this is OK or if there's a better way to be doing this, but it has to be done in a simple way (without using any 3rd party libraries) or tokenizing
You could use regular expressions to find and replace all of the needed values.and use this method as such:
The problem with your approach is that you find first left parenthesis not the corresponding one to right parenthesis you found before.To solve this problem you can use regular expression as Kupiakos suggested or you can try to use str.rfind method
