This question already has an answer here:UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc2                    4 answers                So I am trying to read data off a .txt file and then find the most common 30 words and print them out.  However, whenever I'm reading my txt file, I receive the error:Here is my code:
In Python 3, when opening files in text mode (the default), Python uses your environment settings to choose an appropriate encoding.If it can't resolve it (or your environment specifically defines ASCII), then it will use ASCII. This is what has happened in your case.If the ASCII decoder finds anything that's not ASCII, then it will throw an error. In your case, it's thrown an error on the byte 0x92. This is not valid ASCII, nor valid UTF-8. It does make sense in  encoding, however, where it's a  (Smart quote / 'RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK'). It could also make sense in other 8bit code pages, but you'll have to know or work that out yourself.To make your code read  encoded files, you need to change your  command to:
I am learning python, so please take this response with that in mind. file = open(filename,'r').read()   #THIS IS WHERE THE ERROR ISFrom what I have learned so far your read is combined with the open() object creation. The open() function creates the file handle, the read() function reads the file into a string. Both functions would return I presume success/fail, or in the open() function's case in part the file object reference. I am not sure they can be combined successfully.Thus far from what I have learned this is to be done in 2 steps. i.e. file = open(filename, 'r')  # creates the objectmyString = file.read()      # reads the entire object into a stringthe open() function creates the file object, so probably returns the object number, or success/fail.The read, read(n), readline() or readlines() functions are used on the object..read reads entire file into a single string.read(n) read next n bytes into a string.readline() read the next line into a string.readline() read entire file into a list of stringsYou can split them up and see if the same result happens ??? just a thought from a newbie :)
