I would like to sort the file 'Class1Scores' from highest to lowest. I have used a .txt to save the contents in the following way. When sorted the output should be :Here is the code I have used to develop the task:I am kind of still confused on how to order this in the same way as the .txt file above?The code works but outputs the data like this:
I would recommend storing the data in a dict with user as key, their scores as values and to  json the data to file but to sort your data in current format you can use  to get the data back into lists, sort using the max score as the key and specifying  to sort from highest to lowest:Which will give you:If you want the names sorted alphabetically for a tie you need to change the logic slightly specifying -max and the name as the value to use in a tie removing  in this case:You should be able to figure the rest out.
