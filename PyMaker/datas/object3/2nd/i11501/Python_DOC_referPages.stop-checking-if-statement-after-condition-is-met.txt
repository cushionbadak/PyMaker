I have the following program that runs for 400 seconds, and throughout the while loop, it iterates over an array of timecodes. When the elapsed runtime of the program is the same as one of the timecodes, it does something. The problem is that it iterates over the array of timecodes many times every second, and currently it "does the thing" multiple times during the second that the condition is met â€“ I only want it to do the thing once... how can I do this?
Instead of iterating over the whole list:Since the list is sorted, only check the first item.Once the time given in the first item has been reached, pop it from the list.
I did not fully understand your question but if you want to run your code sequential every second you can use 
I went ahead and wrote up what I put in my comments on a different answer:
