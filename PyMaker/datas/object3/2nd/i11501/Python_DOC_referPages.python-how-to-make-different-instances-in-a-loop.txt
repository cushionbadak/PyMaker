I need to make multiple instances of a class, then use its methods to find the output. It is straightforward to write the code in multiple lines but I need a more efficient way of doing that. Basically, here is what I want to do in a loop:Of course, this is not so hard, but if I want to do it for 100 times ...
You could make a list of all your A's and a list of all your Y's, or you could even make a list of lists, basically a list with 1 or more lists within it. for example and then to reference them you would say:The first 1 goes into the [A2, Y2] list, and the second then goes and takes the Y2 variable.This way you don't need all the variables really, because you could make a for loop that iterates over all these and thus making it possible to have infinite of these lists. for example:this will print out:So what this basically does is that it it says x is 0, and then goes through all the numbers for y, and y has gone through all the numbers, x is changed to 1, and then y goes through all the numbers again, until all possible combinations are reached. You could make the range(0,100) although, might lag if you print the whole list out (like I accidentally did haha)So you can see that this is a great way to create a long list with many variables.but you can also call a specific number, say we wanted the third list, then we would call the print function (on line 5) as:we say two because python starts counting from 0.this will print out:Which is the third list, like we wanted. Now we want to print the second item in that list, the number 2, then we would call the print function as:and this will print out:exactly like we wanted.
Assuming python 2.7.10. You could try something along the lines of (add after your class definition):This will run 10 times with random numbers between 1 ... 100.disclaimer: untested code -- just to give a general idea.
