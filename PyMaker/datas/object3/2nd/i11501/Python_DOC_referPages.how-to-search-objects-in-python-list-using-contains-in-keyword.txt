I would like to make a list of objects which I define, then use the  keyword (which calls ) to determine if said object exists in the Python list. Here is a minimal example with comments:Shouldn't the  keyword iterate over the Python list and use the  method to determine existence of the object?Extra kudos if calls to lists  function are also operational.UpdateThanks to @user2357112, Looks like the answer is implementing the equivalence operator . Adding the following bit to the  class in the previous example fixes the issues I was having.
 is the method that's called on the container, not on the elements. You need to implement  instead:If you are going to store  in other containers (like ), remember to implement .
