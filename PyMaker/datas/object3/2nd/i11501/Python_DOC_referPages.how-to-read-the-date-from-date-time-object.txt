Natural Text
I have a datetime object which looks like the following:How can I read just the date part from here? For example: 2020-04-08
If you have a string of this format you can just split on whitespacewhere  is your input string
This creates a string that looks like you want it.

If you have that date set to a variable, such as , you would use  to select the first 9 characters which are the date. the first '2' is the 0, and the '8' is the 9. You can also change this to select the time.
