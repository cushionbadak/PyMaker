I want to make python file which opens two programs. This two programs have to get input from each other multiple times. I opened two programs and know how to give input to one program, but i don't know how to give input multiple time on one program and get output multiple time. My code is like this.Now this program just get program output. I want to give input N times for each program and get output N times. So I expect my code to be like this.
Try using  and  to send data to  and  and get the response, see https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#popen-constructor.
To exchange messages via pipes dynamically (not tested):It assumes that the child processes expect a line as a request and return a single character as a response.To make it work:,  should disable their internal  buffering (call at the start of the program) or call  after each .
