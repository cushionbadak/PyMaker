I am reading the source code of  in the Ansible module. I found the following lines of code:It iterates over , gets the integer ordinal of each character and converts it back to a one-character string.  But what's the point?
When  is unicode-specific character (cannot be encoded in ASCII):This is only true in Python2, as in Python3, unichr is removed and chr acts as unichr. This seems to be unusual behavior for such a library, since it would routinely throw an unexpected error that's executable-specific for any non-English locale. 
When c is an 8-bit string. From the docs for ord():[returns] the value of the byte when the argument is an 8-bit string then converts that to the corresponding character. It's basically just converting bytes to a character, as the comment says.
