I've written the following code for computing the in-center of a triangle. This code is supposed to be for code-golf. Any help would be appreciated.Input:Expected Output:Actual Output:
Python is doing the maths correctly. Either your logic is wrong or your input is wrong or your expected output is wrong. Given your input, the only possible output for  is  or  (the Cartesian distance between two points).
