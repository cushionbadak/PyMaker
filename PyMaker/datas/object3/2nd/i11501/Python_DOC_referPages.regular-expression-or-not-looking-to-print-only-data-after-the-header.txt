Some homework help would be greatly appreciated.Using socket, I need to parse data from a website (http://www.py4inf.com/code/romeo.txt).I'm using a regular expression '^\s*$' to locate the first blank line after the header and above the data.Any tips on how to only extract the data (and not print the header)?
I'm assuming since it's a homework problem you have to use  and can't use something more user-friendly like .I would first loop until you have the complete response in a string, and then iterate over it like this:
>> Documentation of  (Python 3)First, it's recommended to use powers of 2 bytes as buffer size for :Second, it does not return a string but binary data of  bytes length (or less, if the stream end is reached). That means, you don't get the data line by line and can iterate over it like over a file-like object.You have to collect the data chunks, concatenate them, convert the result to a string and then split it into a list of lines. Here's a generator function returning lines from a socket stream, so that you can iterate over it like over a file-like object:Update: fixed bytes encoding issue in function belowNote that this function already strips the newline characters  from the returned lines!You can now use this function's returned generator like a file and iterate over the received lines:
