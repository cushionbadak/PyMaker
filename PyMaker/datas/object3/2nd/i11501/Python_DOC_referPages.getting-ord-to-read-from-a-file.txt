Natural Text
What my code does is it counts the amount of times a letter has appeared and counts it to the respected letter. So if A appears two times, it will show 2:A. My problem is that i want it to read from a file and when ord() tries to, it cant. I dont know how to work around this.
When you iterate over a file you get lines. If you want characters you need to iterate over each line as well.
You need to loop over the indivdual characters of the each line of the file, and you could use a  instead of an array. And if you want uppercase characters only, then add  before you add to the Counter. Example
While I prefer @JohnKugelman's answer over my own, I'd like to show two alternate methods of iterating over every character of a file in a single for loopThe first is using the second form of  using a callable (read one character) and a sentinel (keep calling the function until it returns this value) In this case I'd use  to make the function that reads one byte:The second is frequently used to flatten two dimensional lists,  takes something that is iterated over (the file) and chains each generated value (each line) together in iteration.Then you could pass either to  to construct a basic counter but it wouldn't follow the same logic you have applied with :
