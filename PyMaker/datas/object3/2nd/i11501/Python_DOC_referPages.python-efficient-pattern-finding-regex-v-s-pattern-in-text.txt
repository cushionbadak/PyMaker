I am working on a simple case where I need to check for existence of a string (let us say ) in a .What will be a more efficient way to do so:OR
As someone said,  is much fasterI think this is because  just have to look in the string.  is a more complex tool that should be able to manage more complex cases so probably is slower because of the overhead to manage such complexity.
We can use python regular expression search module to get it done in efficient way.
