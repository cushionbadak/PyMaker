could someone please help me understand what this line is trying to get me to do? Thanks. findCows function: Write a function called “findCows” that takes two string values as parameters (Say secret, guess) and returns the number of digits in guess match the secret only in digit but not in position. Assume that there are exactly 4 digits in each string. For example, findCows(“1807”, “7810”) will return 3. 
You can use filter function:
 converts two lists of the same size to a list of element-wise pairs. The  statement is a  comprehension which maps each pair to / based on their equality. Finally,  counts the number of  values.
