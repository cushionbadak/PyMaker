Say we have an object we write to binary file using . Let's say the object graph looks like this:Now the  objects are large datastructures and all instances of qux are the same. Therefore we decided to leave these  objects out of the pickle process with:for the classes to which ,  and  belong (and in fact all other classes in our design).When we  the object back into memory, we want all  references to be set back to our given context. One can do this by walking over the object tree recursively, but we are wondering whether there is a more elegant solution in  that fills in the  values itself when loading the data back into memory?
If the  is of type , instead of setting  to , you could adapt the code from the section Persistence of External Objects in the  documentation:
