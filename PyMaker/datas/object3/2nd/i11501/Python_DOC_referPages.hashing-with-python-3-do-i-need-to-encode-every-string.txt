Natural Text
I'm migrating from Python 2 to Python 3 and wonder if every string literal needs to be encoded now before you can hash it. Example code will run perfectly under Python 2:using Python 3 however, it throws a  so I have to append an  after each string or am I missing something here?
The  operates on bytes-like objects only and the documentation explicitly states:Note: Feeding string objects into  is not supported, as hashes work on bytes, not on characters.So any time you'd like to hash a  object in Python 3, you have to encode it first.
