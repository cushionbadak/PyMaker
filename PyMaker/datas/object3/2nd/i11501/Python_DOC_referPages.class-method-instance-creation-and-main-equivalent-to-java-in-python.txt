In python, intendation is very important. If you intend some code segment, it means that code segment is part of a block.See following snippet from your codeYou should correct indentation of this code segment. It should be,'__main__' is the name of the scope in which top-level code executes.  A moduleâ€™s __name__ is set equal to '__main__' when read from standard  input, a script, or from an interactive prompt.A module can discover whether or not it is running in the main scope  by checking its own __name__, which allows a common idiom for  conditionally executing code in a module when it is run as a script or  with python -m but not when it is imported:  A module can discover whether or not it is running in the main scope  by checking its own __name__, which allows a common idiom for  conditionally executing code in a module when it is run as a script or  with python -m but not when it is imported: - Python documentation
