I am practicing using type hints in Python 3.5. One of my colleague uses :Both of them work just fine, there doesn't appear to be a difference. I have read the  module documentation.Between  or  which one should I use in the program?
There is no real difference between using a plain  and , no.However,  is a Generic type that lets you specify the type of the keys and values too, making it more flexible:As such, it could well be that at some point in your project lifetime you want to define the dictionary argument a little more precisely, at which point expanding  to  is a 'smaller' change than replacing .You can make this even more generic by using  or  types here; since your function doesn't need to alter the mapping, I'd stick with . A  is one mapping, but you could create other objects that also satisfy the mapping interface, and your function might well still work with those:Now you are clearly telling other users of this function that your code won't actually alter the  mapping passed in.Your actual implementation is merely expecting an object that is printable. That may be a test implementation, but as it stands your code would continue to work if you used , because any object in Python is printable.
 is a generic version of :A generic version of dict. The usage of this type is as follows:Here you can specify the type of key and values in the dict:
