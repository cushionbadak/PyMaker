Currently, we are building a robot with a raspberry pi and the AX-12 dynamixel Servo's. We found a python2 library we a currently porting to python3, we pinpointed the problem in a specific method that gives an error in python3.The Python 2 version actually works like a charmWhat we have tried is adjust this variable:Now the script runs, sadly the Servo won't work anymore.We also tried to place the bytes in a byte arrayThe script runs but the servo won't run.My believe is that the operations done to outData is different in python3 then in python2. I can't find out what should be adjusted or different.Anybody sees what I am currently doing wrong?
Your bytes are not UTF-8 data; for any of your  values you create outside the range 0 - 127, encoding to UTF-8 produces two bytes.You were creating Unicode codepoints from integer values; these create Latin-1 codepoints if you limited those to integers between 0 and 255; in principle you could encode to  to get the bytes again, but it is much easier to just create bytes in the first place.In Python 3, use the  type, created from a list of integers:Your own attempt did not include the  value and you used  rather than .You could also use a  object, which would let you append additional bytes; you could use that to calculate the checksum by referencing the bytes produced so far, avoiding having to repeat yourself (a common source of errors):You could use concatenation too of course (, ) but  is also available in Python 2, so the above version is compatible with both major Python versions.
