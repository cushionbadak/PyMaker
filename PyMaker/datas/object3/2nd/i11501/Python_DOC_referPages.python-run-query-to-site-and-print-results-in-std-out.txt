I have been trying to write a python scripts used for checks on IP address to www.blacklistalert.com. The goal is to run the script on one or multiple IP addresses as standard input. Then have the standard output from the site be printed on the command line. I am running into the problem of sending the query to the page, and getting results, which come on a separate page. I am currently getting the error:Whats the best approach to run the IP address query, and get the response in standard output? Thanks in advance.
Python is not bash, and does not process arguments on stdin automatically into variables like  (hint: the only place  is used in Python is when dealing with currency based on the dollar). Instead, Python places command-line arguments in the  list. You can either read them from there ( is the script's name,  and so on are the command-line parameters - read the docs for the full story), or use something like the  module, which I recommend. There's a bit more code involved, but it'll be worth it in the end.
