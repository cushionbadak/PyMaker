I wrote a Python script that I am now trying to get to run via the command line. It consists of a function that takes one obligatory and a few optional arguments. Now I am trying to make it executable through the command line like so:This works well as long as I put in only one argument; but I don't know how to accept the additional, optional input that  delivers as a list. Is there a simple way of doing this with this approach?Or is it necessary to use an additional module such asargparse?I tried feeding keyword arguments into the function as well butcouldn't make that work either - is that a feasible approach?I am working with Python 2.7 on a Mac. Any help is much appreciated!
I always use argparse, because it gives you nice error handling, converts strings to ints or open files, and clearly documents the options. However, this should do what you want:
