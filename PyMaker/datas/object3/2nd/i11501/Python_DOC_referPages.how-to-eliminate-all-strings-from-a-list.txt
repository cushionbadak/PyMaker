my question is how to eliminate all strings from a list, for example if I have   and the outcome to be 
You need to use  to filter out those elements that are string. Also don't name your variable  it will shadow the built in or or
You can do that using , but unlike the other answer by user3100115 I would blacklist types that you don't want instead of whitelist only a few types. Not sure which would be more suitable for your special case, just adding that as alternative. It also works without any imports.Instead of a list comprehension, you could also use the  builtin. That returns a generator, so to directly print it, you have to convert it into a list first. But if you're going to iterate over it (e.g. using a -loop), do not convert it and it will be faster and consume less memory due to "lazy evaluation". You could achieve the same with the example above if you replace the square brackets with round brackets.
Either use list comprehension as @user3100115 or use the "lisp/lambda approach"By the way, do not name your variable . It is already a python function. :)
