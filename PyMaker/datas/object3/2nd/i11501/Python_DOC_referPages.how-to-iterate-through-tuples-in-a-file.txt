Natural Text
I'm working on a project for my NLP class and this point I have a .txt file that looks like this:So basically, it's just a bunch of tuples with a word and a tag. I'm trying to iterate through this file and return a list of just things tagged with "NOUN."So, the output may look like: I am really unsure how to iterate through these tuples and more so get rid of that u' tag. Can anyone help?
Considering you have the data in a text file, here is a solution using regex:Following image shows the results produced:
Use a list comprehension to decompose all tuples,apply the str function to the word to convert it to a string instead of unicode, and filter out words based on their type:A little tip is using the lower function to standardize strings to check conditions. If you think you will have rogue whitespace, you can also use strip() right after it like:
You can use a list comprehension to do this, such as this one:List comprehension syntax is a little confusing, so here is it's equivalent for loop
I am assuming you will first get the lines from text and replace all u' with '. Then you can iterate through the tuples like this;
