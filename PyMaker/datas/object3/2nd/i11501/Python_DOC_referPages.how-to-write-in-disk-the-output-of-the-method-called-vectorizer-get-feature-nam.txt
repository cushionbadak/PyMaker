Natural Text
I am working in the following code using sklearn and python to vectorize this text:https://gist.github.com/adolfo255/be2bc75327e288d4d090659e231fa487My code is this:Everything goes well, until the part when i try to write the output, i would like to write on disk the output of the last print, I mean this:I tried the following:but this approach did not work.I got:I would appreciate any suggestion of how to achieve this, since i want to analyze the output later, the problem is related with the encoding but i donÂ´t know how to fix it, i would appreciate any suggestion.
In order to convert your  (aka unicode) object into bytes to be written to the file, Python needs to encode it using some encoding. For some reason (either due to your system's default encoding or because of some code you haven't pasted here), Python is using the ASCII encoding, which cannot handle some of the code points in your object.Because of the  statements without any , I assume this is Python 3. One fix is to ensure that the encoding used to write to a file is UTF-8. On my system that's the default:Therefore, on my machine, the code you pasted works fine. You can specify the encoding and override the default in your  calls, e.g.  and  (docs).A good reference for understanding these issues can be found in the Unicode HOWTO.If you're in fact using Python 2, you probably want to use  as described here.
Since this code is written on python 2.7.10 the problem was fixed using codecs, and the library called: chardet to see the encoding of the data, as follows
