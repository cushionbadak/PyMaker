I'm currently writing a Python Telegram bot which is used to monitor Raspi IOs and send messages to a channel. So basically it has a function that will update a logging variable .This function (), as it's named, will remove entries that are more than 5 mins old. In it, I tried to check the content of the global variable. Upon printing, it just hangs.This doesn't seem to block any other functionalities of the bot because I can still call out other bot commands.I don't think it's the bot. It must be some kind of data access problems.I attach some code snippet below:P.S. I think someone might suggest a 'class' version of this. Think it'll work?
In the  function, I forgot to put  in front of the should-be members  and :Which is why the value returned was always an empty string.Note to self: check your variables!!!On that note, that kind of explained why it didn't seem to block the thread.
