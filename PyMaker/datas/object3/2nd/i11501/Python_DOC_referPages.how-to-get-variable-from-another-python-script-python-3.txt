I have 2 Python 3.5 scripts, boot.py and about.py. Boot.py is located in /os, but about.py is located in /os/bin. Boot.py starts about.py with . The problem is that about.py requires variables that are in boot.py, and i dont want to rewrite them all over again. So i need to start about.py in a way that it can read/use the variables in boot.py. If its unclear, i posted the codes down below.boot.py:about.py:
Simply import the other file.By doing so the file will be run and the variables defined.I would also recommend putting all code of the other file, that shouldn't run when imported in a if statement (not necessary in this case though):If the  file is the directory above you would write (add a . for every parent directory):If the  file is the directory above you would write (make sure to put a empty file called  in any subdirectories you are importing from):
