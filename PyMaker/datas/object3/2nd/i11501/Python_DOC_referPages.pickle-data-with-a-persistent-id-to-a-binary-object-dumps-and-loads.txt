A first question I asked was how to load a pickle object and resolve certain references. A next problem I'm facing is that I cannot call  or  objects to a binary object.Below is an implementation of the  and the . How can I use these to convert an object to and back from its binary representation? As far as I know this only works for files.
Your solution is similar to the one in  (I'm the author) -- but not as robust.https://github.com/uqfoundation/dill/blob/cccbea9b715e16b742288e1e5a21a687a4d4081b/dill/temp.py#L169   (code snipped reproduced below)Note that you may want to be careful about things like to  the buffer on , as  does.
I think I've found the answer:Basically you first create two utility methods:  and . Next one can implement  and  where one wraps an  that acts as a handler to which and from which data can be loaded/stored.
