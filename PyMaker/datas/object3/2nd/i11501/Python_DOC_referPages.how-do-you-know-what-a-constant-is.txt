Would  be a constant or not?
It depends on what you would call a constant. Python has immutable objects. like strings. Remember that in Python variables are basically labels on objects. So if you writethe label  is used for the immutable string . If you then were to doyou haven't changed the string, you've just hung the label on a different string.But immutable objects are not what we generally think of as constants. In Python a constant could be thought of as an immutable label; a variable (label) that cannot be changed once it is assigned. Until recently, Python didn't really have those. By convention, an all-uppercase name signals that it shouldn't be changed. But this isn't enforced by the language.But since Python 3.4 (and also backported to 2.7) we have the  module that defines different kinds of enumeration classes (singletons really). An enumeration can basically be used as group of constants.Here is an example where a function to compare files returns an enum;This saves you having to look up what the return value of  actually means every time you use it.You cannot change existing attributes of the  after it has been defined. There is one surprise here; you can add new attributes later, and those can be changed.
No there is not. You cannot declare a variable or value as constant in Python. Just don't change it.If you are in a class, the equivalent would be:if not, it is justThe following code snippet might help you Link .
