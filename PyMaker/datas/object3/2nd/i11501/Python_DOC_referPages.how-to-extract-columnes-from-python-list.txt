You don't need to read all the data into memory at all, you can use itertools.islice to parse the rows you want and the csv lib to read and write the data:
I'd highly suggest using numpy for this.  The reason being this is all numerical data that fits so nicely into memory.  The code looks like this.and then you want to write the fileThe way the array slicing line  reads is "take every 3rd row starting from 0, and take every other column starting from 0"
I think you need something this?
