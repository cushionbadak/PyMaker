I am trying to send jobs to a Pool one by one (due to memory limits I cannot use map). Is it possible for the pool to digest if it has available workers and otherwise to wait?e.g. can I do something like this?where  sends the job if the pool has more workers available and otherwise wait until it does.
The way the problem can be solved is by using a semaphore initialized with the number of workers. You acquire and release the semaphore before feeding the pool and after a worker has completed the task.Here's an example working with Python 2.6 or greater.
