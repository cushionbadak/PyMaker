You could always do it without , putting the files in a list and closing them manually, in a loop, when everything is done. This will also make the  line much simpler:Or using , as suggested in comments. This way, the opened files are passed to the  and that will take care of closing the files after the  block.
You could process the files serially (which gets around the potential problem of having too many files open at once):This will leave  and  lying about, which you may or may not care about cleaning up.
