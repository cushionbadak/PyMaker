In , I can use  instead of , where  can be a  or .Is there any similar function for , ,  in python?
In a way, no. But there are lots of somewhat similar alternatives. The  function of R seems quite versatile, so in Python one has to replace it case by case.You could use  for simple collections:Or  for, again simple, objects:Pandas' s support directly accessing specific columns and applying operations on them. Summing is an easy example, as it has a function as is:There's also , which is closest to what you're after, I think:Evaluate an expression in the context of the calling DataFrame instance.
Not really.  R and Python have pretty different philosophies when it comes to this kind of thing--in R it's possible to write a function which parses the entire syntax of its arguments before they are evaluated, whereas in Python it's not.  So in Python, this is impossible:However, this works:If you wanted to apply other chained operations, you could implement support for something like this:Then you can do this:
