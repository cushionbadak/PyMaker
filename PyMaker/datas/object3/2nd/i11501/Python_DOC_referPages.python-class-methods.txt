So I am trying to create a program that has a class called "Loan" which calculates the monthly payment and total payment of a car with data fields. I'm guessing that my error is caused by having a method ( getMonthlyPayment() ) in the method ( getTotalPayment ). How do I put a method inside a method? Or is there another solution to my problem? Thanks!My error is:
Just like accessing members, you need to prepend all accesses to methods with .Change  toAlso, take a look at  to make getters and setters less painful. However, most of the time, you shouldn't even be defining getters and setters in Python. Private-ness is not usually treated as a concept in idiomatic Python.
