I have add multiple spinboxes and labels in a gui window using a for loop. The for loop creates the spinbox and labels on the same row. Then in the next irritation of the loop creates another row of labels and spinbox. How do I get the value from the spinbox (either when clicked or when incremented or decremented), then do calculation with the value from the clicked spinbox and update a label that is on the same row as the spinbox? I have added the code I used to create spinboxes using a for loop.
In  When you do:You expect  to be the one associated with the spinbox clicked on correct? Instead what happens is that it uses the widget assigned to the  variable at the time  is called which is after the  loop so it will only update the last .There are two ways to make sure  updates the right label:Using a wrapper for First this means that  needs to take the label to update as an argument:and you can use a  to make the callback wrapper:Make the label an attribute of the spinbox that triggers the callback.I personally prefer this method, you can create arbitrary attributes on all of tk widgets:then instead of  in  you would update :Note that you may want to phase out using  completely since, as you have encountered, it does not always trigger when clicking on the arrows and it definitely doesn't trigger when using the arrow keys, one solution is to change the  of the Spinbox after initialization so that it triggers a virtual event (so that you can still use  as it is written) And then bind that virtual event instead of :Then just change the binding to use  and it will generate and handle that event every time it... well changes:
