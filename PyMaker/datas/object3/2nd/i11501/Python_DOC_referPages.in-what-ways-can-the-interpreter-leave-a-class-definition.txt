I'm intrigued by the following statement:When a class definition is left normally (via the end), a class object is created. (from the Python tutorial)In what other ways can the class definition "be left"? I can think of a . Are there other ways?
Here's another way:
I believe the phrase "When a class definition is left normally (via the end)" refers to how Python builds your object class definitions during the first phase of compilation.Suppose you declare a class:Before you actually execute your program, the Python compiler does a pass through your code to build an index of object and class definitions that will be used as your program runs (often referred to as a "symbol table"). When it reaches  it begins interpreting the following lines as the class definition for  until the last indented line is reached and the compiler at which point  is now a defined symbol in our index and Python goes on its way running the rest of your program.
