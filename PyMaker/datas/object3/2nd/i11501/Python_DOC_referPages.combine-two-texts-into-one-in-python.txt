I am trying to scrape a website. I have got the information I need but I can't figure out how to output the prod title followed by a space and then the amount and then keep doing down until the end.
Use .
You can use the  function.Usage:Documentation for zip - https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip
You can use izip function https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html#itertools.izip which returns an iterator instead of the listizipped = izip(iter1, iter2)for x in izipped:    print(str(x[0], str(x[1]))
