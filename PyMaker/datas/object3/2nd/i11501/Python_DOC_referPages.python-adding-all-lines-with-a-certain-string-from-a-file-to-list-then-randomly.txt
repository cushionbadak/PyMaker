Natural Text
This is the part of the code for my random tips from a file so far. I wish to add another part of code where it adds all strings with any occurrence of the input placed after "/tip ", for example, if I were to type "/tip Hello", it would compile all lines in the text file with "Hello" in the string and do a random.choice() from the list, printing the one chosen. I don't really know where to start with this, any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance!
You don't have to store all of the lines in a list. You can read the lines, selecting one at random and discarding the rest. This is called "resevoir sampling".Your code might look like this:As a more special case, this code randomly chooses a matching line from the tips file, but falls back to a random non-matching line if no match exists. It has the advantages of reading the input file exactly once, and not having to store the entire tips file in memory.References:https://stackoverflow.com/a/23840292/8747https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling
I think this is what you want, process each line of a text file, checking if the line has the word you're looking for.  If so, add it to a list, and the randomly select one "line" for all possible "lines".
