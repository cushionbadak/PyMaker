Natural Text
I want to detect whether a word is in a sentence using python regex. Also, want to be able to negate it.this code works but I do not understand why I need to put  in there.Also to negate it, I do not know how to do that.I've tried:but it does not work.My ultimate goal is to combine them like so:
To detect if a word exists in  a string you need a positive lookahead:The  is necessary to enable searching farther than just at the string start ( anchors the search at the string start).To check if a string has no word in it, use a negative lookahead:So, combining them:will find a match in a string that contains a whole word  and does not contain a whole word .
You need the  because  tries to match the pattern to the beginning of the string.  If you want to search the whole string, use .Just as you can do , you can also do 
UpdateJust found that Python re.match() has an implied  anchor.In other words it will only match at the beginning of the string,and strangely, unlike Java, does not require it to match the entire string.  Be warned though that combining a sequential positive and negative   lookahead,as in Stribnez answer, can give unintended results if not anchored tosomething. Either to literal text or a BOS anchor .  For general usage, don't rely on the fact that (or if), in some languagethe match() function implies a BOS anchor  (and possibly EOS ).Put one (or both) in there at all times. This way it can be usedin search() as well. And is portable to other languages.  To see how negative and positive, in-series lookahead's can cause problems,take this tricky standalone expression  It can be examined like this:  Since it is in-series, both assertions have to be matched at the sameposition in the string.  Given the same position in the string for both, the negative assertioncan be satisfied when it finds a place that downstream does not match it's contents.  Assuming that no anchoring exists, this leave's an opening upstream(between the search position and the  literal in the example) forthe undesired content to exist, that will still satisfy the positive/negativeassertion pair.  Example:matches This shows that at position 1, both assertions are satisfied.  Conclusion(s):1. Always use anchors, even if they are implied.2. Avoid using any language's match() function, use search() instead.  End updateIt doesn't matter if you use a positive or negative lookahead,if you don't use the correct syntax, it won't work.   Look at this  This says that the next character can't be an equal sign  followed bya greedy number of characters up to the next . This is not allowed.  So, it will not match , but it will match '=(here) ab foo'.  The next problem is that if you don't give the assertion anything to anchor onit will use a bump-along to move the postion to a place between charactersthat will satisfy it.  The corrections for the negative lookahead you are looking for is this For reference:  And, they can be mixed and nested anywhere.
