I am trying to trim a sequence based upon a trimmed quality score. Since I'm relatively new to python, I was looking for something simple that may do the trick. I have the following quality score that is converted based on phred scores to numerical values:1816  28  32  32  26  164  30  32  1816  1618  216  22  1616  216  218  20  28  1816  1816  24  1816  1620  20  24  28  28  28  216  26  28   1622  216  28  24  18  24  28  1622  30  222  24  18  218  216  26  26  218  28  1624  24  16  26  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2Here is the corresponding sequence:ACCGAGCCGAAGGAGACCGCATTCACCCGGATGCCCTTCGAGGCCAGCGCCACCGCCATCGACCGCGTCATCTGCTCCACCGCGGCCCAGCTGATGGAACAEssentially, I want to be able to remove/cut/trim all value "2"s at the end of the quality score, compare the two strings and remove/cut/trim the corresponding sequence nucleotides at the end of the sequence. I have tried splitting the quality score into two sections, and using that to print the first section of the sequence:But it doesn't seem to print the cut sequence. I am able to cut the quality score where I want it to. Another thing you may have noticed is that the quality score values are not spaced appropriately. I'm not sure why this is occurring.. I used a  for the quality score values once they were converted and this is the output I got. I would appreciate your suggestions!
 from itertools, when applied to the reversed data, does what you want -- it filters until the filter is no longer true and then drops out completely, low quality scores will no longer trip it:OUTPUTACCGAGCCGAAGGAGACCGCATTCACCCGGATGCCCTTCGAGGCCAGCGCCAThis same technique can also be used (more easily) to clean up low qualty data at the start of the sequence.
To handle trimming from the end only of the quality scores you can use  on the reversed  list to get rid of the trailing '2' items (thanks @cdlane for that idea). Then slice the  to the length of the trimmed quality scores. No zipping required:Output
