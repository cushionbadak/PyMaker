New to python. Learning to create a function that results a list of lists... for example, something that can represent a family tree.  Here is what I came up with:Seems to work...... but results unnecessary brackets and print outputs.Any suggestions for better implementation? Will work on a Class structure next.

One simpler approach without breaking your code: You might also make use of  built-in library to pretty-print objects
