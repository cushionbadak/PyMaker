Please see following Python code:Is there a way to get process ID from which signal came from?Or is there another way to get process ID from which signal came from without blocking main flow of application?
 returns the current process id. So when you send a signal, you can print it out, for example.Check this for more info on signals.To send pid to the process one may use Exchanging objects between processes
You cannot directly. The signal module of Python standard library has no provision for giving access to the Posix  structure. If you really need that, you will have to build a Python extension in C or C++.You will find pointers for that in Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter - this document should also be available in your Python distribution
