Natural Text
I am currently expanding by python skills by programming a procedurally generated dungeon level in text format. I am confused as to why my "intersects" define is not working. Here is the class containing the def:Here is where it's called:Full traceback:I hope someone can help me understand why this code won't work, thank you.I have managed to fix the problem. I'm sorry if my question was not defined very well. I have only been learning Python for around 4 weeks and i am used to Java which has a very different syntax. Here is my solution:
As most previous comments have said, you use global variables that shouldn't be global at all.The way I understand your code, you meant for , ,  and  to be attributes of your  instance, meaning that each room has its own values for , ,  and . In Python you don't have to declare attributes at the beginning of the class (where you declare all the global variables), you simply need to initialize the attributes in the  method.This means that you can safely delete all the  lines, and change your  to(note that you don't need  since you're already dealing with integers, simply use the integer division operator )That way you define , , , , ,  and  as attributes of your class meaning that each instance has its own values for these variables. In Python, you need to add  before all calls to attributes of the object itself, so you should also modify  to add  before each access to an attribute of your current object (all the , , etc. that are not already prefixed by  in your code).Also, while we're at it I don't think your  function works as intended, but that's another problem :)
