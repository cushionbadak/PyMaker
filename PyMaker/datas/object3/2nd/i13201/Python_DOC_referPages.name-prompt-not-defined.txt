my code needs to ask the user for 3 numbers. if the numbers are over  or under , tell them My problem is: I can't figure out how to define my variable , and am getting the below  when I run my code.Code:Stacktrace:
Here is how I would approach the get_int function:Inside function , the , , and  arguments are already defined because they are in the argument list. The  argument is passed to the  function, and then the  and  limits are used for range checking within an infinite while loop. The function returns a valid number within the range. If the user enters an integer that's out of range, we ask them again until they give an acceptable input. So the caller is guaranteed to get an integer within the specified range.This isn't ideal design, because what if the user doesn't want to enter a number, but they want to "navigate back"... so that's outside the scope of this approach. But there is a more advanced programming technique called exception handling (read up on  /  /  for examples) 7.4. The try statement.Outside the function, where  is invoked, the  and  are defined as global variables in the main module namespace. For testing I just ran in interactive mode, accepting a single value. Tested on python 2.7 and python 3.2.If you've never seen the  string formatting expression before, that's described in the python help files section 6.1.2. String Formatting and 6.1.3.2. Format examples.
