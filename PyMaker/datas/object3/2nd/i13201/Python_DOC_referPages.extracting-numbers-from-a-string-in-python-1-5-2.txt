I'm currently working with a Telit module (GT864-py) and I'm trying to extract numbers from a return value/string that I recieve when using AT-commands.This is an example of the code that I'm using:which gives the responseNow, I would like to filter the number after ADC, however, I have not yet found a solution as to how.By using this code in PythonWin 1.5.2+ I get the following error:NameError: isdigitSo I am assuming isdigit isn't supported in Python 1.5.2, is that correct? And if so, does anyone know any other ways to extract the numbers after #ADC: xxx ?
The Python 1.5.2p2 documentation is available online. Indeed, there is no  in either  or in the module .Even in Python 1.5,  is a sequence that supports the  operation, so you could do:For more thorough parsing I'd use a regular expression, with module  instead; the code This will match  followed by any number of spaces, followed by 1 or more digits ; the digits are captured in the group , whose value is then stored to  if a match was found.
If the string is always exactly , then simple string slicing should also work:
