I need to write a program that generates a random integer named file_size between 4 and 7, inclusive, then print them, but each random integer must be both between 5 and 19 inclusive and be an odd number. Duplicates are okay.To summarize, if file_size is 6, then 6 odd numbers ranging from 5 to 19 must be printed. I'm using Python 3 by the way. This is what I have so far:Output is as follows for a sample run:This obviously isn't what I'm looking for. Please help.
You're loop runs  times, but only prints when the randomly generated number is odd, meaning you'll generally get less results than desired.  To get a random odd number you'd need to keep generating random values until you get one that is odd, e.g.:You can tweak this however you need, and write unit tests to verify the random generation behavior you expect.  Then, use this helper in your  code:As horns suggests,  is really the function you want, but in general the helper function pattern is a good one to follow - split up your code's responsibility into parts, so that each part is conceptually simpler and can be verified independently.
Your current code is very close. Just use  with a step of 2 instead of . This will not generate any even numbers, so you will get the right number of odd ones. However, you need to increase the upper bound by one because  is inclusive of the upper bound but  is not, like the builtint  function.
