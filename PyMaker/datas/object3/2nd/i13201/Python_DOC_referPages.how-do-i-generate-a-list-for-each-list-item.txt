How do I generate a list for each name and append a price(s) into that listeg.This is what I've been trying to use:EditI want to be able to manipulate â€“ add/remove prices from - the generated lists like  or Thanks so much for helping, I'm still learning
Edit - using dictionaries: Now that you have specified how you would like to manipulate your data, I'd strongly recommend to switch to using a dictionary instead of lists. Because of how the association of keys and values work, dictionaries will allow you to access a specific item by a more descriptive value than a numeric index, like a list does. Your new code would look something like this:And if you ever need to check up on the prices of a specific fruit you could always use:likewise, in order to add a new price you only need to type:And to remove a price:To insert an entirely new item to the dictionary, simply use the  operator to attribute to the new key:And to remove an item, simply call the  method:This way you will have a much clearer on what you're manipulating at any given time than by trying to juggle around obscure list indices.If you must use lists, however, please refer to my old answer below.Old answer:Assuming the two lists of prices used were supposed to be assigned to two different variables, a solution would be to iterate over the lists like so:
You can use  twice:In python3,  is a generator, thus we use  to turn the generator into a list.
