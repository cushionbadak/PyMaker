I have data grabbed to Python that is in table form:How can I format this table in Python that would make it easy to sort or group items. For example, if I wanted to see all the names of people that played Golf or all of the people that scored 100 on any sport. Or all of the data for just John.
'  will be the way to go:
 and  with s and s can be used for this task.Results:
What about this one?This should hold the relation of each entry as list are ordered.To avoid the effect of duplicate element in a list, first make a new  from the list.For your expected query, you can do something like that.It's better to use a  to store the result and make it a , to avoid some cases for example, if a man has score of  in two different games.
You can create list of lists. each row will be a list inside a list.
If you want to retrieve information based on your data, I'd go with SQL.  It's well-suited to answering questions like these:...to see all the names of people that played Golf......all of the people that scored 100 on any sport......all of the data for just John.The most popular database language these days is SQL, and as it happens Python actually has built-in support for it through the  module.SQL, while not a monumental task to learn, is beyond the scope of this answer.  To learn that, I'd recommend checking out Codecademy, Code School, or SQLZOO (they're all interactive).Or, if you just want to read it in and write it out without caring about what it actually means, consider using the  module, which is also built-in.
