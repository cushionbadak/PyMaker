I've two functions, and I want to choose function  or function  on a  terminal.This example I define the function will be used inside :At terminal Inputting:Outupts:Then when I've two functions and call just one of them:
The canonical (and, in my view, correct) way to do this is to create a mapping of argument values to functions, which is simple to implement, efficient and easily scalable:Note the use of  to pass the rest of the arguments to the function - see What does ** (double star) and * (star) do for parameters?. This has removed the requirement for  to have a third value to create the functions, which could be a problem if you decide to reuse those functions elsewhere.This will raise a  if the user enters an invalid function name; you can handle this and give them a more specific error message if you like (either with , which will be more efficient than checking in a list, or using  and ).If you want a more complex CLI, with e.g. flags and specific value types, you should use something like  or .
You definitively asked the wrong question. Your question is "how do arguments work on Python", and for working with arguments you have two options I'm aware of:Using sys.argv: you need to write something like Using argparse which is a far better solution
