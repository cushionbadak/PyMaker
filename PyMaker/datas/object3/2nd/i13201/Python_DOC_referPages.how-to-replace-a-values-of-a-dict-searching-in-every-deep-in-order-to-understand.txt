i have tried to solve my problem studing this and this and several other pages but i'm not able to understand. I hope i will ask something new.I try to explain the problem because i don't known the right way to solve it.I make two requests with requests.get to obtain two json answer from the same api of two version of the same sdk. I want to understand if those json are equal but i want to "whitelist" some values thats i known it will be different (for example creation timestamp).To do this i want to replace some values of the same keys with the same values in order to ignore difference inside some keys.For example /server/v1/api.php response is :and /server/v2/api.php response is :Now I want to "whitelist" dateTime thats because it's normal that it values will change.How to replace values of a key at every deep? I need to obtainso the two json will be equal.in the real case i DON'T known json structure and I NEED to USE a hardcoded whitelist to filter the test result so i need to iterate over the json in order to apply the whitelist.this is a real exampleupdate :as suggested by Letzerwille i should use dict.update() to apply whitelist. How to apply to dict contained in my first dict without removing other keys? for example this is my whitelist dictit keeps all the keys that i want "to whitelist".but applying this dict i will destroy every other keys of "content" dict, because the entire "content" keys will be overwritten by the new one so i lost, for example, ["content"]["owner"] that should not be removed (this is the result)how i can solve this problem?so i tried to make a function with receive a dict and a whitelist (for example whitelist = ["id"] ) but something during the iteration of the list doesn't work and it return a corrupted object (thats because entering in the list switch case, the function exit)Is my way the best way to obtain that result? any suggestions?
