The title basically says it all. I want the absolute, most barebones, simplest implementation of a server socket, and a client socket. Im sure there are questions similar to this, but I have not found anything that works for me.  If possible, please have the server socket send the message "hi" to the client socket which receives this and prints it out. Vice-versa would also be nice just so I can see a client sending to a server and how it works. Thanks! 
The documentation has pretty much what you're asking for: https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#example
besides Doc of Python, tutorialspoint is also a good place to start learning
