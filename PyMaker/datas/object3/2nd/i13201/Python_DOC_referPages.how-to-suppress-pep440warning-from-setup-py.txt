I am running  or  which gives me 's for unrelated packages I am not going to fix:I would like to silence this warning, and I tried a number of variants of the  switch without any success:match module:  → warnings there, no message about invalid  specificationmatch class name:  → match fully qualified class name:  →  (??)match the message test:  →  warnings there, no message about invalid  specificationmatch all warnings:   →  warnings thereThe last attempt leads me to believe that for some reason the command-line switch is not being honored at all. Why?
If using  still shows the warning,  is either not using the  module to generate that output or it is starting a new Python without the same options.Try using an environment variable like this: If it still shows the warning, then I'd check the source code to see how that warning is being generated.
