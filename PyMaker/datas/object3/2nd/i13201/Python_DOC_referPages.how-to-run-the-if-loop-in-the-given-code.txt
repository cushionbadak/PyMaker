Code works from  to count=9. Then it does not get in to the other elif code. I have commented which part is not working below. I have tried so many time by checking the value of count, still I could not find why the code doesn't work
Your expression:does not do what you think it does. You are not testing if  has one of 4 possible values there. Python sees this as 3 different expressions forming a tuple:producing the outputif  is not equal to 3 and if it is.  will always return  because it is a non-zero numeric value, so true, and it doesn't matter what the other side of the  operator evaluates as anymore.A tuple with 3 elements is always true in a boolean context, because it is a non-empty container. As such, that  branch is always going to match if preceding  or  tests failed.See the Truth Value Testing and Boolean Operations sections for details on how boolean testing and  work.Use the  operator membership test instead:where the test will be true if  has a value that's in the set of 4 possible values.
