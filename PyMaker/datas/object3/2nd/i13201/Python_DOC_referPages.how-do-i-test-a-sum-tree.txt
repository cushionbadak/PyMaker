I have 2 lists. One contains , the other contains the  those values hold in a sum tree. (the lists have same length)For example: Those lists correctly correspond becauseI need to check if a given list of values and a list of its levels corresponds correctly. So far I have managed to put together this function, but for some reason it's not returning True for correct lists array and numbers. Input numbers here would be  and array would be 
I got this running using  to grab the subtree under each level. Toss that into a recursive function and assert that all recursions pass.I've slightly improved my initial implementation by grabbing a  and  and testing early to see if the current node is a parent node and only building  if there's something to build. That inequality check is much cheaper than iterating through the whole  zip.It unfortunately adds a lot of complexity to the code since it pulls out the first value that we need, which necessitates an extra  call. That's not ideal. Unless you're expecting to get very large lists for  and , it might be worthwhile to do  and approach this list-wise rather than iterator-wise. e.g...I still think the fastest way is probably to iterate once with an approach almost like a state machine and grab all the possible subtrees, then check them all individually. Something like:This should give you a list of  objects, each of which having the following attributesAfter you do that, you should be able to simply checkBut note that I haven't been able to test this second approach.
