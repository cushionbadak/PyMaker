Let's say I have a C/C++ file named . Using Python, how can I invoke the local gcc compiler so that the file is compiled and an executable is made? More specifically, I would like to provide some input (stdin) via some file  and I want to save the standard output into another file called . I saw some documentation that I will need to use subprocess, but I'm not sure how to call that and how to provide custom input.
A simple solution will be as given below:2 caveats:I am hardcoding stuff. You may want to parameterize and all that.Setting shell to True, is a security risk, per Python documentation.
Here's a possible solution (written for Python 3):The parameter  makes  use strings rather than bytes for input and output. If you want bytes rather than strings, open the files in binary mode and set .On compile or run errors in the two programs,  will be raised by .
