I'm desperate here. Trying to do a program for one of my classes and having so much trouble with it. I added an input loop because part of the requirements is that the user has to be able to enter as many lines of code as they want. Issue is, now I get the error that the index is out of range, and I think that's because I am breaking to stop the loop. Here's my code: I am definitely an amateur and could use all the help/advice I can get. THANKS SO MUCH
In your while loop, because you're testing for textinput == "" after you've already set textinput = input(), that means that when it breaks, textinput will always be ""! The index out of range error then arises when you try to access words[0]; there are no elements in "", so you'll get an error.Also, since you're overwriting the value of textinput every time you go through the while loop, you can't actually keep track of all the previous things the user has entered, since textinput keeps on changing. Instead, you can put all the code under the while loop into the while loop. Try:(By the way, you didn't define text either when you wrote "for line in text", and you never actually used "line" in that for loop. Just little notes to look out for, good luck!)
You're reassigning the textinput variable on every loop iteration. Instead, you could try something like:
Your problem exist because the  statement only break out of the  loop, and then it will continue running  and onwards.To stop the script when you received a empty input, use  instead of .
You can keep reading data and processing it separate by using 2-argument form of :It's simpler than it looks: when you give 2 arguments and iterate over what it returns, it'll call the first argument and yield what it returned, until it returns something equal to second argument.And  does the same as .So the code here above prints what he read until user enters empty line.
