I'm trying to read a dictionary in my python script from an environment variable.This is the code of my python script: And this is how I'm specifying the environment variable (but is not recognising it as a dictionary)Can anyone help me figuring out what am I missing? Thanks in advance guys
You can you use the  module for this.
Your json object here is being represented as a string. You need to now use the json module to make it a proper Python dictionary. You also have an error in your json with that trailing comma you have at the end.Furthermore, is that in order to use the json module for this, you should be using double quotes and then enclose by single quotes. I also don't see the "\" as necessary if you are setting them in to an environment variable. However, if they are there, they will also be in your string as this:The json module will have a hard time with that. What you can do in that case is if you really want those slashes in there, make sure you remove them before performing your  command using the replace method on the string. So, you can in fact, do this: Below are two examples. One with the modifications I made to the json removing the slashes, and another without removing:Output:Now, with the slashes in place. Remember, you have to at least fix your quotes and remove that comma first, as I mentioned.Here is information on the json module: Python 2https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.htmlPython 3https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html
It is being recognised as a string. You need to evaluate it as python code in order to create a dictionary from it. is more limited than built-in , but it is safe to use from untrusted sources, as it cannot execute arbitrary code.
