So this is very simple, but I'm having trouble getting this to work.  I want to, for example, if the incoming IP address string is '168.108.114.22', convert this to a bytes object like:Basically each part of the IP address is converted to it's hexadecimal equivalent.  I've tried so many ways but couldn't get what I want.  String manipulation, using socket.inet_aton, packing, etc.  I want to be able to send  these bytes over a socket and then receive and parse them at the other end, but I am having trouble just getting my bytes object created and looking like that.
Python's  function should do what you need, it does return a string containing exactly 4 bytes:These would display:And to convert the four characters back again using :Giving:
thison python 3 produceswhich should be what you are looking for, if I understand correctly.Note: there are more specific and optimized utility functions to manipulate IP addresses
