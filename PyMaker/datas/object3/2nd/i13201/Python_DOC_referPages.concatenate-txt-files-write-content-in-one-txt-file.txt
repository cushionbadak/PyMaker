Natural Text
I have some .txt files in a folder. I need to collect their content all in one .txt file.  I'm working with Python and tried:but did not work. The 'out.txt' is generated but the code never ends. Any advice? Thanks in advance.
 returns tuples, not filenames:Also you should open outfile in the beginning, not in each loop.
This solved my problem. The generated 'out.txt' file is just 151KB. Thanks everybody.
