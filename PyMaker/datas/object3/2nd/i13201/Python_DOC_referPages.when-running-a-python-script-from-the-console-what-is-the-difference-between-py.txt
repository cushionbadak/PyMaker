I have been reading about python, and I have certain doubts when using the shebang line. When I run:It executes the script using the python version that I have indicated in the shebang line, but when I execute,The last version of Python is used instead of the one that I have specified. I would like to know the difference between using  and  when running a script from the command line. My shebang line was  Does using either  or  have different implications or eventually both are the same?
(This answer assumes you're using Windows, but I expect it mostly applies to other OSes too, modulo some details)"python.exe" is the actual interpreter. You have one for each version of Python on your system. Which version gets executed when you run "python" on the command line, depends on your  environment variable and your current working directory. "py.exe" is the Python Launcher. You probably only have one, even if you have multiple Python installs. Mine is in . It looks at the script, decides what version it's using, and delegates the actual execution to the proper interpreter.
To see what version of Python are in use for each command, run these two commands:If both show the same version, then on your system they are both currently the same. However, one or the other might be updated. I personally recommend to rely on neither, and to call the Python version that you want explicitly in your scripts.
