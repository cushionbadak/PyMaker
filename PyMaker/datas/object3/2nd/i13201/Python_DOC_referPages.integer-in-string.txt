Write a function named enterNewPassword. This function takes no parameters. It prompts the user to enter a password until the entered password has 8-15 characters, including at least one digit. Tell the user whenever a password fails one or both of these tests.I have come up with somewhat of a solution but cannot seem to find if a digit is involved in the input. This is what I have come up with so far. Can you please help me how to check if there is a digit in the password in the input? There are question marks where I feel I should put something. Thank you!
If you want to check for a digit in a string you can use the any() method.any will pretty much return True if the condition that is being checked returns True at least once, in this case with the "c.isdigit()"The isdigit() is a method available in your string object, so you are pretty much checking each character is a digit with that call. Here is a doc on isidigit as well. Here is the doc on any()
