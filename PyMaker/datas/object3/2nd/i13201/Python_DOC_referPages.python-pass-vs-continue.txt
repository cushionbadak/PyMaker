This question already has an answer here:Is there a difference between `continue` and `pass` in a for loop in python?                    9 answers                I'm new to Python, couldn't figure out the following syntax, this gives me all of these element, it make sense as Pass is skip this step to next one however if I use continue I will get the following Can someone tell me why don't I get '0'? Is 0 not in the list?
 skips the statements after it, whereas  do nothing like that. Actually  do nothing at all, useful to handle some syntax error like:You can handle it by:Demo:This will skip the  statement and print nothing.This will keep printing 
"pass" just means "no operation". it does not do anything."continue" breaks a loop and jumps to the next iteration of the loop"not 0" is True, so your "if not element" with element=0 triggers the continue instruction, and directly jumps to next iteration: element = 1
 is a no-op. It does nothing. So when  is true, Python does nothing and just goes on. You may as well leave out the whole  test for the difference that is being made here. means: skip the rest of the loop body and go to the next iteration. So when  is true, Python skips the rest of the loop (the  line), and continues with the next iteration. is true when  is 0; see Truth Value Testing.
