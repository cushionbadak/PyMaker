If you comment the  statement there, it doesn't mean that you don't have an Error; it simply means that you handled the  -- which in your case is from what I can tell an  -- by catching it with the  and then calling . When you  an exception what you actually do is: The raise statement allows the programmer to force a specified exception to occur.So, by un-commenting, you allow the  named  to re-appear after catching it in the inner  block and get caught by the outer  clause in which you again re-raise it.Generally, you don't want to catch exceptions in such a generic way because it might hide some unpredicted behaviour of the program that you would like to know about. Limit the exceptions you catch in the except clause by simply specifying them, in your case, an except clause of the form:would probably suffice.
