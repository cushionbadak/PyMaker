How can I find the span of a inside group by regex?I have the following code, but I don't know how to get the span (start, end) of the matched group inside the parentheses:In this case for example, I only need to match the span of the 'car' not the whole statement.
You need to pass  an argument:1 is referring to the first group, the default is zero - which means the whole match.
