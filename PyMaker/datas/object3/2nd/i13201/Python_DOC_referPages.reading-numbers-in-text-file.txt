I am a beginner in python learning how to read and manipulate data in text files. Lets say I have a text file grades.txt :I want to create a program that averages the grades for each line and multiplies that by the weight which is always the first number in each line. It then should add the weighted total for all of the lines and print a the final grade. How would I do this if I didn't know the number of grades in a text file or if I had different weights? Currently I can only do it if I already know how many grades there are going to be.Code so far:
You can use  to return a list of grades where the weight is . Then you can get rid of the weight, and cycle through the list in a for loop. You add all the grades, then divide by the length of the list of grades.Don't accidentally include the weight!
After splitting the string, use  to turn each item into a . Use  unpacking to assign the first item to , and the rest to a  called .You can then use handy functions like  and  to find the average. , , , and  are all Python built-in functions.
This will work in Python 2.7 as well as 3.x.
