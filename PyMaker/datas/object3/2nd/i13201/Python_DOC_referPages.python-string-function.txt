Looking to put together a simple python function that checks the followingGiven two strings, return True if either of the strings appears at the very end of the other string,ignoring upper/lower case differences (in other words, the computation should not be "casesensitive").
Try with
You can use regex
Or if you need to "create" your own function:So, basically, if  and , it will check character  of  with  of  and  of  with  of 
Here's another approach using zip, which avoids having to do multiple passes of ,  or slicing. It iterates the 2 strings in reverse and returns True if all the letters are equal up to the exhaustion of one of the strings:In Python2 you can use  for a marginal space improvement:
You could use slicing.You can read more about string and slicing here.Slicing means to get part of the string based on passed . General construction look like this: .Let's take a look at this:You can also pass index lesser than 0:So in the code above calling  means starting position is the length of  sentece. In this case . Because lenght of  is 3. 
You can use OOP if you want, subclassing  and writing an appropriate method:
