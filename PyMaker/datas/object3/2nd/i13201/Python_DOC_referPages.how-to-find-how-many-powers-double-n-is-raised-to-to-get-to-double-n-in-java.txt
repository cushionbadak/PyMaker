I want to find the equivalent of  in Python in Java. Basically how many powers is a  raised to to get to the full . Example  returns 2. Because, 10 is raised to the second power to get to 100. returns: 3. returns 2. Etc... Does anyone know what this would be in Java.
In Python you can use  which takes a second argument which is the base.In  there is no such function, but you can trivially solve for the same thing
