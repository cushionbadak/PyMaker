I'm studying python and getting on with it now. I've been working this random word generator and I'm looking to modify it so that it picks characters by their ascii codes as ranges from lists.Here you can see there's one list called asciiList where I've defined digits, lowercase and uppercase.Now I've separated this into three lists for a second version of the program:I am having trouble trying to get the program to ensure that the ultimate word generated (as per my complete program) to have at least one uppercase, one lowercase and one digit. I understand it'd be along the lines of this (I've used different variable names here as I wrote this in a new program):IE. Until program reaches the length defmined, pick at random from one of the three sets but ensure the program picks it at least once, but I'm struggling with the last step. Does anyone have a potential suggestion for a while loop for the program? Suggestions appreciated!

You may pick one char from each required set and then fill the remaining chars from the full set. After that just shuffle the remaining string.PS: Your definition of  might be possibly wrong. Try this:For this code to work.Also, you may use the  module to provide your setsPS 2: If you are doing something as a password generator, you may want to use  before calling the functions in the module, for security reasons. Using a non determinist random number generator might avoid attacks that may reproduce your number generator and predict following passwords you generate.
