I'm wondering how in python I'd be able to write code, and not have it executed until a certain input is inputted by the user, for example, but instead of having '1' in this example, it would be code. And not run until the user inputs 'a'Okay: here is the part of my game I'm working on:I want to move all of this code to have it when the user types in an input, for example "buy" it executes this code, but only then and I don't want to have to copy + paste it after every input when i ask the user what they want to do next
You want to declare a function.Now whenever you want to run the function, all you have to do is call it. You can define lots of other functions the same way and call them too, without copying and pasting any code.I highly recommend you read the documentation already linked in the comments. It's better programming practice to pass balance and FinalPrice as parameters into the function and return them at the end, and even better practice to define separate variables for each price, but reading the documentation will probably help more than asking here.
