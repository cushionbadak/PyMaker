In Python I'd like to open a file explorer to a specific directory, or if it is already open in another window, bring focus to that window.  Currently I'm doing this:But it opens as many File Explorers as calls to .  Is it possible in Python to focus on an existing one?
Stumbled upon this question looking for the exact opposite of what you want, to open the explorer multiple times on the same directory.Coming from the documentationos.startfileWhen operation is not specified or 'open', this acts like double-clicking the file in Windows Explorer, or giving the file name as an argument to the start command from the interactive command shell: the file is opened with whatever application (if any) its extension is associated.so just doing  or  would do exactly what you want as long as the opened explorer is still in the directory you started with. I don't know if I am correct though as my answer assumes you are on win7 os and using python 2.7.
