I need to replace '|' into tab so that I can analyze my human annotation genomic data (200+mb). I'm a research assistant learning how to analyze/manipulate sequencing data in the easiest/simplest way so that I can replicate this on more data.  Here how my data looks like. There are ~400,000 lines of this type of data in one file.I tried to use this code to replace '|' into '\t' for several lines.All I'm getting is this :
Try using regular expression.Example for one line:
 is just printing the brand new  object you created (and you probably don't mean to be creating a new writer on every loop). If you want to write to it, use the actual  method. There is a lot of example code on the  docs page for reading and writing, you just need to combine them (and use an alternate dialect for each).You're not actually using a , and even if you were, your input file is , which is not CSV, pipe delimited, or anything else, it's a much more complex data format (Office XML, and it's a zip file, so it looks like binary gibberish when read directly) that  can't read.
Your filename indicates excel, but for now I will assume you actually have a tsv (Tab Seperated) file and not an Excel file.  If soOf course if it is Excel that's different try xlrd Udacity has some nice lessons in "Data Wrangling with MongoDB"
