I have this function in python, and this function computes the sum of the integers in the list. result:what I'm hoping to achieve from this function is to return a list of running totals.something like this:
Appending the running sum into a list in a loop and return the list:Or, using  statement:If you're using Python 3.2+, you can use .where the default operation in  with an iterable is 'running sum'. Optionally you can also pass an operator as needed.
def runningSum(aList):    theSum = 0    cumulative = [ ]    for i in aList:        theSum = theSum + i        cumulative.append(theSum)    return cumulative
