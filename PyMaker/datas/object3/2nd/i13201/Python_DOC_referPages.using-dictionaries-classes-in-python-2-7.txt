Hi im trying to create a program where a user input would be stored in a dictionary/class (really new to this unsure of the terminology). but basically i would like to have 3 dictionaries/classes at the begining of my code which will store the information of three teams e.g. team name, then how many points the have gained over the past 3 weeks. the user will then enter the next weeks points to be stored into the class/dictionary which will in turn removed the previous 3rd week. so they would select the league by:then once they have done that i want to allow the user to update the score and get rid of one
Your syntax is a bit off on how the dictionaries are built.  You Sub contain an invalid syntax list and should look closer to:A better way may be to change your formatting a slight bit, as with the current scenario the "points" field isn't providing any benifitYou can than access the content in the Premiership dictionary as followsYou will than need to figure out your logic in how you rotate your list values
