I am trying to fetch some Ids into a list via the subprocess command. Below is my code:The error that i get is: 'Popen'object not iterable.I am creating a list and fetching the IDs into a list and then for every ID in the list, I am trying to get the mem and cpu information. this information is again input into another empty list(list2). I am iterating over list2 to display these information. Where am I going wrong?
If you want the result of the call you'll need to communicate with the subprocess objectThe  object is not the output of the process, it is an object that represents the running subprocess.Also avoid  if you can as it is widely considered a security concern, and you don't need it here.
For this scenario (where you're only reading  and / are untouched), you probably don't want  or . It's easier to process the lines as they're produced, which those APIs don't do (they buffer everything into memory before returning).To process the output line by line, just change:to:In addition, you've got a problem with types on Python 3; to fix that (and avoid the problems with ) change the  line to:where  makes reads from  return , not .
Calling  yields a Popen object.  It does not give you a list and it does not give you something you can iterate over, because the  object is not iterable.It is easier to use a higher level function from the same library to get the output as a string, then parse this and loop accordingly.  In Python 3.5, you can simply call :which will give you a  object from where you can inspect the output.In Python 3.4 or earlier, you can instead use .
