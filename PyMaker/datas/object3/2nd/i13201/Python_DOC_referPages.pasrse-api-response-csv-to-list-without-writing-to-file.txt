Goal:Directly read .csv API response to Python listI am using the Census Bureau's Bulk Geocoder to get the lat/long of many addresses. The documentation for Batch Geocoding is on page 5-6.I would like to be able to read this csv to a list without first saving the file.My first attempt was to do the following:Get response:Handle response (without writing to file):The output is a 1-D list:[[unique_id], [input_address], [match/no_match], [exact/non-exact], [output_address], [lat/long], [tiger_line_id], [tiger_line_side], [ ], .... ]The newline is being read as an element to be put into the list (shown as [ ]).However, if I do the following:Handle response (first writing response to file):The output for this method is the desired 2-D list of lists:[[unique_id, input_address, match/no_match, exact/non-exact, output_address, lat/long, tiger_line_id, tiger_line_side], .... ]How can I read the .csv response directly to a list? I would like to avoid I/O operations because I may be performing 300+ batches at a time (which would be 300+ write to file/read from file.
