Natural Text
I have a list like this, where the first number in string of each element is exactly the index of each element:I want to return for each word in element list the index of "element of list" where(the word) is located:I mean this something like this:any suggestions?
This will find occurrences for all strings in the input, even such as "1-" etc. But filtering the records you do not like from the result should not be a big deal really:{'': [0], 'and': [2, 6, 10], '8-': [8], '11-': [11], '6-': [6], 'something': [2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11], 'your': [1, 5, 9], 'happens': [3, 7, 11], 'giulio': [4, 8, 12], 'make': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], '4-': [4], '2-': [2], 'his': [4, 8, 12], '9-': [9], '10-': [10], '7-': [7], '12-': [12], 'took': [4, 8, 12], 'put': [2, 6, 10], 'choice': [1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12], '5-': [5], 'so': [4, 8, 12], '3-': [3], '1-': [1]}
First of all rename your list to not interfere with Python builtin stuffsowhat defaultdict does:it works like normal dictionary as long as the key (word in our case) is present in the dictionary. If the key doesnt exist, it creates it with its value corresponding to, in our case empty list, as specified when you declare it . I am not the best explainer so I suggest reading on defauldict elsewhere if it is not clear :) 
@Oleg wrote a great nerdy solution. I came up with the following simple method for this problem.$>>> findIndex('your', list)[1, 5, 9]
I need to use the number on string to take the ID, and for this i have the solution... but as you remember i have to get all ID for each word in element.The problem is that I got only one ID of all words and I put them in 1 set( i mean wer = set() ) but i need all ID of words:1 - for example, for the word 'your'i get only ID of last post where the word is located: but i need:  2- the ID 9 is a string in set and i need it in int, but i get an error if I try to put aw in int: errorany suggestions?
