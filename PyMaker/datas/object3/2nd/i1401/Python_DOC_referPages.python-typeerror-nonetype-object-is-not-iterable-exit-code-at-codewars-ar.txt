So I'm doing a challenge from CodeWars that says:"Given two arrays a and b write a function comp(a, b) that checks whether the two arrays have the "same" elements, with the same multiplicities. "Same" means, here, that the elements in b are the elements in a squared, regardless of the order."My code for it is:Now, I know there must be much easier code for this task, but I'm still a beginner programmer.So all the tests are passed positively.But I keep getting an exit code:If I remove the first "if array1= None.... return False" statement, it gives this exit code instead:So no matter what, my code has something wrong in it, haha. Any solution to this?
The error you can cam be dueto different lenghts of lists -you do not guard against that.You can simplify your code using  on one array and then look into the other one. I highly doubt your arrays need to be cast into a list - they probably already are - and even if, you could do that in one step using :You still might get better results if you optimize more - but you can do that on your own time :o) - f.e. think about a check for this:You can easily speed that up if you use a sorted list of a  of your inputs instead of sorted list and that way you can eliminate about 99999999 checks which will make a dent into your runtime (unless your dataset only contains unique values to begin with). And if you got set()'s .. they are really fast in looking up if something is in them - far better and faster then sorting huge lists to begin with ...
