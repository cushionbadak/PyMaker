I have a bit of code that uses ,  and  to determine the UTC offset of a given timezone, in the form of a  object:It looks like there should be a more elegant and efficient way of doing this, since the  must be aware of its own offsets relative to UTC. It seems wasteful to extract the offset values as a string and then use regex to essentially sscanf the string.How can we make this code better?
If you look at the documentation for Python  objects you'll see a method called . This will give you the offset directly.Edit: no need to call  on the , The  object does it itself as part of . It expects to be passed a naive datetime.
