I have this for-loop. I want  to start from the second number in the  list. Could you guide me?
First thing is to remember that python uses zero indexing.You can iterate throught the list except using the range function to get the indexes of the items you want or slices to get the elements.What I think is becoming confusing here is that in your example, the values and the indexes are the same so to clarify I'll use this list as example:The range function will allow you to iterate through the indexes:If you want to access the values using the range function you should do it like this:You can also use array slicing to do that and you don't even need . Array slicing returns a new array with your slice.The slice is done with  where all three parameters are optional and: is the index of the first to be included in the slice is the index of the first element to be excluded from the slice is how many steps for each next index starting from (as expected) the  (if  is 2 and start with 1 it gets every odd index).Example:
If you want to iterate through a list from a second item, just use  (if nI is the length of the list or so). Probaly, a part of your function just lost somewhere, but anyway, in in general range() works like this: i. e. EditPlease, remember: python uses zero indexing, i.e. first element has an index 0, the second - 1 etc. By default,  starts from 0 and stops at the value of the passed parameter minus one. If there's an explicit start, iteration starts from it's value. If there's a step, it continues while  returns values lesser than stop value.Detailed description of  build-in is here.
Range starts from the 0 index if not otherwise specified. You want to use something like
