Windows 10, Python 2.7.4Endless loop , no output with PoolExecutor implementedPlease help , code as following:
From docsThe main module must be importable by worker subprocesses. This  means that ProcessPoolExecutor will not work in the interactive  interpreter.The trouble with the way processes have to be created in windows means that you would need to incorporate  type of syntax as shown in the example and run it from the terminal. If you would like to further read into why that is, look into multiprocessing, which is being used under the wraps for concurrent futures, and further read here . The summary however, would be that windows does not have an os.fork method, and so has to utilize a "cheat" to create a subprocess, which is to create an entirely new python instance and execute the script from the top to reach a similar state. This however, means that each new version needs to be given the knowledge that is it not the main thread that started the process spawning.
You are launching Python interactively.The interpreter's you are launching via subprocess aren't exiting after executing the script - that's why they are kept open forever.Just a hint especially for debugging:Have a look at stderr and check for the result code of the subprocesses:
