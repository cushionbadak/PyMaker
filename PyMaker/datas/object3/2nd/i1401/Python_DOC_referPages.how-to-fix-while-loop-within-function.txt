My code works, and asks to name the file, and how many numbers. But it just keeps asking for numbers, and if I put zero then it does what it is supposed to do. any help at all is appreciated very much. I just don't know how to fix the code, and it is really bugging me.
The  function calls itself recursively in the  statement, which is skipped if you input a 0.Also, your  contains an unused  and the  statement is neither executed nor needed. Try shortening it.You can also simplify the  and  functions significantly by using with open.It is good practice to use the with keyword when dealing with file  objects. The advantage is that the file is properly closed after its  suite finishes, even if an exception is raised at some point. Using  with is also much shorter than writing equivalent try-finally blocksFinally,  contains an infinite loop, try indenting the second  one step or rewrite the function to read the full file at once and use a simple  loop.
using  is good but I see it make you confused, try to learn  first.you have no ending loop inandit should beAnd here your working code
