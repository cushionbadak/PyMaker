How can I use range in numpy to get the cell in a area? I can use  but it is possible for me to use a list to set the row range?
I don't think you can use  or  in that way (though see @hpaulj's answer), but you could use , which uses the same syntax as range (i.e. you give it a start, a stop, and optionally a step argument):This is equivalent to:For example:For more info see also the glossary entry for  objects
To use a list or array in indexing 2d, you need to think in terms of : makes that easier:or the same thing with lists:This is indexing rows 1 and 2, and columns 2 and 3 - in a cartesian sense, not pairwise.
