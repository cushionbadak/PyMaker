I'm trying to get my home automation project to switch a light on at sunset.  I'm using this code to get sunset from my location:This returns:I'm only just starting to get my head round JSON so my questions are:How to I extract just the sunset time from the above?Is (in the example) "4:02:16 PM" a time?  I know it is when I look at it butwill Python know it's an actual time so that I can compare it?What I'm trying to do is:I've got about 5 hours to find the answer or I'll have to wait 24 hours to test it :)
