I am trying to understand below code snippet, for each value of i, what are all the two arguments passed to ? appreciate if you could explain how the  computation could be expanded? 
A lot of things are happening here. The  method is receiving a python list as an argument. This python list is created through list comprehension. It helps to start from the back.
