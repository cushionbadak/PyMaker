So, I can't load my json file and I don't know why, can anyone explain what I'm doing wrong?For some reason I'm getting this error:
Most likely, you have reassigned the Python builtin  function to something else in your code (there's almost no other plausible way this exception could be explained).The  statement will then attempt to use it as a context manager, and will try to call its  method when first entering the  block. This then leads to the error message you're seeing because your object called , whatever it is, doesn't have an  method.Look for places in your Python module where you are re-assigning . The most obvious ones are:A function in the global scope, like Direct reassignment using Imports like  or The function is the most likely suspect, because it seems your  is actually a callable.To aid you finding what object  was accidentally bound to, you can also try toimmediately before your  statement. If it doesn't say , you've found your culprit.
