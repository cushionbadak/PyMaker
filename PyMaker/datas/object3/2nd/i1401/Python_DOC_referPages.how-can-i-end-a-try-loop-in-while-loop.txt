I'm in trouble about how to end a 'try' loop, which is occurred since I have the 'try', here is the code:I tried end it by using , , and I even leaves it empty what I get is , I searched online and they said it is caused when the code blocks were not completed. Please show me if any of my code is wrong, thanks.Btw, I'm using python 3 and I don't know how to be more specific for this question, kindly ask me if you did not understand. Sorry for my poor english.EDIT: Solved by removing the  because I'm not using it, but I still wanna know how to end a  loop properly, thanks.
Your problem isn't the , it's the overall, high-level shape of your  clause.A  requires either an  or a  block. You have neither, which means your  clause is never actually complete. So python keeps looking for the next bit until it reaches EOF (End Of File), at which point it complains.The python docs explain in more detail, but basically you need either:or(You can also have both the  and .) If you don't need either the cleanup or the exception handling, that's even easier: just get rid of the  altogether, and have the block go directly under that .Finally, as a terminology thing:  is not a loop. A loop is a bit of code that gets executed multiple times -- it loops. The  gets executed once. It's a "clause," not a "loop."
You have to also 'catch' the exception with the  statement, otherwise the try has no use.So if you do something like:This way if anywhere in your try block an exception is raised it will not break your code, but it will be catched by your except.
