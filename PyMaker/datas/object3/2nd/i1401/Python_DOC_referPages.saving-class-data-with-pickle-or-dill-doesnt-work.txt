I want to save state of poll class data to file and if my script restarts load it back. I popped out part of my program to replicate the problem. here are my files.pickleclass.pyfxns.pysave.pyFirst i call save.py to create the class and then save it. its successfully ends. after the save.py script i call below load.py to load what is saved. but it loads empty class data. as it was newly created. output of the save.py file is as follows:load.pyand when i load the file and show the output, its empty like below.I couldn't find out the problem. it loads the class but not the data. 
The load was performed correctly: the problem comes from your class which is not implemented properly.Have a look at some material on classes and instances (or some posts on SO), especially the  function, , and notions like instance and class members (see also a closely related problem in that post).Then look at how  handles classes and you should be good to go.Edit apparently with  this should actually be possible, see this SO post
