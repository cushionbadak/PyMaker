Get the sum of each list individually, and then sum the both scalar values to get the total_sum:
You could sum the concatenation of the two lists:This is what I get using the python console:Or you could just sum the sums:which leads to the same output but in a probably faster way:
if you have several lists (more than 2) you could  the sums by applying  to the results:
 acts as concatenating in case of lists, so  will help
First Define both liststhen use Sum() For Both listAlso You Can Do This :
You can use:
 takes an iterable, so you can use  to chain your lists and feed the resulting iterable to :
