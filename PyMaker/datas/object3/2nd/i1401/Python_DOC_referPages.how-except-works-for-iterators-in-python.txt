Can you explain to me why the except clause has never been executed and print never been called in the example?    
The  is thrown by , not by the :Retrieve the next item from the iterator by calling its  method. If default is given, it is returned if the iterator is exhausted, otherwise  is raised.So you could instead wrap the  call.Then you use it like this:Note that  also has a second argument that allows to provide a default instead of the :
Your  calls are outside your  function and so are not covered by your  /  clause. For comparison, try this:Then run repeatedly:Result:
The function "h" returns a generator. The statement "yield" as a "return" does nothing, only returns a generator. The exception will not be in that part of the code.The exception must be transferred to another part of the code, where it will work.
