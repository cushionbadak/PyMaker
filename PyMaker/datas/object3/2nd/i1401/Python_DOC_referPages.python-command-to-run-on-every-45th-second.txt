How do i make the the program run every time the timestamp in seconds is 45, currently I am using time.sleep, but my run time tends to vary a little bit every time the program is executed and i would like it to execute again if the timestamp is on the 45th second. Currently I have something like this where the run loop commences every 60 seconds, however I would like it to run the loop when the timestamp seconds slot == 45My run time at the moment tends to be around 18-20 seconds
You could use the  module, and check if .E.g.In your case you would use some logic to check every X amount of time if we are at the 45th second.
So I assume you specifically mean run an event at the 45-th second of the minute?That sounds like you want to do event scheduling:https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.htmlIn the example on that page, they only use the  method of the scheduler and not , which is what you should be using.For that, you need to figure out the time that's at 45 seconds from the current minute. Some simple math gives that:The stuff inside the  specifies what you want to run/schedule, just read up on the package doc to figure out the format.Then just put that scheduling into your loop and it should all be good, and no need for the  no more.
You need to implement scheduler that will call your function each 45 seconds.We can user python's threading.Timer class to implement simple scheduler:
