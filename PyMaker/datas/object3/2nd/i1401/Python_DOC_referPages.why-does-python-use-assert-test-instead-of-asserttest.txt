In python2, it's possible to use  and , and both  and .In python3, why can't I use  while being able to use ?
Short answer:  is not a function.Long answer:When python3 came out, it changed(or, removed)  syntax, because  became a builtin function so it should be called.Although  can be used like a function(), it isn't a function - it actually is a syntax in python3 grammar, like print in python2 was.Unlike , of which the type is  when you execute , when you try to  or  you'll get this:So you can't use  while using  because these two are different.
In Python 2, both  and  are statements (like , , , etc). In this case, the parens are not interpreted as the function call operator but just as plain parens, forcing the evaluation of their content, which in this case is a no-op and is actually considered unpythonic.In Python 3,  became a function so you must call it.  is still a statement so it works just like in Python 2.
