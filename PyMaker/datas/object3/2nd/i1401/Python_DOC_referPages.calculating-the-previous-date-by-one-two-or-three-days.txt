I am calculating the previous date either by one, two, or three days. I have a function which does this, but I want to be able to calculate the correct previous date based on the previous JSON file that exists. I know that I would need some sort of conditional statement, but I'm not sure of how to approach this. This variable will then be used within a for loop to read through the contents on the previous day's file with the current day file to carry out some analysis. If the previous day file is not available it will need to be incremented by one till file is found.My code is as follows:
I don't think you need to bother with the date calculations at all if you are just trying to find the most recent 2 files for comparison since your file names are just ISO date strings. You can just get all the files in the directory, sort them and then compare them in any order you want.Get all filenames from a directorySort the files by date descendingOpen the most recent and next most recent files for comparison
