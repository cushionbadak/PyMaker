Natural Text
Below is my code:Error:It returns the error above but I don't know how to solve it.
Iterating over a file retrieves the data line-by-line by default. You can read the file in as a stream of bytes using the two-argument from of the  built-in function as shown below. Note this approach will not read the entire file into memory all-at-once like what would happen using something like the  built-in. 
you have to use readlines and do other loop for any new line in the text file. otherwise single line will be good.
