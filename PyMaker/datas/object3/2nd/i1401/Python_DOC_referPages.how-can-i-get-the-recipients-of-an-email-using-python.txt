Say I have an email as  and I would like to get a list of all the recipients on that email. Let's say it looks like this:I can stick this in a Python script and parse the email:I would expect to see something like:Instead, I get this:Is there a better way to do this?
The best way I've found so far involves .From the docs on getaddresses:This method returns a list of 2-tuples of the form returned by  parseaddr(). fieldvalues is a sequence of header field values as might  be returned by Message.get_all. will return  if the header is absent, unless you pass in a default, so  is a good idea.This message has the added advantage of properly parsing some very terrible, but entirely valid, email addresses:Just splitting on  wouldn't correctly handle:Which is an entirely valid email address.
