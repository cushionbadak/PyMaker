Natural Text
I'm trying to make a program deciding what determiner comes behind the input.However, there is a little bug. When I input the word "bad", it says I need to have "an" go before the word. I want it to only say I need to have "an" be before the word when the first letter is A. What's the solution to this problem?

Regarding the question, using str.startwith would be the most clear way to go:Pay attention to the fact you do not need to make a list from a string: strings are iterable, they support  and indexing out of the box.Also note the readability improvements:Name variables using snake_caseStart a comment with a spaceDo not put a conditional into bracketsSee PEP8, the python style guide for more issues and details about codestyle.Cheers!
