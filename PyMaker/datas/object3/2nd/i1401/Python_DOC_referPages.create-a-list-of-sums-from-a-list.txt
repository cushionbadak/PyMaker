This question already has an answer here:How to find the cumulative sum of numbers in a list?                    18 answers                I'm working on experimental data where I create a temperature profile from 45 °C to 5 °C and then again to 45 °C.Plotting the data results in a loop, since cooling from 45 °C to 5 °C and heating from 5° C to 45 °C are recorded. But since I need to the plot to appear "chronological" every temperature needs to be unique.The image shows a visual explanation of what I need.What I did therefore is getting the difference from each consecutive temperature interval using numpys "diff" function. So far so good.Now to make a useful plot out of this I need to somehow create a new list where every item is the sum from the ones before.A small example of what I'm looking for:Would be great if someone knows how to do that or has a smarter idea how to get the job done!
Since this question is tagged  but for some reason nobody posts the numpy solution... use . :)
There is a nice feature from  called  that does exactly that:
This should do the trick.
