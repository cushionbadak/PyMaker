I am attempting to find the first set of duplicates in a list which is the sum of another list (should take a list such as [0,+1,+2,+1,-5,+1,+2] and return 0, because the sum of the list progressively [0,1,3,4,-1,0,2] has its first duplicate at 0). However, it seems to be returning wrong answers no matter what I do. Here's my code: 
From what you're doing, it seems like  is the "current" list (that is, the portion of  that you've iterated over). If so, you need to append  (and not  as  is not the index but the number in ). Next, you need to append  to  before you check :Output
One way to do this would be to use  to build the list of accumulated sums for each position in the list.  We'll add each to a  as we go, checking if it already exists:Your  will return , because there are no repeated values in the accumulated sums.   has a count of .
