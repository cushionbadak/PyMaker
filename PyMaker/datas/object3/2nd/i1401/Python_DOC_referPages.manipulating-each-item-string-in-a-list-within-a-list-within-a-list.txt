Example element inside of twoDlist: *Please note that the 2nd index of this list can have 0 to n number of elements inside and I would like to account for this. I need to perform string manipulation (via regular expression on each element in 2nd index (specifically ).And then append the new item back to the 2nd index of the list, replacing the the old string. I would also like to: take each  element inand append it to a new list while keeping the  and .Example of how I would like my data to look like:for each  in .Thank you in advance!
You can do this pretty concisely using  (docs here) to split up each record into multiple for each string in the list of strings at index 2. On each iteration you can also perform your regex substitution.Here is an example: iterates over  and each element () of  is converted into a list of lists—one for each element of the list at index 2—using a list comprehension. Then these new lists are all appended onto the list processed so far.The result is  as:
