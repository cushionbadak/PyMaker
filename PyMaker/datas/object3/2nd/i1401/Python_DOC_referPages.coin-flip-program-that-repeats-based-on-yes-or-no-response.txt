I'm very new to python and want to create a basic coin flip program that will repeat based on user input.I was able to create the randomized response for the coin flip but when it asks if I want to repeat it it dosn't generate a new randomized response and instead repeats the same response. how do i get it to restart the program if i input "y".
Your program keep giving you the same result because you are randomizing the value  variable outside the  function. Therefore, it is only being randomized once, at the start of the program.To fix that, simply randomize the  variable value at the start of  function
You should be generating the random value within the  function. You only create it at the start of your script, so it is only ever created once.Move the line  to the start of the  function.
If you dig around a bit in the  module you will find some interesting utilities that will make things like this very short and pretty. For examplewill give you a random heads or tails without all the extra  logic. These kind of things will make your code easier to read, understand and maintain. For example you could do something like:
