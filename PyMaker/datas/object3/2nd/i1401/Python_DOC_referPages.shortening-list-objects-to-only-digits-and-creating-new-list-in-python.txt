I have a list which has a few hundred dates in it but I need to filter out only the time in the format hhmmss (no : in between so I can turn them into int later on).The list I have so far looks like this:My approach so far is:Obviously this doesn't work but I can't figure out what I am doing wrong as I am pretty new to Python. The error I get is this and its referring to the j in the for loopHow can I change my code to get this output? Or is there maybe a simpler way to solve this problem?
Your issue is with this section of the code:Each  in  is an element of the array, not the index of a certain element. So, when you try to get the th element of  with , you're passing in a  as an index to the array, which doesn't make sense. You should just use another while loop like you did in the outer loop, or use  or something similar.
Instead of obscureuse Pythonic (simpler, more readable, and more safe way)and the same for i. e. replace it with
You could use a list comprehension:OutputIf you want the result as integers, use int:Output
using  module you can do something like this. Link for further reading https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behaviorOutput:In case you need to convert the values in int then cast them in the list comprehension itself to get the list of int values
