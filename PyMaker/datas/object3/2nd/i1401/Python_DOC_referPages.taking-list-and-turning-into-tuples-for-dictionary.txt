I have a list that looks like this:in this format what I am trying to do is make a dictionary such that The error I am getting is this: ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 5, got 0)I am guessing my problem is formatting the input string as it is not reading it as a tuple.What I would like to do is read in the list as a tuple and extract the 5 values in each set as the values a,b,c,d,e for the dictionary
You could use filter with a dictionary comprehension:OutputOr more similar to your code:Output
How about checking if the size is 5?or thanks to @Jon ClementsReturns:
