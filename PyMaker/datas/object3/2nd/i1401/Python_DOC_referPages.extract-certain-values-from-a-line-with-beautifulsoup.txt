for a school course we are learning advanced python,to get a first idea about web scraping and similar stuff.... I got an exercise to do where I have to extract the values v1, v2 from the following line of an HTML... I tried looking up but couldn't find any really specific things.... If it is unappropriated for SO just delete it....The HTML partso afterwards when i want to show the values it should look like I tried to get the values just by slicing the whole line like this:but in this case I am not using the bs4 module, which is recommended using... I would be very grateful in case someone could teach me...
What you are seeing there is not an HTML file but a JSON. In this case it makes no sense to use BeautifulSoup's HTML parser, you may want to use a standard JSON library to do that, like so:Then you can index it using the headers (or keys)
