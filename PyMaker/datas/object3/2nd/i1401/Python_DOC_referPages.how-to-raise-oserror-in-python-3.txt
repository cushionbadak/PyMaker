I use a third-party library that's fine but does not handle inexistant files the way I would like. When giving it a non-existant file, instead of raising the good old it raises some obscure message:I don't want to handle the missing file, don't want to catch nor handle the exception, don't want to raise a custom exception, neither want I to  the file, nor to create it if it does not exist.I only want to check it exists ( will do the trick) and if not, then just raise a proper FileNotFoundError.I tried this:what only outputs:This is better than a "Syntax error in file None", but how is it possible to raise the "real" python exception with the proper message, without having to reimplement it?
Pass in arguments: is a subclass of , which takes several arguments. The first is an error code from the  module (file not found is always ), the second the error message (use  to obtain this), and pass in the filename as the 3rd.The final string representation used in a traceback is built from those arguments:
