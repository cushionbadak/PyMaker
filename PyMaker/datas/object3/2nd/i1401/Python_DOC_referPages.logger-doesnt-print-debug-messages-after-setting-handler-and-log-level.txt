I have the following minimalist example of a  test based on the Logging Cookbook:The above produces the following output:As I've defined a handler and set the log level to debug, I was expecting the  log message to show up in the sample above.
If a logger's level isn't explicitly set, the system looks up the level of ancestor loggers until it gets to a logger whose level is explicitly set. In this case, it's the root logger which is the parent of the logger named 'test'. Setting the level of either this logger or the root logger to DEBUG will result in the log message being output. See this part of the documentation for the event information flow in Python logging.
