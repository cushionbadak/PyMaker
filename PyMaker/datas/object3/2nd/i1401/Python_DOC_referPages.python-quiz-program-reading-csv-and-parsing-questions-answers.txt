Natural Text
I have a simple quiz in Python that's having issues. It reads a comma-separated text file in "question,answer" format. The program is reading the quiz fine and outputs the questions, but I can't get the questions to randomize and the "CorrectAnswer" variable to read the correct answer.For instance, if the question is, "What is the capital of California?" and the answer is "Sacramento", the CSV file has it written like this: "What is the capital of California,Sacramento". But the program can't reference the answer, only the first part before the comma.What am I doing wrong?
There's a stdlib library for this: . will even let you select a random k-size sample of .
Shuffle the list and pick first  linesUse  to remove new lines at the end of the answerUpdated code:Output::Improvement: Use  module. See Adam Smith's answer. Reference:Official documentation on CSV: https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html
