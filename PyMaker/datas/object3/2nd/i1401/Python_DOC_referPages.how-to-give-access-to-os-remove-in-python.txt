I want to delete a folder with but I get Access denied error, what is the easiest way to give access?
If it is a file in read only mode, change the file permission to 0777 with os.chmod() function and then try to remove it with os.remove().If it is a directory, do the same but with os.removedir() instead of os.remove().
