I want to implement Binary Search algorithm in python considering the following list:So, I wrote a function to do the calculation but when I came down to this block of code, I didn't know what to do:Instead of "The elements that are less than 22", what can I write to eliminate the the numbers less than 22 since putting basic '<=>' signs don't work?
Do a modified Binary Search to find the index of that first element which is greater than or equal to 22 and then just slice the existing list. In your case the index is  such that  and then just slice your list as .
You could use numpy:
