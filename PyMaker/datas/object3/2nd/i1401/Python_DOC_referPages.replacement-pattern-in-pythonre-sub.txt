The questionCan someone please explain the process of the following  to me. I am thinking the process is as following:look for a  then look for a digit then look for another digit that is between  and . Now I am lost. What is the question mark for? What does the  do? Why do we need to use raw string regex in this case? 
If you want to understand the process, I can simply explain it to you. I don't know if this regular expression is doing what you want or not..At first, the  is a special character in regex which means any character. But, we here want to use the dot character. In regex, this can be done by using escaping character  like so . So, using  means any character and using  means a dot.The  represents any digit and acts exactly like [0-9]When you used , by then you specified to get the numbers from 1 till 9 which means that zero is excluded.We can use the asterisk  to choose zero or more characters. Unlike + which is used to choose one or more characters. So, using  means any consecutive digits from  or none.The  is used to indicate using just one character or none. So, using  means try to find just one digit between 1 and 9 IF FOUND.The Parenthesis  is used for grouping the whole regular expression in one output.If you want to know more about regular expression, here is an awesome cheat sheet.NOTE:I think the regex you have written in the question is not correct. I think it should be as follows  to obtain the same result. I will try to explain this regular expression using this number .  means find any number of digits that could be found before the dot which would match the . then after that  matches two digits after the dot which are . Finally, the  matches any digit between 1 and 9 if found which matches  in our example.
