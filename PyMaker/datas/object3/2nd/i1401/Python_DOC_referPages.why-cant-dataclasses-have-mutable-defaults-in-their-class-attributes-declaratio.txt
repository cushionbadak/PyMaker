This seems like something that is likely to have been asked before, but an hour or so of searching has yielded no results. Passing default list argument to dataclasses looked promising, but it's not quite what I'm looking for.Here's the problem: when one tries to assign a mutable value to a class attribute, there's an error:I gathered from the error message that I'm supposed to use the following instead:But why are mutable defaults not allowed? Is it to enforce avoidance of the mutable default argument problem?
It looks like my question was quite clearly answered in the docs (which derived from PEP 557, as shmee mentioned):Python stores default member variable values in class attributes. Consider this example, not using dataclasses:Note that the two instances of class  share the same class variable , as expected.Using dataclasses, if this code was valid:it would generate code similar to:This has the same issue as the original example using class . That is, two instances of class  that do not specify a value for  when creating a class instance will share the same copy of . Because dataclasses just use normal Python class creation they also share this behavior. There is no general way for Data Classes to detect this condition. Instead, dataclasses will raise a  if it detects a default parameter of type , , or . This is a partial solution, but it does protect against many common errors.
