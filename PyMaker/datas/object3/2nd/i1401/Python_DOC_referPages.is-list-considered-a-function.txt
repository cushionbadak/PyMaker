 is obviously a built-in type in Python. I saw a comment under this question which calls  a built-in function. And when we check the documentation, it is, indeed, included in Built-in functions list but the documentation again states:Rather than being a function, list is actually a mutable sequence typeWhich brings me to my question: Is  considered a function? Can we refer to it as a built-in function?   If we were talking about C++, I'd say we are just calling the constructor, but I am not sure if the term  applies to Python (never encountered its use in this context).
 is a , which means it is defined somewhere as a class, just like  and .If you check its definition in  (the actual code is implemented in C):So,  is not a function. It is just calling  (with some arguments which are irrelevant for this discussion) just like any call to  is doing.Thanks for @jpg for adding in the comments: classes and functions in Python have a common property: they are both considered as callables, which means they are allowed to be invoked with . There is a built-in function  that checks if the given argument is callable: is also defined in :
When you call , you're invoking the constructor of the  class ().If you have any doubt about the use of the term "constructor" in Python, this is the exact word that the implementers of  chose to refer to :https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Objects/listobject.c#L2695
