Below is my code to compute the bill for the gem store. I'm able to get correct prices for the right elements from the list but I'm not able to figure out how to multiply them with the required quantity (reqd_qty list) and calculate the total price.Following is the complete problem description.Tanishq Gems Store sells different varieties of gems to its customers.Write a Python program to calculate the bill amount to be paid by a customer based on the list of gems and quantity purchased. If any gem required by the customer is not available in the store, then consider the total bill amount to be -1.Assume that quantity required by the customer for any gem will always be greater than 0Current Output:
I suggest you read up on dictionaries, looping over lists to match a value in another list is very inefficient. https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries
There are two main flaws with the logic of your program. The first being is that you never update bill_amount, that is why your answer is being returned a 0.Secondly, the price is not being multiplied by the required quantity.Here is calculate_bill_amount() reworked:@Bill .M was also right in pointing out that you didn't account for the condition where the gem was not in the list
As was pointed out in an answer to you before you deleted this same question earlier:  should just be the sum of all of the prices you calculate along the way, so after your print(price) command, try adding . This sets the value of  to its current value plus the new value of .  Though you're still not multiplying this price by its quantity.Also, your code doesn't address the case of a gem not being in the availability list.  So one way around this is to skip the calculation and return -1 if  is not in .  You can use the command "".Frankly, I'd just use dictionaries instead of lists, because you're doing a lot of unnecessary looping:
