Excuse the very poorly worded title!For my computer science GCSE, I have been given a 20 hour project. The most of it is completed and fully functional, however I am struggling with the last step.I've made it so a user can store their final score into an external file, and that file's content is printed at the end of the game. However, I would like it to print only the top 5 scorers and for the scores to be assorted from highest to lowest. A number next to each position to show their place on the board would be cool, but if that's difficult to do, I'm fine with skipping over it. Here's the section of code for defining the leaderboard:And here is the code for writing to the leaderboard:If needed, here's the entirety of the program:Obviously, this is a chore, so if you can't be bothered to try it, that's perfectly fine! Thanks for stopping by and have a fantastic day!
I recommend turning the leaderboard list of strings into a list of (str, int) tuples, sort the list and print the top 5 like this:
Pointers, break the problem into a series of steps and read up on:string manipulation function split() and substrings,the python data structures the tupple (a way to keep values together)the sorted function.Python data structures - see tupplesorted functionThink about maybe:reading your high score file, in the same format as you write it,line by lineget the relevant text and numbers from the relevant linesappend each (username, score) as a tupple to a listsort the list in reverseprint the first 5 items on the listCode Fragments:Hint: Don't forget to cast the score from string to int before sorting.
