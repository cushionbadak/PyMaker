I am using inheritance. In one of my methods I would like to use both the parent attribute and the over-riden child attribute together. Something like;Which would print;parentchildHowever the above code gives the error;'super' object has no attribute 'options'Is this possible?
A way I can think of accessing a static attribute of the parent class that gets overridden by the child is to directly refer to the parent class itself in the method:
As per the python document the super keyword Return a proxy object that delegates method calls to a parent or sibling class of type. You can not use this for member variables.
