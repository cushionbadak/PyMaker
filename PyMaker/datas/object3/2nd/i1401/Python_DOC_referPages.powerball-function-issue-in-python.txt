My function stops working at the  line, immediately after the  point, listing the error as invalid input. What is the reason for this, and how can I fix it? I'm very new to Python, so any help is very much appreciated. Additionally, this function is still a work in progress, and I recognize that it is currently highly inefficient, but I am attempting to fix this error before anything else is changed.
Some things I am picking up as I am reading your code:Your indentation is still all over the place, some places you use 2 spaces, others you use 4 - you need to fix this, python relies heavily on indentation to compile.In your function  you are not doing anything, the double equals sign is a test operator and will not do any assignment, it will simply check if the value in win1 is equal to the randomly generated number.In the same function, you make a variable  that holds a string with the characters  in it, I can only assume you are trying to create an object that holds these win1 variables, for that you can use a list, like so:In that same function you are not returning anything, so the function is useless, in order to send the output of the function back to what called it you must use I have no idea what you're trying to do in your largest  function, so I will just discuss some things that are clearly confusing you:  as a keyword defines a function, but does not execute it, you must call that function for it to run.Like I said earlier, in order to send results out of a function you must return the answer/result.I have a hunch that instead of seeing  you are seeing an  error because you are trying to check whether the integer  is inside the function pointer . This is not a valid syntax, to make a function call you must use parentheses otherwise python thinks you are referring to the function pointer, so  could be valid syntax, however as you have defined it I cannot see how that would work.Has this code ever compiled properly or run at all? I think you need to go back to much more basic stuff about function definitions before trying to construct something this complex, start with one function definition and try and get that to work in a small program and then come back to this.Let me know if there is anything else I can help with.
