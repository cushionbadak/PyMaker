Natural Text
I am trying to scrape contents from this website.As below, I have a list of all paragraph contains regex "\d+\s(\w{3})". I want a regex to get all text between "\d+\s(\w{3})" and "\d{2}00" from each paragraph excluding the regext matched texts.Below works, but I want the string in between.I tried below but no luck, an got an error "sre_constants.error: look-behind requires fixed-width pattern":How could I write a correct regex using lool-behind and look-ahead?[Solved]I got rid of "+" in my regex look-behind. Below works perfect.
output:Note: I assume you meant \d{2}:00 not \d{2}00
