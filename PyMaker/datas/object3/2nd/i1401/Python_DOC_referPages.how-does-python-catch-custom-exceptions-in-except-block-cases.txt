Suppose I have the following custom exception.How does python know when to catch my exception in the following code?when I implement the  function, must it explicitly throw a  in order for it to be caught? Like, for built-in exception classes, code can throw an exception like a KeyError and we don't have to explicitly say  whenever we do something with a dictionary.
Any code that raises an exception has done so explicitly, including . No special handling is needed for custom exceptions versus the built-in types. A  can only catch an exception if one has been raised by code executed by any statement inside the . This includes any further function calls, calls chain together into a callstack. In the following examplethe  doesn't spring out of nothingness, the Python  implementation raises that exception explicitly. This may not always be obvious because native code (code implemented in C here) doesn't show up in the Python traceback.For the  subscription operation the  function calls , a helper function that uses , the C equivalent of  to raise the  exception.Catching exceptions works the same for all exception types, custom exceptions are not special here. When an exception is raised the normal code flow is interrupted, and the callstack is unwound until an active  statement is encountered, and then any exception handlers are tested, in order of definition in the source code, with .If nothing catches the exception, Python continues unwinding the callstack until it reaches the last stack frame, at which point Python would exit with a stack trace if nothing caught the exception.
