I'm a beginner python user. I'm trying to define a function for 'smoothing' a list of floats by averaging the components over a number of neighbours. Here my code:In output I get what appears to be a list of 'generators', something which i don't know ad was not expecting.In particular:Can someone point me towards what is happening here?Thanks you a lot
The problem is that the expression you have for "smoothing" the data is written incorrectlyâ€”so it evaluates to something called a generator expression. I think the code below is the right way to express it:
A generator is an iterable that is exhausted as it is iterated over. This is what you are creating with the statement . If what you want is a list of lists, the correct statement would be , which is instead a list comprehension. An inline generation of a list, so to say.An article I found on the topic can be found here. Have a read.
you've encountered generator expressions, which are integrated in comprehension list syntax but cause numberous mistake.as example :In your case, I think you can correct you problem by adding  aroud your expression: will force the generator to evaluate the values. Generator are powerful object used to save memory and delay execution. il not your aim here.
