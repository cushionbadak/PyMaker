Here is a function that does the job:
Not exactly sure I understand all of your question, but here's a guess:You could write it a little more concisely using f-strings in  Python 3.6+.

If you really want it to only work on one row, example code is at the end.You could make a dictionary, mapping the headings you want to the index they have in :With this, you can just run through the keys and display the value at the corresponding index.However, if you want absolute efficiency, you can calculate  once and just use it several times. It doesn't matter.One-row example code:
