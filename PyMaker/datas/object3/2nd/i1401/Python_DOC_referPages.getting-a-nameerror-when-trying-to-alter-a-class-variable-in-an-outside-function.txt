I am currently working on developing a jukebox/music player in python. In order to make the code more organized, I arranged it into specific classes. A few of the outside functions require accessing class variables and updating them. However, the program throws off the following error:The classes and the functions accessing the class variables are in the following code block: How should I edit my "JukeboxGUI" class or the "constructGUI" variable to solve this? Any ideas?
 is defined in , so it won't be accessible outside of that function. Make  a global variable by putting a placeholder outside of the function in the global scope. If you need to modify it within a function (which it looks like you are), make sure to add  to the top of that function.
 only exists within 's scope. You aren't passing it around to the other functions so they don't know what it is.Make  a module level object so that everyone can see it.Here are some things from the docs to read: Naming and Binding, A Word About Names and Objects and Python Scopes and Namespaces.
