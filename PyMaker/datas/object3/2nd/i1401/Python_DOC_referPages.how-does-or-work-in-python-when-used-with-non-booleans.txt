This question already has an answer here:Logical operators in Python                    4 answers                Strange use of “and” / “or” operator                    7 answers                Python's Logical Operator AND                    6 answers                I'm trying to figure out how the 'or' operator works in python when used on variables that are not boolean. In particular, I'm puzzled by the fact that it seems to be non-commutative. Shouldn't 'or' be commutative? From what I can tell it seems to be implementing:a or b = a, unless a = null or 0, then a or b = b. Examples: 
From the docs:The expression  first evaluates x; if x is true, its value is returned; otherwise, y is evaluated and the resulting value is returned.[...]Note that neither  nor  restrict the value and type they return to  and , but rather return the last evaluated argument.
