Natural Text
I am to write a regex which captures a string: "N letters followed by 2 or 3 digits", where N is passed as an argument of a function.What I did is this:  but it's not right. Where's the mistake?For , it should match:  but not .
Your second block is only capturing the numbers  and , change it to a range:EDIT:To not capture something that doesn't match, you will want to add start and end conditions to your regex. This can be done in a few ways:Text AnchorsStart and end line designations if your pattern is to be by itself on a line:Where  represents a start of line and  represents end of lineDesignating Not matchesYou can say to not match specific characters after the pattern:The  inside the brackets will say "Do not match these chars." I'm not familiar enough with lookaheads/lookbacks to give you a good answer using those, but the docs can be found here
You need to add anchors to your expression:See a demo on regex101.com.In general:
