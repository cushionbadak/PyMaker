I’m using a function that performs a query, and returns either some or no results. When no results are returned, I want to raise an exception to either stop the script execution, or possibly catch it from some outer context.What exception should be raised in that case? Are there any pep recommendations about this?Note that I’m not asking what the query function should return when there are no results (this has already been covered).
As this is a pretty specific case that doesn't match any of Python's built in exceptions, I'd probably declare a new one and raise that:Python does also have a generic exception to be used when no other exception seems to apply, called :https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.htmlBut using that would be less informative than using your own.
