how can I print all sequences of length n containing letters from a list (that can repeat themselves)? using recursion.for example:output:I've been looking up and could only find recursive programs that give all sequences with no repetition. furthermore, I couldn't find any solution regarding a given list (most of them are given strings)one of the problems is that I'm not sure how to address the function recursively while it contains the length n.  
You can recruse on , the length of the subsequence. If , there is only one subsequence - the empty one. Otherwise, you take all pairs of elements of your list and subsequences of length n-1, and get all subsequences of length .
One of the ways to solve this is to use I hope this helps :)
I will use itertoolsThis is a task for product ;)BTW: if you don’t want modules look at source code: Source code at: https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.productLearn and Reverse engineering it to fit your need ;). Example if you don’t want it to return tuples.
Here is another approach, using only recursion. The  finds all possible combinations for a specific character in the list and the  find all possible combinations for every character:Output:
