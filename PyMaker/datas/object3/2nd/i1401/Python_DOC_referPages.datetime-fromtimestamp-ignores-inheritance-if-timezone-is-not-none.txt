I created a class inheriting from .While creating a new instance using the classmethod  it seems to work, except if I provide a  object. In such case, the returned object is of base type .This seems surprising. I don't see any mention of such weird behavior in the documentation, am I missing something or is it a Python bug?
Cross Posting from Python Bug TrackerIt's a side effect of a date arithmetic operation performed while setting timezone.while passing tz info to datetime it invokes tz.fromutc()followed by a datetime arithmetic herewhich eventually leads to building a new datetime object hereI'm not sure if its an expected behaviour
