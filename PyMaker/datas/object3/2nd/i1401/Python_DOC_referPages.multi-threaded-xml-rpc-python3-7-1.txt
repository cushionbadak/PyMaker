The problem you've uncovered is that it's only possible to listen once on a particular port. This means that instead of starting multiple threads to listen, you need to have a single listener which delegates the response to different threads.Python provides a ready made multithreaded server which can be used in combination with the built in server classes like .The following code implemented a multithreaded sleep server, and see below for a multithreaded client and outputs, noting the different ordering of sleep times between the server and the client.Multithreaded server:Multithreaded client:Server output:Client output:
