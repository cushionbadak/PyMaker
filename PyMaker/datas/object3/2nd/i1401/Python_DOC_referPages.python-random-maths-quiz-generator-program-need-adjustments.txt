I am trying to change 3 things in my code.Make 'Answers' match the same set of random.randomint's used for 'Questions'.Give the user an option to choose a specific operator to use for the quiz instead of random operators.For the subtraction operators, ensure the first operand is bigger than the second operand so the program doesn't give negative answers.Any answers are appreciated.Here is my code:<--FIRST FILE FOR QUESTIONS--><--SECOND FILE FOR ANSWERS-->I am fairly new to Python, writing with the program Pycharm.Thank you.
1 Make 'Answers' match the same set of random.randomint's used for 'Questions'.You could build one list first which creates the numbers and use it for questions and answers.Then use it in questions and answers :2 Give the user an option to choose a specific operator to use for the quiz instead of random operators.3 For the subtraction operators, ensure the first operand is bigger than the second operand so the program doesn't give negative answers.
To ensure positive subtraction results you could use the abs function. Or you could sort the values first :You make a  file that has all the information you need for the answers code.  Read the quiz file and for each question, use  methods to split and strip till you get the math.
