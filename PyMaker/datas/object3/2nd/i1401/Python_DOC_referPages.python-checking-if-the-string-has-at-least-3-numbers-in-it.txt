Im having some problems with the code below. I'm using PyCharm. The program is supposed to get an input for password of the user and check if it has at least 3 upper case chars and at least 3 numbers. The second task is what im having troubles with.It gets stuck at calling out the num() function and gives following errors:
In your function  declare a variable named . Because of its missing in your function and it is raising an error.
Your problem is the result of false scoping - the variable you want to use is not known. Learn more here: Short Description of the Scoping Rules?You can use  over booleans - each True sums as 1. There are pre-build function for checking  - you can those like this: Output:Doku:str.islower()str.isupper()str.isdigit()sum()truth value testing
Try to change the code to something like this: 
Here's an other option:I think it's better as it has fewer iterations and has "fast-exits"
