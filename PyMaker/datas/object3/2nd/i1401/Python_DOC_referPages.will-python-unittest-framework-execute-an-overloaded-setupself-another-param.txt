If I overload (not override)  the setUp method, will it still be executed before each test method?If not, does it affect the execution of setUp() (the non-overloaded version)?
Python does not support method overloading. The actual method will be the method which was defined last.That is mostly because Python is dynamically typed language. Overloading rules would have been way too complicated if overloading was to be (somehow) supported.
