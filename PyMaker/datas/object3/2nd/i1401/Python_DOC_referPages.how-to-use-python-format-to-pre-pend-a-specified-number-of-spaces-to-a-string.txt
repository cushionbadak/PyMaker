How do I use the string  function to pre-pend a specified number of spaces to a string? Everything I search (e.g. this post and this post) tells me to use something likeBut that will give me 10 spaces in front. What if I always want to put 4 spaces in front, keeping things left-aligned, when the input strings are of variable length? For example:I thought of doingWhich does work, but then I have to pass in this bogus empty string. Is there a cleaner way to achieve this?
If you have n as your number of spaces requiredshould add n spaces
You can use a helper function and define the number of spaces or type of indent you want:You can change the default value of the  keyword or  according to your needs so that you won't have to always have to use  or  on every output.
This doesn't use format, but  does what you want.Python also allows you to define your own formatting options. See this question an example of how to override it. In this case, it might look like:Usage:Studying the format string language, I do not see a way to do exactly what you want.
