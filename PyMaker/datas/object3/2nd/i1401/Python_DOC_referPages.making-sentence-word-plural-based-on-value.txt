Natural Text
I'm wondering if there is a preferred or at least more readable/pretty/pythonic way to make a sentence plural based on data being put into it.Here's how I'm doing it nowI know this works, but it just doesn't sit well when I go and read it. I've thought of either making a function or using a dict-switch (which is something I kinda like) but maybe someone knows a better way.Solutions I've tried:using a dictusing a functionusing boolean operatorsThose are really the only other ways I can think of right now that makes sense, also the reason I want this is because I have multiple places where I'd need to make words plural. The issue is, I may want to use different wording in places and would like to keep from repeating myself with making word(s) plural for human-readable format.
Maybe in this single instance (if we are talking a few strings to be declinated) then such approaches are sufficient.But in general case, localization (L10N) and internationalization (I12N) is best handled with suitable libraries.In case of python we have a standard library  that can be used for this purpose. It is effectively a python API to GNU gettext which is a neat option for a start.There are supplementary resources:Step-by-step guide how to localize your python script.A more in-depth introduction to GNU gettext in the context if python.Or another one if the previous does not suit you.And finally, much more involved but comprehensive python internationalization guide.In short, there is much more to L10N and I12N than plurals...
While I found @sophros answer very knowledgeable and informative, I decided it was more than I needed. I decided to write my own custom class as I needed something cheap and easy and that I can reuse for different words/sentences. Feel free to use yourself if you like it!Test that it worksWith Negative ValueOther use casesIf you just want a quick and dirty fixEither use one of my examples in the question or make a method like in my question but here's a tweaked version as @Ev. Kounis and @9769953 suggested in the comments (hope ya'll don't mind me putting ur suggestions in the answer)
