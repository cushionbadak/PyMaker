I am running a programming and getting an expected ValueError output of:I cannot figure out how to parse this data and just take the code (or message) value. How can I just get the  value of the ValueError?I have tried the following:What is the pythonic way of doing this?EditThe one thing that does work is taking the string index, but I do not want to do this, as I feel it is not very pythonic.

ValueError is a dict type. So you can use    e.get("key")to reach any field inside dict.
You should get your  directly from your dictionary not . Try this one:
