I have a set of static Html files which I need to parse and fetch some details from.I'm using the Python - lxml module to grab the required details.A sample from the static html file is as shown below:So Here's the problem I need to get the star rating from the span class = 'star' element which is visible ; for example in the first div[@top] ,the star rating of the span that is visible is '4' while the  second div[@top] doesn't have a visible span[class=star] element so it should return a star rating of '0'. However since these elements are hidden I'm having problem to fetch em and also to get the script to return  '0' star ratings on div element that has all span[@class=star] 'hidden'.This is what i have tried until now:But this code doesnt help me with the result I want,what mistake am I doing?Expected Output:abc 4dfg 0
There are a few ways to approach the problem and here is one way to go about it: get the "star" rating elements and return the index of the first "visible" element falling down to 0 if none found. We can use  and  to achieve that:Prints:Beware of the fact that  attribute is a multi-valued attribute and, strictly speaking,  is not the best tool for the job to find an element by a class value: How can I match on an attribute that contains a certain string?
You could use lxml via BeautifulSoup. Someone more familiar with Python can probably tidy this upOutput:
