Natural Text
I was looking at the Python documentation for  which states:print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)As it can be seen, if the  on which to print is not specified, the default  is used, which got me thinking.Calling  definitely does not import  in the background, so how does it work?is  somehow reachable from everywhere?Example:I am using PyCharm and I want to create a function that either prints a message  to a file or to standard output. I began writing:So what goes after ?  does not work and obviously, I am not interested in the verbose:
The other answer points out that print is implemented in C. However, even if it was implemented in Python, that would not mean that  was available from everywhere.Consider this code:utils.pymain.pyHere  is only available within utils, but print will still output to  without it being accessible from main.
I think @DanielRoseman gave a good idea of why the implementation might not necessarily give you access to  directly, but to address the last part of your question, you can use this approach...:... where basically you are unpacking the argument  if  is present, otherwise pass no argument.In terms of readability I think your original implementation is superior however.Actually you can just pass :... and it would just  the  if  is not provided...
