I'm downloading a zip file from S3 in Go like so:I send 'data' to a client that's written in Python3, and need to convert this byte array back to a zip file and put it in a specified directory. I've tried this:But I get this error:OSError: [Errno 36] File name too long"I just want to 'rebuild' the zip file and save it to a directory.
Read the documentation, the first parameter of ZipFile class is the file name or file object, not the Zip content.If you want to read the ZipFile in memory without creating a real file, you'll want to wrap file_bytes using io.BytesIO.
I figured out how to do this. In go, you'll want to base64 encode it (as a string).Then in python it's as simple as this (where 'file_bytes' is the base64 encoded string):And bam, you have a reassembled zip file.
