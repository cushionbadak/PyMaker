For example, I want to determine if a certain number a is in a list A. If I use , this would be much faster than writing an iteration function likeWhat's under the hood? Is Python using a different way as mine to determine the membership? I skimmed the Python documentation but didn't find the answer.
6.10.2. Membership test operationsFor container types such as list, tuple, set, frozenset, dict, or collections.deque, the expression  is equivalent to .For the string and bytes types,  is  if and only if x is a substring of y. An equivalent test is . Empty strings are always considered to be a substring of any other string, so  will return .For user-defined classes which define the  method,  returns  if  returns a true value, and  otherwise.For user-defined classes which do not define  but do define ,  is  if some value  with  is produced while iterating over . If an exception is raised during the iteration, it is as if  raised that exception.Lastly, the old-style iteration protocol is tried: if a class defines ,  is  if and only if there is a non-negative integer index  such that , and all lower integer indices do not raise IndexError exception. (If any other exception is raised, it is as if in raised that exception).Information extracted from the Python official page: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html
