I have the following code in Python which connects to a local root database in MySQL using the  library:  The above code works just fine, but if I need to execute system commands (according to MySQL CLI syntax) such as: I get the following confusing error:This could be potentially a security issue implemented in the MySQL service (as I got the same error using other database libraries in python), but if so, how can I tune this setting down?I am using the newest version of Ubuntu Server (18.10) and MySQL (Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.7.24, for Linux (x86_64)).  Edit: To clarify a bit, I am very well aware of Python's  or  but I wanted to try the above-mentioned technique through MySQL queries. I've also tried different drivers such as ,  but all of them with same results.
The  command on the MySQL CLI is a convenience feature that allows you to issue commands for execution on your default command interpreter. It does not need or use a DB connection. It is only available on UNIX systems.The CLI is a tool for administrators or users to work with a DB. It contains a DB driver, but it also contains a system shell escape; it tries to cover all functionality required to manage a DB. (or any other DB API 2.0 compliant driver package) is built to create connections to databases, get cursors from those connections and execute SQL statements on these cursors. It is not concerned about system shells.A DB driver is a software package that allows developers to implement SQL query functionality in a programm. It does not need to do more than this, because if the developer needs additional functionality in said programm, they will implement it using the appropriate package.If you want to issue system commands from your Python script,  can be considered the standard package for that.
