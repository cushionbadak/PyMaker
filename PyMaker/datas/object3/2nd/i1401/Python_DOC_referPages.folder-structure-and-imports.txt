So I have a small project i'm working on currently but im struggling with imports.originally I had a struct like so: Im running my tests from the python folder and I had a class in that folder called pertest_resources that contained paths to other folders like the root and the script folder. Now this worked fine when all the core files were in the python folder, but now its getting a little messy i've been asked to branch off some of the python scripts to a new folder called 'networks' with a structure like:Now I want to run a file from the python folder called test that uses the standard_network that in turn imports perftest_resources from the python folder.I've tried: but that doesn't work when its all originally run from test.py in the python folder.Do I need to add init to both folders?
