I have two keywords in my robot file. The first method should give me a status code and the second should get this code from context and match it with the argument I have given. The test case basically checks whether the status code from an api is 200 or not, the 200 which I will be passing as an argument.I had tried to give the value as suite variable and then use the Get Variable Value keyword to get the value. The problem with this is the argument to the above keyword will give 'Variable definition not found' error. Please find the two methodsThe reason I do not want to return from the first keyword and give to the second is because of the format of test cases I am told to use.I would have used a hashmap in Java. I am new to robot framework and pycharm. Can someone help me out?
The core of this issue seems to me to be spacing. Below is the essential solution of your problem. When using embedded arguments in the keyword name there should be no double spaces as they have special meaning in RF. 
You will need to remove the [Argument] if you want the variable parameter embedded. Also change the embedded variable name, as at the moment it looks like a dictionary value passes in from just a string value:Also consider using "Set Test Variable" to lower the scope of the variable or you might have some undesired impact on other tests further down the line (unless you need it at suite level).
