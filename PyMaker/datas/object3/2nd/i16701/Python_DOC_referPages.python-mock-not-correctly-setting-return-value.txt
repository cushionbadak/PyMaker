I am attempting to build unit tests and have been using mock, However upon using two patch statements, I was not able to set the proper return values.however the assert fails and instead of the expected string redirect I instead get I was wondering what is necessary to have redirect returned instead.  I have not encountered this issue when only patching a single method.
I was able to fix the issue of incorrectly appearing by replacing my earlier code with: this allowed the return values to be properly set.
 and  created with patch decorator are ordinary mock objects (Mock or MagicMock). Direct assignment is not the correct way to set return values. Use  attribute:Also you can set it during patching: takes arbitrary keyword arguments. These will be passed to the  Mock (or new_callable) on construction.
I recommend you to use this solution. You should move your functions to helper class and instead static methods user class methods, because it's possible to mock class in this way.p.s. And you forgot 'return_value' in your example.
