I am making a multiple choice game with pygame and python. I made a seperate program to work on the circle filling/unfilling I mostly have it down. The circles fill and unfill on the way up, but not on the way down. It's hard to explain, I'd suggest you run the code to really understand what I mean. Any help would be very appreciated!Heres my code:
You have to set the other variables to  that aren't being clicked when you handle the mouse button being pressed. For example, once  is set to  nothing sets it to , hence the first if statement will always execute, and the other things will be set to .There are also simpler ways of accomplishing what you are trying to do, I think you might benefit from looking at some of the Python documentation, it would make your more concise, legible, and also, in many cases, faster.
