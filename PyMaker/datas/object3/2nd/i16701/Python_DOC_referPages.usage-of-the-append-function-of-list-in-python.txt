The above code is used to generate all permutations given a collection of numbers. For example,num = [1, 3]The result will be:[1 3], [3, 1]But there is a bug for the above code that I don't understand, which is .If I change it to , then the code is correct. Can anyone explain why?Using , the result is:[1, 3], [1, 3]Using , the result is:[1, 3], [3, 1]
The elements of a python  are references to other objects. When you append using , the list is grown by 1 element, and the last element is set to refer to the object pointed to by .Now in the first case, there are 2 references to the same  object. As  and  refer to the same object, all changes performed through either are also visible through the other.In the second case, using ,  operator makes a new list that is copy of the original.For general algorithm for creating all permutations of a given collection of elements, use the :
