The doc clearly says:Return the new absolute position.However,  appears to return  (same behavior also on Linux):Is this a know bug?Is this a doc or implementation bug?
You are reading the wrong documentation. You need to look at  when using Python 2:There is no return value.Using  is fine, and if you do, you'll get a different object, whose  method does return the current position:The  module is the new I/O architecture for Python 3, available in Python 2 as well. The Python 3 built-in  function is an alias for , but not yet so in Python 2.
Following up on Martjin's answer, use  to inspect the variable's type:By inspecting the object type, you will see that the variable  is not a member of , but of , and so the documentation to look up would be different.
