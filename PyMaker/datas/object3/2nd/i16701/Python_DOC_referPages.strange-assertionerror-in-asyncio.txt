I'm trying to mark future done by timeout with this code:"Timer" loop.call_later sets result to future after 3 seconds. It works, but I'm getting exception too:What can mean this AssertionError? Am I doing something wrong setting future done by loop.call_later?
What causes the exception:  continues to run even after the  call; By changing with , you will get what I mean.How about using ?
You shouldn't call  yourself. The event loop sets the result of the future after the task returns.
