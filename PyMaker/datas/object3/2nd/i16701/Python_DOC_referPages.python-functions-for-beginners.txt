I'm somewhat new to python - I at least thought I had a solid understanding of the syntax but can't seem to figure out why this function does not work.  I want to write a function to capitalize the letters of a string.What am I not understanding here?  Seems basic to me but can't figure it out.  Any help would be appreciated!
You need to specify a  explicitly. replace withIf no return statement is specified,  is returned by default, Hence the result.
You need to do two things:Because  returns an uppercase copy of the string on which the method was called, you need to return  from function  and thenReassign the variable  to that return value.Here is how your script should look:Demo:
I think you are missing a print command.If you want value back in a variable then you will have to return the value in function and assign it to a variable. 
You have to remember to ask yourself, what do I want this function to do? In many cases, you might want it to give you the result. eg returnIn some cases you may just want the function to do what you were going to do anyway.
This can also work too. You can assign the word.upper() to a variable and still call it word.
