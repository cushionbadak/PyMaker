I have a dictionary like:I want to get the sum of all values that are under the key :Currently, in order to avoid entering  repeatedly, I use the following commands: But, I guess there should be an operator that does the same thing, without storing  as an intermediate variable. I was wondering if such a command or an operator exists.EDIT:In the example given above, it was just a sum operation. But it could for example be: But I do not want enter  repeatedly. That's the thing I am searching for... I don't know whether such an operator exists. (In MATLAB, there exists such a thing for cell structures).
No, that kind of operator does not exist for the built-in dict type. I suppose you could make your own dict type that inherited from  and overloaded an operator:but that is somewhat inefficient and not very good for readability.If you just want to sum the values, you can use  and  ( if you are using Python 2.x):Otherwise, I would just use what you have now: It is about as clean and efficient as you can get.
For a general solution to repeatedly get the same item from a mapping or index, I suggest the  module's :Now create our easy getter:And call it on the object whenever you want your sub-dict:returns:andreturns
If this is just "how do I access a dict's values easily and repeatedly?" you should just assign them like this, and you can reuse them again and again.In Python 2:In Python 3, values returns an iterator, which you can't reuse, so materialize it in a list:and then you can do whatever you want with it:etc...
