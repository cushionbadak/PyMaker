 is the script; the gist author just didn't give it a name.If you want, give it a name with a  extension instead, and run the script with Python:gives you the command-line help message.Do make sure you have pyquery installed first.The file is written for Python 2. If you have Python 3 installed, it is easy enough to have it converted:This will replace the script with one that will work just fine on Python 3.
