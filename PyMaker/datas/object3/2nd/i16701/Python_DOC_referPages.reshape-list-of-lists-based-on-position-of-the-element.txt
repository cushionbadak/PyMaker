This question already has an answer here:Transpose a matrix in Python [duplicate]                    3 answers                I have a list of lists that looks like this;Which is the most efficient way to get 3 lists from the above list based on the position of the element?Result:
You can use  and a list comprehension:Placing  before  unpacks the list into arguments for the  function.  In this case:is equivalent to writing: then zips these lists together by returning an iterator of tuples where the n-th tuple contains the n-th item from each of the lists.  In this case, it returns:1Finally, the list comprehension converts these tuples into lists and collects them into a new list.1You need to call  on  to view its items because  returns an iterator in Python 3.x.
