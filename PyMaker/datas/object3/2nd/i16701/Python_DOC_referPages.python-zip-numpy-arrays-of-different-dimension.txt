I'd like to zip numpy arrays befor saving it via . For zipping one dimensional arrays I usewhich does exactly what I want. Now I have more data, say likebutdoes not work. I could doinstead, but the "depth" of  changes. My solution isbut that reads kind of suboptimal. Thanks for an advice.
I would use numpy.hstack/vstack:Edit: I actually mostly use np.row_stack/column_stack nowadays, as I find it more natural than hstack or vstack:
Use the  opertor to "unpack"  when calling :(You can avoid  and use a direct numpy approach (e.g. using , as @metaperture suggested), which is arguably a better approach. However, this answer demostrates the correct way to do exactly what you were trying to do originally)
I would not recommend using  if your only objective is to save multiple arrays of different dimensions, as the title of this question suggests. Use  or  instead. These functions were meant to save multiple arrays (of arbitrary dimensions).Using  is particularly bad as it won't port to Python3, where  returns an iterator and not a list of tuples. Calling  on the iterator creates an array with a single element of dtype , which is probably not what you want.I was not able to recover the zipped data after a save and a load.
