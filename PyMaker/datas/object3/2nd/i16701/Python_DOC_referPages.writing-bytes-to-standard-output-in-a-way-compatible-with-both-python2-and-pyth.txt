I want a function returning a file object with which I can write binary data to standard output. In python2  is such an object. In python3 it is .What is the most elegant/preferred way to retrieve such an object so that it works for both, the python2 and the python3 interpreter?Is the best way to check for existance of  (probably using the  module) and if it exists, return it and if it doesnt, assume we are on python2 and return  instead?
No need to test, just use :This retrieves the  attribute on , but if it doesn't exist (Python 2) it'll return the  object itself instead.Python 2:Python 3:Take into account that in Python 2,  is still opened in text mode, newlines are still translated to  when writing. The Python 3  object won't do this for you.
