I have a dictionary object say:I need help finding the key with maximum numbers of data.by data here I mean the string values inside the list.
Your question could be clearer, but if what you want is what I suggested in the comments, this will work:Here, we define a key function that takes a key/value 2-tuple as returned by , and:if the value is a string, returns 1.otherwise, returns the length of the list of strings.That key function is then used with the builtin  function to return the item with the largest number of strings, and finally we use  to get the key from that item. 
I understand that you want to return the key that has the maximum numbers of data.A pretty functional solution:
