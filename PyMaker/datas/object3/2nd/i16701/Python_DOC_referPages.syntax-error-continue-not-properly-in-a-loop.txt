it says Syntax error 'continue' not properly in a loopwhen I run the file.
You cannot  from an  statement. You need it to be in a loop.Whereas,is wrong.Python Docs state this:The continue statement, also borrowed from C, continues with the next iteration of the loop:
The  keyword is used to go directly to the next iteration of a loop, skipping the code after the keyword. So, the errorindicates that the   clause is not inside a loop (like  or ).What can you do?Check your logic. Do you really want to use ?Put the code inside a loop:
 must be inside a while or for loop, check if your elif statement is within a for or while loop. if yes, check your indentation.
The  keyword is reserved to skip the iteration of a loop and not a  condition block. What you want to do is more this:From the documentation: may only occur syntactically nested in a  or  loop, but not nested in a function or class definition or  clause within that loop. It continues with the next cycle of the nearest enclosing loop.When  passes control out of a  statement with a  clause, that  clause is executed before really starting the next loop cycle.
