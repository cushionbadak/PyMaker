I have a class that return a float number, and I want to print it in the  as a representation of the previous class, formatted to trim some numbers over floating point. If I override the  method I obviously get  exception, as the following example:So, how can I "fix"? Using the  doesn't seem to help
You can convert the float to a string within the  method before returning it.
You could implement the  special method to customise how your custom class is interpolated into a string format:This delegates to the  function to handle the actual formatting, but it gives you a hook to determine what format is being requested for your custom object.The  method is passed the full Format Specification Mini Language string. Like  you still need to return a string object.Demo:
