I have a class which I want to have all the functions of frozenset but i don't want him to be configurable (by init, frozenset gets iterable).Additionally, I want him to have the function 'reload' - I am loading static list from a server so the user can not change it (so I don't want the user to think he can change it).The list on the server can be changed by the admin so I need the reload option.That's what I hoped for:But I didn't find a way to 'add' new staff to the class (I tried to re-init it).May be I am using the wrong staff so if you have anther way for this it fine (I need the option to compare difference between to difference objects):May be overloading add and update of set will be good but i don't want to do that (it looks bad in code because there are more update-like functions).
You cannot update the  contents, no; it remains immutable even when subclassed.You can subclass the  Abstract Base Class instead; it models an immutable set too; all you need to do really is implement the methods listed in the Abstract Methods column and the rest is taken care of for you:Not all methods of the built-in  type are implemented; you can easily supply the missing ones as these are aliases of the operator methods:
