I'm confused about the namespace and scope of variables in pythonSuppose I have a test.py:and then, I define a variable named strName and try to access it in the test.py, but it throws an error:I was wondering why this happens and is there any way to access strName in test.py?
 isn't global.  is module-level; truly global variables like  and  live in the  module ( in Python 3). Using a  declaration at module level is redundant.I strongly recommend you pass your data to  another way, such as by defining a function in there and passing your string as an argument:test.py:other code that wants to use test.py:
test.py:Interactive Shell:
Global is specifically for cases where you have a variable defined outside a method, and want to use it inside that method without passing in parameters. It is put at the top of the method  so that python treats that variable as a global variable, rather then a new local variable with the same name. Global is not a way to declare variables, and since strName isn't in existance, global can't figure out where the location of strName is.
