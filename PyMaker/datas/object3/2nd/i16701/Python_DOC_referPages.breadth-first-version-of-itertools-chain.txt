In  there's , which combines multiple generators in a single one, and in essence does a depth-first iteration over them, i.e.,  yields A, B, C, 1, 2, 3. But, there's no breadth-first version, or am I missing something? There's of course , but for large numbers of generators this feels awkward, as the tuples will be very long and possibly very sparse.I came up with the following:It feels a bit verbose to me, is there a more Pythonic approach I'm missing? And would this function be a good candidate for inclusion in ?
You could use  to rotate through your iterators; rotating a deque is much more efficient. I'd also call it a chained zip, not a 'breath first chain', as such:Demo:There is also a  recipe in the documentation that does the same, using the  function:
Not sure if you'd still consider this too "verbose"...
