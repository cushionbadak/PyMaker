How to truncate a string using  in Python? Is it even possible?There is a  parameter mentioned in the Format Specification Mini-Language:But specifying it apparently only works for padding, not truncating:So it's more a minimal width than width really.I know I can slice strings, but the data I process here is completely dynamic, including the format string and the args that go in. I cannot just go and explicitly slice one.
Use  instead:According to the documentation of the Format Specification Mini-Language:The precision is a decimal number indicating how many digits should be displayed after the decimal point for a floating point value formatted with  and , or before and after the decimal point for a floating point value formatted with  or . For non-number types the field indicates the maximum field size - in other words, how many characters will be used from the field content. The precision is not allowed for integer values.
