I'd like to write a function which:takes in parameter: a number of months (int)returns the year (int) and the month (int) of the timedelta between now and the number of input months.Example : we are in may 2014, so:myfunc(0) should return (2014, 5)myfunc(12) should return (2013, 5)myfunc(5) should return (2013, 12)etc.There is lots of documentation about datetime and calendar, so much that I'm a bit lost. Thanks for help.Note: I need to get an accurate way to do it, not an approximation :)

This produces:Don't know why i got the downvote, but to quote OP:Example : we are in may 2014, so:myfunc(5) should return (2013, 12) etc.And this is what my function produces...Feedback people, give it before downvoting randomly.
You can use  module for this. https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-dateutil
EDITED (Changed the month addition to make the accuracy perfect)Now you can put negative number of months and get past datesI think this is what youre looking forI've tested this script in my coputer and works perfectly
