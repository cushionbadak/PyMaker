I am creating a little script that will take a pickled file, read its contents and present it to the user. I am working on a feature that will allow to randomly select lists. Each list represents a single file. In these lists are items.What I want to do is randomly jump between files (master lists) but every time it returns to the file, I want to pick up where it left off - to read from the position it was at before.To demonstrate, I will give you a little example (in reality it's more complex):Now I want to do something like:The  statement is because I want to jump out of  loop so  is differing from the one that was before.But I cannot do what I need. I would like to get this output for example:Etc. You get the idea. I cannot figure out how to keep the state where the list was read last time. I hope it's not too confusing. Also, I do not know how  will look like, it will be changed every time so I cannot use anything too "specific", the number of the item lists in  will be different every time as well as number of items inside those.
An iterator yields each item of a list (or any other iterable) in turn, keeping track of its place as it goes. You can make an iterator over a list (or any other iterable) with the built-in  function, and then get its items in turn using .Here's how you could use iterators to accomplish your goal:Notice that when an iterator is exhausted, it raises , and in the code above we catch that exception and remove the exhausted iterator from . When  is empty, it evaluates as  and the  loop terminates.
