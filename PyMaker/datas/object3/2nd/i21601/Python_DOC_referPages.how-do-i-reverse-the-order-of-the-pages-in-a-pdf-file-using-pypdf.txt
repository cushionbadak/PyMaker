I have a pdf file "myFile.pdf". I would like to reverse the order of its pages using pyPdf. How?

Thanks for sharing suggestions. I used them and edited a bit to make the interface more graphical when selecting and saving a file. New to all of this and what I added might not be efficient or clean, but it worked for me and thought to share.
As of (long before) January 2019, pyPdf is no longer updated, and upon testing is not compatible with (at least) Python 3.6, and likely at all with Python 3:(Moving the  assignment above the  fixes this specific problem, but other s due to Python 2 syntax then pop up.)Fortunately, its successor project, PyPDF2, works cleanly on Python 3.6 (at least). It appears the core user-facing API was intentionally maintained to be compatible with pyPdf, so nosklo's answer can be used in modern Python after a  just by changing to  in the  statement, and switching  to :I would also recommend the more Pythonic approach of just iterating over the pages directly using :I don't know if this  collection was available in the original , but arguably it doesn't really matter much at this point.
