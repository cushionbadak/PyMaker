I am getting the  error. Any idea how I can fix this?
You need to use something like iteritems.See this answer for more information on iterating through dictionaries, such as using , across python versions.EDITSince Python 3 iteritems() is no longer supported. Use items() instead.
For Python 3.x  has been removed. Use items instead.
You want to use iteritems. This returns an iterator over the dictionary, which gives you a tuple(key, value)Your problem was that you were looping over fields, which returns the keys of the dictionary.
For lists, use  will not work for list objects
Can't be iterating directly in dictionary. So you can through converting into tuple.
you are missing  in your code.You could also do it other way, where you get values using keys in the dictionary.

In Python3  is no longer supportedSOLUTION1:Use SOLUTION2:You can use  as well
