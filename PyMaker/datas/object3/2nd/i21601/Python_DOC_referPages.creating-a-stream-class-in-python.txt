I have a class which expects a stream that contains an XML file.I don't necessarily want a file stream and I might want to use other sources like a database, a socket etc.What class do I need to subclass from the io module in order to supply the stream interface from other sources?
Dynamic typing allows you not to subclass from any base class in this case. You should implement some methods with proper names. Blog post on the subject
The answer given by Andrey isn't entirely correct.In Python, streams are "file-like" objects. You can read/write to them using tools defined in the io module. The module also provides interfaces which you should implement if you want to define a stream object.Note that the  module differentiates between three different types of streams, which require slightly different interfaces. (They differ mostly in terms of data types.)Text I/O - interface TextIOBaseBinary I/O - interface BufferedIOBaseRaw I/O - interface RawIOBaseStringIO for example is an in-memory implementation of the TextIOBase.Note that these interfaces are available both on Python 2 and 3.
