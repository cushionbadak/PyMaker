I was searching for a usleep() function in Python 2.7.Does anybody know if it does exist, maybe with another function name?
Since  generally means you want to delay execution for x microseconds, you must divide the seconds value by 1000000. takes seconds as a parameter.http://docs.python.org/library/time.html#time.sleep


Be very very careful with time.sleep.  I got burned by python3 using time.sleep because it is non-monotonic.  If the wall clock changes backwards, the time.sleep call won't finish until the wall clock catches up with where it would have been if the sleep had gone forward as planned.  I have not yet found a monotonic blocked sleep for python.Instead, I recommend Event.wait, like this:http://pastebin.com/0rZdY8gB
More info.
An alternate sleep function for python.Note: Should not be used for multiple threads due to GIL lock, but for multiple subprocesses its fine. Same with time.sleep()I'm wrapping a C function to Python. I'm using nanosleep() of C library, which halts that thread running for that much amount of time. It is not a busy-wait type of delay which uses much CPU to evaluate some math. The codes are as follows. Put all in a folder, say CWrapper.C_functions.hC_functions.cYou can also create a function for micro seconds using the same nanosleep()CWrapper.pyxsetup.pyInstall python-pyrex. Then run in linux terminalIt will create CWrapper.c, build, and CWrapper.so files. Use CWrapper.so where ever you want, and just import in python.Note: Compile separately for Raspberry Pi.Now, test the functionTest_sleep.pyVary the parameters delay_sec for time.sleep(), delay_msec for CWrapper.sleep_msec(), delay_nsec for CWrapper.sleep_nsec(). Uncomment the function which you want to test in thread_1_task().
how about this:
