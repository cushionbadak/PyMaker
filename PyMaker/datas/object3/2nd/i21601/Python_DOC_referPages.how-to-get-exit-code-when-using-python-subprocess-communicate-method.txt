How do I retrieve the exit code when using Python's  module and the  method?Relevant code:Should I be doing this another way?
 will set the  attribute when it's done(*). Here's the relevant documentation section:So you can just do (I didn't test it but it should work):(*) This happens because of the way it's implemented: after setting up threads to read the child's streams, it just calls . 
You should first make sure that the process has completed running and the return code has been read out using the  method. This will return the code. If you want access to it later, it's stored as  in the  object.

 will update the return code.TryIn addition, after  is called the return code is available in the object as .
This worked for me. It also prints the output returned by the child process
