I need a python client to do FTPES (explicit), does anyone has experience with any python package that can do this.I am not able to do this in python, but can connect to FTP server using tools like FileZillaThanks
FTP-SSL Explicit is well supported by native Python. After setting up the connection, you can use all the standard ftplib commands. More can be found at:http://docs.python.org/2/library/ftplib.html#ftplib.FTP_TLSHere's a basic example for downloading a file:
For me this worked: (login after auth). Taken from Nullege. They seem to be tests for ftplib.
If you can use an sftp client, it is provided with paramiko... however, sftp and ftp over ssl (ftps) are different...My googling indicates that ftp over ssl might be available in ftplib, although I haven't tried this mechanism myself...  the FTP_TLS method was only added in python 2.7
Standard ftplib does contain everything you need for ftpes (ftps explicit) connection. I didn't find easy way to make implicit connections.See: http://docs.python.org/2/library/ftplib.html#ftplib.FTP_TLS
