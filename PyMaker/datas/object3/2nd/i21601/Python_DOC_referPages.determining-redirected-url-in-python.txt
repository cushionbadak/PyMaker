You can use  ( in Python 3) and its  in order to find out where a URL will redirect you. Here's a function that does that:
You can not get hold of the redirection URL through parsing the HTML source code. Redirections are triggered by the server and NOT by the client. You need to perform a HTTP request to the related URL and check the HTTP response of the server - in particular for the HTTP status code 304 (Redirection) and the new URL.
