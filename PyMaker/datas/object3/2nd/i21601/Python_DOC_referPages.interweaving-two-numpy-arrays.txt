Assume the following arrays are given:How would one interweave them efficiently so that one gets a third array like thisIt can be assumed that .
I like Josh's answer.  I just wanted to add a more mundane, usual, and slightly more verbose solution.  I don't know which is more efficient.  I expect they will have similar performance.
Here is a one-liner:
I thought it might be worthwhile to check how the solutions performed in terms of performance. And this is the result:This clearly shows that the most upvoted and accepted answer (Pauls answer) is also the fastest option.The code was taken from the other answers and from another Q&A:Just in case you have numba available you could also use that to create a function:It could be slightly faster than the other alternatives:
Here is a simpler answer than some of the previous onesAfter this  contains:This answer also appears to be marginally faster:
Maybe this is more readable than @JoshAdel's solution:
This will interleave/interlace the two arrays and I believe it is quite readable:
Improving @xioxox's answer:
 sure is an option, but more straightforward solution for your case could be the and more importantly this works for arbitrary shapes of  and Also you may want to try out  u've got options now!
One can also try . (Solution migrated from Interleave numpy arrays)Please see the  and  for more information.
