...Now I know this question has been asked many times & I have looked at these other threads. Nothing so far has worked, from using sys.path.append('.') to just import fooI have a python file that wishes to import a file (that is in its parent directory). Can you help me figure out how my child file can successfully import its a file in its parent directory. I am using python 2.7The structure is like so (each directory also has the __init__.py file in it):StockTracker/__Comp/____
Should do it. This will only work on recent versions of Python--from 2.6, I believe [Edit: since 2.5].Each level (Comp and Subcomp) must also be have an  file for this to work. You've said that they do.
When packages are structured into  subpackages (as with the sound package  in the example), you can use absolute  imports to refer to submodules of  siblings packages. For example, if the  module sound.filters.vocoder needs to  use the echo module in the  sound.effects package, it can use from  sound.effects import echo.Starting with Python 2.5, in addition  to the implicit relative imports  described above, you can write  explicit relative imports with the  from module import name form of import  statement. These explicit relative  imports use leading dots to indicate  the current and parent packages  involved in the relative import. From  the surround module for example, you  might use:Quote from here http://docs.python.org/tutorial/modules.html#intra-package-references
If the Comp directory is in your PYTHONPATH environment variable, plain oldwill work.If you're using Linux or OS X, and launching your program from the bash shell, you can accomplish that byFor Windows, take a look at these links: http://docs.python.org/using/windows.htmlhttp://www.itechtalk.com/thread3595.htmlEDIT:To modify the path programmatically, you were on the right track in your original question. You just need to add the parent directory instead of the current directory.
