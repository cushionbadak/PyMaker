You can use the  function to prompt the user for input, and  to convert the user input from a string to a float:If you're using python 2, use  instead.
This is the simplest way:Note that the  function returns a string, which is converted to a floating point number with . If you type something other than a number, you will get an exception:If you're using Python 3 (it sounds like you are), use  instead of .
You can use: Where the string 'Please enter a value:' would be your message, and foo would be your variables.
If the user is entering the inputs in just one line with space as delimiting word between those inputs, you can write:Now, you can change it to:The awesome trick is that in this way you don't waste your space creating a new list and storing your values in that and then fetching it.
