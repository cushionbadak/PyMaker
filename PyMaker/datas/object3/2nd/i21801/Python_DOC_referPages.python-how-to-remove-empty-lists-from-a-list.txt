I have a list with empty lists in it:How can I remove the empty lists so that I get:I tried list.remove('') but that doesn't work.
TryIf you want to get rid of everything that is "falsy", e.g. empty strings, empty tuples, zeros, you could also use
You can use  instead of a list comprehension:If  is used as first argument to , it filters out every value in the given list, which is  in a boolean context.  This includes empty lists.It might be slightly faster than the list comprehension, because it only executes a single function in Python, the rest is done in C.
Calling  with  will filter out all falsey values from the list (which an empty list is)

A few options:sample session:
I found this question because I wanted to do the same as the OP.I would like to add the following observation:The iterative way (user225312, Sven Marnach):Will return a  object in  and  . Instead the filter way (lunaryorn, Imran) will differently behave over versions:It will return a  object in  and a  in  (see this question found at the same time). This is a slight difference but it must be take in account when developing compatible scripts.This does not make any assumption about performances of those solutions. Anyway the filter object can be reverted to a list using:
I needed to filter empty items from more complex nested objects. I made a recursive function to do it. See my SO answer here.
output:
Output:
Adding to the answers above, Say you have a  of the form:and you want to take out the empty entries from each list as well as the empty lists you can do:Your new list will look like
