For every client connecting to my server I spawn a new thread, like this:Now, I know I can close all the threads using this code:But how can I close the thread from within that thread?
When you start a thread, it begins executing a function you give it (if you're extending , the function will be ). To end the thread, just return from that function.According to this, you can also call , which will throw an exception that will end the thread silently.
A little late, but I use a  variable to tell the thread when I want to close. It's easy to use, just implement a stop() inside your thread class.And in  just loop on 
How about  from the module . If  is executed from within a thread it will close that thread only.This answer here talks about that: Why does sys.exit() not exit when called inside a thread in Python?
If you want force stop your thread:For me works very good.
