I'd like to generate a set of x unique random numbers and sort them in Python. For example:range(1000, 10000)x = 100I've figured out to import random and use the random.randrange method, then loop to get 100 random numbers and in the end sort them.However, I don't know how to get unique numbers (such that they do not repeat) - should I validate each and every loop? Or is there any other easier way how to do it? And how should I sort them?Thanks y'all!
Use The sorting part is easy - use the  method.By default this will sort it from smallest number to largest, but it takes an optional  argument which determines what to sort it on.There is also a  function which doesn't modify a list in-place, but rather returns a sorted list.This also has an optional  argument.
 implements the   itertools recipe, which returns  sorted random numbers, if given a sorted input.This is unlike , which returns an unsorted result.DetailsLooking at the recipe, we can see why this order is established.From itertools recipes: is inherently sorted and becomes the  from which random elements are selected.  Although the indices are randomly selected, they are later sorted. Since the  and  are both sorted, the results are also sorted.In summary, this does the same as @Volatility's answer, except the sorting is handled for you.Cavaet:  requires the length of the iterable to exceed the value of , otherwise an error is raised.
