I have a large sequence related problem to solve for which following is sub problem, an I am sure its something very basic in python that I am not aware of. How can I generate I can easily solve above problem by writing a small function, but I require it at the variable definition time.  
Your solution doesn't work because it produces a list of tuples.What you are looking for is a way to flatten the list you produce - the simplest way to do this is :If you intended to have the last value only once, as in your example, simply slice the end of the list ().As a note, rather than repeating your value for each repetition you want, you can use a list and multiply it up (providing the values are immutable, or you don't mind them being the same object). An alternative is .
A variation of @shantanoo's answer: OutputReally it was just an excuse to use  :D
Sometimes a simple generator is all it takes:-- Although this generator could definitely benefit from a better name...The thing you get from this answer that you don't get from the others is that you don't need to convert to a list in order to slice off the last element -- It can be evaluated completely lazily.  It also can be passed a generator and it still works (although the answer by Lattyware still works in that case as well -- but the  answers don't unless you use  first).
Another way:In case of seq as iter,Thanks @mgilson for the iter feedback.
