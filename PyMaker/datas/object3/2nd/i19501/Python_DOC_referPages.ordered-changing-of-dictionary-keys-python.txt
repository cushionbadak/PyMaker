I know it is possible to change the keys in a dictionary. But is it possible to change all the keys using a defined pattern? In this case I have a dictionary that contain:Question: All key's contain a '>' + string. Can I remove these '>' and update? Or update without '>'?Little background:In my script I try to compare one dictionaries values to this examples keys which results in an error. I assume this is due to the '>' because v =! k if k = '>foo' and v = 'foo' If any of you are scientist this '>' is a result of a fasta parser. Which I could probably just change the script to not write the '>' at the start of a line (I haven't tried this..yet).
It's easy enough with a dict comprehension:for Python 2.7. For Python 3, use  instead.For Python 2.6 and earlier, where there is no dict comprehension syntax yet, use: is a quick and concise method to remove any  characters from the start of a key.
