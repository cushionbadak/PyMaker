How can I guess an image's mime type, in a cross-platform manner, and without any external libraries?
If you know in advance that you only need to handle a limited number of file formats you can use the imghdr.what function.
I've checked the popular image types' format on wikipedia, and tried to make a signature:
If you can rely on the file extension you can use the mimetypes.guess_type function. Note that you may get different results on different platforms, but I would still call it cross-platform.
