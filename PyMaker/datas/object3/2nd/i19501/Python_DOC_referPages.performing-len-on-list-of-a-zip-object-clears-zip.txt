This question already has an answer here:Why can't I iterate twice over the same data?                    3 answers                I am seeing a strange behavior when working with the zip() function.  When I perform the following operation len(list(z)) where z is a zip object, the result is 0 (which seems wrong to me), and the action seems to clear out the zip object.  Can someone please help me understand what is going on.Thank you,Ahmed.
In Python 3 zip is a generator. The generator is being exhausted when you do . You can create a list from the values returned by the generator and operate on that.Generators are a good thing. They allow us to write memory-efficient code in nearly the same way we would write code that deals with lists. To use an example from the linked wiki: Could be rewritten as a generator to avoid creating another list in memory:
To complete the previous answer, there is a Python library called  for getting the size of iterables.http://cardinality.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
