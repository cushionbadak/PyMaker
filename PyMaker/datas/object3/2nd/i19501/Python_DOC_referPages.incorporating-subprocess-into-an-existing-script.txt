I have an existing python script, which I'd like to now revise to have more threads (subprocesses) running. For the purpose of this example, let's say revised to run 3 threads at the same time. Incidentally the script is nothing more than generating a client request to a web server and measuring the response time. As a relative noob, the documentation isn't quite clear to me. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
If you want explicit control over the processes you're running, you want :That's all there is to it.There are various differences between threads and processes, but the big one is that you don't get to implicitly share values between processes; you have to pass them around (through the startup  and return value, or through a , or some external means like a socket or pipe) or explicitly share them (through a  or , or some external means like an file).For a more realistic use case, you usually don't want to directly control what the processes are doing; you want to create a pool of processes, and just queue up jobs to get done by whichever process is free next. For that, you want either  or . The latter is a bit simpler, but requires Python 3.2 or a third-party library, so I'll show the former:More commonly, you want to actually pass parameters to the function. In the simplest case, this actually makes things even simplerâ€”if you can write the sequential version as a list comprehension or  call, you can write the parallel version as a  call. Let's say you had a  call that returns some value, and you wanted to run it on , , and :
