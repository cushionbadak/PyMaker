I have a dictionary where each key has a list (vector) of items:This will print:Is there an easier more pythonic way other than creating this "getTotalVectorItems" function? I feel like there is a quick way to do this already.

You are looking for the  built-in with a generator expression:The  function totals the values of the given iterator, and the generator expression yields the length of each value in the lists.Note that calling lists vectors is probably confusing to most Python programmers, unless you are using the term vector in the context of the domain of the problem.
