Natural Text
I know that if I want to get the intersection of two sets (or frozensets) I should use the ampersand . Out of curiosity I tried to use the word 'and' I am just curious why? what does this  represent when used with lists?
 just treats the whole  and  expressions as boolean values. If  is false, it returns . Otherwise, it returns . See the docs for details.Both s (as in your example) and s (as in your question) are false if and only if they're empty. Again, see the docs for details.So,  will return  if it's empty, and  otherwise.
