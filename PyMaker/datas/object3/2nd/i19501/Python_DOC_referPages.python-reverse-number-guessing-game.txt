So I've been trying to figure out a way to write a program where the computer tries to guess the number I am thinking of, instead of the other way around where you are guessing a computer's chosen number. It works most of the time however in some situations it does repeat numbers down the chain even though I've told it before that for example the value I am thinking of is higher than '7'. In some cases it also repeats the same number again even though I tell it its higher or lower. If someone more experienced could have a look at this and tell me what am I missing in these loops it would help a great deal.
 is inclusive, so:and Also, if the user does not enter a valid response,  will never be called again and the program will hang in an infinite loop.Something more robust, but doesn't handle liars:
 returns a number between and including  and . When generating a new random number you should use 
One of your problems, among the others mentioned, is on these lines:You're setting a new bound, which is good, but then you're choosing another random number! What you should be doing, is halving the bound, and asking the user higher or lower from there. Have a look at binary search algorithms.Your program is still going to work (with the other changes mentioned here), but this will guess your number quicker most of the time.There is actually an example of this game on Wikipedia.
Here is my version of this exercise from Michael Dawson's book, I was trying to minimize number of tries, that computer uses. I know code looks dodgy, it is just my 2nd day:)
You get numbers twice because 's boundaries are inclusive;  can return 1,2, or 3. Note that you should also continue to ask the human if the response is neither "higher", nor "lower" nor "You got it!":
