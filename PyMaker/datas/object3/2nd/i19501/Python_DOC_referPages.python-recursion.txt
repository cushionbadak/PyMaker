I have to generate all the possible combinations of letters that represents a number sequence in a telephone... for example: if the entry is '423', the output should be:I must use recursion to solve this... I started using a dictionary like this:But I don't know how can I use a recursion here... Could someone help?I thought something like this to start with:
I think you're looking for :This gives you a bunch of tuples, but you can  them easily.Of course, this isn't recursive and won't help you out if you have other constraining forces (a professor perhaps?).  I leave this answer to demonstrate how powerful the python standard library is and to show that recursion really isn't the best tool for this sort of problem (at least not in python).
If you do not want to use itertools.product and implement it recursively, you can do something like:Then, you can use it as following:
Doing being limited to only using recursion was trickier to get right than I expected -- being somewhat out of practice since Python has several useful built-ins that make doing such things fairly easy. But, FWIW, here it is:Output:
