I'm trying to take a regular expression as an argument to my python program (which is a string naturally) and simply match it against another string.Let's say I run it asI'd like to be able to then take that input (call it input) and say whether or not it matches 'HiTthere' (it should).How should I do this? I'm inexperienced at regex.

Python 3 syntax (Python 2, use  instead of ):Note that I'm using the anchors  and  to guarantee that the match spans the entire input.  matches the start of the string and  matches the end of the string.See the documentation for much more detail.
