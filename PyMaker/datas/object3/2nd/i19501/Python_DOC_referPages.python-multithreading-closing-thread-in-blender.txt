I have a little problem, with a multithreaded python script in blender game engine.It works alright, but when I stop the game, It raises some exceptions and sometimes crashes.The console writes:I would be glad, if someone could find what's wrong with it.Thank you
That's a well-known limitation of Python scripting in Blender.The problem is that Blender tears down Python before your thread. What you can try to do is to somehow register that Blender (or your game) is exiting, notify your thread, and  it from the main thread.
