I am writing a program in Python 3 that will take data from a csv file, make adjustments to it and write the new data to a csv file that will be named by the user.I'm just trying to understand the command line part.I want it to execute properly in this format.I plan to also make it check that there are 3 total arguments.My question is where do this filename inputs on the command line go?Are they saved to a default variable? How can I call these filenames within my python program?
Command line options are stored in sys.argv. You may want to check this:http://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html?highlight=argv#sys.argvBeside, if you need more complex command-line argument parsing and deciding your program logic based on that, you should try argparse
