I am getting a different output in python 2 and 3 when I execute same code for regular expression.Suppose this is the data that I want which is located somewhere in the webpage. So, when I run the below code in python 2.6, it works perfect. I'm getting exact output like above.But when I execute it in python 3.3 like:I'm getting the output of the match variable like:So, would you please tell me that why it's not taking whole string in python 3? Why it's skipping  each time? I want output like python 2.6.So, I am clueless at this moment. I'm waiting for your reply. Thanks.
Seems like  behave differently in  and .According to Python 3 re module docs: - - Matches any character which is not a Unicode whitespace  character. This is the opposite of . If the  is used this  becomes the equivalent of  (but the flag affects the  entire regular expression, so in such cases using an explicit  may be a better choice).Now, since  (equivalent to , that comes after your  is a  character - reference to activestate, so it is not matched by  in Python 3. Whereas in Python 2: - - Matches any non-whitespace character; this is equivalent to the  class .So, it only considers the  character set for matching non-whitespace, and hence it matches .
