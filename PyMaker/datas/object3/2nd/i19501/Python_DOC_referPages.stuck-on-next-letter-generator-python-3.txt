Currently, I am taking some computer science lessons online.  I have been issued the task of writing a program that, upon a valid input, will print the next letter in the alphabet.  Here is my code:Now, I do see the problem with the code, though I don't know how to rectify it.  Basically, on the second to last line of code, I want it to essentially say "if nextletter does not equal { or [ print nextletter". 

You do not need to test for those characters at all. In the code before it you make sure that  is never going to be either  or , if you just assign a different letter to  there:If you still need to make such a test, use the  operator: returns  if the left-hand operand is not present in the sequence on the right. I used a string with two characters in my example, which counts as a sequence:
Use  membership operator:Also note that, you can avoid the third test if you used  construct rather than individual . That way, you can just put the 3rd part in an  block.
While the other answers are correct, the right way of doing what you want is using and :
The problem is that you are asking if nextletter is not equal to the tuple of . You wanted to ask if it is not equal to either "[" or "{". Therefore, you must ask,This will check if it is neither "[" nor "{". Hope this helps
