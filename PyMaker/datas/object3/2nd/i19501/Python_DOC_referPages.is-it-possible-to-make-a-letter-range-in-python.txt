Is there a way to do a letter range in python like this:
Something like:(or maybe:)
You can use  to convert the letters into character ordinals and back:It seems to work just fine:
There is no built in letter range, but you can write one:prints:
result
this is easier for me at least to read/understand (and you can easily customize which letters are included, and in what order):
Emanuele's solution is great as long as one is only asking for a range of single characters, which I will admit is what the original questioner posed.  There are also solutions out there to generate all multi-character combinations: How to generate a range of strings from aa... to zz.  However I suspect that someone who wants a character like range function might want to be able to deal with generating an arbitrary range from say 'y' to 'af' (rolling over from 'z' to 'aa').  So here is a more general solution that includes the ability to either specify the last member of the range or its length.
how about slicing an already pre-arranged list?
Malcom's example works great, but there is a little problem due to how Pythons list comparison works.  If 'A' to "Z" or some character to "ZZ" or "ZZZ" will cause incorrect iteration.Here "AA" < "Z" or "AAA" < "ZZ" will become false.In Python [0,0,0] is smaller than [1,1] when compared with "<" or ">" operator.So below lineshould be rewritten as belowIt is well explained herehttps://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#comparing-sequences-and-other-typesI rewrote the code example below.Anyway, Malcom's code example is a great illustration of how iterator in Python works.
