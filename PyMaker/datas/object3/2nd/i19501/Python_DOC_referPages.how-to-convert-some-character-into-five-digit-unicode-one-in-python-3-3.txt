I'd like to convert some character into five digit unicode on in Python 3.3.For example,but the result is different from what I expected.Do I have to put the character itself, not codepoint?Is there a better way to handle five digit unicode characters?
Python unicode escapes either are 4 hex digits () or 8 (); for a codepoint beyond U+FFFF you need to use the latter (a capital U), make sure to left-fill with enough zeros:(And yes, the U+1D15D codepoint (MUSICAL SYMBOL WHOLE NOTE) is in the above example, but your browser font may not be able to render it, showing a place-holder glyph (a box or question mark) instead.Because you used a  escape, you replaced  in  with two characters, the codepoint U+1D15 (, latin letter small capital ou), and the ASCII character . Using a 32-bit unicode literal works:where again the U+1D15D codepoint could be displayed by your font as a placeholder glyph instead.
By the way, you do not need the  module for this. You could use str.translate:
