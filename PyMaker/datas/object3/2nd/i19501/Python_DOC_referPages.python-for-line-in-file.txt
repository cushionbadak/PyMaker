Is there a way to create a loop in Python that reads a file, line by line, and does an action using the line? For example:which would print  to the terminal
You were so close, all you had to do was  the file:By using a  context manager block, the file is automatically closed when you are done with the loop.
Solution is at : clickI did not write the some codes here, because at link there are many different ways for your question. Have fun.
Just need to open the file in your loop:On Win7 and OpenSUSE 12.1 (and I'm sure others) I've seen python doesn't like the "~" part of the path, so the  fixes that.
