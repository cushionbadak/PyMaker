I've been searching all around for a Python 3.x code sample to get HTTP Header information.Something as simple as get_headers equivalent in PHP cannot be found in Python easily. Or maybe I am not sure how to best wrap my head around it.In essence, I would like to code something where I can see whether a URL exists or notsomething in the line ofSo far, I tried But always got an error
To get an HTTP response code in python-3.x, use the  module:The returned  Object will give you access to all of the headers, as well. For example:If the call to  fails, an   is raised. You can handle this to get the response code:
For Python 2.xurllib, urllib2 or httplib can be used here. However note, urllib and urllib2 uses httplib. Therefore, depending on whether you plan to do this check a lot (1000s of times), it would be better to use httplib. Additional documentation and examples are here.Example code:For Python 3.xA similar story to urllib (or urllib2) and httplib from Python 2.x applies to the urllib2 and http.client libraries in Python 3.x. Again, http.client should be quicker. For more documentation and examples look here.Example code:and if you wanted to check the status codes you would need to replacewithNote, in both examples, if you would like to catch the specific exception relating to when the URL doesn't exist, rather than all of them, catch the socket.gaierror exception instead (see the socket documentation).
you can use the urllib2 library
You can use requests module to check it:You can also check header contents before making downloading the whole content of the webpage by using header.
