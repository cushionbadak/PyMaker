Most Performance Efficient approachYou may also insert the element using the slice indexing in the list. For example:For inserting multiple elements together at a give index, all you need to do is to use a  of multiple elements that you want to insert. For example:Alternative using List Comprehension (but very slow in terms of performance):As an alternative, it can be achieved using list comprehension with  too. (But please don't do it this way. It is just for illustration):Performance Comparison of all solutionsHere's the  comparison of all the answers with list of 1000 elements for Python 3.4.5:Mine answer using sliced insertion - Fastest (3.08 usec per loop)ATOzTOA's accepted answer based on merge of sliced lists - Second (6.71 usec per loop)Rushy Panchal's answer with most votes using - Third (26.5 usec per loop)Mine answer with List Comprehension and  - Fourth (very slow with  168 usec per loop)
