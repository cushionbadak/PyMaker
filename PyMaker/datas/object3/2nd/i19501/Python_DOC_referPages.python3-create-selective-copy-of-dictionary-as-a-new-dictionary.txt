using Python 3.3.0, I created a "dictionary" from a csv-file (header: ):with codeand I wanted to copy the lines with ID = 12345 into a new dictionary, NOT into a file.I really nedded to copy into a dictionary, NOT a list, because I wanted to be able to address the column names directly.I tried this by doingOutput is:My problem:Only the second line with ID=12345 gets copied, the first one is omitted, I don't know why.If I try this by copying into a new list (just for testing purposes), everything works fine:Output is :I don't know why this isn't working by copying into the new dictionary...there doesn't seem to be a method like .add or .append for dictreader.How can I copy my data into a new dictionary without missing any lines ?
What is the expected output? The behaviour is perfectly normal for a ; you are replacing the values for each key with a new value.If you wanted the values to be lists of the values for each matching row, it's easier to use a  with a  factory:This outputs:A  is a subclass of ,so  will print .When you use  you effectively do this:e.g. set each key in  to the value found in the row being processed. When the last row is being processed, it's values overwrite the values of previous rows.If you want to filter out just the rows that match a certain  criteria, then adding them to a list is just perfectly fine. You then loop over the matched results to process them:or you can build a generator filter that you wrap around your  to do the filtering for you, so you don't need to build the list in memory:
