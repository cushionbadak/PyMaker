According to the docs it should work to combine  and  so the following should work in python3.3:test the implementation:so it is obviously not a property, because then it should work like that:Maybe I'm to stupid or it simply doesn't work, somebody has an idea?
If you want  to be a property, you still need to use the  decorator in your implementation:All that an ABC metaclass does is test wether or not you have provided the same name in the concrete class; it doesn't care if it is a method or a property or a regular attribute.Because it doesn't care, it doesn't magically apply  decorators either. This is a good thing; perhaps in a specific implementation a static attribute is enough to satisfy the requirement, and a property would be overkill.The purpose of a ABC metaclass is to help you detect gaps in your implementation; it never was intended to enforce the types of the attributes.Note that before Python 3.3 you can not combine a  with an . You would have to use an  decorator instead. There is an ambiguity there when your property needs more than a simple getter in that case; Python 3.3 covers that case much better (see issue 11610 for the painful details).
