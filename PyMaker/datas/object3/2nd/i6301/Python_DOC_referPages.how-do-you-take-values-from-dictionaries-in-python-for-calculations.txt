I have to answer the following question:8.We have a dictionary containing several rectangular islands:Write code to calculate which island has the minimum area, using your land_rectangle_area function.I have created a function for the area:I am unsure how I proceed with this question from here?
There you go. Just iterate through the islands, finding their area and update your answer if the current area is less than minimum.Output :
You can use Python's  function with your  function as a key to do this:You can find the  the same way:Or, use a list comprehension to transform the tuple into the area:And then take the  of that:Or sort them smallest to largest:(Since Coconut Island and Pineapple Island have the same area, either of them could be considered the  for the function and the sort. You would add another key to be definitive...)Or you can bypass the named function and just use  with a key function:
Think about your problem set:You're given the container already. So now you need to learn how to access its contents.You already know the function to calculate area ().You need to find the minimum area. So you need to keep track of the lowest value.Given that, you should be able to reason out the process (but not necessarily the implementation). In these situations, get out the good ole' pen and paper and write it down:
