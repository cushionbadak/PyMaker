Basically i need some quick help. I'm making a program where I am using two random generators to generate numbers. First generator, between 2-14 each number representing a card. Numbers 11, 12 13, and 14 represent Jack, Queen, King & Ace respectively. Second random generator generating numbers 15-18 to represent the type of card for example 15, 16, 17, 18 would represent Hearts, Spades, Diamonds & Clubs respectively.What the outcome of the generators should come to is the first generator generated a number 8 and the second generator generated the number 17. I then want it to translate this to read: "8 of Diamonds".Here is my code so far:
Try the following, using  and string formats:You could use some  function to generate the numbers, but in this particular case, you can probably get away with hardcoding it. Note that strings are probably the better option as well because you're mixing that with .
