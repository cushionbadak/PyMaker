How do I test how many times a certain number is outside my list of ranges?Example: So, the output generated will be 1 because there is only one range where the value of 1 does not lie within.
Well, those aren't actually Ranges, but two-element lists. You could use manual comparison, as in the other answers, but in my answer I turn them into actual Range objects.Since Python's  constructor is inclusive at  (that is,  is inside the range) and exclusive at  ( is outside the range), you have to add 1 to one of the endpoints if you want them both to be inclusive or exclusive. I assumed you wanted inclusive, so added 1 to the high end point:
You could use  and a generator expression: and  are lower and upper range bounds, respectively.  is a chained comparison, equivalent to . The final return value is the number of times the  expression evaluated to .We can get a slightly longer but more readable solution if we apply De Morgan's laws:Technically, you can use  as shown in other answers, but they will be slower in Python 3 (due to the creation of the  object) and much slower in Python 2 (because Python 2's  creates an actual list, and containment checks on lists are O(n)):
list comprehension should be enough. 
You could try:
Using  :Using  (recommended as it will be faster) :#driver value :
Just a parellel solution:
