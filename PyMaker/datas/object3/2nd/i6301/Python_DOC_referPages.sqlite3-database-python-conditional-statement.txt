What I am trying to do here is pretty simple. I am trying to create user login function. If user type 'y', program will simply ask to put login email. If user type correct email from database, print that customer information. if wrong, print 'not'. I am not sure what is wrong with my code. Can someone help me please?
As I understand,  is an unique field. And your query could return one record or nothing (). TryAlso, such method of parameter pass is incorrect (insecure)usemore info here.
