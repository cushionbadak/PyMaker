What it's supposed to do: take as input an int n, then output a list(or string) of all numbers from 1 to n. After that, I don't know how to explain this in simple words, so I'll just show you.All legal moves(12345)=21345,32145.43215,54321I want a function that when given a list (or string) outputs all the legal moves I can play. I also want to do this again for each of the outputs.So, it should look like this:All legal moves(21345)=...All legal moves(32145)=...All legal moves(43215)=...All legal moves(54321)=...Up to a depth k. I haven't figured out the depth thing yet. And a lot of other things actually.Here is the code:this is the output for n=5:
One way to systematically generate all the legal moves is to use a queue. To do the processing, we pop a game state string from the front of the queue, make a list of the legal moves from that state, and append those new states to the end of the queue. The standard library provides  which is ideal for this task.We also need a set to keep track of states that we've already processed so that we don't needlessly process them again.In this code, I've chosen 4 for the size to keep the output small. Because  it produces all 4! == 24 possible strings.output
