I am trying to implement a customized automata where the transition table looks like:The table is dynamic i.e. the column heading, row name, and data at every cell can be determined at run time. The column name and row name are also necessary.I tried this code but I am unable to access the individual item in the cell i.e. B or 2 from B:2 etc. Then I triedNow, I can access the individual item (B in the above case) but I am lost with the four subscript. Specially, when I do not know the depth of the list in advance. Need to get some help to do it in some easy way. Being a novice, I will appreciate some explanation to the pythonic code. Update: This is Non-deterministic Finite Automata. I tried the automaton package but they are not solving my problem. Following the solution of Tadhg-Mcdonald-Jensen, it give the correct out put for the first row (A) in the table but an error message for second row (B). Here is the code The output is 
Pandas is great at doing tables but you could also move to dictionaries, either way, list is not the data structure you want. Then  will give you the first element, each element will have one or more entries, if you wanted to iterate over the entries you can do Or to iterate over the entire table you could use 3 nested for loops:To be honest I don't understand what the table represents so I can't give you specific advice but I think this would at least be a clearer data structure.
