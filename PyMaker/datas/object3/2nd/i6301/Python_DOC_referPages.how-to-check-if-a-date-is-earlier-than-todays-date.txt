I have a program that runs a Windows "net user" command to get the expiration date of a user.  For example: "net user justinb /domain"The program grabs the expiration date.  I am taking that expiration date and setting it as variable datdIn the example below, we'll pretend the expiration date given was 1/10/2018.  (Note: Windows does not put a 0 in front of the month)Right now, it gives me correct information if datd equals a date in 2017.  I am getting a problem with the year 2018 and on though.  It is telling me that 1/10/2018 comes before today's date of 10/24/2017.Is there a way I change the format of the dates properly so that they are read correctly in this program?I want the output to say that the "Password is not expired" if datd = 1/10/2018
This should do the job for you! Both handling day in format with leading 0 and without it.Use  to make comparision of datetimes just to extent of daily date.Warning: if you would like to be 100% correct and purist take care about timezone related issues. Make sure what time zone is assumed in your windows domain etc.Reference:datetime strptime -  https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior
