How can I check that  is instance of , not , without referencing . I have around 50 classes that subclass some class. I want to check whether instance is a child.Something like .Is there any way?
So I assume that  does something particular that  can't do. Ie it has a method that  doesn't. So one way to check that the instance is from  is to use the following. This will check if that method exists on  if it does. You can treat it as an instance from , otherwise treat it as an instance from . 
It is really hard to use  and judge whether a particular variable  is an instance of a subclass or superclass. What you can in fact do is specify a special property  which can tell you about the instance's class.for example:If you however inherit  with  you can check the behaviour without specifying these properties.PS: I referred this SO question although it is in Java
Not elegant, but seems working: 
You can find the type of an instance using . will give you the specific type of the object.
 checks if the object is an instance of (or subclass of) the class given as second parameter. returns the exact type of the object.So you can check whether the object is an instance of a subclass of , but not  itself, you can do something like the following.For reference:https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#isinstancehttps://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#type
