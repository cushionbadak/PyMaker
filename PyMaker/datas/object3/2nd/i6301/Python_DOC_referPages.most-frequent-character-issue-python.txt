Natural Text
I am trying to Write a program that lets the user enter a string and displays the string that was entered and the most frequently occurring character in the string. The program can treat upper and lower-case characters the same. If there is tie, then both characters should be output. Use the following strings to test the program:The program works as its intended only on "Python programming is fun", but I only get the frequency of the character on the other 2, but not the letter. 
Try using these two lines after getting the input from the user. You need to lowercase all the characters and then strip the whitespace (assuming you are not counting whitespace as a character).
Actually, you are getting the most frequent character.  YOu left spaces in your input; space will often be the most frequent character.  Note the output:See the extra space in there?  The middle one is your most frequent character.Try changing your input conversion line to also remove spaces:Now, the output is
If there is tie, then both characters should be output.If there are multiple letters with the same maximum frequency, then maybe use a list to store those letters.
The alph array is initialised to 0 for all characters from a-z. ord(c) - ord('a')calculates which alph index needs to be incremented
