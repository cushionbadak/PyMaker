How do I use a function or set of functions from another module as a parameter in my own function I'm defining?I'm trying to write a function that compares one vector  and calculates its distance from each vector in a set of vectors . The function  should take the one vector , the set of vectors , and a parameter .  is supposed to take any one of the distance calculations from scipy.spatial.distance and use that for the calculation, so I could call the function something like this:  Here's the scipy reference page -  should be able to take any of the distance functions braycurtis, canberra, ... , sqeuclidean, wminkowski:https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/spatial.distance.htmlAt the top of the  file where this function is located, I've imported scipy.spatial.distance, from which I thought I should have access to functions to use just like distance.euclidean(), but when I call  in the interpreter, I get .I found a lot of answers already like the below that say functions are 'first-class objects' and that I should be able to use them as arguments just like any other argument, and I've tried using the **kwargs concept, but I can't put it all together.Passing functions with arguments to another function in Python?How do I pass a method as a parameter in Pythonhttps://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#keyword-argumentsCan someone help me understand what I'm missing?KNN.py:Here's what I'm doing in the interpreter:
The problem with:is that your attempting to use  to access a function from  whose name matches the value of the string (i.e ), however  will look up a function named  within the  object, which does not exist. To access an object's function by name, you would use , which will return the object attribute matching the string.What you want to do is:
@TheoretiCAL's answer shows you one approach to get desired result and here is another one:
The problem is that  is not the name of anything in the module you're trying to use.  You can use the modules  attribute to "fetch" the appropriate method.
