I'm seeing a behavior that I have no way of explaining...  Here's my simplified setup:module :test for module :If I uncomment the  line I can also see the log from .  Note, it is not a typo, I'm calling  on , not on the  from module .  And if I call  on , I don't see logs.What is this, I can't even?..
In your setup, you didn't actually configure logging. Although the configuration can be pretty complex, it would suffice to set the log level in your example:This will create a simple  with a predefined output format that prints all the log records to the stdout. I suggest you to quickly look over the relevant docs for more info.Why did it work with the  call? Because the  functions all call  internally, so once you have called , you configured logging implicitly.Edit: let's take a quick look under the hood what is the actual meaning of the  functions. Let's take the following snippet:If you run the snippet,  will be not printed (and this is correct so!). Why not? It's because you didn't actually specify how the log records should be treated - should they be printed to stdout, or maybe printed to a file, or maybe sent to some server that will email them to the recipients? The logger  will receive the log record , but it doesn't know yet what to do with it. So, to actually print the record, let's do some configuration for the logger:We now attached a  that handles the record by printing it to the stdout in the format specified by . Now the record  will be printed to the stdout. We could attach more handlers and the record would be handled by each of the handler. Example: try to attach another  and you will notice that the record is now printed twice.So, what's with the  functions now? If you have some simple program that has only one logger that should print the messages and that's all, you can replace the manual configuration by using convenience  functions:This will configure the root logger to print the messages to stdout by adding a  to it with some default formatter, so you don't have to configure it yourself. After that, it will tell the root logger to process the record . Merely a convenience, nothing more. If you want to explicitly trigger this basic configuration of the root logger, issuewith or without the additional configuration parameters.Now, let's go through my first code snippet once again:After this line, the root logger will print all log records with level  and higher to the command line.We did not configure this logger explicitly, so why are the records still being printed? This is because by default, any logger will propagate the log records to the root logger. So the logger  does not print the records - it has not been configured for that, but it will pass the record further up to the root logger that knows how to print the records.
