Here is an alternative to @GiantsLoveDeathMetal's solution with  (also it shows a way to provide us a copy/paste-able piece of code containing a sample of your csv file with ) :EDITED the  to contain data in columns and with empty rowsIn python 2 (and in some cases in python 3 if your code works with a generator, which is not the case in this example), you don't need to convert the result of  to a list.So  can be replaced by the much cleaner . Which can be considered cleaner and more explicit than a list comprehension (or a generator expression).For instance this will work :If you're interested in the  vs list comprehension debate, here you go for more details.
yes indeed Unatiel.sorry, had to create an answer to my own question, apparently 
I think you can try to read it with pandas. Below is sample code where dataarr will be ndarray of numpy type and you can access it using for loop. Access element like this:I hope this help you to solve your problem.
