Natural Text
My task is to turn the input text to acronym and reverse it. The word should be more than 3 characters long and do not contain symbols such as  For example if I have this sentence  the function should return I have done so far:I have problems with  function. How to correctly control the length of words and symbols?
A bit hacky in the sense that a comma is technically a special character (but you want the 'e' from easy), but this works perfectly for your example. Set up the "if" statement in the "for word in words" section.Basically the 'if' condition became if you have word of length > 3 characters AND the word is alphanumeric (then that satisfies all conditions) OTHERWISE (OR) if there is a comma next to the word (there will be len(word)+1 characters) and it will have a comma (,), that still satisfies the previous conditions, then populate the first_letters list. Otherwise, ignore the word.This way you don't even have to set up a check_word function.This spits out the answer'EQT'A couple more examples from my code:** Note that it did NOT include the word 'cow' because it did not have more than 3 letters. ** Note, now the term 'cows' gets counted because it has more than 3 letters.You can similarly add any exceptions that you want (!, ? and .) using the 'or' format:Ex: or (len(word) > 4 and '!' in word) or (len(word) > 4 and '?' in word)The only assumption made for this is that the sentence is grammatically correct (as in, it won't have exclamation marks followed by commas). It can be further cleaned up by making a list of the special characters that you would allow and passing that list into the or clause.Hope that helps!
 finds first letter of every at least four letter wordre docsIf you want to ignore words preceding non-word characters, use  â€“ this also allows a comma explicitly.
