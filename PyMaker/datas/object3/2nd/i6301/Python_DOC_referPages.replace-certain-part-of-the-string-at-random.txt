The problem:There is a string with conditions and I want to replace an operator with other operator at random.The possible solution:It seems a little vague. Could you offer a better way to do it?Thanks.
It's much simpler with  function (with callback replacement function called for every non-overlapping occurrence of pattern):An exemplary output:https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html?highlight=re#re.sub
Edit 1. Well the assumption I made that the OP wanted all the operators replaced was wrong. makes a list out of the string words, excludes spaces.A list is created from the original string with an operator chosen at random to replace any given operator in it. turns the list to a new string including spaces in between the lists elements.Edit 2. I came back to it during my coffee break. This changes one operator.
Replace random occurrence of an operator chosen randomly with a different operator chosen at randomOutput
