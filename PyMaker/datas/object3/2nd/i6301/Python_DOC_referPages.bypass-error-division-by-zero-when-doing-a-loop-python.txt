New using Python :) I am trying to normalise my data using different columns however, it sometimes occur that some columns I am using to make division have value = 0. Which then give me error: ZeroDivisionError by zero.I have one dataframe mergedfs and loop through columns to calculate normalised values.The ZeroDivisionError by zero is usually because sometimes. mergedfs.ix[:,b] AND mergedfs.ix[:,b] will be equal to 0.Is there a way to bypass it?However, no success.I have searched for quite a while on stackoverflow and most didn't work on my code. Thanks a lot if you can guide me a bit to solve this problem.Cheers !
