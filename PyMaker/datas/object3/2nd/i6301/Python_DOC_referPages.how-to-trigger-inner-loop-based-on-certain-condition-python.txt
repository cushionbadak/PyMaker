I'm new to Python, and to programming in general. I've been writing a temperature converter as a way to practice some concepts I've learned. What I wrote so far works ok overall, but I've hit a brick wall on a specific objective I'm trying to achieve:When the user makes an acceptable first choice (either "F to C" or "C to F", as opposed to anything else), they then get the next question, which is the temperature they want to convert. Here also I have made sure that the program does not give an error message and stop when the person enters anything other than an integer or a float, but if and when that happens, I don't want the program to loop all the way to the beginning, but only to the beginning of that particular branch of the decision tree.In other words, when someone says they want to convert a fahrenheit value to a celsius but then type "jambalaya" instead of "78", I want the program to ask them to "enter a value" again within the same "fahrenheit to celsius" selection branch, as opposed to asking them whether they want to convert F to C or C to F, which is what the program is currently doing.(Just a quick note: I DO want the program to keep asking whether the person wants to convert from F to C or C to F, IF the person has successfully obtained a converted value.)Here is the code I have written:How would you amend this code to achieve the result I have described above?
The easiest way to do this is to just add another loop to your program that will keep asking your user to enter a correct value. Once the user does enter a correct value it exits out the loop using .As it's probably easy to tell, this starts to make things cluttered. It would probably be a good idea to take the code for F to C and C to F and move it into its own function.
One thing you could do here is combine your  loop with a .  The maybe new idea is testing the object type. 
Try this , this satisfies all your requirementsIt will keep asking user what type of conversion he/she wants to make until they press qif they don't enter F or C prompts againIf they don't enter float number prompts againcase sensitive is remove means accepts F/f to C/c
For your purpose I suggest you to write separate function to calculate conversion so you can call it recursivelyOutput:
