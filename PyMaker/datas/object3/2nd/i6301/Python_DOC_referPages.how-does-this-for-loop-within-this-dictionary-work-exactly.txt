Natural Text
Currently I'm learning Python text sentiment module via this online course and the lecturer failed to explain in enough detail how this piece of code works. I tried searching each piece of code individually to try piece together how he did it but it makes no sense to me.So how does this code work? Why is there a for loop within dictionary braces?What is the logic behind  before the  then  at the end?What is the purpose behind  within the parentheses? Wouldn't just  do?
1 and 2The line  uses a set comprehension. It builds a set, not a dictionary (though dictionary comprehensions also exist and look somewhat similar). It is shorthand notation forThe  right after the  in the original set comprehension signifies which value to store in the set. In all,  is just a set (with no repeats) of all elements within all containers within the dictionary . Try printing out  and  and compare.3In the function definition,the  means that the local variable with name  gets set to the global variable similarly named , if you do not pass anything as the second argument. This is an example of a default argument.
