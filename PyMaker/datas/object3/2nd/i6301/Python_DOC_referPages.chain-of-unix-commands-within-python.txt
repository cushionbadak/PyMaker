I'd like to execute the following UNIX command in Python:  The date directory  and  are already variables in Python so I have tried variations of  using the  function, but I’m struggling to find documentation for multiple UNIX commands at once, which are normally separated by  or piping with Doing the commands on separate lines in Python doesn’t work either because it “forgets” what was executed on the previous line and essentiality resets.
You can pass a shell script as a single argument, with strings to be substituted as out-of-band arguments, as follows:This is much more secure than substituting your  and  values into a string which is evaluated by the shell as code, because these values are treated as literals: A  of  will not in fact try to delete your home directory. :)
Doing the commands on separate lines in Python doesn’t work either  because it “forgets” what was executed on the previous line and  essentiality resets.This is because if you have separate calls to  it will run each command in its own shell, and the  call has no effect on the later shells.One way around that would be to change the directory in the Python script itself before doing the rest. Whether or not this is a good idea depends on what the rest of the script does. Do you really need to change directory? Why not just write "missing" to  from Python directly? Why do you need the  call?Assuming you're looping through a list of directories and want to output the full path of each and also create files with "missing" in them, you could perhaps do this instead:The above could use some error handling in case you don't have permission to write to the file or the directory doesn't exist, but your shell commands don't have any error handling either.
