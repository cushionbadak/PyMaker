I have list which consists of three parts. In the first and third part, all elements are True. In the second part, all elements are False.I'd like to know the first index of the third part.For example,  is shown after executing the below code. How do I implement  in the below code? I guess I should use , can not find how.
If you say the three parts exist all the time we can use  with  by converting the True & False values to int i.e Sample runs :
Loop over the list, comparing each element with the previous:Here the  argument to the  function determines the number of parts and defaults to 3. 
you can achieve this by iterating over array
check for first instance where the item in list is False, and the next item is True
An algorithm to find the index of the beginning of the third part would be:Split list into partsAdd lengths of first two partsThis can be done using  and :
