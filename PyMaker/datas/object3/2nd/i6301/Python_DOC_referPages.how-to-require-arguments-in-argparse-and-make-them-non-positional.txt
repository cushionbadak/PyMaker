I have a Python script where I would like to force all required arguments to be named (non-positional).So the following should work:But the following should fail:From what I can tell, in argparse if you make something required, it becomes a positional argument, so both of the second examples that I want to fail will succeed (even the second case, with the made up argument!). How do I get desired functionality?
No argument you haven't defined will be accepted as long as you don't call  explicitly.To make an otherwise optional argument required, use the  keyword argument when defining it.
