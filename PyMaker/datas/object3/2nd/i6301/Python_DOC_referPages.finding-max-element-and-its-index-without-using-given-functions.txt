I am trying to find the maximum number and it's index using only  loop and without any Python given function.Here is my code:After looping is finished I get correct max number, but incorrect index. What should I improve?
You were almost there:This assumes that all numbers in  are positive.
Move the  incrementation to the body of the loop and keep the index for the maximum number, e.g:Also, don't name your variable  to avoid shadowing the built-in function of the same name.
This will probably do what you want it to do:Here's an example:
You should indent the line 9 variable index inside the for loop.
