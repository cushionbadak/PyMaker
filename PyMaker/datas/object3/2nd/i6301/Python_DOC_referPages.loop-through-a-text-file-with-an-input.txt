Natural Text
I have a text file set out in this layout:Greg,Computer Science,Hard,5    Alex,Computer Science,Medium,2Fiona,Maths,Easy,0Cassie,Maths,Medium,5 Alex,Maths,Medium,1In my program I want the user to be able to choose a certain name and see their results. My code for this looks like this:A few things are wrong with it though and I can't figure out what to do:If the user entered "Alex", only one of his results will be displayed.If a wrong name is inputted once, every other name inputted will return as "Invalid".If the correct name is inputted and the results are displayed, the program will continue to ask for a name.Does anybody have any solutions to these problems?
If you're going to query your file repeatedly, I'd recommend pre-loading your data once into a dictionary, and printing data as and when needed. Something like this:This solves problems one and two. If you just want to break after the first valid name is input, you can query the return value of :This solves problem three.
You're better off using the  module since your file syntax is simple CSV.Then you can loop through the rows (each row will be an array of values).
