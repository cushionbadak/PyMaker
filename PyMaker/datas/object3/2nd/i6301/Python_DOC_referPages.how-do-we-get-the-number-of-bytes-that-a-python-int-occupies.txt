I am not looking for a constant recording the maximum value representable with an ; I am looking to find out the maximum amount of memory that an  can occupy. Consider the following code:For my particular machine, the output is:Apparently, some s are 24 bytes long, others are 28, still others use 36. How many bytes are required to hold an  of any size?
How many bytes are required to hold any size ?As many as are required. There's no limit on the size of s, they are of arbitrary size as their documentation states.* does not represent the maximum size of  objects. It is the maximum value of a  which is used (in CPython) for holding values of indexes. For example, just create a larger  than  :So, you get the number of bytes for a given  by using  on it. *Bound, eventually, by available memory.
