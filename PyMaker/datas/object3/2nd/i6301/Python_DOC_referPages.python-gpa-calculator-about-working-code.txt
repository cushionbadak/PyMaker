this is a GPA calculator code in my textbook. I'd like to ask about a few this I don't understand here.What does  mean below? Does it create a new array? I tried simpler but it doesn't work.
From  this line:We can see that  is a tuple of two values. Then  unpacks the values in the tuple to two variables, the first to  and the second to . It's a simpler way of doing:From the docs:This is called, appropriately enough, sequence unpacking and works for  any sequence on the right-hand side. Sequence unpacking requires that  there are as many variables on the left side of the equals sign as  there are elements in the sequence. Note that multiple assignment is  really just a combination of tuple packing and sequence unpacking.
Tracing your program we see the following :So we see that  is a . Now this is passed to the function.So as we can see, the values were  from the  and assigned to  &  respectively.It is similar to doing : Note : sorry if its not exactly how it would look on a console. Can't get to my PC, writing it out on my mobile right now. So have put it approximately how it would look.
