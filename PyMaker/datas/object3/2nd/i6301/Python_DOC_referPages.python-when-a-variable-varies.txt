I'm making a basic code for my python bot, but i encountered a problem: let's suppose that i have A variable, since A is a variable that is taken from an API, it's value changes. I want my bot to Print X when A varies of x% (for example, 10%). I know how to make the if statement but the problem is the percentage part, is there a way to tell my bot to print something when the variable changes of 10/20/30%?
Considering the value hold by the variable is of string type: Firstly you should determine the logic based on which you calculate the difference of values. For example, below is the sample code which determine the difference based on two conditions:Value at each index of the older and newer stringIf two strings are of different length, fill the missing characters with '|'. Then calculate percentage change based on the length of bigger string.Sample code:
If the value of  is a number then this will work:Or if you don't want negatives:
