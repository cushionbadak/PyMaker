Natural Text
I am trying to display on screen every item from the list 'magicList' as well as a number in front of that indicating the position so it would look someting like this1) Fireball2) Explosion3) HealI have been able to display it with just the text but i can't seem to do it with the numbers, is my use of the len flawed or is it something else because everytime it try that it returns the error:it's weird that its like this considering pos should be an integer, but if anyone knows what's wrong here i'd love to know.For anyone that is asking why i don't just do it without the numbers, I have to use the numbers because that is how the player will select it, doing this way means i can append a potentially infinite number of items to the list without having to pre-program them all.
I don't see any problem with the len function, I have seen below in the documentation, please see this, it is not obvious to say with out looking at your data, hence sharing this info.Null characters (‘x00’) raise a TypeError. Both Unicode and char (byte) strings are accepted. For Unicode strings only UCS-2 characters (‘u0001’ to ‘uFFFF’) are recognized. Anything greater raises a UnicodeError.See this link for more info https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/font.htmlOne more thing I also suspect casting "str(pos, i) ", because I tried below lines to rule out the root cause and ended up having error "    print(str(pos, i))TypeError: coercing to str: need a bytes-like object, int found"
