I am trying very hard to write a function that will duplicate the first string in a list into 6 places and duplicate the ones that occur at even indices into two places,if it occurs at an index that is a multiple of three, duplicate three times. However, if it occurs at both an even index and at an index that is a multiple of three, it should duplicate it into six places. Here is the code i have written but it seems not to be solving it dynamically as soon as i change input and target more cases i get this error :this printsThis is not the desired output.am expecting it to print But am expected to take care of other cases like this will print.There are also other edge cases similar to this one i already posted.
Just some oneliners...Rather annoying that the first one is the shortest. I like the others better. I found  for factor 2 but nothing that short for factor 3...Edit: Another short one:
You can use the  function to iterate over the index/value pairs of the list. Then just apply your logic to update the values in-place, e.g.:
The solution below is very similar to the above poster, but with a test for length of the list in the beginning and slight difference in the looped conditional. Either work for what you're trying to do.
