Let's say I have two lists  and  as:I want to find the count of the elements of  which are present in .Expected output is 4 because 3 and 4 from  are appearing twice in . Hence, total count is as 4. 
Use list comprehension and check if element exists Better one from @Jon i.e Output : 
You can iterate  list and  occurences of a given number to a  using  method.
You can use collections.Counter here, so a naive and rather ugly implementation first (mine). This doesn't take into account what happens if you've got duplicates in the first list (HT Jon), and a much more elegant version of this would be:
You may use  to achieve this with the generator expression as:As an alternative, you may also use Python's 's magic function to check whether element exists in the list and use  to filter out the elements in the list not satisfying the "in" condition. For example:For more details about , read: What does  do, what can call  function?.
