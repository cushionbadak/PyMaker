Is there a way I can import a list of modules that are contained within a single file just by using one statement without building some sort of method?E.g. large_import_file.pymain.py
If you want to bring in all of methods and imports for large_import_file to the current file's namespace, you'd just do.As silent mentioned in his answer this is covered in Python more on modules
