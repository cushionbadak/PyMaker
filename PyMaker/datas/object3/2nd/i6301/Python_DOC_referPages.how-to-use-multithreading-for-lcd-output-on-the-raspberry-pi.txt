Natural Text
Writing to the 16x2 LCD display on the raspberryp pi can take some time to finish, especially with the module I wrote that automatically scrolls text that exceeds the length of the display.I need to use multithreading, or something similar, to send the output to the display and continue with the rest of the program. I've tried a couple things with multithreading, but haven't quite got it.This is the working code without any multithreading. The method I want to be multithreaded is "TextToLCD.ProcessFrameBuffer".piBell.py
First of all, it would be nice to see your LCD functions.You are using hardware, so hardware is a limited resource. For this you will need some kind of access control, this could be implemented with a Lock Object or Event Object.You have two choices when you used the display:Run the current writing to the endInterrupt the current writing
