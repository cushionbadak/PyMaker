Natural Text
I want to write a text file that has some lines in the following format:And so on... So far I have:Variable and error are floats, and some_name is a string.But I'm getting an error:TypeError: expected a string or other character buffer objectI guess I need to format the  line differently but I can't figure out how. The file only needs to be read by humans, so that actual format can change.Thanks!
If the problem is not the type of  or ,try this:
From the :writes the contents of string to the file, returning the number of characters written.So you can't pass in any number of  separated by  as . This is different to the way  works which excepts any number of arguments and  them for you...So that is why you are getting the :TypeError: expected a string or other character buffer objectHow to fix it:Fixing it is really easy, if you are sure  and  are , you can either: them with :or concatenate them with the  operand:Hope this helps!
