Quick question, I recently learned about functions. But I am a little insecure about the print option. Whats the better option for a nice code if I want to print out a result: to integrate the printoption into the function or to print the function?Option1:Option2:Thank you for your help!
Returning print will return  as print does not return anything, so option 2 will not. Also, functions are not called by putting def in front of them, that is how you define them, so neither Option 1 nor Option 2 will work.In this case, the base way would probably be:
Function print does return None, so you should directly return True or False.
In both the options you are not calling functions. You just defined functionYou have to call function like below
