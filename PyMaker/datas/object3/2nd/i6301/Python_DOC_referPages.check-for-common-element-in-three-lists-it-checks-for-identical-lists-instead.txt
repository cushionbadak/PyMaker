I need to input three lists and make a Boolean check whether there is a common element to all lists. So far it the main part of the code looks like this:I don't know why, but it only returns True if the lists are identical. What is wrong with my code?
You can use intersection of sets for this purpose. As @Reti43 suggested, you can do  instead of  as its a better option for the reasons described in the comments below. In that case, the modified function would look like this: 
Logically you need to return False only after all items were checked and no match was found. In order to do that you need to RETURN FALSE; after the loop done.
