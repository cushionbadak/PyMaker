I am coming from an R background and am now trying to learn Python. At the moment, I am looking at how to do some calculations in Python that I use to do in R. For instance, to get the sum in R, I could do something likeor which gives the correct answer 5064.However, the following code in Python gives me 5060.0.What am I doing wrong?Edit: As suggested by Gregor, the R code can be better written as .
In python, the  generator provides an iterable from  to , as reported in the documentation. To make a sum like that, jou need a  
Its because of the  function. Then last value is not included. So it is to be  not
