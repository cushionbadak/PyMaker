An ugly solution is below (uses os.path.join twice). Can someone fix it (by adding an element to the iterator or to the list in one line :)

Use regexp and cut:
Assuming you have a file in your current dir, you can get it absolute path (starting at root) with :Thes the magic word is  that splits a pathname into the last component and the head (everything in front of it). So to get the absolute path of what comes before  just iterate the components:You can control that  gives as expected Alternatively if you want to use the  module, you can search the  for a specific component:
I found the one-liner finally:wouldnt hve been possible without others answers though. thanks a lot.
