I recently installed  using the following command: . (It's also worth mentioning that I'm following Python's official guide here.) Most online resources seem to indicate that the default installation directory for user-scoped packages is at . However, it would seem that my installation of  resides in . I'm concerned that keeping the installation in a version specific directory (i.e. Python 3.6) could lead to problems down the road. What happened? Should I be worried?
This is entirely correct behaviour, and not something that you need to worry about.Python packages with native compiled extensions are tied to the specific Python version into which it is installed and should not be shared. Because you can't detect a-priori what package will contain native extensions, all Python packages are installed in a version-specific location.The  switch installs in the User Scheme location:With Python 2.6 came the "user scheme" for installation, which means that all Python distributions support an alternative install location that is specific to a user. The default location for each OS is explained in the python documentation for the  variable. This mode of installation can be turned on by specifying the  option to .You can always list your  location by running:(using the same Python binary as tied to your  command).The Python module search path automatically includes the user location, and because that location is Python version (major.minor) specific, won't interfere with other Python versions. is the Mac OS X specific path used when you have a framework build. You can override the path by setting the  environment variable.
