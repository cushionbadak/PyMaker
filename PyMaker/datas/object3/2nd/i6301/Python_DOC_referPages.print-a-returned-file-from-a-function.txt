I just want to print a file that is returned from a separate function:It's prompting for the file, and gives the error and re-promts when an invalid file is entered, but when a valid file is entered, it says that "file" is not defined. It's defined in the open_file function though, and is the returned value... So why doesn't it print?
 is the name of class object. You should use something else;The problem in your code is that you don't save the return code from your function.You don't need to  clause, because you never reach it. You return from the function if there is no exception, and if there is - the else clause doesn't get executed anyway. The try â€¦ except statement has an optional else clause, which, when present, must follow all except clauses. It is useful for code that must be executed if the try clause does not raise an exception.You can do the same with more elegant way;The behavior of iterating with a for loop on a file object iterates the file line-by-line.
First of all, don't use  as a variable. It is a builtin type, like  or . To print the file returned from , you need to use the  function:And an improvement for your  function:
 is a local variable of your  function. It is therefore not available outside of the function. You should assign asign the return value:
