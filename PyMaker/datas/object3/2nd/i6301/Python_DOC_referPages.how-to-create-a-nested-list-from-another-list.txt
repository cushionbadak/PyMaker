I want to create a list  from .I tried  but it's showing only  instead of .
Just initialise a new  which has a  that is .This is done with:which will give:Or alternatively, when you are defining , you can define it already  inside another :Note that when you were trying to  the original  inside another , using  will not work.If you read the documentation:The constructor builds a list whose items are the same and in the same order as iterableâ€™s items. iterable may be either a sequence, a container that supports iteration, or an iterator object. If iterable is already a list, a copy is made and returned, similar to iterable[:]. For example, list('abc') returns ['a', 'b', 'c'] and list( (1, 2, 3) ) returns [1, 2, 3]. If no argument is given, the constructor creates a new empty list, [].The key thing mentioned here is that  creates a  from an . As  is a  already, it is an . This means that the  constructor will treat as an  and create a new  from the  inside  - creating a copy of it. So that is why it wasn't working as you expected it to.
Have you tried?
You'll have to put it in another list using. When you declare a list, you put them in two square brackets. If you want to make a list of lists, you'll have to use them twice. 
This works for me
