Natural Text
I created a nested dictionary that represents a confusion matrix of a POS tagger, and it looks like :which is kinda ugly. I want to save this as a neat matrix format into a txt file preferably without using any library. What is a good way to do this?
Using string formattingPut it in a function that yields strings instead of printing them; iterate over the function writing the return value to the file.
Without using any libraries, you can still create a csv-style output using lists.
Instead of 'reinventing the wheel' use .xml, .json, or .ini. Plenty of libraries are available for these and more. For a simple example check out https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html .
