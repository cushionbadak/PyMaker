I have 2 dictionaries.Required output is a list where if the key is matching the matching key's value will be added to the list. If not matching, a space has to be populated to the list. For example, Age is not available in dict2 and hence the 2nd item in list should be space and the output order should not change. So far i tried using a for loop to find matching keys, but not sure how to populate spaces for non-matching values and to maintain the order in dict1.Any help would be highly appreciated. Thanks in advance
You could just use a list comprehension to iterate the keys from  and  the corresponding value from  or  as a default.Note: Using Python 3.5 here, so 's order gets messed up. Using :

This code gives us common and uncommon keys between these two dictionaries. You can use them as you want. For your specific case, you can use one for loop:output: If the order is important to you, then you have to use ordered dictionary as mentioned by @tobias_k. (Using Python 3.5)
