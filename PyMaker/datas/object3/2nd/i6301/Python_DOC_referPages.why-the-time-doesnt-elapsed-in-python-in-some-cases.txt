I run the following python code:It seems that the time doesn't elapsed, however using explicit sleepor using longer tasksbehaves as expected, the time has been elapsed.What is the phenomenon? When I should expect positive result of difference of two time() stamp?(Tested with python 2.7 and 3.5)
First of all, you are putting all expressions on the same line, with a an expression that has been constant folded; the division is not calculated between the  calls:Those  calls and the  take hardly any time at all.Next, the  clock probably doesn't have the resolution required to capture the short amount of time those 3 opcodes inbetween take. From the  documentation:Note that even though the time is always returned as a floating point number, not all systems provide time with a better precision than 1 second.Pick a higher-resolution clock. Or you could use the  callable, which should be set to the highest-resolution timer for your platform:If you wanted to run time trials on snippets of Python code, to compare their performance, say, then you should be using the  module anyway.
