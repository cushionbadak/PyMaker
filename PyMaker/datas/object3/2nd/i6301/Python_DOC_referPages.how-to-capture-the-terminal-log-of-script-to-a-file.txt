But unable to do so.I want to do this using  only not using any  or  scriptingI have done like below in my :This part of code in the  prints both  and  to a outfile.How can I capture the whole terminal output to a single file.
If you're okay with the requirement of having  in your , then I'd call another python process to run your main script. In your top-level script, use the  to start your desired script in a child process. Then use  to get the output streams from the process (and probably pass any command-line arguments into the process).You might even be able to redirect all std* output to files just with Popen, but this really depends on your needs and whatnot.  seems pretty useful for what you might want to do.subprocess.Popensubprocess.Popen.communicate
You can use something like this in your code:        You could also look into this: Subprocess
