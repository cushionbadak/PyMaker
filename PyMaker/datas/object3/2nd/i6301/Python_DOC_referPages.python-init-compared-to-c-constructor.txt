I have worked with Python for about 4 years and have recently started learning C++. In C++ you create a constructor method for each class I I was wondering if it is correct to think that this is equivalent to the  function in Python? Are there any notable differences? Same question for a C++ destructor method vs. Python 
Yes, Python's  is analogous to C++'s constructor. Both are typically where non-static data members are initialized. In both languages, these functions take the in-creation object as the first argument, explicit and by convention named  in Python and implicit and by language named  in C++. In both languages, these functions can return nothing. One notable difference between the languages is that in Python base-class  must be called explicitly from an inherited class  and in C++ it is implicit and automatic. C++ also has ways to declare data member initializers outside the body of the constructor, both by member initializer lists and non-static data member initializers. C++ will also generate a default constructor for you in some circumstances.Python's  is analogous to C++'s class-level . Both are static class functions which must return a value for the creation to proceed. In C++, that something is a pointer to memory and in Python it is an uninitialized value of the class type being created.Python's  has no direct analogue in C++. It is an object finalizer, which exist also in other garbage collected languages like Java. It is not called at a lexically predetermined time, but the runtime calls it when it is time to deallocate the object. plays a role similar to C++'s destructor, in that it can provide for deterministic cleanup and a lexically predetermined point. In C++, this tends to be done through the C++ destructor of an RAII type. In Python, the same object can have  and  called multiple times. In C++, that would be accomplished with the constructor and destructor of a separate RAII resource holding type. For example, in Python given an instance  of a mutual exclusion lock type, one can say   to introduce a critical section. In C++, we create an instance of a different type taking the lock as a parameter  to accomplish the same thing. The Python  and  calls map to the constructor and destructor of the C++ RAII type.
The best you can say is that  and a C++ constructor are called at roughly the same point in the lifetime of a new object, and that  and a C++ destructor are also called near the end of the lifetime of an object. The semantics, however, are markedly different, and the execution model of each language makes further comparison more difficult.Suffice it to say that  is used to initialize an object after it has been created.  is like a destructor that may be called at some unspecified point in time after the last reference to an object goes away, and  is more like a callback invoked at the end of a  statement, whether or not the object's reference count reaches zero.
I was wondering if it is correct to think that this is equivalent to  the  function in Python?No. Just by looking at the structure of the statement you can understand. Indeed,  is a reference to the instance. Therefore, the instance must be constructed before  is called. See this for more information ( is actually what you're looking for) Same question for a C++ destructor method vs. Python No.  only exit the Runtime context related to the object. In this case, what you are really looking for is .See this, which clearly state:Called when the instance is about to be destroyed. This is also called  a destructor.
