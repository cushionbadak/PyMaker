Why is this  not being caught by exception ?
You have to enclose the list of exceptions in parens/brackets:
Python 2 does not allow specifying multiple exceptions in the same  clause this way. You might expect the  to create a tuple of Exceptions (which would be valid, as bernie demonstrates), but that's not what happens.Looking at the language spec, we havewhere the comma is interchangeable with .In other words, the following two except clauses are equivalentThis catches a , and gives it a name of . So, in your code, you're catching a  and giving it a name of .To overcome this ambiguity in Python's grammar, and specify multiple exceptions (kudos to Artyr and Downshift for explaining this), you must use parentheses to force it to be interpreted as a single expression (to be interpreted as a tuple of exceptions), rather than AS expression COMMA identifier.Again, the above two expressions are equivalent, and assign the caught exception to the variable . Notably, the form with a comma was removed in Python 3, making the language grammar a bit less confusing!
