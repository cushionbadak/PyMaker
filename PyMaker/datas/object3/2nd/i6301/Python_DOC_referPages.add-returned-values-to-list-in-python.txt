Natural Text
When I print this I get:When really what I want is:How would I be able to iterate through my returned values and add them to the list? 
Rather than manually look for text (which can easily lead to false positives), use the  module to build an abstract syntax tree, then extract function names with that:This finds all function objects anywhere in the source code, just like your search for  text would have. Except this skips commented out code or the word  in a string literal, for instance.
