Sockets have no concept of "messages" as you are using them. If you put  then  onto the socket, it's chance (helped by doing a local connection) that when you do a  that it shows up as just  and not .You need to either parse the stream into the messages yourself (store data received), or add a layer of something that has messages (like HTTP or ZMQ).If you want to host files,  can do that for you.
