I can get this for a config consisting of just CONF_A and CONF_B (see below), but I'm not sure how to also enumerate each of the CONF_C elements.N.B. The keys for CONF_C elements should be the 'CONF_C1' and 'CONF_C2'---- edit ----@Patrick.Haugh provided this answer for the first part of the question:This works for getting the cartesian product, however I still need to get the keys back in. When I do the following:I get the keys CONF_A, CONF_B, and CONF_C. However the values are in reverse order, e.g.Additionally, I'm trying to figure out how to ensure that the keys for C match up with the CONF_C values, i.e.
