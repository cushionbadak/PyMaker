This is from this source code I am trying to understand. I am new to python and am trying to convert this whole application to .NET. Thanks a lot for any help.
Your snippet filters a dictionary by key.in C# this would look like:
 comprehensionIt's a comprehension that returns a . Essentially, it iterates a pair of values through  and then creates a  (key -> value mapping) out of it.Let's say  is . Then,  will iterate with the following: filters the comprehension. So if  were, say, , it would only iterate through  and .Then, the final dict is:
This is dictionary comprehension. Some five lines of code can be written in a short form like this
From a high-level perspective, the one-liner you provided updates a dictionary  instance (i.e. ) and removes the elements that are not in , effectively filtering .Basically there is a dictionary , and what is being done is that each key-value pair  in  is checked and a new dictionary instance that only includes the key-value pairs for which the key  exists in  is created. Finally, that newly created dictionary instance is assigned to . The formal name of this technique is dictionary comprehension.The following code, which may seem more familiar to you, is equivalent to what you have given in your question.
