My code is as follows:When I try to run it, the program doesn't give me a chance to input.I get the following traceback message:Can someone tell me the reason and how I can make input to test my program.Thanks a lot.
 will read  until it hits EOF. Normally, this happens when that stream is closed by the other end (i.e. by whatever provides input).This works if you run your program like . But it will just keep reading endlessly in interactive mode when  is connected to your terminal, so the only way to close it from the other end is to close the terminal.Strictly speaking, you can make  stop by inputting a EOF character on a line by itself which is  in Unix and  in Windows -- and this works in a regular Python console. But in IPython, this technique doesn't work: here in Windows, I see  as  and  as a blank line and neither stops the read (whether this is a bug or by design is another question).So,Use  instead to input a single line, orif you require multiple lines of input, use something that puts a limit on how much is read from :This way, you're able to stop the program from asking for more input by entering a blank line.finally, there's  which allows you do invoke different code depending on whether the input is interactive (but for your task, this is probably an overkill).
