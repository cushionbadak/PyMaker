So I want to be able to remove and add items in an inventory that I tried creating in my game but I keep receiving an error. This is my code:this is the error that I receive when I run my game:(pick up razor)You walked over and picked up your razor blade.It's been added to your inventory.
Your error is occurring because  has no parameters in the function definition, but you are trying to pass  as an argument to it. That's what means.Also, you are using the list  method, but you are making inventory a dictionary.Here are two options that you could use depending on the functionality desired, one for the dictionary and one for the list.
