I've just installed Python 3.7 and faced an error with dir() in  module. Please consider this minimum example.1) Create a module  that has one line:2) in python:results in this error in Python 3.7and runs normally in Python 3.6:I understand that dir() expects  to be a function but in the docs this is not a must but rather a condition and the docs provide no difference in respect to 3.x vs 3.7. Why the behaviour is different? Is it a bug or a feature?Thanks!
The relevant PEP (PEP 562) actually contains the specification:The  function should accept no arguments, and return a list of strings that represents the names accessible on module:If present, this function overrides the standard dir() search on a module.The difference is that  in a module was simply ignored until Python 3.7. Given that double underscore names must be used according to Pythons specification it's not necessary to include a deprecation (for the changed behavior) there because  as string was simply not according to the specification.
Python 3.7 now also allows  to be defined on modules. Previously it was simply ignored. The conditional part is that if  is defined, it must be a callable, but it is not required to be defined.
