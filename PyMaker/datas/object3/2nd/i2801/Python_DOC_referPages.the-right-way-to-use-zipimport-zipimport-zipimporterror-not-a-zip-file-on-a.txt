I have managed to use this module without installation - just import it from path to use , It seems possible in Python to use  to directly use the zip archive of the module without extraction, I wonder what is the right way to use , a simple trying like the following just gives the exception . I downloaded the file from here , the file  does exist and isn't corrupted. 
(This is the suggested way of action that answers your question: "The right way to use "; see further below for the immediate cause of your error.)You shouldn't use  directly. Instead, you should add the  file to  -- it will be used as if it was a directory.That said, the file you downloaded is a source distribution -- it has a  in root and the actual modules in a subdirectory. To use the module, you need a built distribution instead.Telling all about source and built distributions is beyond the scope of a single answer. One possible way to go is to:unpack the make a wheel using its  with  andinstall it with Debugging with Visual Studio shows that this is the code that it chokes on:,:As you can see, it reads and validates the last 22 bytes of the file as an "end of central dir signature".The spec says:4.3.1 A ZIP file MUST contain an "end of central directory record".<...>4.3.6 Overall .ZIP file format:4.3.16  End of central directory record:As you can see, this "End of central directory record" is 22 bytes.. without the comment. And this file does have a comment:So this is a bug. Here's a relevant ticket.
I have downloaded the file and have the same exception, though file seems to be legit.Maybe you should use  instead:
