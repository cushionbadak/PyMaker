Suppose I have a function that returns a tuple:I have a list of values that I'd like to apply the function on and then turn the results into a dictionary:I've come up with two ways to do this:or:However, none of these is very readable. Furthermore, if the  is humongous I don't want to create extra copies. Is there any better (efficient?) way to do this assuming I have very long list of values and  is an expensive function?
You can also use the  initializator that takes an iterable of key-value tuples. So this would be perfect for your function that already returns a tuple:In general though, having a function that returns a key-value tuple with the identical key seems somewhat rare. Most commonly, you would just have a function that returns the value. In those cases you would use a dictionary comprehension like this:
Just convert the result of  to  directly
