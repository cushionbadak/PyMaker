I have a 32x32 matrix of float numbers. I want to get a sum of all the elements in it. But when I use loop:I get 2.795541576006144e-13And when I use NumPy  method:I get 3.197442310920451e-13The results are pretty different, so which is right?P.S. can't show the array I use for an example above, because it says my post is mostly code
They are both correct. Please see that it is such small number that in both cases it is almost zero (because of e-13 part).Please see this post about floating point arithmetic issues and limitations: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html
