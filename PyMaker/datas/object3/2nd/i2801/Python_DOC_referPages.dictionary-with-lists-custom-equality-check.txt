Say, I have two lists:and If I do a  it returns ,If I check , it returns .Now, I have two objects:and  is True, irrespective of the order of keys.But if how do I test the equality? Obviously,  returns False.  will have , so  is kind of waste check. I should have probably overridden the equality method for the object, or use some library. Is, is there any way to write idiomatic python code for deep equality?
 each element in the dict if it is of type  and then compare
If you are only interested in an equality check, consider using . You could just apply a custom comparator to all the dictionary values:A more elegant way might be to factor out the comparator into a separate function and check against something more general, like :This has the advantage of not storing all the intermediate sorted products. If, on the other hand, you need to do the comparison frequently, it may be better to transform your dictionaries before using regular :Notice that I used a loop instead of a comprehension here. That way, your dictionary is transformed in-place, rather than allocating a whole new hash table.
