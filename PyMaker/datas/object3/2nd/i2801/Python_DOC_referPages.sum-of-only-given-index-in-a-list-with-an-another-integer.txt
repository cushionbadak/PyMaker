I want to sum the particular index in this listWhen i try to execute i get:The expected Output is:Can anyone help me out to get me my expected output?
Use  and list comprehension
Python lists do not work like that.  Just use a loop over the indices.Or, use numpy arrays, which do support that syntax exactly:
What you're hoping is NumPy indexing. This, however, requires the 3rd party NumPy library:In pure Python, you can use a list comprehension. To save having to repeat indices, you can define a  object:
First, I'll answer the question as to why that fails. You're taking a  of your array . Which translates to,Then you say,  which is equivalent to  but what does that mean to Python? Do you want to append  to the list? Do you want to add  to the first element? The second?Are you starting to see the ambiguity here? As others have pointed out, this behavior is defined for numpy arrays but not for vanilla python.There are many solutions for this but IMO the following is the clearest solution.However, the most pythonic would involve a list comprehension which you can see in other answers but IMO that seems a little advanced for you.
