I'm having a hell of a hard time trying to figure out why my  is printing . Any ideas?When I run this code, I getAny ideas? I know I'm not saving the Nodes anywhere but my mind can't wrap around it.Any help would be appreciated, thanks!
Statementcreates  object with  set to  &  set to  (default argument), so when you're getting its  it returns .If you want to create  objects and then re-use them -- you should store them in some sort of container.Assuming that field is a hashable unique identifier of ,if  has been created and we're passing different  -- old  persistsI see at least 2 approaches here:Create container on the top level, explicitly add s to it upon creation and access them using it afterwards likegives usExtension of previous approach: restrict s creation using global function which caches already created ones:(note: here we're using "hack" with mutable default argument, more info may be found in this thread)Then everywhere when we need to create/access  object -- we should use this function only likethis will give us the same output as before.Further improvementschanging If our assumption about  being persistent turns out to be wrong -- we can simply add changing of  if it was passed like:in first approach:in second approach: set  parameter's default value to  and check if it was specified likeinheriting from If we're working in Python 3 -- there is no need to specify  as base class, it will be set by default (see this thread), so instead ofwe can simply writeuse -loop instead of We don't need to use -loop & increment  by hand when we have -loop and  objects, so instead ofwe can writealso I think here is a typo, because we're skipping case with  equal to , so we can fix it:finally we can see that there is no need in  index when we can use  built-in & iterate over pairs of  &  s elements like
