I have a python script running on python 3.6.4 locally buy trying to run it on a system with python 2.7. I cant seem to import timezone module.  I can't seem to install the timezone module.  is there an easy way to import that module or modify the scripts to not need it? my only two references to that module are below. 
1) for the reason: as outlined e.g. in this answer  works only from Python 3.2 and later versions2) for fixing: I would use a quick snippet like the following [check this other answer as reference]:
First, you're not importing a  module, you're importing the  class out of the  module. So, trying to install a  module, even if there were such a thing, wouldn't help anything.Meanwhile, as the docs say, the  class was added in Python 3.2, so you don't have it in 2.7.There used to be a backport of the  module from around Python 3.4 to 2.7, which would have solved your problem, but it seems to have been abandoned years ago.So, that leaves modifying your code so that it doesn't need .Fortunately, the only instance of  you're ever using is the UTC one, and that's pretty easy to work around.A  class is just a pre-built implementation of a  class. In 2.x, you have to implement your own  class. But the trivial  example in the docs happens to be exactly what you want:Now, everywhere you used , just use  instead, and you're done.
