Natural Text
I have a text file as mentioned below:I want read this text file and create a nested dictionary which will be used in my subsequent program.Note: Code should remove the rows with 'nan' KEY values
You can use  to create a list of OrderedDicts from your data file. Then you can rearrange and transform your data to make the nested dictionary to meet your requirements. Here is an example using dictionary comprehension. EDIT: If all you need is the  values as posted in Tanmay's solution then this does the same with a lot less code. EDIT 2: casting valuespprint(results)    pprint(results)
You could use  module like this. If you need to check if KEY value is number, create corresponding function:
things that you will need to do to achieve your goal arefirst you need to how to open file(assuming its .txt file containing comma separated values)then you would want to split string(line) using ',' as delimiters for that you would have to do  this will give you list.here you will find list of all the strings in line 1 of your text file.okay I have decided to add code but please don't copy paste try to understand it google or go to python docs look what each inbuilt function do.
