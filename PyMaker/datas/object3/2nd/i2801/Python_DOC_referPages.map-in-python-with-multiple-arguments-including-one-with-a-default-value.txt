I am using Python3.6 and am trying to figure out ways in which we can use  with multiple arguments.When I run,  returns  as expectedHowever, when I specify a default value for z, returnsWhy does Python differ in the way it runs  in the two scenarios?
When you set the default value of z during execution with map this happens:Therefore your output, for map to work as you intend you should explicitly give the list as one of it arguments and in your case the default value of z is not a direct argument of map. Hope this makes sense. 
Try:Then  would be: Explanation:Your code doesn't work because you're multiplying a number with a list (so basically it will be a list repeated n times), you need to get always the next value, so do  to the  of the listSee: Python: next() function
I think it should use  rather than .This link explain difference between  and .Using  it should beAccording to this doc. is roughly equivalent to:
