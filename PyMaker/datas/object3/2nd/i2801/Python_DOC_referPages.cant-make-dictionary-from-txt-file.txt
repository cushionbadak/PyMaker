So I defined a blank dictionary called library globally. I already know how to save a dictionary to a txt file.The output of the txt file looks like this this (it's called bookList0.txt):I made a function to load this file:If i use this function it says "Library successfully loaded!". But when i type  in the console it only shows .However, if i type  then  in the console and then again  in the console it gives me the dictionary that is in the file. So that way it works.And i don't know why is this not working in a function, but works in the console. Thanks for the help!Update: I tried loading with the json module but still it doesn't load anything. Here's the code that i wrote for json:Problem solved! This is the code that seems to be working: 
It seems to me that you have not a clear understanding of Python's name scopes.I have written a little script where I have (mutatis mutandis, i.e., no external files involved...) two different  definitions,  that, like in your code, has no  statement and  that has a  statement, and where I have invoked in different ways these two functions, i.e., without or with a corresponding assignment, and in each of these four cases the script prints its idea of the value of .Here I have the results of executing the script that I have preparedI hope that, studying the code and confronting with the output, you could get a better understanding of name scopes in Python.ps, all that was told in comments, about the use of  and the opportunity of using the  module stands on its own and you should try to incorporate the suggestions you've received in your code.My example is only addressed to one side  of the problems you're facing, namely the one that puzzles you at the moment...
