html.escape() and .unescape() are not symmetrical. According to the docs, escape only converts &, < and >, whereas .unescape handles "all named and numeric character references". How can I escape all characters that .unescape() unescapes?Current behavior:Desired Behavior:
The documentation you linked to links to this:As another poster pointed out, you probably don't really want to escape everything, since there are entity names, or at least numeric escapes, for every character.Given the above mapping, however, you can certainly create your own function that goes through a string character by character, and either keeps the original character or replaces it with an entity from the above dictionary. Just choose which characters, or ranges of characters, you most want to represent in entity form rather than character form.
