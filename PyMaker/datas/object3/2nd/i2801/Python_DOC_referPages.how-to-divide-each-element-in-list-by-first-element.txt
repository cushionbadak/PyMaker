Lets consider some list:I need to divide each element of list by its first element.It can be done with list compehension:but I have to use some functional programming for this
:Or as a function:Or use numpy:and if you want list:
You can use the built-in function  in combination with the class : returns an iterator that applies a function to every item of iterable, yielding the results. takes an iterable in order to produce a list.
Use :And if you don't like the  expression, you can use the  (or ) method in , but two parameters are required so here I used a little trick.I first build a new iterable according to the question, and then use  which can  multiple parameters to a function.  in  has exactly the same functionality as operator  but just make it run in a function way and accept two parameters and return the div result between them.
