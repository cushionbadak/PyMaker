I want to create an empty file in python.Currently I am using  but I've seen a lot of people use .I did some research and it seems that  uses tools from the OS you are using (hence its library name) and that  is the "pythonic" way of creating an empty file.What is the difference, in terms of speed and implementation between these two methods?Would you recommend any other, more reliable or faster method to create an empty file? 
you probably want to create regular files with  like this:Well, don't since it's not portable (Unix only). Stick to  when you can (even if  is probably called behind the scenes on unix when creating a file, the performance difference is very small)You can check another Q&A (Creating directory with mknod()) where the answer hints at the non-portability of .Another possible difference (didn't check that point) is that if the file already exists,  may return an error/exception, while  happily opens the file if the permissions allow it.Don't forget that methods from  package are OS dependent. Using them sometimes ties you up with the system you're running on (even if it's safe to assume that  and  are available, with - of course - implementation differences).Also note that  does not necessarily create an empty file. If the file exists and the permissions are right, it just does nothing ( is for append).To open with truncation and remain 100% portable, use A slightly faster way is to open in binary without buffering: For speed and reduced risks of non-portability:  is also an option since it's lower-level, and supported on all python environments that provide :
