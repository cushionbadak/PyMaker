SummaryI have a .csv file that contains values with temperatures and a timestamp when the temperature was measured. What I want to do is to find time periods where the value goes done below a specific value. I wanna do it without a database, I know it is easy with mysql or something else. This is a private project to learn statistics with python. DatastructureOne file contains 720 Entries for everyday. What is my idea?The functions  and  are not implemented yet, because I found a mistake in my thoughts. When I ran the code and just printed the values I found out that also the periods within the periods where also defined as a period. What are  my questions?How to skip the periods within periods?Is there a library I could use, to solve this problem more easily?
as suggested above, pandas is the library you need, but if you want to do it with a loop on the lines you can still add a boolean to forget to add start while you are on a periode:
