I want to check when the  object comes closely to any of the  objects in order to print a notification message. By "closely" I mean the distance of 20 pixels between the  and the border of . For example, something like "distances_list = worker.get_dist(fences)", where "distances_list" would contain the current distances to all fences.I could adopt the approach proposed here, but maybe there is some built-in function for my task?In  we can use different collision detection functions, but in the case described above there is no collision. Is there any built-in function to find the distance between the sprites?
Here's this solution ported to pygame. The y-axis in pygame is flipped, so I had to swap the  and  variables and the distance can be calculated with . You need to pass the s of the two sprites to  where they will be unpacked into the  (top left) and  (bottom right) variables. (You can see the distance in the window title.)
