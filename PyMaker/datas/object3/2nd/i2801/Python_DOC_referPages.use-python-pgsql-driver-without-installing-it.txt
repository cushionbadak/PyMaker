Is there anyway I can use any pgsql driver without actually installing it? I see  is most commonly used for connecting to PGSQL database but that need installing and The issue I have here is I need to distribute the code but the we are not allowed to install anything on the server. Anything standalone (e.g. including the driver/library files in a directory along with my scripts) but that's the only thing I can do. Is there any way I can  psycopg2 from a local directory?Thanks in advance!
Yes, you can import modules from local files - you can even import whole python files of your own if you want. You can download the source code and put it onto your system by using a USB stick (if permitted). However, you will still have to install it which may not be possible depending on your situation. If this is for homework or a school project, I recommend only using files or libraries you create or are provided with. You can read more about Python imports here https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html Best of luck.
