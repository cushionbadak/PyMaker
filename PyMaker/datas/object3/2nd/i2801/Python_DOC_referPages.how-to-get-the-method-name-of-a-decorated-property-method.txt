Lets say I have a method which I decorate with .Is there a way to get the underlying name of the decorated method?How could I for instance print the name of the property when it does not have a  attribute?I'm trying to do a RPC call and everything works for methods and static functions but not this.
A property has the following attributes: fget, fset and fdel, which are references to the getter/setter/deleter functions.So, you can get the  of each of this functions (if not )Demo:
i think if use decorator @property you can access your function with name of function and you can give return value.
If you use  in your decorator, the decorated function will have the  of the wrapped function.IF you had some sample code for the decorator in your question, I could show more precisely how to do this...
