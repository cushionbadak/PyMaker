I have an django app route that will run a pytest.main() command if some conditions are met: I would like to include a unit test that validates  has been executed. What is the best approach to doing this? Mock and unittest are new to me.I tried messing around with stdout:but this returns: 
Here are two example tests that verify that  is invoked when a valid test name is passed and not invoked otherwise. I also added some different invocations of  as an example; they all do pretty much the same, with extra check for args that were passed on function call. Hope this helps you to write more complex tests!
