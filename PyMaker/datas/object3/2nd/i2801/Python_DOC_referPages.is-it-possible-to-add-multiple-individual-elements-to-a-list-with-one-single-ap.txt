Using Python, I would like to be able to add multiple values/elements/items to a single list without having to repeat the .append method Here is an example of what I mean. Review the following Python function:The --  singleList.append(list_element) -- statement must be repeated each time. Is it not possible to do something more like this:...and still end up with: Every way that I try to do this, I get the following error.TypeError: append() takes exactly one argument (3 given)I understand that .append() can only accept one argument, as per the error message. Is there an alternative way around this, or do people just repeat the .append() statement for each argument/element/value/item?P.S. anyone know the correct term for: argument/element/value/item?
You can do or equivalently which is syntactic sugar for  and where Python interprets the  using the  method, more details can be found here if you're interested. As pointed out in the comments, this will mutate the list in place, so you can't use it directly in a  or  statement. 
You have mainly two options: 1) Use : 2) Concatenate your list with another list: They are quite close in performance:
