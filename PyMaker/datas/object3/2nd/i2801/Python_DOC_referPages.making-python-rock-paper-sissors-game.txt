Hey I am new to python and am making a game of rock paper scissors, how ever the condition is that the users have to select 15 options(rock,paper,scissors) which will be then played against the opponent in the order they were placed. I have made the game for a single turn but am not sure how I can code 15 attempts and then compare them to the opponents 15 attempts. Also the user is not required to attempt 15 times he can attempt less but choose to lose the times he didn't attempt. The player with the most points will win. What can I code in python to be able to make 15 attempts and compare in order of choice. Thank you a lot in advance I really need helpjust to clarify I want to explain that im not really looking an answer on exactly how to do it but rather direction on what to learn and focus on such as loops and lists as i'm stuck on what to learn and where to learn it.
I would make a  for both player one and player two. I'm assuming they would both be using the same computer.Use a  to add to the array, in which you take user input.Then iterate through the lists and compare them, can be done with yet another . This could be done with a function.
