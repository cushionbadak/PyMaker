I have a question for the below code,  which is basically a function taking 2 parameters one is a column and one is a dataframe, and I'm having a hard time to understand the for loop iterating over the column and checking if values in the column is keys in the empty dictionary "langs_counts", how is it possible to check when it's an empty dictionary, please explain to me the for loop and why we put 'entry' between square brackets. 
why we put 'entry' between square brackets?the thing in the square brackets is called a key.It is just a simplification for indexing:example code :a = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': [1, 2]}a["d"] = 5 in the machine it becomes: a.__setitem__("d",5)if "d" does not exists as a key, it will create one.If it does,the function assign a new value to it
