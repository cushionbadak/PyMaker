Natural Text
I'm trying to read a txt file where a username and password is stored, separated like so:And have python input the two into separate text boxes, essentially a basic "remember me" system for logging in.  changes the foreground color of a widget to a different color if  is run.If the .txt is empty, it should not run , and pass.The code I have here does not give me any errors, but it does not input anything into the text box, nor does it change the color of the button.Everything in my .txt file is formatted to fit the code, so what seems to be the problem?
Assuming that the  in your code is right:First of all, you should try using with statement, as it assures of properly opening and closing a file.Second of all, well, you  your file twice. What it does is on the first read it moves the cursor at the end of the file, and then if you read once more, it just reads nothing. So that's why your other function is not being called.Then, doing the comparison like this:  is not usually the best idea, because your file may contain whitespace like spaces, tabs or newlines. What you can do is  the string you've just read.Lastly you can get rid of the useless  case with . Just check if it's not empty -> if it's not, do your saving, if it is, just don't.Here's how I would write it:So this function is reading and checking. You should really follow the DRY rule, and pass the text you've read to you other function: Like this:
