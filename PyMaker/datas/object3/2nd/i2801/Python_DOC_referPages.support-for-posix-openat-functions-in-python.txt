There is a patch to add support for the POSIX  functions (and other  functions like ) to the python standard library that is marked as  with resolution , but the ,  and  modules do not currently include any of these methods.These methods are the standard way of solving problems like this in  and other languages efficiently and without race conditions.Are these included in the standard library currently somewhere? And if not, are there plans to include this in the future.
Yes, this is supported by passing the  argument to various functions in the standard  module.  See for example :Open the file path and set various flags [...]This function can support paths relative to directory descriptors with the dir_fd parameter.If you want to use high-level file objects such as those returned by the builtin  function, that function's documentation provides example code showing how to do this using the  parameter to that function.  Note that  and  are entirely different functions and should not be confused.  Alternatively, you could open the file with  and then pass the file descriptor number to  or to .It should also be noted that this currently only works on Unix; the portable and future-proof way to check for  support is to write code such as the following:On the other hand, I'm not entirely sure Windows even allows opening a directory in the first place.  You certainly can't do it with /, which are documented to fail if "the given path is a directory."  To be safe, I recommend only trying to open the directory after you check for  support.
