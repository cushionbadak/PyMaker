This question already has an answer here:A get() like method for checking for Python attributes                    3 answers                How to know if an object has an attribute in Python                    11 answers                Background is I'm getting data from a JSON API where lots of fields are optional and I want most of the fields in a database. When a specific field isn't available I want an empty string () written into the database.Currently I've been doing:And then inserted dbstring into the database. However I'm getting a lot more of these fields now and I want a much cleaner code rather than a function which consists about 80% of if-statements.I've found if-shorthands and this shorthand to check if a variable is empty, but both don't seem to work directly as a string. I've tested this using  in an interactive python 3.5.2 shell:This:  is the PHP equivalent of what I seek.Edit: Since it seems relevant: The object I am trying to process is coming from Telegram's JSON API. I'm using  as library and this is an example object.
The Pythonic way is to look out for  exception that would be raised when the variable is not defined, the name is not bound to any object to be precise.So, for example:Names reside in namespaces e.g. local names reside in  () namespace, global names reside in  () namespace. You can define a function that takes name string and namespace as an argument to check for the existence, here is a hint passing namespace as a  and catching :On the other hand, if you are looking to get the value of an atrribute string of an object,  is the way to go:For example, the following two are equivalent:Even you can add a default when the object attribute is missing:The above will output the value , if  is missing it would output .You might also be interested in  that returns / for an attribute existence check, instead of needing to manually handle .
