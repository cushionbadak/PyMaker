I ran into an issue where my current traffic generator: Warp17 has generated python code that is only python2 compatible. We are moving all else to python3 so i have created a cli tool that wraps our warp17 api. Is there a better way to pass information from a subscript than just printing the output and loading it in json?This is basically what I am doing. I was curious if there was any interesting way to avoid doing this and get back an actual python dictionary object etc.
The binary representation of dictionaries, and in fact objects in general, has changed quite a bit between Python 2 and Python 3. That means that you will not be able to use the objects directly between versions of Python. Some form of serialization to a mutually acceptable format will be necessary.The JSON format you are using fits this criterion. I would recommend sticking with it as it is flexible, human readable and quite general.If space becomes an issue, you can look into pickling as an alternative, but I would not recommend it as a first choice. While  can understand Python 2 data just fine, there are many caveats to keep in mind with different interpretations of datatypes between Python versions, especially : Unpickling a python 2 object with python 3Here is a resource that may help you with some common errors from unpicking on the Python 3 side: TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str' when opening Python 2 Pickle file in Python 3
