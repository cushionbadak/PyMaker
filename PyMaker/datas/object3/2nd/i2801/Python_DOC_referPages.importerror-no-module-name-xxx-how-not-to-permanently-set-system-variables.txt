I'm running  under Windows 7. I have some modules that I do NOT want to put (at least yet) into the python subdirectories. After much angst, I've gotten them to run, but only at the expense of adding  and  to my System variables.  I tried creating a batch file, set these and then executed my script. I tried setx, but this just puts the variables in my User variables where python does not appear to recognize them.  I find it hard to believe that I can't distribute some of these scripts to my co-workers without forcing them to change their System variables. Am I doing something wrong?
Make sure you understand the module search path. https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#the-module-search-pathBeyond that, one option is to prepend any directories where you have dependencies to sys.path before your import statements.
As has been pointed out elsewhere setting pythonpath and pythonhome were probably not the best of ideas, especially in my newbie case because they ended up interferring with gcloud. I ended up adjusting my scripts so they sys.path.append("ZXYLIB") where XYXLIB is a path I set the the batch file calls the python, and that works.
