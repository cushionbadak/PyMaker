Consider this code:This code, takes from  an API response, with a series of currency exchange rates, from 1999 until now, what I need, is to understand, how can I filter this data, by taking the  from all of these years, but, excluding weekends.The response from this api url is something like this:I don't know if I'm explaining myself, I'm getting all the historical data, but I need to actually get this, excluding weekends.I know that  has a  function, but I'm not really sure on how to use it in this case.Any ideas?
If what I am understanding is correct - you want rates corresponding to only dates that lie on a weekday. (Correct me if I am wrong)In such a case, you can use the datetime day.weekday() method.day.weekday() explanation -  Return the day of the week as an  integer, where    Monday is 0 and Sunday is 6. For example, date(2002,  12, 4).weekday() == 2So, usage would be something like this - Refer here for date string formatting that I have done in the above code.
from https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html :date.weekday()  Return the day of the week as an integer, where Monday  is 0 and Sunday is 6. For example, date(2002, 12, 4).weekday() == 2, a  Wednesday. See also isoweekday().So I guess you could do something like:
