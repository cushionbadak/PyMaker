Is it possible to create a python object which does not have either a  a ?
As pointed out in this SO python classes defined in C have no  attribute. So yeah, it is possible and this is how you get built-in classes that don't have it, such as . Other than that... if you look at the data model the  is used to hold the namespace for user defined modules, classes and functions. So you'll get that attribute even when you define a new class that inherits from a built in class which doesn't have it. (such as str)
