New to python, My professor has given me a piece of code to help process some imagery, however it only works one image at a time due to an input and output needing to be stipulated each time. Usually I would put import os or glob but argparse is something new to me and my usual methods do not work.I need to edit this in order to create a list of '.hdf' files with the output being the same as the input just with a name change of '_Processed.hdf'Code below: 
From the argparse docs here, you can simply add a  to the argument definitions. However, be sure to give the input and output files in the same order...Also, you can use the  object, which is now standard in Python >=3.4, to play with file names.So with an added  at the top, the last part of your code becomes:Here,  is now a list of strings, so we iterate on it. The  attribute returns the file name without any extensions, I find it cleaner than something like , which only works for specific extension lengths...This works well with glob patterns in a standard linux shell (I don't know for other cases).Ex. calling , processes every file with filenames beginning with "Image_".
You can use the  option, and since you're going to have only have one required argument, I'd recommend that you don't use  as an option, but simply run the script as :
