I am trying to stop this program if the number the person enters is not 4 numbers long, using the try-except structure. I don't really get why it skips the except block if I enter a 2 or 3 digit number for example. All help appreciated.
The / syntax catches exceptions (aka errors).  If there are no errors thrown by the code in a  clause, the  clause is skipped. You don't have any obvious errors in your  clause.From the / docs:First, the try clause (the statement(s) between the try and except keywords) is executed.  If no exception occurs, the except clause is skipped and execution of the try statement is finished.Use / conditional syntax instead:
Try adding an  to  so it is .The reason why is that just having  is useless - that is run but you haven't told Python to do anything with the result. If you , it basically means verify the next code is true, otherwise throw an exception. 
You need to raise an exception in order to trigger the except. Try it like this:
