I need to write my program output to a log file whose name should change every 15 minutes and currently I am doing this way.Is there any dynamic way to do this procedure.
During while loop, get the current time. Then figure out how many minutes does it have. For ex., 10:20 has 20 minutes. Now divide it by 15 and add 1 to get the file name.
