I have a list that looks like this:I can successfully iterate over this list and pass the IDs into an API. However the API breaks after certain point in regards to number of Ids I am passing. I went ahead and broke the list into chunks of 50 using this code: The  variable is list of list that looks like this: How do I iterate over the list of list, passing individual Ids into the API code (below), while pausing the code for 10seconds after every chunk? In addition, if the API breaks, is there anyway I can force the API to continue rest of the code ? Not a requirement for now, so this is optional. API code: Thank you in advance. 
You can use a double  loop with use of the  function after execution of the inner loop. Here's an example:To answer your second question about how to continue execution if the API throws an error, you can use . Code that might throw an error goes in the  block and if an error is thrown, execution moves to the  block, which specifies how to proceed. If you wrap your code in a function this can be made a bit easier.I find it helpful to track the number of times you've tried calling for a specific  with a keyword argument that can be used for exponential backoff -- where you wait for longer amounts of time depending on how many times you've tried.Here is an example building on the above code:The code above is largely the same as the code before it, but the request logic is wrapped in the  function, which contains the  blocks. If an error is thrown when requesting the , the function will wait for  seconds and then try again.You might also want to  specific errors and handle them differently (or just to be explicit so you only  errors you are prepared to handle).
