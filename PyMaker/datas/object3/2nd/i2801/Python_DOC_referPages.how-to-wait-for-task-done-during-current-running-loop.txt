I want to wait for the result of a set of tasks during the current loop running in the Ipython notebook due to the need of data process. In the Ipython notebook,the event loop is running by default. That is to say, whenever u run the code below, you'll get And you can't shutdown the current loop because the notebook is using it. And I have some tasks to do in Ipython notebook. But I can't create a new loop without closing the current loop.I almost implement it. This is how I do it:Now what I need to do is to wait for  to be done, however, I can't use  to wait for it to complete, because I can't close the current notebook loop.What should I do to get the result?Thanks.  
Just create a new event loop and set it as the current event loop. I couldn't reproduce your issue, see below, so note that this is untested:Then you should be able to safely call  without interfering with the default event loop.See the docs for detail: https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloops.htmlP.S. I'm not sure what version of IPython/Jupyter notebook you're using, but I couldn't reproduce the issue on Jupyter notebook version 4.4 or ipython version 6.2.1. Mac OS High Sierra. Note that IPython notebooks have long been deprecated in favor of Jupyter notebooks.For instance, when running  REPL:Similar output in a Jupyter notebook.
