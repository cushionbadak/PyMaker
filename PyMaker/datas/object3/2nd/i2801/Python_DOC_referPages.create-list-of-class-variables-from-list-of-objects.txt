Tricky to word the title well.I want to create a list of values that correspond to the variables of a list of objects. It can be inelegently done like this;But this seems unpythonic and cumbersome, so I was wondering if there is a way of indexing all the the values out at one time. Im wondering if there is a syntax that allows me to take all the variables out at once, like pulling a first axis array from a 2d array;I hope this question makes sense 
Nothing unpythonic about that, IMO, but if you really want to iterate over the  values of your instances 'directly' instead of obtaining them from the object itself, you can map them to :Beware that on Python 3.x  returns an iterator so if you want the a  result make sure to turn it into one. Also, unless you construct  in a special way, pretty much anything will be slower than the good old list comprehension loop which you consider 'inelegant'.
