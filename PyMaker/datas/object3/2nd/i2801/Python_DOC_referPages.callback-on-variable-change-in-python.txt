I've searched around but didn't find anything like this. Let's say I have an army of threads, that keep reading and updating an integer variable . I would like a callback for when  changes over a certain margin, let's say 500, to run the callback. How can this be done without putting a heavy load on the system, like having a thread that has a  and checks if the variable has changed?  Performance is critical. But so are ethics.In plain code would be something like this:
You want to have a function (a  "setter") which is called whenever the variable's value changes. A good way to do that is to define a . It will behave like a variable, but will have a getter function and a setter function.Then, in the setter, call any callbacks you need, which will react to the change.This should do the trick:Then, you can do:
If  is an attribute of some object, rather than a global variable, this is very simple: add a  method:Obviously there are ways you can make this more flexible:Add a way to register conditions dynamically instead of just always calling .Make it a mixin class that can be attached to any other class letting you  whatever you want.Combine the above, so you can . so the callback can see old and new values. so the callback can accept or reject the change.  so the callback can override the change.
