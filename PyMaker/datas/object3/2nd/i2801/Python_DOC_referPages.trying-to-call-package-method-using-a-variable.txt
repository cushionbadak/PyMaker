Im trying to store the method in a package in a variable as it might change and I dont want to manually update in multiple places in the code.
In this particular case you can use hashlib.new() to create a hasher by its name.If you think you might want to change which function in a module you're calling, you can wrap it in your own function, which is right generic answer to the question you're asking.You can use getattr() on a module to retrieve a function by name, but that's not the usual way to do things.
