Since you're using the Requests library, you should use it on each API. Requests provides a method to extract JSON, so you don't need to call the  module yourself.When multiple things can go wrong, it's not a good idea to bundle them all together in one line. Do them in stages so you can see exactly where the error occurred, and deal it with it appropriately. Also, using unnamed  blocks is rarely a good idea: you might catch something that you don't know how to handle.Here's a re-organized version of your code.typical outputUpdate: I've improved the error-handling of this code.
Requests is able to parse the JSON for you. Try this:Output:Edit:No errors...You silently swallow any error thrown. That's a bad idea, especially when you try to debug. Don't do this:You will never know why  broke exactly. Either don't use  and let the exception appear, or at least print it:See https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#handling-exceptions
