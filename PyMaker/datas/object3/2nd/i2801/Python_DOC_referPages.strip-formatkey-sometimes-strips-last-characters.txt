This question already has an answer here:Python strip unexpected behavior                    2 answers                The code above sometimes strips the last character from the word. After removing the code after  all the data came back fine but in a list.Example : from  turns into  from  turns into Why does this happen?I tried this in Python shell and it also strips the last charactersI expect it to return  instead of  getting stripped.It seems that this  is responsible. I removed the last strip() it only return data with spaces.Edit: It seems that  takes characters in inputted string and remove them instead of removing exact strings. That is why the data came out broken. I think a string split then slice is good.Edit 2:Seems like answers by Austin and Pankaj Singhal is good and bug free for my use case.
Use a  on  and take the second item:Talking about your code,  is not meant for what you are trying to do.  only removes characters from at the ends.
You could use  (which returns a copy of the string with only leading characters removed), instead of  (which returns a copy of the string with leading and trailing characters removed):
OR:And of course, this is another option similar to the first one, just using :OR:Note: here  can be replaced with 
 does not strip that exact string, but each character in that string, i.e.  will remove each , , , etc. from the beginning and end of the string.Instead, you could use a regular expression with the  anchor to only match substrings at the beginning of the string.
