I have two lists:How do I compare the lists and only return the points at which  was greater than  into a third list  while preserving the indices so that the result looks like:After all that, there is a fourth list :and I am trying to collate it with  so that I end up with list C & D matching in terms of indices:Final Result:I was looking into list comprehension as I was told it would help, but I'm not really sure how to apply what I've read.
This is a perfect use-case for :Get a new list of booleans where  means item in  was greater than corresponding item in .Now we filter  and  based on  using .
I'd not use a list comprehension here; you are building two lists, not one, and that's just easier with a regular  loop:Using  you can iterate over lists in parallel, removing the need to track indices altogether.You can still use a comprehension here, but then you'd build a sequence with  values, and then use  again to split that result into two separate lists:This however becomes harder to follow and explain, and you actually have tuples, not lists, in that case (depending on your usecase you'd have to convert those to lists again).Demo:
Get the result by list comprehension:
