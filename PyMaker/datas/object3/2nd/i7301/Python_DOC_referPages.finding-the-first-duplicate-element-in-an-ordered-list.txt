I'm new to coding and hit a wall as to what to do with my pseudo code.I am defining a first duplicate function that for a = [1 2 2 3 4 4] it returns 2, This is what I've done so far. Any suggestions what I do next?
If I understand you correctly, you want to return the first number that appears a second time while you're iterating over the list. To achieve this I would use a set and check if the current item is already in the set, if yes return it, otherwise add the item to the set. (You could do that with a list, too, but less efficiently.)
In case if you would be interested in a single line code by list comprehension
