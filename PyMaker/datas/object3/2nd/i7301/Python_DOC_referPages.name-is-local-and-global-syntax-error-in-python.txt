I am getting error while executing below statementOutputHow to change value of a globally in this proc where name is same for function argument and actual parameter
I really think the correct answer is to just pick a different name for the function argument as I commented, but if you cannot for some reason, you can access the global  via :Although this is somewhat hacky and I would strongly recommend simply changing the variable names to avoid the error instead.
