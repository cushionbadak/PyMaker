When I run this file, everything seems to calculate correctly, except for the fact that I end up with the individual list elements inside of lists themselves. This makes it difficult to do some other operations I would like to perform on the individual parts of the list. My code:When I run this code, it returns [['Test 1'], ['Test 2'], ['Test 3'], ['Test 4'], ['Test 5']].Is there anything I can do about this?

It will ensure that your files will always be closed regardless of any errors or issues that arise during program execution.
