I am trying to write information to a csv file.  It is inside a for loop that will change the data.  Basically what I want it to do is get data put it in a csv file and then it will loop get new data and put it in the same csv file, but it needs to continue where it left off from the last set of data and not replace it.Here is what I have:I can't give more than this,  But I can confirm it is parsing 10 times and the data is there.  How do I skip used lines or just continue where I left off?Note:  It is important that each bit of information is on a newline.  Ex:Note:  I have tried many different threads and none of them apply to my situation nor explain enough for me to match them up, so I have been exploring options with no luck.
You can use the append  modifier when you open a file to write where you left off. For example:
Open the file outside of the for loop
