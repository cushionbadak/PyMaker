The unpacking/splat operators  and  differ widely in their applicability across python versions (2.7, 3.x < 3.5 and 3.x >= 3.5).For example:Are there any more discrepancies between the various versions that I've missed?  I'm looking through PEP and Readmes but the docs aren't detailed with this. 
Around 1992 (not sure about Python version). This is from the Grammar file of Python 1.0.1.Python 1.4+:Keyword Arguments: Functions and methods written in Python can now be  called using keyword arguments of the form .Python 1.6+There's now special syntax that you can use instead of the   function.  is equivalent to .

You can no longer write .  Use  instead.Python 3.0+ PEP 3132: Extended Iterable  Unpacking. You can now write things like . And even . The rest object is always  a (possibly empty) list; the right-hand side may be any iterable.PEP 3102: Keyword-only arguments. Named parameters occurring after   in the parameter list must be specified using keyword syntax in the call. You can also use a bare  in the parameter list to indicate  that you donâ€™t accept a variable-length argument list, but you do have  keyword-only argumentsPython 3.5+PEP 448, additional  unpacking generalizations.As far as I know there's no single page that lists all the syntax changes. Per version syntax changes are listed in the What's new in Python section or you could check the Grammar specification of each release to see the differences.
