Below is the sample of my XML. There are many such similar cases.My requirement:Pass through the xml logs, note the tests, test cases and the test case status. If status is failed, then display for which test case and test suite its failed along with other relevant messages. Issue i'm facing: I'm iterating over the test, collecting all the sub tests status and status. In the below code, if tc#2 is failed, output is giving for tc1 as I'm iterating for tc1 by collecting all the status which is in list. So the output is getting repeated.My desired output(Only for status="FAIL")Test Name: Login checkTest case: Invalid username & PasswordStatus: FailMessages: Return errorBelow is my code:
