I want to write Python regex that takes a string of pattern: "u'Johns's Place',"and returns:Johns's PlaceIt should locate the character 'u', the apostrophe comes after it and then the apostrophe that comes before the comma and returns what there is between these two apostrophes. Therefore, I wrote the following code:however, I still got the entire string "u'Johns's Place',"with no filtering. Do you know how it can be resolved?
Python doesn't accept your pattern because of the middle  in . It isn't followed by a comma, as described in your pattern. The matching cannot continue to look for a  because you only allow characters that aren't  or  with .If you want to parse JSON with Python, use  package, not regexen applied to escaped unicode strings.
I don't use Python much but this regex should solve your problemfrom the beginning match the u and single quote, capture anything after that until the single quote and comma at the endremove ^ and $ if there's more to your string than the replaced (in other words, if there is any context)
After making a bigger research I found this package https://simplejson.readthedocs.io/en/latest/It can make you read a JSON file without putting u'..' for every string. current_json will not have the character 'u' at the beginnig of every string. It answers my question partially because it returns keys and values that are delimited by a single quote mark(') and not by quotation marks(") as it's needed in JSON format.
