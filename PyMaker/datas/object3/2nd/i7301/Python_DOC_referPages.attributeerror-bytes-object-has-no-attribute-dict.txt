I totally new in Python and stuck with this error:I am trying to encode an image and then convert it to json to upload into a no-sql db. But when I am trying to convert it to json I am getting this error:"AttributeError: 'bytes' object has no attribute 'dict'"Below is my python code:
That happens because you are trying to access a property that a  object doesn't have (). I understand that you need to return a format that can be serialized to JSON.This works for me, but I don't know if it's the decoding you desire:See TypeError: b'1' is not JSON serializable as well.
