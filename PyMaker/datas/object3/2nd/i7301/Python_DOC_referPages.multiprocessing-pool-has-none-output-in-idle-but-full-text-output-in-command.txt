Natural Text
When running the code below, I get 'None' output when running code from IDLE, but I get the full text output (correct output) when running from my command prompt. Why is this the case? Am I utilizing Pool wrong? testing multiprocessingfrom multiprocessing import Pool
You're using  correctly. However, it's a known problem that  will not work with interactive interpreters like IDLE. This is documented here underneath the example.
