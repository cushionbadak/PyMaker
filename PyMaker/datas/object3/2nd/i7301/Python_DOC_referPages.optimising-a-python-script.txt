I've been trying to complete the below task in Python:http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/4/CI created a simple script for it as can be seen below, but it returns a runtime error for the 7th test. I believe this is due to perhaps the code is taking too long, so I require assistance optimising it. I have looked at map and filter commands and tried implementing them, without success.
You can try changing  to a  instead of a . For a list  operation  takes (on average) linear time. For a set  operation  takes (on average) constant time. (source: https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity)This simple change could improve runtime a bit.  What also strikes me as potentially very slow is this fragment:However, if you want to improve this, you need to think about using a completely different data structure.
Why don't you use a lookup  with a counter and solve this in O(N) time?
Why don't you try
