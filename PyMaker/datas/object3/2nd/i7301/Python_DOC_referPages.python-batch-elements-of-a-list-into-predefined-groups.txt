I have a list of numerical values, for example  and a set of predefined groups:I would like to obtain the following:One way of doing it is to make a for loop and check the if-elif-else condition for each element, as below:Is there any way to group the elements of the list which is faster and a little bit more elegant? The real my_list which I'm using is large, so any way to optimize would be great!
You can use bisect module for this.Here for each item in  we will find the index where it can fit in  list and that index will act as the group number.
