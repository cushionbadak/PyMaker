Whenever you import a module, Python creates a module object and stores it in the  dictionary. Subsequent imports of that same module will reuse the module object from . Additionally, each time you import a submodule, the attribute is added to the parent module object.There's one instance of  for a given Python process, and therefore in general there's only one instance of every module per Python process. It means that if you have access to a module object, you also have access to its submodules that have been imported anywhere within the current process.In this particular case,  runs package/__init__.py, which imports , which imports . As a result,  and  are added to the "shared"  module object, and you can access them.
