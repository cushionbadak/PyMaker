So I am working on a project, my code is:The number of products are around 20. When I input 500000, it can't be run and the mistake is:I think the "else" should work, while it doesn't...Thanks for any help!
The problem is that there is no product with the input id, so the list length is zero and there is no element that you can get at index 0. Break the code in two lines: 
If  returns an empty list object, i.e. there is no match, trying to access the empty list with  will result in an IndexError.It can be re-written as:
Your error doesn't match your code.Also the error occurs with trying to get the first object in an empty listIf  is an empty list, it will crash, and  will not prevent it from crashing.To prevent it from crashing you can try either a Try-Except statement or checking the length of the list before attempting to get any members from it via the  command.
