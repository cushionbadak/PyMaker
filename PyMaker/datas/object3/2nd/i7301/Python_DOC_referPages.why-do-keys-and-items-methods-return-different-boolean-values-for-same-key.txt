In python 3.6, when checking whether a key exists in a dictionary the  method returns , while the  method returns  for the same key. Why is that the case?
 contains tuples, key-value pairs:Your key is not such a tuple. It may be contained in one of the tuples, but  does not test for containment recursively.Either test for the correct key-value tuple:or if you can't get access to just the  dictionary view, use the  function to test each pair individually (iteration is halted early when a match is found):orOn a separate note, if all you are doing is testing for a key, then just use . There is no need to create a separate dictionary view over the keys for that case; it's just a waste of Python cycles and memory as containment testing against the dictionary achieves the exact same result.
This is because items() returns a list of key and value pairs.
 will return a list but  will return you list of tuples in  pair so it would not match. for example :Hope you get the point.
Of course they are different.In your spam variable --> :, and  are the Keys. and , the items.
