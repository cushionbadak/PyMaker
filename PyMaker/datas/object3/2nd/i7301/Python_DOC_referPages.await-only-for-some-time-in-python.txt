So waiting for server can bring pain:I want to have something likeSo how to await only for a limited amount of time in Python?
await expressions don't have a timeout parameter, but the asyncio.wait_for (thanks to AChampion) function does. My guess is that this is so that the await expression, tied to coroutine definition in the language itself, does not rely on having clocks or a specific event loop. That functionality is left to the asyncio module of the standard library.
