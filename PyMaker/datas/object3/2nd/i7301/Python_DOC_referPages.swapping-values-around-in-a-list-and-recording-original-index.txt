Preface: This is a homework assignment and I am not looking for a complete answer, just a little nudge in the right direction.  I am writing a simple encryption program, that will take the name of an file as input, open it and rewrite it with the lines randomly shifted around.  I have done this, but I need to somehow keep track of the line numbers that were shifted around.  I know I need to write a new list and append the indexes+1 when they changed, but I can't quite figure out where to put it.  As you can see I have also made a dictionary that would contain the contents of the .txt file as 1:lineone 2:linetwo.  But I am not sure if it would be easier to use this, or just use a list to keep track of it.  Edit: I have changed my code to include:new_dict now prints the correct order of the shifted list, but at the wrong indexes.  For example, 1:line7 2:line11, but I want the indexes to match the line number so I can just print off the keys into an index file to use for decrypting. ex: 7:line7 11:line11 Any tips?
You don't actually need to save the order of the shuffled lines. You can simply re-create it when you need it by using the same random seed that you originally used. The code below should give you a few ideas.output
Just shuffle an numpy array with indeces and shuffle them. So you can save the indices for later.Version without numpy:
