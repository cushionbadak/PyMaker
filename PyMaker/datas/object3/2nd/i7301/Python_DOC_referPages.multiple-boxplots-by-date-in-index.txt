My dataframe Then, I set Dates as index:The Problem:  When I tried to create one box plot for each year found in index, I got both plots on the same grid. I tried the following but the plot comes up empty:Is it possible to have them in the same grid, one by the other?
A simple solution will be grouping by year first and then making boxplot:Your second method ends up with an empty plot because  fail to recognize  correctly. Try use Numpy-array representation:To use subplots, you will need to plot them one by one:
Let's reshape the data with Years in columns and :
If you want to put all the boxes in the same plot, you can do something like this:
With the help of Scott Boston, Y. Luo, and yuhow5566, I was able to devise an interesting answer.

Luo, I learned how to create a new column, while isolating the year from a datetime value.
