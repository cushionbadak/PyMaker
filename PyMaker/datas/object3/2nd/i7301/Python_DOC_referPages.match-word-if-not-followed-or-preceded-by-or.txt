I am trying to not match words that are followed or preceded by an XML tag.Result is:Wanted Result:I have been trying negative lookahead and negative lookbehind assertions. I'm not sure if this is the right approach, I would appreciate any help.
First, to answer your question directly:I do it by examining each 'word' consisting of a sequence of characters containing (mainly) alphabetics or '<' or '>'. When the regex offers them to  I look for one of the latter two characters. If neither appears I print the 'word'.This works for your test string; however, as others have already mentioned, using a regex on xml will usually lead to many woes.To use a more conventional approach I had to tidy away a couple of errors in that xml string, namely to change  to  and to using a proper closing tag. I prefer to use the lxml library.
I'll give it a shot.  Since we are already doing more than just a regex, put it into a list and drop the first/last items:result:I would personally try to parse the XML instead, but since you have this code already up this slight modification could do the trick.
A simple way to do it, with a list, but I am supposing the  followed or preceded word by an XML tag and the proper tag are not separated by an space:The result will be:
My soultion...I don't see the need to use  at all, you could solve it in a one-line list comprehension:
