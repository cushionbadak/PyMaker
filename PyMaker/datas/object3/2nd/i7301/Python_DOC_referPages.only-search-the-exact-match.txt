So, I have a really long list (example truncated) with values that look something like this:I have function that goes through that massive list and just pulls out a match based on the IP but the problem is, it seems to match on anything in that last octet and not just the exact match.So in the above case, if findIP = '10.1.1.1' it would come back with 10.1.1.1 and 10.1.1.11.  I'd imagine there has to be a way to just force it back to exactly what my input is...
Don't use a regular expression.  Just look for the string itself.Of course it only works if the ip addresses in the data conform to your example ... no leading zeroes.If your addresses might have leading zeros you could compare the integer equivalents of the addressesI don't have Python 3.x on this computer so I don't really know if map objects can be compared like that.  If not, use  for the condition.
