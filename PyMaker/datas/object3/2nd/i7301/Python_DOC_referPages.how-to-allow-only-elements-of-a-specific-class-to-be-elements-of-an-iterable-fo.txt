In my case, I want to define a custom class (called WordTuple) which is a subclass of the tuple class. The elements of this custom tuple must all be of another custom class(called Word).I know that this question (How to make an iterable class in Python in which only a specific type is allowed to be the element?) is similar, but the answer is not what I am looking for, nor it is very clear to me.
Because a tuple is immutable you only need to validate the objects when creating the tuple. You can do so in a custom  method:Demo:
