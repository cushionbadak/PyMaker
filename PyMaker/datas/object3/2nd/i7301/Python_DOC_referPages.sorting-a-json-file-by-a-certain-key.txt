Natural Text
I am coding in Python. I have a  file with contentHow can I sort the file content intousing the "ID" key to sort?I tried different methods to read and perform the sort, but always ended up getting errors like "no sort attribute" or ' "unicode' object has no attribute 'sort'".
There are several steps:Read the file using json.load()Sort the list of objects using list.sort()Use a key-function to specify the sort field.Use operator.itemgetter() to extract the field of interestWrite the data with json.dump()Here's some code to get you started:This outputs:For your application, open the input file and use  instead of .  Likewise, open a output file and use  instead of .  You can drop the indent parameter as well, that is just to make the output look nicely formatted.
simple and probably faster in case of large data - pandas.DataFrame.to_json
