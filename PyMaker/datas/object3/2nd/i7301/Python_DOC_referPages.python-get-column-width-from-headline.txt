Natural Text
I have a table like output and I would like to get the input from each line separated by column.Unfortunately the column does not always have the same width and there can be whitespaces inside the column.But the column always starts at the position of the description in the headline and ends 1 field before the next headline.My idea was to get the position of the words in the headline and then split the line with something likevar = line[firstword:secondword-1]var2 = line[secodword:thirdword-1]How can I get this positions?
If you know the column headers, you can do something like this (assuming variable  contains the table:If you don't, then assuming the headers don't contain whitespace (similarly to as Karmanya Aggarwal already suggested):Or using a regex: Now you can get the column values using the indices:Of course, if the table is  actually tab-separated, you'll want to use the csv module instead.
There are many ways to do this.  Note that this becomes difficult in general when the header words have spaces (you begin to have to look for double-spaces as splits, or even at the contents of the rows rather than just the header).  For the example you gave, a simple regular expression can give you the results:
Are the column titles constant? If so, why not just read the first line and figure out the starting position of each field from it?Something like this?
