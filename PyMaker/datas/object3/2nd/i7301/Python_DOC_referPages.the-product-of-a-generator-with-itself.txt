I need to iterate over the product of a generator with itself, excluding the diagonal.  I'm attempting to use  to consume the same generator twiceThis does not workThe documentation for tee states:Return n independent iterators from a single iterable.What's the proper way to do this?(I'm using python3.6.1)
It looks like you want to use .If you really want to do it using , you will have to turn the second iterable into a  so that it is not exhausted on the second time through the outer  loop:Note that this is pretty pointless, since calling  on an iterator loads it into memory and defeats the purpose of having an iterator in the first place.
The issue is that you're trying to reuse the  iterator. After it's been iterated once, it's exhausted and so you won't be able to iterate on it again. When you try, it yields nothing.I think rather than  (which is not very efficient for this purpose anyway), you should use  to generate all pairs (before filtering out the ones you want to skip):
