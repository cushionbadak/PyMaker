For example:It runs successfully so there are no problems with line #2 and line #3. But after I uncomment line #4:Now it reports error so there must be something wrong with the uncommented line #4 but why the Traceback error is reported on line #2?
There is a answer in Programming FAQThis is because when you make an assignment to a variable in a scope,  that variable becomes local to that scope and shadows any similarly  named variable in the outer scope.Read complete here : Why am I getting an UnboundLocalError when the variable has a value?When len is commented it is consider as a build in function len()
with L4 commented,  is parsed as function .after uncomment L4,  is parsed as a local variable.
