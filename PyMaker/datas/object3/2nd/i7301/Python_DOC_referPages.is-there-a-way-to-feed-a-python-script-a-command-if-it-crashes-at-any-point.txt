I am familiar with try, except. However I'm looking for a more general method that just runs a simple command before the script stops running after any error is raised.For example if I'm using xlsxwriter:
This is what context managers are for (the  statement). The Workbook class actually provides what is necessary.It is as simple asSee Workbook documentationIn case you want to do other things as well, the  statement(s) are what you need. See documentation
For the specific case of calling a  method (where the object doesn't support the context management protocol natively, so you can't use it bare in a  statement), you can improve a bit on / by using  to wrap it such that it's  statement compatible, replacing your code:with (adding  to the top of your file):That calls  unconditionally when the block is exited, whether by exception, , or just naturally leaving the block without error or ing (which is usually what you want). If for some reason you only want to call it when you have an exception, you can do:That will only  when an exception occurs, and will reraise the exception (because continuing silently in this scenario is probably wrong).
Well. In general this is solved by:
