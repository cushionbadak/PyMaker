I'm trying to create a simple array program and print out the array elements but getting an error right after I input employee 2 value saying: IndexError: list assignment index out of range. 
Python doesn't have literal arrays: it has lists.  doesn't create a list with 3 elements: it creates a list with 1 element. You should use  to add items to a list, not indexing past the end of the array.The correct code would look something like this to add elements to the list:From the comments, it seems you're learning code from a pseudocode textbook: that's wonderful. Just remember though that certain conventions common to pseudocode, or sometimes C-like languages may be different in other programming languages. For example, in C, this declares an array of 50 chars named .In Python, you cannot use the same syntax. Good luck.
You seem to have the wrong idea on how arrays work in Python. Essentially what you're doing when you typedIs create an array with one element with a value of 3
