I have a function which works with integers. I have added code for exception handling if strings or floats are entered, however, Python keeps returning either nonsense or . At this point I have tried a loop which keeps asking until an integer is entered and a  and . Nothing works.Here's the code:Entering a whole number(the intended input) executes the code fine, but everything else leads to a name error like this, where the input is . The top part is my attempt at a loop, which also failed and returned the same error;
 means that you try to use a variable named  but you didn't create it.You have to define what is  like that for exemple :orFurthermore, I just want you to know that even if it works, try to avoid using try/except because this is quite slow when you have to enter in the except block.If you want to check if your variable is an integer I recommend you using :Where isinstance() is a built-in function.
Your bob variable is not defined at all, so you don't reach the try/catch.Try decalring bob with not a number,  and retry.
The problem is that  is being raised from outside the function call. When you say:What Python does is:Get the value of .Call  passing that value as parameter. is raised in step 1., so you don't even get into the function. If you still want to catch it, you should have the / block outside:
The code you posted simply cannot raise a NameError. The error probably comes from the part where you call you  function. If you just wrote , then the NameError will be raised if you did not previously define a variable named . If you wanted to pass a string, you should call your function like:
