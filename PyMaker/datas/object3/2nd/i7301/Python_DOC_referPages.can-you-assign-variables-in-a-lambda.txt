I was using a  statement to perform math, and happened to repeatedly use one certain value. Therefore I was wondering if it was possible to assign and use a variable within a  statement. I have tried things like:However this just raises errors, and I was wondering if there was a way to do this.
Nope, you can't. Only expressions allowed in :You could, however, define a second  inside the  and immediately call it with the parameter you want. (Whether that's really better might be another question.)Of course, both the outer and the inner lambda can have more than one parameter, i.e. you can define multiple "variables" at once. The benefit of this approach over, e.g., defining a second lambda outside of the first is, that you can still also use the original parameters (not possible if you invoked  with  pre-calculated) and you have to do the calculation for  only once (other than repeatedly invoking a function for the calculation of  within ).Also, inspired by the top answer to the linked question, you could also define one or more variables as part of a list comprehension or generator within the lambda, and then get the  (first and only) result from that generator or list:However, I think the intent behind the lambda-in-a-lambda is a bit clearer. Finally, keep in mind that instead of a one-line , you could also just use a much clearer three-line  statement...
You can assign variables in lambda functions is you use exec:
You can create 2 different lambda functions and pass one to the other. For example,
You can just pass your lambda an argument which passes it along to another argument if you wish:
