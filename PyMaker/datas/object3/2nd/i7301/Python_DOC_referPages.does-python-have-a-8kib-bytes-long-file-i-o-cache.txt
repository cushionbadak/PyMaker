I'm investigating file I/O performance in Python 3.6.0. Given this script which consists of 3 tests:Procmon sees the following operations happening (hashtag lines are my comments):First off, it is clear that python will read files in chunks which are multiples of 8KiB.I'm suspecting that python implements a cache buffer that stores the last read 8KiB block and will simply return it and crop it if you are trying to read only in that same 8KiB extent multiple times consecutively.Can somebody confirm that it is actually the case that python implements this mechanism?If that's the case, this means that python cannot detect a change to that block made by an external application if you don't somehow manually invalidate the cache. Is that correct? Perhaps there is a way to disable this mechanism?Optionally, why is it that exactly 8192 bytes reads cannot benefit from the cache?
Yes, the default buffer size is 8k. See :  An  containing the default buffer size used by the module’s buffered I/O classes.  uses the file’s  (as obtained by ) if possible.andand the module source code:If you use the  interface or a wrapper to make changes to the file, the buffer will automatically be updated (opening a file in binary mode produces a  subclass, one of ,  or ).For your second case, your  call flushes that buffer because you seeked outside of the 'current' block range (the current position was at , the first byte of the second buffered block, you seeked back to , which is first byte of the first buffered block). See the source code of  for more detailsIf you need to edit the underlying file from some other process, using  is a great way to ensure that buffer is dropped before trying to read again, or you could just ignore the buffer and go to the underlying  implementation via the  attribute.
