I am using simple formulawhere covariance is when I printNumPy returns 0.000105846998912 instead of 1.05846999e-04, changing the value of original item in array, and i am experiencing this problem only when I run this covariance[1,1] statement in my terminal. If I run the same stuff in Jupiter it works just fine. Can you help me?
 is equal to . One is scientific notation and the other isn't.
Most of the "floating point" are wrong questions relate to the difference between the formatting and internal representation of a floating point. The computer can't represent the "formatted" floating point exactly. Things to be aware of are what kind of floating point am I using, for example here you could check if you are using a float32 or  type array. You can check this by typing:You can set the details of how values are printed using the  function from numpy. Also make sure you are aware of how floating point values are printed, in different python versions. This is what you would call a "reproducible" example:If I run it under jupyter with python3.5 I get:If I run it under python console I get the same answer.
