So as is, this doesn't work. I get an error about how I can't concatenate a list with a string. And obviously that's not what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to concatenate the constituents of both my lists (indexed the same so i can use the same counter). I just didn't want to use a for loop if I didn't have to.I still need to do the matching index iterations of product_name
To iterate over the  list items you have to use a for statement, but you don't use the right syntax, please read the tutorial about  statements at:  https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#for-statements
