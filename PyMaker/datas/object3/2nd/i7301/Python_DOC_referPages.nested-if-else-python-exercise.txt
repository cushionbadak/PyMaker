I'm trying to build a function that checks which of a,b,c is less then returns the lesser value.So far the code runs fine until it gets to check 'c', then it doesnt return anything, nested if else statements already get really confusing to me.
You shouldn't use  as the 3 conditions are not exclusive.For example,  should return in the 3rd condition but is also suitable in the 1st condition, so it returns nothing.If you don't want to change your code a lot. You can use:For simple, you can try:
why that code doesn't work:Alternative:if you really want to use nested if/else (this code is so long):
Use the power of if...elif...else over if...if...if or if...else...if...else. The way you have written your code, depreciates the power of elif. The correct way should be as this:This code will always return the min no matter what numbers you give.Explaination:In your code, the line  already tells you the comparison between a and b that which one is greater. So checking for this condition again in the second if  is useless. if a is not lesser than b, then obviously it is either greater than b or equal to b. So now you must just check if b is lesser than c to prove that b is smallest or even a or b both but the returned value is always minimum. I hope you get that.Also I don't understand whyt do you want to return None. If you provide three numbers to a function to find the minimum number, it should always and always return a number. Tell me a case where you can expect a None.
Easily be done using  inbuilt function:also the number of steps in your code can be reduced with some tweaking.
It works - Finding two greatest in three int:Find greatest in three integer:
You could probably get away with using a for loop to minimise lines of code!It would look something like this:
