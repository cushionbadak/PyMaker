Here's a couple lines of a larger programOutput:Now I need to specifically request the 'latitude' and 'longitude' parts of the webpage, and store them in a set. Any idea on how do I call these individual elements? 
Unfortunately, the short answer is, you can not do this simply from the  request. This answer here explains it very nicely.This means that you would have to  the entire json table, and obtain the  and  values locally.
I assume you mean the latitude and longitude for each location in the snappedPoints array.You could use the built-in JSON decoder provided by the Requests module: http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#json-response-contentOr you could use Python's JSON module if you prefer: 2.7 Docs | 3.6 docsOnce you've decoded the JSON response you can just iterate over your locations and grab the parts you want.
