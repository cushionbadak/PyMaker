I am having difficulty in understanding as for how this piece of code works.As I know the split is used for splitting characters but this does not make much sense to me.
It's easy to understand what happens if you play a little with with Python REPL. The most interesting part happens in line 3 of the code you've shown:Let's run it step by step in REPL to understand what happens:As you can see this function is meant to extract titles like ,  etc. This implementation is error prone if specific characters like  or  are not found in the input string, for example:
You should do the splits one by one and see how its going, for example:
You start with:The first  will find all ',' and split the string at those positions. So you get:  Then you take the second element so you are left with:You then split this string by '.' and get:  After that you take the first element:And strip it:
What happens here is called Method chaining. This means that if a method returns an object, you can append a method on the returned object directly on the calling method. Let's break down that return line of code: returns a list of items, where each ',' in the string is treated as a separator between list items. On , this returns the following list: The following  selects the second item in the list, which is a string object ()Next,  splits that string again into a list, returning . Then, the first item is selected by , returning the string .Finally,  removes all whitespaces from the beginning and the end of the string. 
I will explain based on your example:Does name contain ? Yes, then you split name using , which returns:Now, you retrieve the second element (), and you split it using , which returns:Then, you retrieve the first element (), which returns:is used to remove extra leading and trailing spaces.Then the final result:
