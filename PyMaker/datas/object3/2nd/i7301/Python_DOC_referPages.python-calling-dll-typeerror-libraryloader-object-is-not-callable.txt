I am trying to import a DLL into Python 2.7.12 64 bit using ctypes. To narrow down the scope for errors I used Microsoft's MathLibrary DLL example and built my own based on these instructions (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-GB/library/ms235636.aspx). I built it as x64 release and copied the resulting dll into C:\ root to eliminate path length or spelling error issues. My machine us running Windows 7 Pro 64 Bit.My python code is:When run it reports the following:Can anyone advise what might be the issue?ThanksAndyUpdate:@eryksun comment  - this removed the LibraryLoader error. However I am now struggling to access the add function and get this error:
windll is an object from the ctypes module. It can't be invoked like a function ('object is not callable'). You probably want to reference one of its methods and invoke it.you can use  to see the objects attributes and methods, or better yet, check the documentation.
