I have a list of strings like this:I need to find all the strings in this list that contain  or  or I checked many other threads as well as the regex manual. It turned out to be too confusing for me. Pleas help. :(
You don't need regex for this at all. A list comprehension with  will suffice
Here's a solution using regex if that's what you really need. I search to see if any of your 3 substrings are present inside any given string from the list. Using https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html as the Python regex library.
 also works for your problem.
