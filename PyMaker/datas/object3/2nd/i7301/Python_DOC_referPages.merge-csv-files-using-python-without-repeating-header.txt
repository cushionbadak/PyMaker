I am trying to do this ,and getting I don't know much about python please helpAlso i want to know how to split 1 big csv into multiple csv with same header.

Using pandas:To get rid of duplicate rows as well:This will not get rid of duplicates as the dataframe is created, but after. So a dataframe gets created by concatenating all of the files. Then it is de-duplicated. The final dataframe can then be saved to csv.
