Recently I found this awesome 2-factor authentication code generator written in Python 3. I was trying to convert it to Swift 3, but I am having trouble with one specific part, though:I so far have only been able to do the first line of the function body :p using code from hereI tried reading the documentation on  here and reading about what packing actually is here, but I still find the concept/implementation confusing, and I have no idea what the equivalent would be in Swift.According to the documentation,  returns a string in the given format. The format in my case is , which means that the byte order is  and the C Type is an . Again, I am not exactly sure how this is supposed to look in Swift. ... And that is only the second line! I don't really understand how  works (I can't even find the actual 'background' code), so I can't even translate the entire function. I could not find any native library for Swift that has this behavior.Any pointers or help translating this function will be highly appreciated!P.S. I checked and I think that this is on topicRelevant imports:
I just finished converting my code to Swift 3. This is a little different from the Python version, since this is more of a framework-type thing. It took a lot of experimentation to get the  to work (for example the Wikipedia page says it used SHA256 but it actually uses SHA1. You can find it here. When you use this, be sure to add a bridging header with Enjoy!
