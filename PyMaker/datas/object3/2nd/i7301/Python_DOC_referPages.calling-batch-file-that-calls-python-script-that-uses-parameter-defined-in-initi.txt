This question already has an answer here:How to read/process command line arguments?                    17 answers                I've two batch files, A.bat and B.bat, as well as a python script C.pyA.bat looks something like this:Now of course, if I use %1 in B.bat, the batch file will view that value as "hello". Now, if I have B.bat call C.py, I need C.py to be able to recognize that %1 is hello, the same way B.bat recognizes that.Of course, I've tried simply writing in B.bat:And then using %1 in C.py like I would in any batch file, but this did not work. I don't know if this means that I can't use %1 itself as a parameter or if I can't use a parameter of this type in python, or both. So, how would I be able to use a parameter in C.py that was defined in A.bat?
To access parameters in Python, use:Ref: https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.argv
