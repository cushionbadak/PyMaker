I'm looking for a way to let end users process some data from the user interface. A scripting-engine with a syntax similar to Excel would do.Example:The input would be a  which contains the data (which is basically variable name for the script) and a  with the rule.The script must be extendable with own functions. Also maybe some definition of types which can be used by users.Use case:Basically the users have some 2 dimensional data in their account (product details). And using some scripting rules I would like to let them change product data.For example if a user wants to exclude all products starting with letter , they would create a rule:or if the user wants to raise the price by 20% if the product price is lower then 10:
If you want something more user-friendly, perhaps you could try Blockly:https://developers.google.com/blockly/You can easily integrate it with your application and customize it, creating your own blocks to serve your user's needs.You may also want to take a look at Mesh:https://github.com/chrispsn/meshOr perhaps something simpler:https://pypi.python.org/pypi/simpleevalOr, even simpler (but less safe), you can use ; this one is part of Python's standard library:https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast.literal_evalAlso this other question may help you:Safe expression parser in Python
