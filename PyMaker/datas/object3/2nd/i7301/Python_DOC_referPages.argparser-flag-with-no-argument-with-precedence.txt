I have couple of positional and optional arguments (using argparser) , now need to add a flag which takes no argument/values and essentially calls a method.let's say this is the current parser :here's the brief sample codewhat I'm looking for is something similar when you use  which results in showing the help (and takes precedences on other flags).So I want to support a special flag (like --help) without worrying about providing all the other flags in the command line. So something like this should work as well:I was thinking to use  to take the flag with no value, but it does not have the precedence over other flags.any comments/suggestions is really appreciated
You could use soemthing like this: 
You're missing the  field.
 help takes precedence because it forces sys.exit when encountered.  That is, it has a Action class that prints the help and then exits.There is a  action class that does something similar - display a message and exit.All other actions store something in the  Namespace, and continue parsing.  The  complaint is produced at the end of parsing when it deduces that some positional (or other required) arguments have not been filled.I can think of several solutions:define a new Action subclass modeled on  or .  If you take this route, you should do the development, so you know exactly what is happening.change your positionals to something that is optional.   is a possibility, but making flagged is better.  In this case  could be a simple  action.use subparsers.   would be parser that takes no arguments.  The othe subparser would take the 2 positionals.  Look at the subparsers documentation, and the  note.
