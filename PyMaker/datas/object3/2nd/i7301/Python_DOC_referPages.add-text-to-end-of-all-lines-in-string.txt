Say I have this string: How do I add something at the end of all the lines? The amount of lines in the string may vary from time to time.Something like:Duplicate being the string's name.This code only adds 'X' to the end of line 1.How can I do this for every line?Desired output: Thanks!
First, split as you did  on :Then append  at the end of each line with a , and join these line on .I do both operations in a signle line:If you're not familiar with generator expressions, this is somewhat similar to:
Just use :
Remove the  line and change  into .
You can use map to apply a function to all elements of the list you obtained using  and then  the elements in a single string:
Try this, uses list comprehension to add 'X' to each line and then joins it by a newline character.
