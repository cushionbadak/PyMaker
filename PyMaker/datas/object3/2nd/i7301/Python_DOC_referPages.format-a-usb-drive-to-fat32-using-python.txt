I'm trying to create a bootable USB drive and need to format the USB into FAT32 so that I can extract all the files into it.Is it possible to format a USB drive using pure python? Can I format it into FAT32 without the use of external commands?I know that in bash I can do this:  to format the USB drive, how can I do similar using just python?
The following is a close approximation to the  command you gave in the question.  I'm not sure if there's a way to force a  after completion.
You can use subprocess to inline bash code
