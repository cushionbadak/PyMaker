I have a python script that tell me what 'period' it is (for school) which then outputs into a csv file:I have another python script that grabs a student's name once they swipe their student card through a magnetic card reader and then outputs that into a CSV file.What I want to happen is when they swipe their card their name gets imported into the CSV then the period gets imported next to it (ex. ). Then the next student will swipe their card and their name and period will be placed under the last students But every time a card it swiped the csv file gets erased and then the current students name is the only one left in there.This is just a temp mock up the final code will have both codes in it.TL;DR - how do I have python add data to a CSV file instead of just rewriting the whole file?
But every time a card it swiped the csv file gets erased and then the current students name is the only one left in there.This is because you are writing () the file every time the card is swiped, which means a new file is created (an existing file with the same name will be erased). So You should use  mode which is appending values in existing file.So the line should be changed to Now everytime card is swiped the values will be appended.you can check File Operations at https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files
