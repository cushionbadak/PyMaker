Natural Text
I am trying to use regex to get the url from the text file. And I am taking XML in the form of .txt format My text file is locations.txt. This is the text fileThe script I am using :But there is no output.
Do not use regular expressions to parse XML files (or any hierarchical/nested structures)DO NOT USE REGULAR EXPRESSIONS TO PARSE XML FILESIf you insist to pick up content between the nearest  and tags with regex:.Yours fails mostly because you're not escaping your backslashes, but even if you did you'd be getting three more groups instead of just the URL.
