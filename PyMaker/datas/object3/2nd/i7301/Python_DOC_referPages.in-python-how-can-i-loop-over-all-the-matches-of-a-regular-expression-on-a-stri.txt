I want to do something (more than just substitution) with substrings matching a pattern in a longer string. If an assignment were an expression returning a value, as in C and most other programming languages, this would be (using C syntax with Python semantics):or more verbosely, avoiding the use of an assignment as an expression:At least one of these is possible in most programming languages: C, C++, Java, Perl, Javascript, ... but neither of them seems to be possible in Python. Is there a pythonic equivalent (not involving a kludgey mess with a break or continue statement)?
You may be looking for finditer:Return an iterator yielding match objects over all non-overlapping matches for the RE pattern in string. The string is scanned left-to-right, and matches are returned in the order found. Empty matches are included in the result unless they touch the beginning of another match.
