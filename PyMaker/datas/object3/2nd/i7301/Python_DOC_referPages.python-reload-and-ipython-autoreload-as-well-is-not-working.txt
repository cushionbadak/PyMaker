I am using Python + IPython for Data Science. I made a folder that contains all the modules I wrote, organised in packages, something likeAt the beginning of each session I ask IPython to autoreload modules:Now... let's say a1.py contains a class, , that I want to call from one of the scripts. In the  of package  I import the moduleThen in the script I import the class I needIf there is some error in class A1 and I modify it, there is no way to have Python reload it without restarting the kernel.I tried with , , . Each time it uses the old version of the class until I don't restart the kernel... anyone can give me some suggestions?
This is funny. It seems that my problem is not due to IPython but to Pyzo (the IDE I'm using). I added a TestClass to a1:This is the output I get from running the commands in an IPython shell:Now I modify  to print 'BBB'So it was actually reloaded... also because if I skip running the autoreload commands at the beginning, it prints 'AAA' again. So it's working.Instead if I run the commands through Pyzo (create a script, select the lines and press F9 or right click on the editor tab and select 'Run file')  it doesn't get reloaded!Again I modify  to print 'BBB'
