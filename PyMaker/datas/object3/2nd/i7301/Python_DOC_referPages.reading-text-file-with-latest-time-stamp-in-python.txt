I have a small program through which I am trying to read log files generated in a file location like belownow the issue is this was good until I have only one single file. But now the files are generated at a certain interval with the timestamp as below.I want to modify the above program in such a way so that it should always check the file with the latest time stamp. Also, I want to loop this program to run every 5 mins to check for the latest file. If new file doesn't arrive within 5 min it should not read the old one (which is already been read)
If you're in the directory containing all those files, you can use  to get the latest file.You'd use it like this: returns a list of all files in the current directory.  with the key finds the file with the most recent modification time, and returns it.To loop over your directory every 5 minutes, you'll need to instate a  loop:
