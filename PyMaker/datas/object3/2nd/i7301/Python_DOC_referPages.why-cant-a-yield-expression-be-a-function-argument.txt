I simply want to tidy up the following code.I just moved the yield expression into the print function, but a syntax error occurs. I'm just wondering why a yield expression can't be a function argument like below? If yield works like an expression, it should be okay as a function argument.
You need to add another pair of parentheses around :The parentheses are part of the  expression syntax:but the parentheses are optional when it's the only expression in an assignment statement or a statement expression:The parentheses may be omitted when the yield expression is the sole expression on the right hand side of an assignment statement.Inside a call expression (such as ), the parentheses can't be omitted.
