This is my code to get second largest element from the list.I assumed that a list has at least two elements. However, it gives me 'gamma' not 'delta' from the input below.
You've initialized the largest and second-largest values to the first two items in the appropriate order, but then you're including them again in the loop. If the largest value was also one of the first two values, it will take up both slots after that point. You can fix it by creating an iterator from the list explicitly and advancing it for the first two elements:By not using indexed access, this also has the advantage of working on any iterable.For real-world use, see , which even has specific optimizations in CPython for small numbers of elements.
a simple way is to find max and remove it. finding the max is on o(n)and for second time:o(n)+...+o(n) ->  L * o(n) -> o(n)
