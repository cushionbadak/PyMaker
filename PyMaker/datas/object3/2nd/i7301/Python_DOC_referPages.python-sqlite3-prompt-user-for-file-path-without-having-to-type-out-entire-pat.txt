I am very new to python but i tried making a small program which imports a CSV into a sqlite3 database and matches column values with pdf names - creating folders and filling them with said pdfs. I'm currently usingto get the directory where the executable file exists and using real_file_path + "specific file name" to import my CSV and find my folder with pdfs which are in the same folder as the executable file. See exampleIs there a way to prompt a user for the path for both the CSV file and the folder with pdfs, without them having type in the entire path?
You can use  if using Python 3.4+:Here is the documentation for the library, pathlib.You can also use , however I've had some issues using it, which is why I use the implementation in the code provided.
