I'm trying to define a decorator that just adds one keyword argument to the decorated function .  might have any combination of (positional, keyword, etc) parameters. I tried this:If I try to use it with a function that accepts a single argument:I get an error because the any argument becomes the  parameter in . How should I do it correctly?
You can make  a keyword-only argument to achieve this. Currently the issue is that it is a positional argument and when you're doing  the  is being passed to  argument.Demo:
Just pass name where you are calling the function finner = f(name, *args, **kwargs)
