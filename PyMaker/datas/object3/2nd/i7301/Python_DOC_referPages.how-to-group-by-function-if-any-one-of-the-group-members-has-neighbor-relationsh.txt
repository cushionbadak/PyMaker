The function argument in  accepts a single argument, so you have to make use of partial functions to add the 'extra' one.https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.partialbut, of course, it means that you have to explicitly test every 'centre'.Btw, be aware of the sorting requirement on groupby - it seems likely that it may trip you up.
