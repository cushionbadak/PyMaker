I found this practice today:Detect whether a check number is valid or not. The check number must have 10 digits, can not have 2 or more zeros followed, nor three or more digits other than zero followedI've able to complete the first part with this code:any thoughts on how to create the logic to check if the check number has 2 consecutive 0.thanks
You can check if the number has two or more zeroes, or three or more digits by using built-in function , for example: returns  if any of the supplied expressions is . 
Let's say your check number is the variable  and it is 12300.
 is type , which gives you access to: - return True if string a is in string b, e.g. To check whether the trailing part is some number of zeroes, you can try  or look into regular expressions ( package in Python) if you don't know how many zeroes it might be.
A solution with  for detecting the others condition, as suggested by @Riaz, should be definitely better than what I'm about to suggest, but for the sake of completeness, one can also do the following using ,  returns a list of tuples with a number followed by it's number of consecutive duplicates (Reference):
something like :
If I understand the question ("two or more zeroes followed" means "two or more consecutive zeroes"?), the number must have exactly 10 digits.  It must not have two (or more) consecutive zeroes.  It must not have three (or more) consecutive digits other than zero.  (Three consecutive zeroes implies two consecutive zeroes, so that does constitute an invalid number because of the 2nd rule--we do not need to exclude zero from the last test).That gives that code
