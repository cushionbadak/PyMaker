I use RegEx & a String to get if this file name & similars to it exists in os.listdir('.') or not, If exists print('Yes'), If not print('No'), But If the file name even doesn't exists in my listdir('.') It shows me YES.How should I check that ?
 on Python 3 is lazy, it doesn't return a , it returns a generator, which is always "truthy", whether or not it would produce items (it doesn't know if it would until it's run out). If you want to check if it got any hits, the most efficient way would be to try to pull an item from it. On Python 3, you'd use two-arg  to do this lazily (so you stop when you get a hit and don't look further):If you need the complete  a la Py2, you'd just wrap it in the  constructor:On Python 2, your existing code should work as written.I'll note, what you're doing would usually be handled much better with the  module; I'd strongly recommend taking a look at it.
An alternative to your code (not considering additional requirements you might not have listed):
