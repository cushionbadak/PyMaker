I have a number of non-JPEG image files that I want to process using Google Cloud Vision, but the API only accepts certain formats (see question Cloud Vision API - PDF OCR and answer https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/supported-files).I can use PIL or some such to convert a TIFF to JPEG to be uploaded, but I'd like to avoid a temp file if possible.So, in python, how do I convert a TIFF in-memory for upload to GCV? numpy array, base64, string..?
As suggested, you should use StringIO or BytesIO for Python 3.See this question: Python resize image and send to google vision functionExample making a request string:
