I'd like to have some python code running and communicating with a nodejs express server. So far, I can get my nodejs server to call python functions via one of two mechanisms, either to spawn a python task or to have it talk to a zerorpc python server.For the first, a la http://www.sohamkamani.com/blog/2015/08/21/python-nodejs-comm/, this works:Where mytime.py isAnd with zerorpc http://www.zerorpc.io/, if this python code is running:This nodejs code works:But what I'd like to be able to do is instead of just having python functions called, I'd like a separate python process running and sending messages to the nodejs server which listens for them and then handles them. I've experimented with middleware socketio-wildcard, but if I try to set up a python server with zerorpc on the same port as the nodejs express server, it gives a zmq.error.ZMQError: Address already in use error.I know that I'm not thinking about this right--I know that I'm missing some logic around interprocess communication due to my naïveté here--so if there is a better way to do message sending from a python process with a nodejs server listening, I'm all ears.Any ideas?Many thanks in advance!
For those trying to figure this out, here's a solution thanks to Zeke Alexandre Nierenberg For the node.js server code:and the python code that sends it messages:Voilà!
I had some problems with socketIO version...so, this is my Solution: NodeJS:on Python:
