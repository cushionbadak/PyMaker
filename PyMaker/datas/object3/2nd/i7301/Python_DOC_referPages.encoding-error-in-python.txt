Codesince you said they are all strings, here you goThis should work for the formats and types you wantExplanationAccording to this, and specifically section 7.1.2.2, we can find the types needed as arguments for the following format characters:and since the data you want to format is of type , we need to change it.Lets start with making a  to and  since it's the simplest.Easy, all we need to do is call  on our string.Next up is turning a string into bytes. We use strings  method to do this (documentation)
Your original code was correct, except that the type of  was unexpected.  Your code snippet should reador some other suitable format code and encoding that turns  into your expected result.
