I need help in my code, I don't know why I'm getting 'IndentationError:unexpected unindent' in the line 10 (def plus(self, v):), someone could help me?
Try this:
In your  function, you are missing an  block. If you do not include this, your  statement is essentially useless. Make sure to add the  block to handle your !
The error is coming from when you are calling  what you need to do is add and  to it like such:The try and except concept means that you are trying to perform an action in python but if an error occurs within the  scope then whatever is in the  scope will run.Hope this helps :)
I'm gonna take a guess and say the code should look like this:The indentation in the code you provided was indeed wrong but i think the interpreter was expecting an 'except' statement(here just shown to pass but you should make it do something)
See the documentation on exceptions.
