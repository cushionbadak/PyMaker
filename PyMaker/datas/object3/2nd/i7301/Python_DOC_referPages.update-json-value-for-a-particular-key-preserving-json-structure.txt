I need to update the value for key () in the JSON file. Value is stored in the variable . I am able to update the key  with  (updated value), but the structure of the JSON file gets messed up. Can anyone suggest me a way to doing it without messing up the JSON structure?Code:Input JSON:Output JSON:
I'm guessing you're referring to the order of keys in you dictionary (later in serialized JSON) that gets changed. That's because by default  uses  as an underlaying mapping type.But you can change that to a dictionary type that preserves order, called :Note the use of  in . From the docs: is an optional function that will be called with the result of any object literal decoded with an ordered list of pairs. The return value of object_pairs_hook will be used instead of the . This feature can be used to implement custom decoders that rely on the order that the key and value pairs are decoded (for example, collections.OrderedDict() will remember the order of insertion).
