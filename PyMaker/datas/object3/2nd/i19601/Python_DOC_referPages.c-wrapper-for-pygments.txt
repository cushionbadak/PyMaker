Is it possible to use pygments from a C application? Is there a C library for pygments? I need to use it from a C++ program. 
It's rather simple to embed Python. Then you can use Pygments from your application.In particular, look at section 5.3. There, they use user input for the module and function names, but you could just as easily use a constant  and such to call the necessary functions in the Pygments API.
