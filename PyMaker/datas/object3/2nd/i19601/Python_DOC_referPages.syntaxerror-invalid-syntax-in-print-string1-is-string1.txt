I get an error that reads:I am not sure what the problem is because I got it from a tutorial site and I'm not certain, but almost, that they wouldn't put a file on there that doesn't compile. So I was wondering what I am doing wrongHere is the python code that I am using:Any help is appreciated, thanks. 
In Python 3.3,  is a function (in Python 2.x, it was a statement). So the correct syntax is now:There is a tool called  which converts Python 2 to 3.
The problem is that in Python 3  is not a statement, but a normal function. Just put  and  around the arguments to the  function and you should be fine.
This code is for Python 2.x. Print statements in Python 3.x are different as per this section from the Python documentation:
In python3,  is a function: etc
