I'm trying to use super() for a simple class hierarchy in this manner: However, I'm getting this error: I've read that you need to make the parent object type object (new style classes) in order for super to work. If I change class Employee(object) to class Employee(), I get this error: What's going on? 
You use the current class in : looks for requested methods relative to the first argument; you started the search from  instead, looking for the parent classes;  is the next parent method that matches in that case.You need to use the current class, because Python needs to search the base classes in Method Resolution Order; that ordering depends on how your current class is derived from it's base classes (especially if there is multiple inheritence or a base class ends up being referenced multiple times).On Python 3.x, you can use  without any arguments, and the compiler will add an extra hint to your method so that it can determine the correct class to start from.
When you use  in Python, you should be specifying the derived type (that is, the class in which you're writing the call) as the first parameter.
