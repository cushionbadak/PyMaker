How do I run the following in Python?I got this:How do I insert the output of the  process to  and keep the print output of my python process as usual? As in, don't redirect everything to stdout?
For Python 3.3 and later, just use :Note that this redirects both  and . If you only wanted to redirect  (as your  line implies you might), leave out the  part.If you need to be compatible with older versions, you can use . So, this works for everything from 2.6 on (including 3.3):Or, for 2.4 and later (still including 3.3):Before 2.4, there was no  module, so that's as far back as you can reasonably go.
