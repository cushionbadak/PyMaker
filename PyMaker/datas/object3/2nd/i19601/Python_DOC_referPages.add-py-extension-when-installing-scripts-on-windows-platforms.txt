The problem I'm trying to solve is that Windows requires a  extension to recognize and execute Python scripts.I have a package set up like the following:In my setup.py file I declare  as an installable script withThe  script is just a thin wrapper that simply calls :On *nix platforms, this installs  as an executable by the name of , which is what I desire, but on Windows, it also installs as  in the  directory, and is thus not recognized on the command line. How can I get the setup script to install  as  on Windows, so that Windows recognizes the file type to make it executable?

As a result, the user can now enter  on the command line of either *nix or Windows platforms and always have it run the same program. Very handy!
