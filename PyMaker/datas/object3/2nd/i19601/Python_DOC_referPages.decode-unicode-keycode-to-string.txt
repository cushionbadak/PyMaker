Using Python, I'm reading lines from a Logfile produced by a Firefox extension. One of the inputs in the log is a number that represents the value returned by Event.keycode() that has been used on a keyup event.While reading the loglines, I want to convert those keycode values to the char they're representing. Example logfile line:In this case the 16 is the value returned by Event.keycodeSolved this problem already in Java using a scriptengine and converting the value with javascript. Maybe that could be used for python, too?Note:Python only, the data is already gathered and there is no changing the extension or w/e
What about this, assuming the keycode is a Unicode code point ?See also python doc for chr
