Natural Text
I'm making a text-based rpg with python 3.3 and I am wanting a more dynamic inventory system for my game. I am currently using variables assigned to each item but with functions, the variables I am passing as arguments are becoming too many and quite cluttered. If there is a better way out there I would love help creating a better system.Here is how my inventory call system looks right now:and so on.
Well, I have an old text game I made and the inventory system I use is just a list named 'inv'. Then all you have to do when you gain an item of whatever type is to append the inventory list with the string.Then you can create a dictionary with the key as the item name and the value be a list you can reference. Try this:And the list can be a bunch of different attributes such as buy sell price, strength or what have you. Hope this helps.
You could try and use a list:And you can implement an inventory cap:If you want to 'use' an item in the inventory, say, then it's also easy to remove (this is of course assuming the index exists):Obviously most of the functionality you need is accessible through standard list methods, so check the documentation out.
