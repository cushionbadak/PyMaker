I have a class with a function like this:And I call it like this:and I get this error:but this works fine:Can anyone explain why this could be happening? It's weirding me out a littleIf you need more info please feel free to askEDIT here's an approximation of the actual code...I suspect I am misunderstanding how  works... I'm doing some reading now
The issue here is that the new function does not accept self as an argument, seeing as you're creating a new object in it. The first argument is in fact the class, usually shortened as cls.SourceCorrected sample:This will create an instance of MyClass instead of cls. If MyClass is a subclass of cls, then it's init method will also automaticly be called (see linked reference)
 needs to return an instance. It gets MyClass as an argument, not an instance of MyClass. To instantiate  in ,  is employed. This is to prevent infinite recursion is called automatically on the returned value of  so long as this value is of type MyClass. This can be prevented by playing with the metaclass
