Here is the sample dict oneand the second dict is here is the key container(of type )and all work good.But i try to shorten the codelike thisnow,  is  i want to make this key container in one line code.how to achieve it?
 modifies the list in-place and doesn't return anything. Are you sure your first snippet works?
While the other answer by Pavel Anossov answered the question you explicitly asked, I would still argue that it's not the best solution to the problem at hand. Dictionaries are unordered, and can't have duplicate keys, so using a list to store the keys is inherently misleading and a bad idea.Instead, it is a much better idea to store this data in a set - sets don't have order, and can't contain duplicates, and so fill this role much more effectively.In Python 3.x,  gives a set-like dictionary view, so this would be best done with:We use the  (binary or) operator, which, on sets and set-like objects, signals a union (all elements in one set or the other).In 2.7, the same behaviour can be obtained with :In older versions, then we can use  with :
