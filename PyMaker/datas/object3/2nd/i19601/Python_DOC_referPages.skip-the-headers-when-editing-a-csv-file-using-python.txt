I am using below referred code to edit a csv using Python. Functions called in the code form upper part of the code. Problem: I want the below referred code to start editing the csv from 2nd row, I want it to exclude 1st row which contains headers. Right now it is applying the functions on 1st row only and my header row is getting changed.I tried to solve this problem by initializing  variable to  but it didn't work.Please help me in solving this issue.
Your  variable is an iterable, by looping over it you retrieve the rows.To make it skip one item before your loop, simply call  and ignore the return value.You can also simplify your code a little; use the opened files as context managers to have them closed automatically:If you wanted to write the header to the output file unprocessed, that's easy too, pass the output of  to :
Another way of solving this is to use the DictReader class, which "skips" the header row and uses it to allowed named indexing.Given "foo.csv" as follows:Use DictReader like this:
Doing  won't change anything, because you'll just overwrite that with the results of the loop.You want to do  to skip one row.
