I'm looking for a quick way to auto produce REST API docs from a Flask REST API I've written. Does anyone know of tools that can do this and how I would markup the code?
I would recommend you Sphinx, you add your documentation as  and the  module of Sphinx will generate the docs for you (docs.python.org also uses Sphinx). The markup is reStructuredText, similiar to Markdown (if you prefer Markdown, you can use pdoc).e.g.:
I really like Swagger because it allows to generate an API documentation by just adding a few decorators and comments into your code. There is a Flask Swagger available.Then you can see your methods and notes in an html interface just by visiting /api/v1/spec (it serves needed static automatically). You can also just get all your API description in JSON and parse it otherwise.
There is a Flask extension: flask-autodoc for auto documentation specially parsing endpoint route rule. You can add  decorator to specify which APIs you want to doc: The simple html documentation page is like this:
