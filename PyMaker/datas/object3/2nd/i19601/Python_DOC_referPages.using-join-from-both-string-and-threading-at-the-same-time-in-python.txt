In one of my script, I used join() method from both string and threading of python. I tried to use  to rename the module name like this:But I always cannot get the string join imported properly. I check the official doc, both  class paths should be right. What should I do to use the two join at the same time?EDITInitially I didn't import str.join(). But since I got type error, I thought I should rename the join(). But later, I realized that I passed wrong thing into the str.join(), this is the real reason why I got type error. My fault!
 is a method, used on an instance of a string, so, for example:No need to import anything. I use a string literal here as an example, but of course, any string can be used. This is then the 'glue' that joins the strings from the iterable (passed to the method) together.This is also true of  - you should make an instance of the  class and use the  method on that instance.Note that due to the way Python works, you can access these methods directly from the class, then pass the instance as the first argument, however, this is generally a very bad idea, as it's harder to read and more effort than calling them normally.
str is a builtin, not a module, so you can't import from it.  You could however do:
