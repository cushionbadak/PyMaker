I'm reading Programming Python 4th Edition.Following are the codes(Python3.2):When I run it, there is no output on screen:Does anyone have ideas about this?
When the main thread exits, the entire process exits.You will need to make the main thread wait until the other threads complete.  There is no provision for this in the  API (it's so low-level).You can use , if you're willing to use a better API.
The underscore  means that it is a private API ( module had been obsolete since 2005); you should use  module instead:You don't need to call  method explicitly; non-daemon threads are joined automatically before the main thread exits.
Why don't you use  module (check here)? In your example the main thread exits before child threads can print anything. For example, if you add the following at the end of your example, works on my system:But still you can't guarantee that main thread will not exit  before all child threads exits in more complicated cases. You have following choices:Set flags from each child thread and keep checking the flags from main thread before exiting (bad approach).Use  to sleep for maximum time all child threads can take to exit (also a bad approach).Use  to wait until each child exits (good approach). (as evident from other answers)
