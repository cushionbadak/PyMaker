This script was supposed to be a quick Clearcase supporting script, it's my first go at Python as I decided to dump Perl.subprocess.Popen/communicate is called to run a Clearcase command that returns an empty string, however I am completely unable to accurately test for this returned value:The wonder is the difference in the  comparison's behaviour between running the script directly in a DOS box or in PyDev in Eclipse.  They seem to always return the opposite result.  As it is above this works as expected (ie. hijacked) on PyDev, fails in the command prompt.  Make the comparison  and PyDev delivers the expected result, but not the command prompt.This is the latest Python 3.3 on Win7 and I expected to have nailed this script hours ago.What on earth am I doing wrong?
First of all, good choice to stick to Python (see this, especially the "Alt" text when you mouse-over the cartoon).Maybe you could try:This will make strings like  and  all be like "".Anyway, it sounds strange to me that PyDev gives a different result.
As ever with these things the answer is usually 'fish'...  Here for the sake of completion is the answer:Running a command in the Windows command prompt it seems enough to just give the name of the command, however if the the same run is repeated inside Eclipse then the extension must be given.  In my example above I use  where to be totally correct it is , ie. with extension.Eclipse has a more 'UNIX' like environment that is fussy about these things.  This means that my run was failing in Eclipse as the command was not found, the resulting empty string was similar to what I expected so hard to spot the difference.
