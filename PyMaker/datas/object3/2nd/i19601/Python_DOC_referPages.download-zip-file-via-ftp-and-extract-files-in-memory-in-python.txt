I'm trying to download a zip file via ftp, but then extract the files inside without ever actually saving the zip.  Any idea how I do this?
The  module allows downloading files via FTP.The  module allows extracting files from a zip file.Here's the key, the  class allows you to pass in-memory bytes to anything that expects a file. (In Python 2.x, the  module provides similar functionality.)
use zipfile.openit opens a member from the archive into memory. Since ZipFile accepts any file-like object as parameter, you may get it from many sources, like HTTP/FTP serverscheck also Python in-memory zip library
The zipfile module can be used to extract things from a zip file; the ftplib would be used to access the zipfile.  Unfortunately, ftplib doesn't provide a file-like object for zipfile to use to access the contents of the file.  I suppose you could read the zip & store it in memory, for example in a string, which could then be wrapped up in a file-like object (StringIO), although you're still getting the whole zip, just not saving it to disk.If you don't need to save the individual files, but just access (i.e. read) them, zipfile will allow you to do this.
