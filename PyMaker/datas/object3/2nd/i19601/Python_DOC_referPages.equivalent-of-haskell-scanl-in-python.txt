You can use this, if its more elegant:Use it like:Python 3.x has . It is implemented as below. The implementation might give you ideas:
I had a similar need. This version uses the python list comprehension  gives:
As usual, the Python ecosystem is also overflowing with solutions: Toolz has an accumulate capable of taking a user-supplied function as an argument.
