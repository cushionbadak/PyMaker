I have function declaration like:and if *list_of_objects* not passed (is None) I need to define it like empty list. The explicit way is:orDoes above code equals the next one?I tested it, but I'm still not sure
The idiomatic way is: is a singleton so you can use  operator for comparison.Your code tests truthness of  (all  and  variants are equivalent in this case). The following values are considered false in Python:NoneFalsezero of any numeric type, for example, , , .any empty sequence, for example, , , .any empty mapping, for example, .instances of user-defined classes, if the class defines a  or  method, when that method returns the integer zero or bool value False.All other values are considered true â€” so objects of many types are always true.
No, since  is not the only false object. Also included are , , , and of course .
The usual practice is:Use None because it is easy to distinguish from other false values such as an empty list or an empty tuple.Use an  test instead of equality test because None is a singleton (this is the preferred practice, per PEP 8).
