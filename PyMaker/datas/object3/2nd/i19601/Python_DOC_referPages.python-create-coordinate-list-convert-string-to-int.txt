I want to import several coordinates (could add up to 20.000) from an text file. These coordinates need to be added into a list, looking like the follwing:However when i want to import the coordinates i got the follwing error:I can't figure out how to import the coordinates correctly. Does anyone has any suggestions why this does not work?I think there's some problem with creating the integers.I use the following script:The coordinates needed to be imported are looking like (this is "Bronbestand" in the script):Thus the script should result in:I also tried importing the coordinates with the native python csv parser but this didn't work either.Thank you all in advance for the help!
Other answers have said why your script fails, however, there is another issue here - you are massively reinventing the wheel.This whole thing can be done in a couple of lines using the  module and a list comprehension:Gives us:We open the file, make a  to parse the csv file, skip the header row, then make a list of the numbers parsed as floats, ignoring the first column.As pointed out in the comments, as you are dealing with a lot of data, you may wish to iterate over the data lazily. While making a list is good to test the output, in general, you probably want a generator rather than a list. E.g:Note that the file will need to remain open while you utilize this generator (remain inside the  block).
Your numbers are not integers so the conversion to int fails.Try using float(i) instead of int(i) to convert into floating point numbers instead.
