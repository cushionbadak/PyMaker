I am using Python 3.3  I want to edit a google earth POI file (.klm) which is 1.4Mb on a single line. I need to isolate records of variable length which begin  and end , check each for a particular word, throw away those without it, and save what's left.Are there tools for doing this?
KML is a XML format.Use an XML parser to parse it (such as , included in the standard library, or ).You could use a dedicated package such as PyKML to give you a higher-level API to the information contained, although that specific package is not yet Python 3 ready. I did manage to run the  tool on the files of that project though, so your mileage may vary. The tests fail but the failures look benign (typical python 2 to 3 translation differences).
