I was looking through some lab material from a computer course offered at Berkeley U C and came across some examples on the form of questions on a test about python. 1 and 2 and 3 answer 3I've goggled it till i was red in the fingers, but to no avail.. Could someone be kind enuff to direct me to some docs that explain this?? I've no clue what the hell is going on here..
In Python, all numbers that are not 0 are evaluated as .  Only 0 is evaluated as . In this code,  really evaluates as .  Therefore, it must return .  Now we know that 3 is the same as  - that's why the interpreter is correct in returning 3.  So why does it return 3 when it could make life easy and return ?  That's just the way python is - it returns the last evaluated value.  Hope that answers your question!
See the Language Reference:All other values are interpreted as true.E.g. numbers > 0 are interpreted as true.The expression  first evaluates x; if x is false, its value is  returned; otherwise, y is evaluated and the resulting value is  returned.Its actual value (not interpreted value) is returned.
From the docs:The expression x and y first evaluates x; if x is false, its value is  returned; otherwise, y is evaluated and the resulting value is  returned.The expression x or y first evaluates x; if x is true, its value is  returned; otherwise, y is evaluated and the resulting value is  returned., only 
 and  returns true if both x and y are true; while or  returns if either one is true. similarly multiple  returns  if all are true.
