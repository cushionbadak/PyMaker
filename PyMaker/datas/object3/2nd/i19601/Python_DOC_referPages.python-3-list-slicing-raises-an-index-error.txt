I've encountered a problem, which I guess is some sort of bug in either Python, my computer/windows, or both.So far it hasn't been a problem to me and I haven't even known it's not supposed to happen.When slicing a list out of it's index, value of  should be returned:And this does indeed work on my mac and on my friend's computer as it's supposed to.However, when I'm on my PC (Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit, Finnish), I get I've got both Python 3.3.0 and 2.7.3, it works fine on 2.7.3 but the error raises on 3.3.0. I already tried reinstalling both versions, no effect. Python documentation also says it shouldn't raise an error on Python 3: http://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#IndexErrorI can easily work my way around it with a simple , but I'd rather not use something which should not be needed.Didn't find much from google, was wondering if anyone else is encountering the same, and if there's a solution to this? Or should I perhaps contact the python developers?
No. I'm unable to reproduce this error on a Win7 64bit Python 3.3.0 installation. In the command shell as well as in IDLE, the behaviour I see is exactly as expected.Please provide more details about any changes you might have made to your environment.
