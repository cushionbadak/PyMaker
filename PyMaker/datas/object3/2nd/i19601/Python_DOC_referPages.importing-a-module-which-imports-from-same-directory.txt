Suppose I have a project set up as follows:In  I have:In  I have:When I run  I get a  because  cannot be found - since test.py is in a different directory.I know I can fix this in  by writing , but this seems far too verbose to do throughout the project.Is there a better way?
 is the best way to do it. It may be a little verbose, but it is explicit which is generally a desirable quality in Pythonic code.
I think you can useSince that's relative, it should always work.See http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#intra-package-references
You can try relative imports in , e.g.But this may not be a complete solution to your problem. As with any modules that  modules/packages in a higher level of the directory structure, you have to be careful how you run it. Specifically, running a module as  implicitly sets the module's  variable to . Since imports (relative and absolute alike) depend on that  and the , running a submodule directly may make imports behave differently (or break, as in your case). Try running your  as from the top level of the package instead of running it directly.
