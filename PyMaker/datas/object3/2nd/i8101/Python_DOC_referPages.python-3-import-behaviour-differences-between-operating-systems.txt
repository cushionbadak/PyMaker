I'm probably in need of some major sleep, but this is making it hard for me to even consider it.I have the following structure in 2 separate machines:The machines in question are:CentOS (Linux release 7.2.1511)macOS Sierra (10.12.4)I'm most definitely running Python 3.6 on both machines:Python 3.6.1 (default, Apr  7 2017, 09:32:32) [GCC 4.8.5 20150623 (Red  Hat 4.8.5-11)] on linuxPython 3.6.1 (v3.6.1:69c0db5050, Mar 21 2017, 01:21:04) [GCC 4.2.1  (Apple Inc. build 5666) (dot 3)] on darwinThe only file with content is test.py:From the root dir (where testmod and testmod2 coexist), I'm running the following command:macOS output:Centos output:I'm stumped. What have I obviously missed here?
I see that on Centos the script dir is not prepended to your sys.path. On my Ubuntu box it is prepended and everything works. I found the following doc on the topic: The python command has a new option, -I, which causes it to run in “isolated mode”, which means that sys.path contains neither the script’s directory...Maybe you need to check what options are used when python runs by default.
For anyone else wondering, my $PYTHONPATH was not set at all in CentOS. I suspect others might run into the same issue, so a solution could be:Although this will work, it's not really recommended to add a relative path to $PYTHONPATH - It's probably wiser to add the absolute path where your code resides:(a more permanent solution is of course to add the above to your ~/.bashrc or similar)
