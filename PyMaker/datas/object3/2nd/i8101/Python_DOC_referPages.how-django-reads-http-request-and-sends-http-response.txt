If I write a simple http server in C. I can read http request through a file descriptor generated by  function in a while loop. And I can send http response to client through that file descriptor.In Django I know the  object will be passed to view function as a argument, but I want to know which function reads the  through the socket and generate a  object? I know view function will return a  object. But which function will send the actual http response to the client? And where is the while loop?
Django doesn't do this. It implements WSGI standard and sits behind a WSGI server (such as Gunicorn or uWSGI) and lets it interact with sockets. If you want to learn more about it, you need to look up what's going on inside a wsgi server.
