I am not very familiar with python. I am using  with python 3.5. This may be a naive question.In the  folder, I can see a  file. So the  should be a package according to the doc. But when I run below code, it says  is a module.Shouldn't it be  instead of ?
All Python packages are of type .From the docs:Technically, a package is a Python module with a  attribute.
Shouldn't it be package 'sklearn' instead of module 'sklearn'?No. A package contains several modules (like a directory contains several files)
