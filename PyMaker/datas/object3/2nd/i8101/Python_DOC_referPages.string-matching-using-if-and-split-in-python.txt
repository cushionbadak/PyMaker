All, Can someone explain why the second code doesn't return True?1st codeOutput: 2nd CodeOutput: What is this particular difference between  (list) and  (array) that causes this Mismatch ?
'geetansh' is a string in python.Sothat check whether the string 'geetansh' contain a string 'geeta'.On the other hand, 'geetansh'.split() is a list in python. split() return a list, so 'geetanch'.split() return ['geetansh']. Sothat check whether the list ['geetansh'] contain a item 'geeta'. The list ['geetansh'] only contain item 'geetansh'.
The basic difference is, str.split() returns a list!When you compare , the comparison is like, is a list, then a must be an item in b. is a string, then a part of a is in bThat is,
The  method return an array Use this instead:
 returns a list, , so it does not actually contain .
