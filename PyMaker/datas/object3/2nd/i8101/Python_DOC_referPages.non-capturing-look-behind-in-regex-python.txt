I want to extract net profit from the statement, with 'net profit' as the non capturing part. Not sure how to do it(may be a non capturing look behind?)eg'business venture of net profit 23.5 million dollars'required o/p:23.5 millionApplied the following regex:But, it is giving [('net', 'profit')]as the output.
Try with below regex you will get the result in group 1,DEMO
You didn't capture the digitgroup. Also you need a non-capturing group with the 'net' and 'profit'so this should work:Edit to capture million..etcExample at:https://regex101.com/r/EXCzeV/2
