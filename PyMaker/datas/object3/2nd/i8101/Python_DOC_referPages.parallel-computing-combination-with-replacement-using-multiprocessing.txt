I'm trying to get the all possible combination with replacement and make with each of them some calculation. I'm using the code below:How can I parallelize this calculation using multiprocessing?
You can use the standard library . A bit more explanations:This code creates an executor using . Another possibility would be to use  but full python threads only run on one core so it might not be the solution of interest in your case as you need to run heavy computation.The map object return a asynchronous object. Thus, the line  is non blocking and you can do other computation before collecting the result in the  loop.It is important to declare the  function out of the  block and to declare and use the executor in this block. This prevent for infinite executor spawning and permit to  the worker function to pass it to the child process. Without this block, the code is likely to fail.I recommend this over  as it has a more clever way to dispatch the work as you are using an iterator.Note that your computation for combination of  with 5 elements  might not be possible. It needs to compute  elements. By parallelizing, you will only reduce your computation linearly by a factor , so in this case  and each process will need to run with  elements, which should take about  years if each computation is done in 1 micro second.
