I am trying to implement a restricted boltzmann machine in C++. I am using this Python code as a guide:https://github.com/echen/restricted-boltzmann-machines/blob/master/rbm.pyThis is Line 37:pos_hidden_states and pos_hidden_probs are both 2D matrices, of type  in C++, and num_examples and num_hidden are both integers. Could anyone explain what the greater-than symbol means here?
Probably not easy to translate  into C++, lot's of abstraction in . Anyway, it's acting as a vectorized comparison, because  returns a , which if  is either a scalar or a  it will behave in a vectorized (i.e. elementwise) manner:If  is some sort of , the behavior might be influenced by broadcasting, a feature of numpy:
The  operator works element-wise in NumPy, e.g.gives you NumPy also does broadcasting, which gives meaning to comparison between arrays of different dimensions.
The > is comparing the hidden prob (a float in this case) against each item in a 2d numpy array and returning a 2d array of boolean values:
Due to operator overloading, the  operator can do practically anything -- it simply invokes the  special method on the object. But absent any other information, I would expect it to simply evaluate "greater than" and return a  value.
