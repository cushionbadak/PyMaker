Natural Text
I have two methods to sum numbers found in a text file.  The first one works and the second one does not.  Can anyone explain what is wrong with the second one?.Input text file:Method #1:This gives the correct answer 1368 (= 123 + 456 + 789).Method #2:This produces the error:I'm playing around with generators so the question is really about why the generator in method #2 is no good.  I don't need suggestions on other ways to add up numbers in a text file.  I would like to know if there is a generator-only solution without a standard for loop.  Thank you.
You reversed the order of your loops. Generator expressions (like all Python comprehension syntax variants) list loops from left to right in block nesting order.This works:because it matches the nesting order of the normal  loops (with only the per-iteration expression at the front):Your code tried to access  before the  loop could execute and set .See the expressions reference documentation:The comprehension consists of a single expression followed by at least one  clause and zero or more  or  clauses. In this case, the elements of the new container are those that would be produced by considering each of the  or  clauses a block, nesting from left to right, and evaluating the expression to produce an element each time the innermost block is reached.Bold emphasis mine.
