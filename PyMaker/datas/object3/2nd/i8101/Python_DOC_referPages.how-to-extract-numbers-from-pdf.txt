Natural Text
(Python 3.4.3)Hello, I'm very new to Python and I want to extract numbers from a PDF file. For more details, I wanted to create a histogram depicting the scores of those approved on a university. Because of that, all numbers below 500 and above 900 shouldn't be considered, as no one gets approved with these given scores.
You first need a PDF parser since Python by default is not capable of reading it. A SO answer posted here Python module for converting PDF to text suggested to use PDFMINER for it - http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/python/pdfminer/index.htmlHowever youve not provided any examples of how the numbers are represented. You need to make some kind of a custom line parser using regex/patterns to define rules how to extract these numbers. The difficulty mainly depends if the PDF contains only raw statistical data, if  not, you also need to be careful not to take in all numbers, that is the ones that actually do not refer to any statistical data but are just in a sentence.You can learn more about regular expressions in python from here https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.htmlIf regex is new to you, you can learn and experiment with it herehttp://regexr.com/ .
