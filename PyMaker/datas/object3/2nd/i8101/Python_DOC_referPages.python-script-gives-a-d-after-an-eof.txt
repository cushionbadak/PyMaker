I have written a simple Python3 program like below:But after sending a 'Ctrl-D' EOF I get this:It gives a 'D' after the answer.But if I add 5 and 5 it doesn't:Why does it send 'D' with the first, but not the second?
This is an artifact of your terminal.Change your code to this:And you will see what happens:First, you press control-D, and the terminal shows ^D on the screen.Then a delay occurs.Finally, python's  emits 1 or 2 letters (depending on your input), which overwrite the '^D' that the terminal displayed when you pressed Ctrl-D. I'd suggest that you start using the  function, which does a better job dealing with the user. ;-)
