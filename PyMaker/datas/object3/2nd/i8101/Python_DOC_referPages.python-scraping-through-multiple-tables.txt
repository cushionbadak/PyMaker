I am attempting to loop this through 4 different tables on the same website but I can't figure out how to write the loop. I have done research on it and can't seem to find out what to doThe 4 tables are at the locations 0, 1, 2 and 6. I have tried slicing the data to include them, but nothing seems to want to work
You can find all tables matching your filtering criteria, use  to get the indexes and "filter out" tables at undesired indexes:In general, though, relying on the occurrence index of an element on a page does not sound like a reliable technique to locate an element on a page.
