I have a program where I get numbers like: 0.18869952857494354248046875I need to change these from string to float, but when I do that, I get: 0.18869952857494354Why does python cut off ~10 digits and how can I retain them in the transfer?
The limitations of floating point math mean that you can't have arbitrarily long floating point numbers: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.htmlYou can get around this by using the  library (https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html#module-decimal):By default the  library has 28 places of precision but you can change this using :
This happens because  datatype in python can show upto 16 digits precision. For higher precision (to retain all digits) , use special packages like : mpmathYou can use it like:
