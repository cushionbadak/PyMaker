I have a python class,called settings, which includes an  method for setting some values as below:In another python file(main script), I define an instance of my settings class via this codes:But when I run my main python script, I got this error:I expect that when I am defining an instance of a class, settings class here, its init function will be triggered and I will have values for its attributes.
The variables are local to the  of your class. To have them as instance attributes, you need to bind them to the instance using say a dot reference to the instance:Synonymous (but less verbose) to binding attributes to/setting attributes on the instance using :On another note, you don't need that  statement since you only want to set new attributes on the instance; nothing to do with the global namespace.You could easily check the behavior of the new  as being different from the previous by analyzing the bytecode:Notice how we are not calling the popular  as with a vanilla assignment but .
So far you have only created "normal" variables in your  method. They are only accessible locally within that function. If you want to create instance attributes you have to assign them to :
I believe I had a similar problem some time ago, not sure my solution is the best practice, but it did achieve my goal that was to create a datetime variable for each user, getting the start time of a survey, I simply needed to declare the variable global in the Get method (survey start), so I could be able to pass it to the Post method (survey ended).  Then I could compare start time to the end time, and calculate time spent answering the survey for each participant. After a review, I see other more simpler way to reach the same goal, in any case, here is the code I used:class EmView(DistanceMixin, RegistredIP, View):
