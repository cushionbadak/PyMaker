I'm not too familiar with python and how it should work with my code. I'm trying to POST data to python script and get the return from it, but it seems the python script is not receiving it. I have tried to look here for various posts but still confused why this is not working as i want it to.Am I missing something?My JS:Here is the HTML:The Python script:
You say in the comments that this is supposed to be run via CGI, but you haven't structured it as a CGI script at all. CGI scripts don't read from command-line parameters; they take input via stdin, and Python provides the  class for processing those parameters and accessing them via a dictionary-like interface.Also, your script does nothing with the result of your function; it simply throws it away. A CGI script needs to write a response to stdout, which must be in HTTP format: ie, one or more header lines, a blank line, then the output. In a Python CGI script, you can produce these simply via .Note that you are very cleverly hiding any of the useful error information Python would give you, by including a catch-all  clause that simply prints 'ERROR'. Don't do that. Exceptions exist for a reason, which is to show you exactly what went wrong. Remove that try/except.
