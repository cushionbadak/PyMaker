Is it possible to store a  function inside a variable?Imagine we have the following code:I save the function get_i inside a variable and use it. The output is as expected:Now lets look at the same code, but this time with an  function:Now  is not the function anymore (It is the value 0). Is there any way to still store the function inside the f_i variable?
The whole point of a  is that it is called on access. You'd have to bypass the descriptor protocol to prevent this.You can do this by accessing the  object on the class instead:then bind it to an instance later on:Or you could access the  getter function on the property object, bind it to  to create a bound method, and store the result for later calling:Accessing the property on the class still invokes the descriptor protocol, but in that case  returns the property itself.Demo:
