Natural Text
I am trying to create an array from a text file with both numbers and letters (as a header), however when I try to convert and open my file I end up getting the error:ValueError: invalid literal for float(): 0orValueError: could not convert string to float: AAI understand that this is a data type problem and was wondering if anyone knew a way around this? I'm new to python and usually code in Matlab. my text file consists of: and the code I have tried is belowAfter that, I need to cut all the columns that have zeroes and keep the ones that have 1s in them. The text files to be loaded in will be different each time and I only need to see which cells and headers have been populated with a 1.
 allows a dtype parameter, something like this will read mixed data:How should I solve this?So, now that we have answered the how do I make  read my file, let's go with how I would solve the problem of analyzing the zeros and ones in the file.  The following code snippets read in the file, and then find which columns contain any ones, and all ones.1: Use the csv moduleThe csv module can be used to parse this file.2: Use pandas can also be used to do this work.  More learning curve than the above, but you get what you pay for.Results of csv and pandasFile1:
Lets say your file is called  and inside there is:You can read the file with:Create list from string (that is what  is now):Print every entry in the list (replace  new line character):
