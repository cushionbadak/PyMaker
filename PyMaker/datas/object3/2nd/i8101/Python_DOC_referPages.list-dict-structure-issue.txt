I'm confused on how to structure a list/dict I need. I have scraped three pieces of info off ESPN: Conference, Team, and link to team homepage for future stat scrapping.When the program first runs, id like to build a dictionary/list so that one can type in a school and it would print the conference the school is in OR one could select an entire conference and it would print the corresponding list of schools. The link associated with each school isn't important that the end user know about but it is important that the correct link is associated with the correct school so that future stats from that specific school can be scraped.For example the info scrapped is:SEC, UGA, www.linka.comACC, FSU, www.linkb.cometc...I know i could create a list of dictionaries like:The problem is id have to create about 26 lists here to hold every conference which sounds excessive. Is there a way to lump everything into one list but still have the ability to to extract schools from a specific conference or search for a school and the correct conference is also returned? Of course, the link to the school must also correspond to the correct school.
Python ships with sqlite3 to handle database problems and it has an  mode for in-memory databases.  I think it will solve your problem directly and with clear code.In memory databases are so easy to create and query that they are often the easiest solution to the problem of how to have multiple lookup keys and doing analytics on relational data.  Trying to use dicts and lists for this kind of work just makes the problem unnecessarily complicated.
It's true you can do this with a list of dictionaries, but you might find it easier to be able to look up information with named fields.  In that case, I'd recommend storing your scraped data in a Pandas .  You want it so that "one can type in a school and it would print the conference the school is in OR one could select an entire conference and it would print the corresponding list of schools".  Here's an example of what that would look like, using Pandas and a couple of convenience functions.First, some example data:Now convert to :Type in school, get conference:Type in conference, get schools:It's unclear from your question whether you also want the links associated with schools returned when searching by conference.  If so, just update  to:
