Is there a C# equivalent of Python's range with ?Documentation:For a positive , the contents of a range  are determined by the formula  where  and .For a negative , the contents of the range are still determined by the formula , but the constraints are  and .Example:
We can implement a  utility class to handle this.For completeness, this solution mimics Python's  behavior for one parameter (), two parameters (, ), and three parameters (, , ):Example Usage with Step:Output:
I would go with two methods implementation. First one for parameters validation and providing defaults:That is required for iterators with deferred execution. Otherwise, you will not validate arguments until iterator will be executed. Which might happen a long time after you get an iterator reference. And iterator itself (actually with C# 7 you can use a local function instead of creating separate method):To implement Python's range behavior we need one more method which accepts only stop parameter. We can simplify code with C# 6 expression-bodied member:You also can make static methods available in global scope with C# 6. Assume class with Range method description is named PythonUtils:And usage in code will look likeYou can also use default valuesLooks like Pascal-case Python :)
