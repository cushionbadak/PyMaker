Is it possible to load a Latex package (like using ) inside a python code? For example,  I want to generate a variant font of the Greek letter \tau. Detexify suggests loading  package in Latex and then using  for the symbol. If it is not possible, what could be an alternative way? 
What do you want to do with those characters?As far as I'm aware python won't natively support this, as it's not able to print those characters to the shell. It only natively supports unicode. There are some greek characters available.If you want to display them then matplotlib might be a good place to start.
Modern TeX engines support fonts in TrueType (ttf) and OpenType (otf) format.Using the Python bindings (example) to the  and  libraries, you should be able to use these fonts.Alternatively, you could use freetype-py. This will load characters from fonts as bitmaps.Which one works best for your purpose is hard to say without further information on what you want to do with the fonts.If you want to output small amoumts of text in PDF or SVG format,  would be the way to go.To the best of my knowledge, neither Python (nor cairo) can deal with MetaFont fonts.A third way would be for your script to output (La)TeX code, and let the TeX engine render it. This would be my choice if you had to render a large amount of text because TeX can then deal with things like formatting, line breaking hyphenation and other typesetting related issues.
