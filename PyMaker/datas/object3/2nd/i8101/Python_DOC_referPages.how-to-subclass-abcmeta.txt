Normally, to subclass a class I do something likeBut now I'm trying to subclass a metaclass, specifically ABCMeta, so I'm doingBut, when I then try to subclass  as a metaclass likeI get the error .Why is this, and how do I subclass ABCMeta correctly?
From the datamodel:If  returns an instance of , then the new instanceâ€™s  method will be invoked like , where self is the new instance and the remaining arguments are the same as were passed to .So, as @user2357112 said, the signatures must match. Despite this, there's really no reason to define  and  if you simply want to create an ABC. Just create it and use  to register the conforming classes. Optionally, create a number of abstract methods and a  that checks for conformance. A good example already exists in the  module documentation.
