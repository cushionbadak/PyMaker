I've created a function () that will either  or  the results of functions.I'm doing this for running tests. (print shows the output, return will spit out the values but doesn't print the output).- Python noob; so, let me know if there is an easier way of doing this, like a "verbose" or testing keyword. I've been on this project for days.Modules required...Variables:The function:The problem:I don't understand why I get a  when I use  in the following function:Run it:
Try putting at the endreturn (p_r (yt_url, False))instead of just running the function

You clearly expect the  function to return a value:But the function does not return anything!  As @bell-_-0001 suggested, instead of just calling , you need to return its value:
It turns out I was "trying to reinvent the wheel"...user2357112 gave the best answer to my overall problem (although the answers from John Gordon and mohammad solve my question directly)I can use the built-in  to debug/test - and disable logging.The details of how to use the module are extensive, but I referenced The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python and made a quick code change to show how it works...The changes include: adding the creating a  configuration as replacing my  function with the  objectSimplified the  functionImports:Creates a logger configuration: Formats infoVariables:Function:Run it:Output: : url will switch between url1 and url2
