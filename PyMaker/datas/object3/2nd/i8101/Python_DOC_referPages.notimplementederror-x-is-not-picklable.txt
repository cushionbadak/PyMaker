Using Python 3.x, I am trying to iterate over a dictionary of datasets (NetCDF4 datasets). They are just files...I want to examine each dataset on a separate process:When I run my program, I get some message about 'pickable'What am I doing wrong? How can I fix this?Could it be that opening the file is done on another process, and so I am getting an error because I am trying to pass data loaded on 1 process to another process?
The  needs to serialize (pickle) the inputs to pass them to the new proccess which will run the . In your case the dataset object is a problem, see the list of what can be pickled.A possible workaround for you would be using multiprocessing with another function which reads the dataset and calls  on it.
