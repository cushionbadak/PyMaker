For some reason, I am not able to pass variables from one to another Python file.  Please see files below.:: works fine on its own when I print  and .  Just not able to export the variables to .  It should be simple, but for some reason, the variables just will not pass.  Thanks!
You're using  which imports everything from lenny1.py into the global namespace.  Not only that, but you're actually running everything in lenny1.py on the first import, which contains a while loop that could potentially block.  This is really bad code practice.  However, I think the problem you're having is that you are referencing  and  while using a starred import.  Just print  and  and it should in principle "work" provided the loop terminates.
