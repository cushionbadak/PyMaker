I'm using  in python. I'm pretty new to sql. My sql table has two columns  and  which represent an interval. I have another "input" list of intervals (represented as a pandas dataframe) and I'd like to find all the overlaps between the input and the db.My issue is that the above queries for overlaps with a single input interval, I'm not sure how to write a query for many overlaps. I'm also unsure how to effectively write this in python. From the sqlite docs:This seems difficult because I need to pass in a range for my expression, or a list of ranges, and so a single  probably won't cut it, right?I'd appreciate either sql or python+sql or suggestions for how to do this entirely differently. Thanks!
Putting multiple interval values into a single query becomes cumbersome quickly.Create a (temporary) table  for the intervals, and then search for any match in that table:It's simpler to write this as a join, but then you get multiple output rows if multiple inputs match (OTOH, this might actually be what you want):
