I am trying to draw a series of rectangles given the values stored in a list. For starters, nested loop is often the way to go. However, after some tests, it turned out to be a very bad idea.Here's an example:Needless to say that this is a terrible idea. For something of small size such as this, it may work fine. However, if the list of elements increases, that would cause problems. All in all, this method is a no go.After some research, I tried something else. What I was trying to do is quite simple. Instead of looping through all the values linearly as before, I decided to generate the elements on the fly, that is, the for loop returns the value, Tkinter reads it and uses it as coordinates. Then when the next value will be generated, the last one will be dumped.For one reason or another, Tkinter is reading all the variable at once and returning an error:How would I go about solving this? 
Assuming you want to draw four rectangles, you can combine your two lists of x and y coordinates into one list of x,y pairs with zip:this will result in the following:If you now want to draw four rectangles, with each of those coordinates being used to define the actual coordinates, you can loop over each pair like this:
