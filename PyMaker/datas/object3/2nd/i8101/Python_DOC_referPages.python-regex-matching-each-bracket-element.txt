I have been trying to come up with a regex for the following string:I am trying to get as match output each bracket with its content as a single element like the following:My initial naive approach was something like this:However, the .+ rule is too general and ends up matching the whole line.Any hints?
I am not sure about the data format you are trying to parse and where it is coming from, but it looks JSON-like. For this particular string, adding square brackets from the beginning and the end of the string makes it JSON loadable:Note how  becomes Python's .
The following code will output what you've requested using .Output:['[1,null,"7. Mai 2017"]', '[2,"test","8. Mai 2018"]', '[3,"test","9. Mai 2019"]']Consider changing  to  as it matches python representation.
You might consider the wonderful module pyparsing to do this:(Unless it is actually JSON -- use the JSON module if so...)
