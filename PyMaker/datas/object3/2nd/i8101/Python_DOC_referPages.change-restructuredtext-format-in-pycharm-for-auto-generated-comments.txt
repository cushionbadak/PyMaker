Natural Text
The documentation from JetBrains says, that there are two formats for creating reStructuredText comments with type-hinting:There used to be a way, how you could select one or the other way how comments were generated, but I can't find that setting in PyCharm 2017.1.2 anymore. Any ideas, where this setting went?I want to have type description  in the same line, but the standard way puts it in the next line.
It's in Settings -> Tools -> Python Integrated Tools -> Docstrings -> Docstring format. If I understand correctly the format you're after is the NumPy one.Also, if you're using Python>=3.5, you may already know about type hints in variables and function parameters, which looks super tidy and save you space in the docstring: https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.htmlAnd sphinx supports them with one of:https://github.com/agronholm/sphinx-autodoc-typehintshttps://github.com/nicolashainaux/sphinx-autodoc-annotation
