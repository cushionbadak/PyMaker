I am reading xyz trajectory files a lot. These files are structured in a way, that information corresponding to a time frame is stored in N lines. I would like to write an iterator similar to:but reading N line at once:Since the files are huge, I do not want to read the whole into memory,but the purpose is not to gain efficiency but to make a clean and reuseable code. Of course, one could check the index%N==0, and analyze when it is true,but I am a bit sick of writing that few lines over, and over, and over....Comments and answers are more than appreciated! 
The  documentation has a recipe for a generator function that does what you want:If you don't need to handle files that aren't an exact multiple of three lines long, you can simplify things a bit and just use  directly in your code.
