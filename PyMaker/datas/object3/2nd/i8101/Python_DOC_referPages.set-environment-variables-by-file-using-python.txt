You don't need to use subprocess.Read lines and split environment variable name, value and assign it to :or using  and generator expression:Alternatively, you can make a wrapper shell script, which s the , then execute the original python file.
Modern operating systems do not allow a child process to change the environment of its parent. The environment can only be changed for the current process and its descendants. And a Python interpreter is a child of the calling shell.That's the reason why  is not an external command but is interpreted directly by the shell to allow a change in its environment.It used to be possible in the good old MS/DOS system with  the .COM executable format. A .com executable file had a preamble of 256 (0x100) bytes among which was a pointer to the COMMAND.COM's environment string! So with low level memory functions, and after ensuring not overwriting anything past the environment, a command could change directly its parent environment.It may still be possible in modern OS, but require cooperation from system. For example Windows can allow a process to get read/write access to the memory of another process, provided the appropriate permissions are set. But this is really a hacky way, and I would not dare doing this in Python.TL/DR: if your requirement is to change the environment of the calling shell from a Python script, you have misunderstood your requirement.But what is easy is to start a new shell with a modified environment:
