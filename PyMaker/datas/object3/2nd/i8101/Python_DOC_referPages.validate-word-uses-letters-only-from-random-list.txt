I'm building a 'scrabble' game in Python. Basically, the user is given 7 randomly generated letters and these are stored in the list . They then enter a word using those letters - this is a string stored as .The bit I am stuck on is where I need to validate that the user has entered a valid word - e.g is  only using letters from .Expected behaviour:
You can use  operation to do this: is a data structure contains only unique items. The idea is, convert both of them set. And, then subtract  from  to see if  contains something that not in  . If it doesn't contain, the   is valid, otherwise not. 
RESULT
Python does not have a native multiset type so there's not quite a one-liner for this, but  helps a little:Using  at least saves you the loop you'd need to populate a plain  with the counts.
