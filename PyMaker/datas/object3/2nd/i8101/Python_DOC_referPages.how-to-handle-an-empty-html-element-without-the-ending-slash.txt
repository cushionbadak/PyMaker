I try to convert an HTML page into a tree structure. I have derived this class (I removed what I actually do with each tag as it's not relevant) :I expected empty elements to trigger the  method. The problem is that, when encountering an empty element like , only the  method is called. The tag is never closed from my class' point of view :prints :I need to know when each element has been closed to correctly create the tree. How can I know if a tag is an empty element ?
Checking the documentation, and specifically this example:Parsing an element with a few attributes and a title:  We can determine that this is the expected behavior.The best suggestion come from @HenryHeath 's comment: Use BeautifulSoup.If you don't want to use it though, you can work around the expected behavior of  as follows:This is a list of every HTML 5.2 void element.Create a list with those element names:In  check if the tag is in the  list:Good luck :)
