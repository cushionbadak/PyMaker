I have some datafile names already formed into strings of the following form:I want to extract the strings 'int', 'ext', 'm5' or 'm10' from it, to know which data I am working with. I saw it should be possible with a regular expression, which considers an unknown amount of numbers in the beginning and the '.dat' in the end.
