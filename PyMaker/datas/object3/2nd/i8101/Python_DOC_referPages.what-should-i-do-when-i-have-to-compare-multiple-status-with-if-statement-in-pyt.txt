This question already has an answer here:How do Python's any and all functions work?                    7 answers                Supposed that hi has hi[0]~hi[200] this range , and I want to proceed if statement only if hi[0~200] are include 1. If one of hi list has rather than 1 (ex) hi[5]==2), if statement should not proceed, but else statement runs.What should I do..?if hi[0]==1 and hi[1]==1 and ... etcis this the only way? 
If I understand your question correctly you want to check if all items within a range of the array have the value ?You can do this by checking if any item is equal to 1 using  and a generator expression:
You want to check if all the values in a given range are equal to , you need :returns  because all elements from 0 to 6 (inclusive) are 1. Now:returns  because not all elements from 0 to 6 are 1
Just loop through it like so:EDIT: based on OP's comment on @Andre's answer:
