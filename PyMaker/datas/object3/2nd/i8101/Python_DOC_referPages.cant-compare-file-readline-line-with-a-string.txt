Instead of parsing the html by yourself, take a look at this built-in python html parser (or this for python 2).It will probably be easier and more robust than any code you will write by your own.The example from the python documentation:To use this example just add a member to the class which keeps track of the  you have.
Make sure 'line' object does not have spaces at the beginning and at the end. You can strip it and then compare.Because,  is not equal to  Use  and then compare.
