Any ideas why this list that I'm passing as my command to subprocess() isn't expanding properly?The output is a gmake error, and if I join the cmd to test it on the cmd line myself, I get this:For the life if me, I cannot seem to figure out what's wrong with this command. Any ideas? Am I not escaping something properly? Adding a special char and not realizing it?
You are not running an intermediate shell so there is nothing to interprete the | as a pipe command. Even if you set shell=True, because you passed in a list, it will be escaped. The proper way to pipeline is given in the official python docs Replacing Shell Pipeline â€“ tdelaney
