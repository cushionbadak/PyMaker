I'm creating an invoice program that allows the user to select an item from a menu of products to either purchase or return. Once the user inputs the item ID and quantity desired, the program will read the inventory.txt file and write an UpdatedInventory.txt file, which will replace the inventory.txt file. The inventory.txt file is formatted like this:When my program runs, it does not print correctly on the UpdatedInventory.txt file. There's a lot of code here so bear with me.As an aside, I feel like it would simplify the code if every purchase the user made was added into a list rather than hard coded. Thanks for the help!Here's my main code:Here's my Inventory Class file:Here is my inventory.txt file:And here is what the updated inventory txt looks like after I input product ID 244, and purchase quantity of 5.
I've disabled . This seems to be working (I've combined the script files):I hope it helps!
Have you tried stepping thru the program?https://docs.python.org/2/library/pdb.html  or https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.htmlat some point you're losing information(its hard to troubleshoot that big block of code sadly)
