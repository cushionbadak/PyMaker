i tried to create a pandas dataframe like belowa returns as:So, my question is, why is the last digit modified?Thanks in advance!EDIT: i understand it has to do with the dtype. But why +1 to the last digit specifically? If i were to use 10212764634169926 instead, nothing happens, the results keeps to 10212764634169926. The same is with 10212764634169928, it returns 10212764634169928

If you try the following:you can have an idea about how float numbers are stored in memory (through the exponential notation) (see last decimal). To look a little bit more into this problem, I tested the following:You can see that using a  format would return even more difference.
