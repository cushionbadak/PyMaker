I am writing unit test for some python modules. However, I cannot work out a way to mock a method of an imported instance. Below is the python modules that I want to test.--bar.py----foo.py----test_foo.py--This does not work. My test case is still calling original  instead of the one I mocked.
Use the  decorator instead. It patches an object's attributes instead of patching a global method.If that doesn't work, try patching  instead of , but I don't think that's your problem here.UpdateThe question changed to a class method, so I think this will work:--test_foo.py--
