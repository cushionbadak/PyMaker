I am not able to convertthe following to unicode, but cannot, getting the errorUnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc3 in position 7: ordinal not in range(128)I would like to getas a result.
Your string is already in . You need to decode it to Unicode in order to use it inside Python:But you have a bigger problem: You are clearly using Python 2. Switch to Python 3 immediately, there is no reason to drive yourself crazy trying to understand the Python 2 approach to handling character encodings. Switch to Python 3 and you will not have to bang your head against your desk several times a day. (Note that although you were calling the  method, you got a . A simple explanation:In Python,  and  are different things. A  in Python 2 might be in the  encoding,  objects have no encoding.If you try to use a  for something that requires  (e.g., to  it), or vice versa, Python 2 will try to implicitly convert it first. Except it doesn't know the encoding of your strings, so it guesses (, in your case). Oops.Python2 has a lot of implicit conversions. But really the reason is simple: You are not using Python 3.Edit: Since Python 3 is not an option, here is some practical advice:Unicode sandwich: Convert all text to Unicode as soon as it's read in, work with  strings and encode back to a utf8  only to write it out again.Pandas should still support the  argument to , even on Python 2. Use it to write your files in .For reading a file directly, use  instead of plain  to read files. It accepts the  argument and will give you  strings.  
You need to use  utf-8 encoded string to unicode instead.
in python 3 you'd need to  the  that are your encoded string:in python 2 the  is not necessary (here the distinction between bytes and strings is less strict...).
