Say I have a class to create Redshift object dependencies.  I want to create a single connection, and then re-use it for many different transactions.  Should I create it in the  function, and then set the  in the  statement to mimic the  or  model?EDIT:Here is what I came up with:
I would recommend avoiding del as a destructor since it's calling pattern is nondeterministic and it is not guaranteed to be called at all.If you want to get a  resource  bounded var behaviour, you can do that by using the  module. this example come from the python docs at: https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.htmlThe disadvantage of this method is that the context of your resource needs to be coded. An alternative is to write a real destructor that will be called when the connections reference counter hits 0. This is pretty similar to your original idea of using  but to avoid the many of the issues with using  directly, use weakref.finalize.
