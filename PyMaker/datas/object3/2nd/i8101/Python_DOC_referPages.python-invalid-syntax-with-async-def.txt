I am trying write discord bots using Python, I have come across and threw together this bot.Yet when I tried to run it, I received a : Why is that? I have never received that before when I tested it.
Asynchronous requests were introduced to Python in v3.3, if you're running Python prior to v3.3 (including v2.X), you'll have to install a newer version of Python.Only if you are running Python 3.3:  is not part of the stdlib, you'll need to install it manually from pypi:The  and  keywords are only valid for Python 3.5 or newer. If you're using Python 3.3 or 3.4, you will need to make the following changes to your code:Use the  decorator instead of the  statement:Use  instead of :Here is an example of what your function need to change into (if you're on 3.3-3.4):The aforementioned syntax is still supported in newer versions of Python 3, but it is recommended to use  and  if there's no need to support for Python 3.3-3.4. You can refer back to this documentation, here's a short snippet:The  type of coroutine was added in Python 3.5, and is  recommended if there is no need to support older Python versions.Aside:discord.py currently supports 3.4.2-3.6.6, (It does not support 3.3-3.4.1, 3.7 as of January 2019). For developing with discord.py, I suggest using the discord.py rewrite branch:discord.py-rewrite supports 3.5.3-3.7.
From version 3.7 and  are reserved keywordslike the error in below image.Copy and open the path  (without ).You will get a list of .py filesRename  to  or anything you want, as async is now a reserved keyword with us from version 3.7.Once renamed, modify the new name everywhere.*NOTEAlthough it is not a permanent solutionbut it worked for me in case of the same syntax errorwhile working with firebase.Best solution is to go with previous version of Python. i.e version below 3.7.
