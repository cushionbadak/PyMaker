I'm writing a class and want to overload the __and__ functionWhen I run thisI would expect to get 'hamlet, macbeth'However, it appears the overload does nothing.What am I doing wrong?
The  method is an override for the and operator :Sadly, you can not override the  operator.
The  method is actually grouped with the numeric type methods, therefore it does not represent logical and (which is the  keyword) but rather the  operator
