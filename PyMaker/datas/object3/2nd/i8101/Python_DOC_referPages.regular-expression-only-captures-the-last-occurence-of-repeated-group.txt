I am trying to capture multiple "<attribute> = <value>" pairs with a Python regular expression from a string like this:The regular expression  is intended to match those pairs multiple times, i.e. return something likebut it only captures the last occurence:Focusing on <attrib>="<value>" works:so a pragmatic solution might be to test  before running this regular expression, but..Why does the original regex only capture the last occurence and what needs to be changed to make it work as intended?
This is just how regex works : you defined one capturing group, so there is only one capturing group. When it first captures something, and then captures an other thing, the first captured item is replaced.That's why you only get the last captured one.There is no solution for that that I am aware of...
From the documentation search will return only one occurrence. The findAll method returns all occurrences in the list. That is what you need to use, like in your second example.
