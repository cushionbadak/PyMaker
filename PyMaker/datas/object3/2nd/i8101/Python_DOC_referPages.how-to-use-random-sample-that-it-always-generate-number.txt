The goal is to give start and end limit and the # of numbers to generate. For instance I want to generate 100 random numbers between 1-100.How do I make sure that I don't get  exception?The code I am using is:
The error is pretty clear:Your  only holds 1000 elements: takes unique values from an input sequence, and thus can only pick up to  elements in the first place. There are only 1000 unique values in your , you can't pick nearly 2000 unique values in random order from that.If you wanted to generate 100 random numbers between two values, don't use . Use a list comprehension and  or :This will produce 100 random numbers, repetitions allowed.Even if repetition isn't allowed, to produce a sample of N elements out of a population of N it is better to use a random shuffle:
Are you looking for ? It will give you every element of the range exactly once, in a random order:
