I want to define a class containing  and  methode, which can be called as follows:To not use interlaced classes, my idea was to overwrite the  and  methods and to check, if the given name is  to redirect the return to . But I encountered a problem giving infinite recursions. The example code is as follows:As in  the code tried to create a new attribute , it calls , which again calls  and so on. How do I need to change this code, that, in this case, a new attribute  of  is created, holding the value ? Or is there any better way to handle calls like  to be 'mapped' to ? As there are always questions about the why: I need to create abstractions of  calls, for which very easy methods like  and similar can be created. I need to 'mock' this up to mimic such multi-dot-method calls.
You must call the parent class  method:Regarding the best-practice, since you plan to use this via  I think this is probably better done inside the  method.A quick and dirty way is to simply do:
Or you can modify  from inside :
You can also use object.
