The files I have seem to be in a "dict" format...file header is as follows: next line is as follows:{"t":[1494257340],"o":[206.7],"h":[209.3],"l":[204.50002],"c":[204.90001],"v":[49700650]}`the result I need is (change time ("epoch date format") to dd,mm,yyso I know I need the csv.writer function
I see a number of problems in the code you submitted. I recommend you to break your task into small pieces and see if you can make them work individually. So what are you trying to do is:open a fileread the file line by line each line to get a  objectget values from that objectwrite those values in a (separate?) csv fileRight?Now do each one, one small step at the timeopening a file. You're pretty much on point there:You can open the file in  mode instead, it will give you strings instead of  type objectsIt might cause some problems but should work since eval can handle it just fine (at least in python 3)read the file line by lineHere is another problem in your code, you're not using  variable and trying to  instead. This will just read entire file (starting from the second line, since the first one is been read already). Try to swap one for another and see what happens each line to get a  objectAgain. This works fine. but I would add some protection here. What if you get an empty line in the file or a misformatted one. Also if this file comes from an untrusted source you may become a victim of a code injection here, like if a line in your file changed to:I don't know your exact specifications, but you should be safer with  instead....Can you continue on your own from there?get values from the objectI think  doesn't give you the value you expect. What does it give you? Why? How to fix it?write those values in a csv fileCan you write some random string to a file?What scv format looks like? Can you format your values to match itCheck the docs for  module, can it be of help to you?And so on and so forth...EDIT: SolutionRunning:
