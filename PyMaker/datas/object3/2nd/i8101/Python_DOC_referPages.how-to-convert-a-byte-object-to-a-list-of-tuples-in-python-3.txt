Natural Text
I have a list of tuples [(x,y,z),...,] and I want to store this list of tuples in a file. For this I chose a .txt file. I write to the file in the mode "wb" and then I close it. Later, I want to open the file in mode "rb" and convert this byte object back to a list of tuples. How would I go about this without regular expression nonsense? Is there a file type that would allow me to store this data and read it easily that I've overlooked?
The  extension is typically not used for binary data, as you seem to intend.Since your data structure is not known on a byte level, it's not that simple.If you do know your data (types and length), you could "encode" it as a binary structure with https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/struct.html and write that to a (binary) file.Otherwise, there are many solutions to the problem of writing (structured) data to and reading data from files (that's why there are soo many file formats):Standard library:https://docs.python.org/3/library/fileformats.htmlhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/persistence.htmlhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.htmlhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html3rd party:https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyYAMLand other modules on https://pypi.python.org/Related Q&A on Stackoverflow:How to save data with Python?
