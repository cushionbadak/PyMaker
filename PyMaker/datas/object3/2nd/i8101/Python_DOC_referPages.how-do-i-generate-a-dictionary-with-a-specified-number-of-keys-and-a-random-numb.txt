Say I specified the number of keys to be 5 (so that the keys are 0,1,2,3, and 4 etc.) and I wanted the number of values to be random per key, where each value is 0,1,2,3, or 4, with no repeated values in each key. I am trying to make a Random Complete Graph if that means anything to you. Ex of output:

You can try creating the dictionary from two lists, , which are your integers from 0 to 4, and , which are random picks  from a list containing every possible combination(of any length) of your , and that's exactly what the initials  loops are there(check this answer). Notice the final dictionary's values are tuples, it's not hard to output them the way you need changing the code from here on. Also notice that since we already are importing  the construction of the dictionary can be coded using , and that seems to be a more economical approach in a big lists scenario.
