I'm trying to write to a file like this:Here  is an integer. The file is created, but stays empty. What am I missing?UPDATEI tried writing to the console.This shows the console:The file is still empty.
Check the value by printing . If I initialize , the code works. So there's nothing wrong with the code. 
Aren't you trying to write a tuple?Never mind, this works either way:
