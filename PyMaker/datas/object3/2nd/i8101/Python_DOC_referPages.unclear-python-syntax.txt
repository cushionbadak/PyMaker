Does it mean for each line in , loop for each  on the split ?
The  loops are nested, from left to right. You can write it out as regular loops like this:So the expression before the  loops is the final value added to the produced list, and all the  loops (and any  tests) are executed nested inside the preceding loop or test.So, yes, for each line in the opened file, the line is split and the resulting words from those lines are added to the list being built.
