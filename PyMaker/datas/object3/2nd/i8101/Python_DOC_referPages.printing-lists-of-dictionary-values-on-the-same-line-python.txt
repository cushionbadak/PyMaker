I have a dictionary that has lists as the values:   I'd like to search the dictionary for multiple keys and store their values in a list:  But when I do this I get a multidimensional (double brackets) list for values.  If I were to replace  with  I get the values on 2 separate lines.  My question is, how can I print the value lists from 2 separate keys on the same line? 
One of the many ways you can print a nested list in one line is with a comprehension:If you didn't want it to be nested in the first place, replace  with  in .  takes a list (as  is in this case) and add all its elements to the other list.  just adds the element as is to the new list resulting in the nested structure you see.
Your problem appears to spring from the fact that you are separately appending more than one list to the  list. That is, you are doing:In order to get values to be a single list of just the strings, use . The  method concatenates lists, while the  method nests them.
