Natural Text
I am a very novice coder who needs help combining and rearranging a lot of .txt data. I have 500 text files (actually there are .pts files, but that seems to be the same thing as .txt) with facial landmark coordinates extracted from photographs of people using CLM Facetracker. The output for each photo is like this (68 rows down):version: 1npoints: 68{216.512 146.425217.526 166.783219.63 187.059(....)}which is equivalent to:x1,y1x2,y2I wish to rearrange it so instead all the 68 landmark coordinates are in a single row with a comma in between each:216.512, 146.425, 217.526, 166.783, 219.63, 187.059x1, y1, x2, y2Is there a simple way to do this? Ideally I would also like to add zeros so all landmark coordinates have the same amount of decimal places. Thanks in advance, and apologies if I am missing something super obvious :)

If you want to have a certain number of decimal places, say 4: 
read file(s)read line(s)replace whitespace with the separatorremove the end-of-line (newline and/or linebreak) characteradd to new stringwrite resulting string into new fileTry to get this to work (untested):Some docs:https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/functions.html#openhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methodsThis can be written more compact, e.g. see @Nik's answer.Use a text editor's search and replace function that supports special characters (whitespace, cr, lf). Notepad++ can do it, Atom too (and many others).
Not every answer can work with real input file. By real I understand containing  etc. So – let me have a try.Input file:Looks like dot occurs only as decimal mark. I'll premise that.Output:Pure sed:It's maybe not beauty, but well... I just need to check if I still remember regex. Looks like I should improve it, but at least – it works.Python:
