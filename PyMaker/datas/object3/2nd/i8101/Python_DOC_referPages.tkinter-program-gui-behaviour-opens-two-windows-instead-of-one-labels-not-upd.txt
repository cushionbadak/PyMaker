I have the following program which is used to create a very basic GUI:Even though the GUI was created, I have a couple of issues here:there is a small window titled  that opens up along with my window titled  (See the image below). I remember it was not there when I started out, looks like something that I recently added created it. I can't really understand exactly what though. How can I remove that tiny pest window or at least hide it?I'm unable to update the Status label at runtime even though I've inserted  and similar statements as required in the flow. All that I can see is the very last line in the flow ( is the last called function) .How can I update the status during runtime as per my requirement? I'm sure its possible and some logical mistake I'm doing.

You'd look at the Python documentation or tutorial on classes and notice that you're doing it wrong: does not have parameters, but the method must have at least one ():Success!Tested with a fresh Python 2.7.13:
