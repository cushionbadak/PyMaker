https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/python/google.protobuf.json_format-pysrcalso It is pretty clear that this function will return exactly one object of type string. This string contains a lot of json structure, but it's still just a string, as far as python is concerned.You then pass it to a function which takes a python object (not json), and serializes it to json. https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.htmlOkay, how exactly would you encode a string into json? Clearly it can't just use json specific characters, so those would have to be escaped. Maybe there's an online tool, like http://bernhardhaeussner.de/odd/json-escape/ or http://www.freeformatter.com/json-escape.html You can go there, post the starting json from the top of your question, tell it to generate the proper json, and you get back ... almost exactly what you are getting at the bottom of your question. Cool everything worked correctly! (I say almost because one of those links adds some newlines on its own, for no apparent reason. If you encode it with the first link, then decode it with the second, it is exact.)But that's not the answer you wanted, because you didn't want to double-jsonify the data structure. You just wanted to serialize it to json once, and write that to a file:
