How does this work for you?If you don't have a modern version of Python (3.5+) you can also just use glob, os, and shutil:
This is easiest to do with Python 3's new  module for path operations, and then  for moving the files into their correct places. Unlike ,  will work like the  command and behave correctly even for cross-filesystem moves.This code will work for paths nested to any level - any  or  in the paths will be replaced with  in the target filename, so  will be moved to .
