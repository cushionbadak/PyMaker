I would like to use multiple processes () to do some preprocessing and enqueue the results to a tf.RandomShuffleQueue which can be used by my main graph for training.Is there a way to do that ?My actual problemI have converted my dataset into TFRecords split across 256 shards. I want to start 20 processes using  and let each process a range of shards. Each process should read images and then augment them and push them into a  from which the input can be given to a graph for training.Some people advised me to go through the  example in . However, it is a very different situation because there only reading of the data shards is done by multiple threads (), while the preprocessing (e.g - augmentation) takes place in the main thread.
(This aims to solve your actual problem)In another topic, someone told you that Python has the global interpreter lock (GIL) and therefore there would be no speed benefits from multi-core, unless you used multiple processes.This was probably what prompted your desire to use .However, with TF, Python is normally used only to construct the "graph". The actual execution happens in native code (or GPU), where GIL plays no role whatsoever.In light of this, I recommend simply letting TF use multithreading. This can be controlled using the  argument, such as:(Side note: if you have, say, a 2-CPU, 32-core system, the best argument may very well be , depending on a lot of factors)
Comment: The pickling of TFRecords is not that important.  I can pass a list of lists containing names of ranges of sharded TFRecord files.Therebe I have to restart Decision process!Comment: I can pass it to a Pool.map() as an argument.  Verify, if a  can handle this.Results of Tensor functions are a .Try the following:Comment: how do I make sure that all the processes enqueue to the same queue ?   This is simple done  the results from  after all  finished.Alternate we can  parallel,  data from all .  But doing so, depends on pickleabel data as described above.For instance:
It seems the recommended way to run  with  is via creating a separate  for each child as sharing it across processes is unfeasible.You can take a look at this example, I hope it helps. [EDIT: Old answer]You can use a  and rely on its callback mechanism to put results in the  as soon as they are ready.Here's a very simple example on how to do it.This assumes Python 2, for Python 3 I'd recommend to use a .
