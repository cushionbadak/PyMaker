Whatever you pass to the  function has to be executed first. How else would Python know what to pass to the  function?Generally speaking, in order for Python to call a function, you need to first determine what values you are passing into that function. See the Calls expression documentation:All argument expressions are evaluated before the call is attempted.Calling  you are passing in a string (), and the result of calling . Python has to execute those sub-expressions first before it can call .In this specific case, just use  as the  prompt:and don't bother with .If you did want to print  on a separate line first, call  with just that string, then on a separate line, call :Note that  returns whatever string the user entered, you want to store that somewhere. In my examples,  is that 'somewhere'.
