How do I get the probability of a string being similar to another string in Python?I want to get a decimal value like 0.9 (meaning 90%) etc. Preferably with standard Python and library.e.g.
There is a built in.Using it:
I think maybe you are looking for an algorithm describing the distance between strings. Here are some you may refer to:  Hamming distance Levenshtein distanceDamerau–Levenshtein distance Jaro–Winkler distance
Solution #1: Python builtinuse SequenceMatcher from difflib pros:    native python library, no need extra package.cons:  too limited, there are so many other good algorithms for string similarity out there.   example :Solution #2: jellyfish libraryits a very good library with good coverage and few issues.it supports:- Levenshtein Distance- Damerau-Levenshtein Distance- Jaro Distance- Jaro-Winkler Distance- Match Rating Approach Comparison- Hamming Distance  pros:    easy to use, gamut of supported  algorithms, tested.cons:  not native library.example:   
 is a package that implements Levenshtein distance in python, with some helper functions to help in certain situations where you may want two distinct strings to be considered identical. For example:
You can create a function like:
Package distance includes Levenshtein distance:
The builtin  is very slow on large input, here's how it can be done with diff-match-patch:
