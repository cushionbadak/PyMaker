This question already has an answer here:TypeError: 'dict_keys' object does not support indexing                    5 answers                This is my code:This works completely fine when using python 2.7.3; however, when I use python 3.2.3, I get an error stating .  How can I modify the code to make it compatible for 3.2.3?
In Python 3,  (along with  and ) returns a , rather than a list. See the documentation here. You therefore need to wrap your call to  in a call to  like so:
A simpler version of your code would be:If you want to keep the same structure, you can change it to:(You can just as easily put  inside the comprehension instead of ; it's just wasteful to do so since it would be re-generating the list every time).
In Python 3 the  method returns a dictionary view object, not a list like it does in Python 2. Dictionary views have a length, can be iterated, and support membership testing, but don't support indexing.To make your code work in both versions, you could use either of these:    orBy far the simplest, fastest way to do the same thing in either version would be:Note however, that all of these methods will give you results that will vary depending on the actual contents of . To overcome that, you may be able use an OrderedDict instead, which remembers the order that keys were first inserted into it, so you can count on the order of what is returned by the  method.
