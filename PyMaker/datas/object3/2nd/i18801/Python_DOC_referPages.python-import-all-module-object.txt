I have the following files:,,,I don't know why  is defined, it's not a variable in the lib.py file.Any ideas?
The  object is the nested  file inside the  package.Once you have imported the sub module, it also becomes available as an attribute of the package (unless you also included a  name in the  file. The Python 3.3 module loader (which is implemented in Python) simply sets a nested module as an attribute on the parent:This behaviour is more or less implied in the Python packages documentation:All modules have a name. Subpackage names are separated from their parent package name by dots, akin to Pythonâ€™s standard attribute access syntax. Thus you might have a module called  and a package called , which in turn has a subpackage called  and a module within that subpackage called .
