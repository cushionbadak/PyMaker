I'm trying to time several things in python, including upload time to Amazon's S3 Cloud Storage, and am having a little trouble. I can time my hash, and a few other things, but not the upload. I thought this post would finally, get me there, but I can't seem to find salvation. Any help would be appreciated. Very new to python, thanks! 
I know this is heresy in the Python community, but I actually recommend not to use , especially for something like this.  For your purposes, I believe it will be good enough (and possibly even better than !) if you simply use  to time things.  In other words, do something likeNote that depending on your platform, you might want to try  instead (see Stack Overflow questions such as this and this), and if you're on Python 3.3, then you have better options, due to PEP 418.
You can use the command line interface to .Just save your code as a module without the timing stuff. For example:Then you can run the timing code from the command line, like this:See also:http://docs.python.org/2/library/timeit.html#command-line-interfacehttp://docs.python.org/2/library/timeit.html#examples
