Can  and  give different answers if  is a class instance ?I mean how is  evaluated if  is a class instance ?
yes it can give different answers.will call the  method to valuate the operator and give the result implemented compared to the  singleton.will call the  ( in python3) method to valuate the operator. The interpreter will convert  to a boolean () using the mentioned method and then inverse its returned value because of the  operator.means that the reference x points to the  object, which is a singleton of type  and will valuate false in comparaisons. The  operator tests object identity, and thus whether or not the two objects compared are the same instance of an object, and not similar objects.
 is eqivalent to:Py 3.x:
Yes;  uses  (in Python 3; Python 2 uses ), and  can be overridden by .(Both are shown here.)
If  is positive the  of it means negative and vice-versa. means it will only be  if  is  else False. Check this.By positive I mean the  block is chosen.  is also positive.
 is true for a wide variety of values, e.g. 0, None, "", False, [], {}, etc. is only true for the one specific value None.If x is a class instance, then both  and  will be false, but that doesn't mean that those are equivalent expressions.Fine; that previous paragraph should read:If x is a class instance, then both  and  will be false unless someone is playing silly buggers with the class definition.
