I have a csv file with mixed floats, a string and an integer, the formatted output from a FORTRAN file.A typical line looks like:I want to read it while keeping the float decimal places unmodified, and check to see if the first entry in each line is present is another list.Using loadtxt and genfromtxt results in the demical places changing from 3 (or 4) to 12.How should I tackle this?
If you need to keep precision exactly, you need to use the  module. Otherwise, issues with floating point arithmetic limitations might trip you up.Chances are, though, that you don't really need that precision - just make sure you don't compare s for equality exactly but always allow a fudge factor, and format the output to a limited number of significant digits:
 appears to take a  argument so something like:Should work.'s should work with whatever precision you require although if you're doing significant number crunching with  it will be considerably slower than working with .  However, I assume you're just looking to transform the data without losing any precision so this should be fine.
I finished up writing some string processing code. Not elegant but it works:
