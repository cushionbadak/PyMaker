I'm hours new to python, and I'm trying to write a script which reads a set of x,y coordinates from a file (named 'peaks.dat') and fills them into a list (of class type); I'm defining the following:But then I couldn't find any way to "pick" a single element from a line (namely, an element from only one of the two columns) in the file, instead of the whole line. Is there such a thing?Regardless, I tried splitting my columns into two different files x.dat and y.dat, but then I quite don't know how to separately fill my 'point' type list's x and y fields from the files.I triedplanning to to the same later for the y.dat file, but it seems to be wrong on many levels.p.s. I come from some C++, if you want to give examples.edit: peaks.dat is just three columns (I only need the first two) of numbers, something likeetc.x.dat (or y.dat) is a single row of numbers.
Use  to split the data on a line,  returns a list of string.Examples:If you want only the first two columns from each line:If you wanted to read only first two rows:Some changes to your class  definition:
Depending on the format of the file, you either want to use the  module, or use the  function.For whitespace-separated values on a line, use :For other formats, usually the  module is the best option:To read only two lines, use  twice; csv version: takes the next item from an iterator; both the  object and the  object are iterators that yield file lines or CSV rows.Alternatively, use the  utility:
It depends on the format of your files. Are the coordinates separated by commas?If so, then.I'm sure there's a nicer and more pythonic way to do this.You can read about Python's 'with' herehttp://effbot.org/zone/python-with-statement.htmMaybe you can find something useful here, http://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#module-io if my answer wasn't what you were looking for.
