I'm trying to make a random walk in 2d, and plot the 2d walk.I've been able to make the walk, but the plot is not exactly what I wanted.Would it be possible to see the walk live in python ? Or just add a label to every point so that you know which point came first and which point came second etc. ?Edit I copied my own code wrong, now it is compiling if you have the right packages installed.
The built-in  module could be used to draw the path at a perceptible rate.Sample result:
I would visualize the time-information using a color, i.e. try to plot
See the animation tutorial at http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2012/08/18/matplotlib-animation-tutorial/In this case the animate function should perform one step of your walk and set the x-y data appropriately.  If you don't care to save the animation or don't have the codec installed, just ignore the anim.save call.
