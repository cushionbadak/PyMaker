My today's task is to create a Python script (say A.py) which can do the following things:Start a C program (say CProg) passing some paramsStart another Python script (say B.py) passing other paramsJoin/Wait until B.py has finishedSend a SIGINT to CProgIterate (this won't be a problem at all I think :P)Since I'm pretty new in developing Python scripts and my mind is quite full of C/C++ thread/join/execve/... I'd like to ask you if there's a proper way to accomplish my task. I've read some related topics on SO (some talk about PIPEs or Execl) but I'm not sure what to use yet.Thanks in advance
