I accidentally overwrote  by using it as a variable name in an interactive python session - is there any way that I can get access to the original  function without just restarting my session? (I have so much stuff in that session that I'd rather not have to do that, although of course I can if necessary.)
Just delete the name that is masking the builtin:You can always still access the original built-in through the   namespace; use this if you want to override the built-in but want to defer to the original still from the override: is sourced from the  module (Python 2, note the lack of ), or the  module (Python 3, with  but no underscores).If you have trouble locating where the masking name is defined, do check all namespaces from your current one up to the built-ins; see Short Description of the Scoping Rules? for what scopes may apply to your current situation.
You can use : or simply(no imports required):For Python 3:From docs:CPython implementation detail: Users should not touch ; it  is strictly an implementation detail. Users wanting to override values  in the  namespace should import the  (no ‘s’)  module and modify its attributes appropriately.
To use builtin wrapper, first assign its original address in a variable like  After your work is done then set it to  and set back the original address to builtin function.  Example  work is done
