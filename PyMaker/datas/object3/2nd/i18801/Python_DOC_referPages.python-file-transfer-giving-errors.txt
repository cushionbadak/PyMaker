I am trying to send a file from a server to client but get errors. Please let me know where I am doing wrong.This is my server code:where msg contains the path address where file existsc=client socket   s=server socketI want to read that file and send it to client but I get this errorOn client side, I have written this code to recieve that filewhere s is the client socketHere I get this error
On the client side you have an error on this line:And the Python docs say that the argument has a system dependant maximum, usually 5. So try finding out the maximum for your system of just use a lower value and see what happen.The server side error could be a side effect of the client side failure.
That is the kind of error you get when you call  before calling . Keep in mind that a server always has to follow the sequence , ,  and  in that specific order.
