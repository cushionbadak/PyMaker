Natural Text
I have some questions about Defaultdict and Counter. I have a situation where I have a text file with one sentence per line. I want to split up the sentence into two (at first space) and store them into a dictionary with the first substring as the key and the second substring as the value. The reason for doing this is so that I can get a total number of sentences that share the same key.This is what I have tried but it doesn't work. I have looked at Counter but it's a bit tricky in my situation.Is there a way to do this without splitting up the sentences and storing them as tuples in a huge list before attempting using Counter or defaultdict? Thanks!EDIT: Thanks to all who answered. I finally found out where I went wrong in this. I edited the program with all the suggestions given by everyone.
Using  to "get a total number of sentences that share the same key."will printIf you want to store a list of all the lines, your main mistake is hereFor this pattern, you should be usingBut there's no point storing all those lines in a list if you're just indenting on taking the length.
 return current accumulated count. If key was not in dict, return 0.http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict.get
Full example of defaultdict (and improved way of displaying classDict)
