I have a list of a hundred or so strings and each string is compared with one another in 2 for loops, here is a very basic overview of code:Which prints:As you can see, a lot of the strings are compared twice (PII - AZO and AZO - PII, etc.)I've been trying to figure out how to avoid this problem using 2 count variables but I am scratching my head, there must be an easier/pythonic way of doing this so there are no overlapping string comparisons, does anyone know how to accomplish this?Python 3, thanks.EDIT:Expected result:
Use :Your version generated permutations instead.
The way you could do this by hand is by iterating over the second list, starting after the index of the first list: is like , but doesn't make a copy. Thanks to commenters who pointed that out.
