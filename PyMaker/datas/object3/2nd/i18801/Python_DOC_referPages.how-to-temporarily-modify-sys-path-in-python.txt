In one of my testing scripts in Python I use this pattern several times:Is there a more concise way to temporarily modify the search path?
You could use a simple context manager:Then to import a module you can do:  On exit from the body of the  statement  will be restored to the original state. If you only use the module within that block you might also want to delete its reference from :
Appending a value to  only modifies it temporarily, i.e for that session only.Permanent modifications are done by changing  and the default installation directory.So, if by temporary you meant for current session only then your approach is okay, but you can remove the  part if  is not hiding any important modules that is expected to be found in in  ,current directory or default installation directory.http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/modules.html#the-module-search-path
