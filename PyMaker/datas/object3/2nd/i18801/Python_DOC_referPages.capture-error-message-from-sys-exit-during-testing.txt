Is there a way to "capture" the error message printed out by  during testing and compare it to another string?Some background: in the Python script I'm working on, I've been using  to print out a more specific error message (and avoid the traceback which usually arises).Other times, I just use the regular message (esp. with ConfigParser):I would like to capture the error message there and perhaps use an  to compare.The script I'm working on has both Python 2 & 3 versions, so I'd appreciate some examples if there are differences between them for doing this.
 dosn't do anythin else then raising , which you can catch like any other exception.The example about the context manager just shows you how you can use it to get the exception which was thrown in the with block if you need to perform checks on it.In the case of SystemExit this would look like this:
 is part of unittest's TestCase, so won't help you if you're not using it. You would have to shell off the process to see what happens. Why not write some unit tests instead?
Check out the examples in  and the provided exit block.https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html
