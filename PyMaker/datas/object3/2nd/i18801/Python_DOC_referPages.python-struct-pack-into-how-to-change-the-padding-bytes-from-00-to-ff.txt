Natural Text
I'm writing a Python 3.3.2 script. Here is a snippet from my code:Exactly 32 byte are reserved for the content of text[0]. However, the string is shorter than 32 bytes, so the unused bytes are padded with null bytes (0x00), see also notes. I want to change the padding to 0xFF. Is there a nice way to do this other than getting the real size of my string, pack this into my bytearray and then pack the remaining bytes as 0xFF into the bytearray?
How about using the ljust method to first pad the string to 32 bytes with the desired 0xff character? ljust(width[, fillchar]) where width is the total string length after padding, and fillchar is the character to pad with (a space by default.)
First initialize the bytearray with 0xFF
