I'm struggling with a minor problem in Python (my program is in version 3.2.3 right now).I have a dictionary that looks like this (this is just an example, actually taken from another post here):I want to simply print() a list of unique values, eliminating duplicates. At the end of this list, I would like to print the number of unique values in the dictionary:Any help is appreciated. There are some other posts here I found that were somewhat related, but I don't know Python well enough to apply it to this specific problem.
Use  here as they only contain unique items.Loop over this set to get the expected output:This line  is roughly equivalent to:
Use a :Use  on Python 2 for a little more efficiency. Because you have a list of dictionaries, we need to pull out the values from each of those dictionaries first; I used  with a generator expression to list all values in a sequence:The alternative is to use nested loops in the generator expression:
You can explot the properties of  for this purpose; each element is unique and duplicates will be ignored.By using  in this way, duplicate elements returned from  will be discarded. You can then print them as follows:
