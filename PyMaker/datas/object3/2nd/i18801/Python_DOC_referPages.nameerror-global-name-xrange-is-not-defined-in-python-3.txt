I am getting an error when running a python program:The game is from here.What causes this error?
You are trying to run a Python 2 codebase with Python 3.  was renamed to  in Python 3.Run the game with Python 2 instead. Don't try to port it unless you know what you are doing, most likely there will be more problems beyond  vs. .For the record, what you are seeing is not a syntax error but a runtime exception instead.If you do know what your are doing and are actively making a Python 2 codebase compatible with Python 3, you can bridge the code by adding the global name to your module as an alias for . (Take into account that you may have to update any existing  use in the Python 2 codebase with  to ensure you still get a list object in Python 3):or replace all uses of  with  in the codebase and then use a different shim to make the Python 3 syntax compatible with Python 2:The latter is preferable for codebases that want to aim to be Python 3 compatible only in the long run, it is easier to then just use Python 3 syntax whenever possible.
add  in your code :) It works to me.
Replace Python 2  to Python 3 Rest all same. 
I agree with the last answer.But there is another way to solve this problem.You can download the package named future,such as pip install future.And in your .py file input this "from past.builtins import xrange".This method is for the situation that there are many xranges in your file.
