My question is little bit different than the question posted hereSo I thought to open a new thread.I have a pandas data frame with 5 attributes.One of these attribute is created using pandas series.Here is the sample code for creating the data frameI have another data frame,the code for creating the data frame is given belowThese are sample data. Actual data will have large number of rows & also the series length is large too .I want to match mydf1 with mydf2 & if it matches,sometime I wont have matching element in mydf2,then I will delete values of id from mydf1 which are there in mydf2 for example after the run,my id will be for group 1  . I also tried the code mentioned in above link. But for the first lineI got error message as    TypeError: 'Series' objects are mutable, thus they cannot be hashedin my Python 3.X. Can you please suggest me how to solve this?
This should work. We use  to find the difference between 2 lists of ids. (p.s. This problem does not requires the difference is in order.)SetupCodeOne  object can  another to get the difference in occurances of elements. Then, you can use  function to retrieve all values left.
