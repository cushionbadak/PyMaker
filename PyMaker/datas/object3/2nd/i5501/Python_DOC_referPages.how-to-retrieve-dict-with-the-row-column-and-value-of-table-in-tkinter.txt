I have the following table in a Tkinter Gui and I wanted to know how I would be able to get a dict with all of the values in each of the cells and the corresponding row and col of each value in the dict as well. Here is the code:
Below is a minimal example that creates the  fields as a two-dimensional list, and later puts one of the values in a label:
I suggest you store the table in a dictionary and use the built-in  module to load and save it.Here's the code I used to create a initial table dictionary and "pickle it" for testing (in actual use you might want to initialize it to empty or zero values):Output showing values in table:You can then load the data in the pickled file in the  method and use it as shown:Screenshot of app running. Note that the values being displayed are the same as those that were printed when the table was first created.After the values in table are updated, if you wish you can easily update the associated file by via the same  function that was used in the code that initially created the pickled table.
