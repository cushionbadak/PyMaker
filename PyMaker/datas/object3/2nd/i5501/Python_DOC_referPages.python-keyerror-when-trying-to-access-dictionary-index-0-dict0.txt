Edit: I've moved this question to a new post: Python: KeyError when Calling Valid Key/Index in DictI'm successfully receiving some properly formatted JSON data via websocket:I can loop through the dictionary like this:This will print "Valid_Key" and "Some_value".However, if I try to access this by key name or index, I will receive a "KeyError".This will result in:KeyError: 0This will result in:KeyError: 'Valid_Key'How can I access dictionary data by index or key in Python?Example with no error:https://s17.postimg.org/e11brl99r/Success.jpgExample with KeyError:https://s17.postimg.org/t9r95mxvz/Key_Error.jpg
