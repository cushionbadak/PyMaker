While fitting a model using  I sometimes receive a warning printed in the console:ConvergenceWarning: Stochastic Optimizer: Maximum iterations (300) reached and the optimization hasn't converged yet.Is there a way to detect the warning during runtime so I can act on it?
You can catch the warning in realtime with This structure will catch any Warning in line and allow you to respond to it however you see fit. In this case that may be modifying some hyperparameter to make it easier for the model to converge.You can also ignore warnings with  and can specify the type of warning to ignore.To ignore :
Check the  attribute after fitting. If it is less than the maximum number of iterations you configured (), then it converged.
