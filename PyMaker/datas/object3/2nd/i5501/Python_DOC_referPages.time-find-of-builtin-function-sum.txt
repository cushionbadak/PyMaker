I'm trying to find out how much time it takes to execute a Python statement, so I looked online and found that the standard library provides a module called timeit that purports to do exactly that:However, this produces an error:I'm still new to Python and I don't fully understand all the scoping issues it has, but I don't know why this snippet doesn't work. Any thoughts?
Change this line:To this:Check out the link you provided at the very bottom.To give the timeit module access to functions you define, you can pass a setup parameter which contains an import statement:I just tested it on my machine and it worked with the changes.
You can try this hack:
With Python 3, you can use  From the documentation:Another option is to pass  to the  parameter, which  will cause the code to be executed within your current global  namespace. This can be more convenient than individually specifying  imports
Since timeit doesn't have your stuff in scope.
add into your setup "import thisfile; "then when you call the setup function myfunc() use  "thisfile.myfunc()"eg  "thisfile.py"
