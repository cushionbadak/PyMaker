Natural Text
Not sure how to do this. I have a string that I need the first part of it gone. When print(result.text) runs it prints "@PERSONSTWITTER their message" I need to remove the first part "@PERSONSTWITTER". At first I had it remove everything from the @. I ran into a problem, the first is that the person username could be any amount of letters. (@PERSONSTWITTER2, @PERSONSTWITTER12, etc) they don't have the same amount of characters. Now I'm not sure what to do. Any help would be great!So all I need is to isolate "their message" and not the username.
You can use regular expressions:Output:
You may filter the words starting with  using  as:Here I'm firstly splitting your sentence into words, filtering the words not starting with , and then joining back again.
Use the  method to convert the  into a  of  formed from splitting the original at (by default) .Then use the  method to join all the elements from index  on wards in the list together, separated again by a space.An alternative approach would be to just  the first  and slice from then on wards:Note that we had to add  to the index because  are zero-based
