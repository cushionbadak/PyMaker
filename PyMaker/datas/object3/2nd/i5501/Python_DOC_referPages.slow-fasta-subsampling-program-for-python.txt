I have devised edited a little script that subsamples x lines from an original file. The original file is fasta, which has two lines for every sequence, and the program extracts those x number of sequences (the two lines together).This is how it looks:The creation of the lists with the ID and The nucleotides (line 1 and 2 respectively) goes pretty quick, but the print out takes forever. The numbers being extracted can go up to 2M but it starts going slow from the 10000. I was wondering if there is any way to make it faster. Is the .pop the issue? Would it be faster if I created the a random list of unique numbers first and then extracted those?Finally, the terminal does not go back to "normal finished state" after printing "Done." and I do not know why. With all my other scripts I can inmediately type when they are done.
random.sample (which was suggested in a comment) and a dictionary makes the script much faster. Here is the final script:
