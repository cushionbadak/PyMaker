I'm working with python and i realize that itsn't reliable while sometimes and or statement doesn't work properly without reasonI tested with this function and it prints:After changing to , it works.What's wrong between these two short-hand conditions?
You haven't accounted for the case where  is empty. An empty list is a false-y value:Because  is a false value, the  operator produces an empty list and the  operator produces the other operand.This doesn't mean that  and  are broken or work differently in Python than they do in other languages. You just haven't considered that in a  construct, that the  is still used to determine the outcome of the whole. This applies to all boolean logic, not just Python.Don't use  and  for a conditional expression. Use an actual conditional expression, so :Like  and , this lazily evaluates either one of the two operand expressions based on the outcome of the  test. If  is empty, it'll still be returned, because it's value is not used to determine the outcome of further boolean testing.
