The path is .I want to import an entire folder as a package like this:But it doesn't work and gives this error: But when I import it's function like this , it works.What's going on here?
See the documentation about packages.More specifically that part:[...] when using syntax like import item.subitem.subsubitem, each item except for the last must be a package; the last item can be a module or a package but canâ€™t be a class or function or variable defined in the previous item.When using the  statement alone (without ), you're actually importing a package for usage in your code as . Each part of that path must be a proper package (in other words, contain a  file)
