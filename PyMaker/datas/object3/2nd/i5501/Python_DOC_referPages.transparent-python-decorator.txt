I need a decorator to log method calls. I`ll use something like this (print will be replaced by sending data somewhere):It works fine, but it shadows original method signature:I have to keep method signature untouched, soIs there a way to wrap function with decorator, keeping it`s signature and docs?
The main problem here is that you're grabbing the function parameters directly from the function's code object. This is not really what you want - you aren't actually interested in the function's code, you're interested in the function itself. Decorators have a special  attribute which points to the original function; but code objects do not. Therefore you should use the  module instead, which will take care of most things for you and give you the result you expect.Unfortunately, maintaining the decorated function's signature must be done manually, by assigning a signature object to .Here is an implementation of the  decorator with python 3's  module:And the  function can be simplified (and corrected) with :You'll find that everything works as expected now:
