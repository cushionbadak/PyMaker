The above code prints the rotors to the screens, in pairs.What I would like to happen is for a letter to be entered in an input, and a line to be drawn between the corresponding letters, going from the most right list, to the left list.However, I have no idea how to even start with this.Thanks in advance!
Here's the solution. I blit the letters onto the background surface before the main loop starts and then just blit the background every frame. To store the coordinates of the letters, I add the letters to a dictionary with a list as the value and append the coords to this list.When the user presses a key, I call  to look up the letter in the dict and assign the corresponding coords list to the  variable which I then pass to . The  method will return  if the key doesn't exist, so that s are prevented.I'd also use a  instead of the normal dict, but I don't know if you're already familiar with them.If you want to connect the letters in the way you described in the comment, you need to figure out the indices of the letters in the following lists and use the indices to get the next letters one after the other. You could then zip the letters and their coords to blit them on the background surface and add the coords list to the  again for each letter.
