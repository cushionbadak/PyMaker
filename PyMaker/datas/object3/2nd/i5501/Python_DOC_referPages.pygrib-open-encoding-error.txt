I'm trying to get  to work in Python 3.5.I have imported it in my program, I have assigned the grib file to a variable (grib).But when I try to run the command: I get the following error:File "", line 1, in       print(sys.getdefault_encoding())AttributeError: module 'sys' has no attribute 'getdefault_encoding'No google search led me to any understanding of the problem.What does this error actually mean?
Problem resolved by re-installing! Thanks for your help.
