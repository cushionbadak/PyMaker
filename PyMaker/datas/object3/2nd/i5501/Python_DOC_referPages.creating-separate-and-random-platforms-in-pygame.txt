Im trying to create more platforms, I was wondering whats the correct approach to do this whether to create a for loop or add more stuff to the code like change the numbers in the Platform bracket, also when this code is played the platforms arent seperate how would i go about separating them? so that you see the platforms individually and in random positions something like this https://forums.crackberry.com/blackberry-10-games-f275/fall-down-game-906376/
You have to change the coordinates of the platforms if you want to place them elsewhere. The first two arguments are the  and  (top left) coordinates and the third and fourth are the width and height of the platform: .If you want to use a for loop to create the platforms, you could create a list of rects (or rect style tuples), unpack the values, use them to create new platform instances and add the instances to the sprite groups.To pass random positions, just call  instead of passing the  and  variables.
