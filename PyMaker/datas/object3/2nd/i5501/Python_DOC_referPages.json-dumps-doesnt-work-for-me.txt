I wrote a small Python script to get a response from GitHub and its GraphQL API.Here is what I coded:I start this function with the output of my request as you can see here:I get following output:I am unable to understand what the problem with my Python interpreter is, because I imported JSON. And in the documentation I just read how to use it, and I did as they did.
You re-used the global name  for the module import and for a dictionary. The last assignment wins, so  now references the dictionary, not the module. Use a different name for the dictionary, like :Not that you need to use the  library at all here; the  library supports decoding JSON responses natively by calling the  method. You can pretty-print the result better by using the  library:As a side note: the GraphQL query itself is not JSON. There is no point in using the  library to parse or output a GraphQL query. It is fine to embed a GraphQL query in a JSON document however. The response is entirely in JSON.
