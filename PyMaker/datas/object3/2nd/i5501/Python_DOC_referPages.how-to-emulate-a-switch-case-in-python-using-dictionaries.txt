I am trying to emulate a switch-case statement from the  function below.This is what I basically did but it doesn't work correctlyEven though I find this emulation less readable I would like to better understand it in order to improve my python skills.Can someone help me simplify this code?
(Not an answer to the question, but maybe a better approach to the actual problem.)It seems like you are replicating part of what the Python  builtin does. So you could just create a  from the  and get the , , and  from that.This also takes care of handling the error cases:

You can't return a  as the not-found value in  in this case, since the code is expecting 3 values to be unpacked (in  at least AFAIK). I've updated the code to handle the case where . One could also add a check for the case where  is  or empty.
I would try something like this..
