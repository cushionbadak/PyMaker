I'm trying to use a method from the BioPython package to calculate an isoelectric point for a list of given peptides. The class breakdown can be seen here:http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/api/Bio.SeqUtils.ProtParam.ProteinAnalysis-class.html#isoelectric_pointIn order to import this class to my environment, I'm using the following code (did I do this right?):Then, to call the method, I do the following:However I'm getting the following error, and I'm not sure how to interpret it, despite several searches for similar errors:File  "C:\Users\----\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32\lib\site-packages\Bio\SeqUtils\ProtParam.py",  line 68, in count_amino_acids      if self.amino_acids_content is None: AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'amino_acids_content'Is anyone able to guide me in the right direction here? This other class is also called IsoElectricpoint but I don't see a method in it to use:http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/api/Bio.SeqUtils.IsoelectricPoint-module.html
 is a class. What you're doing in your code is trying to call a method in that class directly. In Python, the first argument to such a function is the class object, but you're passing in a string (). The correct way to use this api is first create a class object:and then you can callYou can read up more on how this all works in the online docs.
It looks like  is an instance method, so you need to create an instance first:
