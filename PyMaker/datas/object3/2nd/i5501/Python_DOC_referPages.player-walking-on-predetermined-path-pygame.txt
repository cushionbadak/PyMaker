I am new to pygame and I am trying to make a game where the player has to bypass some enemy's to get to a point where you can go to the next level. I need the enemy's to walk back and forward on a predetermined path but I can't figure out how to do it. So I was wondering if there is an easy way to do this?This is my code.Here is the download link with the images if you want to run it: https://geordyd.stackstorage.com/s/hZZ1RWcjal6ecZM
I'd give the sprite a list of points () and assign the first one to a  attribute. In the  method I subtract the  from the  position to get a vector () that points to the target and has a length equal to the distance. Scale this vector to the desired speed and use it as the velocity (which gets added to the  vector each frame) and the entity will move towards the target. When the target is reached, I just increment the waypoint index and assign the next waypoint in the list to . It's a good idea to slow down when you're getting near the target, otherwise the sprite could get stuck and moves back and forth if it can't reach the target point exactly. Therefore I also check if the sprite is closer than the  and decrease the velocity to a fraction of the maximum speed.Instead of the waypoints list and index I'd actually prefer to use  and just call  to switch to the next point:
Use a list to have him walk back and forth.
