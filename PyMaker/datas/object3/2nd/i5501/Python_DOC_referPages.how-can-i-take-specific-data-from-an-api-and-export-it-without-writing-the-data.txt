 I'm new to Python and using APIs and would love some help!Using the URL: http://api.worldbank.org/v2/countries?format=xmlI want to gather each country's "iso2Code" and "name".I want to be able to output the data in a cleaner XML file format or an array (but would love the knowledge on how to do both!).I can currently write it to a file and make use of it there, but I am trying to sort it without that extra step.I haven't got much so far at all, but here it is:This is the data I receive upon printing. I want to gather the first two parts.Thanks for the help in advance!
Consider XSLT, the special-purpose language designed to transform XML from complex types to simpler types for your specific needs such as extracting only iso2Code and name. Python's  module can run XSLT 1.0 scripts. However, because is XSLT is portable you don't need  but can call other programs like Linux/Mac's dedicated XSLT processor: xsltproc.XSLTPython (using lxml)Python (command line call to Unix's xsltproc)Output
You can use regular expressions (re) to find strings with findall in the XML and then save the results into a pandas dataframe. Like this:
