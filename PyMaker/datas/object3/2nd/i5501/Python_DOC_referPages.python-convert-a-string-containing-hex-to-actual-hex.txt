I have a hex string, but i need to convert it to actual hex.For example, i have this hex string:One way I could achieve my goal is by using escape sequences:However, I can't do it this way, because I want create together my hex from multiple variables.My program's purpose is to:take in a number for instance multiply it by : convert it to hex add add  againadd  once moreResult I'm expecting is . Now I need to pass this hexadecimal number as argument to a function (as hexadecimal).
In Python, there is no separate type as 'hex'. It represents the hexadecimal notation of the number as . You may check the  yourself by calling it on  as:But in order to represent the value as a hexadecimal, Python prepends the  to the string which represents hexadecimal number. For example:So, in your case in order to display your string as a hexadecimal equivalent, all you need is to prepend it with "0x" as:This way if you probably want to later convert it into some other notation, let's say integer (which based on the nature of your problem statement, you'll definitely need), all you need to do is call  with base 16 as:In fact Python's interpreter is smart enough. If you won't even prepend "0x", it will take care of it. For example:"0x" is all about representing the string is hexadecimal string in case someone is looking/debugging your code (in future), they'll get the idea. That's why it is preferred. So my suggestion is to stick with Python's Hex styling, and don't convert it with escape characters as "\x3f\x48\x00\x00\x3f\x48\x00\x00"From the Python's  document :Convert an integer number to a lowercase hexadecimal string prefixed with “0x”. If x is not a Python int object, it has to define an index() method that returns an integer.
try :Return the binary data represented by the hexadecimal string hexstr.example:
