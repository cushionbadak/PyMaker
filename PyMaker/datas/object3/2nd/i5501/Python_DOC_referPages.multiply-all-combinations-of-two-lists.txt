I really want to know how to extract all the element from two lists and multiply each other. For example, if there are two listsI want to do 1X2, 1X4, 1X6, 1x8, 3x2... etc.One element from A X one element from B.I tried to use zip but because of length difference, I couldn't get right answers.
SInce your question seems to want the cartesian product between two lists, you can use  to bind every element from  with every element from :Then if you want to multiply the the two elements in each tuple, you can do this:
To get a random value from a list, you can do something similar to the following:Importing the random library gives you access to a ton of random generation tools.  Per the random library documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html), random.choice(seq) returns a random element from a non-empty sequence, such as a list. Thus, the code above randomly selects an element from lst and assigns that value to the variable x.I don't want to give the solution away until you've tried using the random library, so I'll let you figure out how to use the information above.
You can use for loops:Operation for each item in A with each item in B:Operation with a random item in A with each item in B:
