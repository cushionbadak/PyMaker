You can simple re-assign  to the correct value:This only works if there is a reference to the original function/class still around (in this case there is ). In case you overwrite something that isn't references somewhere else this won't work.Just to give another example (based on a question in the comments), suppose you overwrote , you can use the  module (or the  module in Python 2):However often it's much easier to restart the Python interpreter (which should also work) and in some cases it might only be the only option (in case nothing else references the overwridden value.
Use the reload buildin function to reload the module. Showcase:
