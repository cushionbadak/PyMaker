I would like to use select.epoll() in my Python library.Unfortunately epoll is not available everywhere.I need a way to fallback to select.select().I tried to find something at pypi, but failed to find a matching package: https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&term=epoll&submit=searchHow could I solve this "fallback from epoll to select if epoll is not available"?
Aside from  stdlib, I would go with uvloop, which is built on top of  in Cython. Compare to /, those two do not have actively maintained python binding, uvloop is more promise.
Python 3.4 introduced the selectors module. It offers a  that is an alias to the "most efficient implementation available on the current platform".Here's a quick usage example:You can find a more complete example on the Python documentation. will try, in this order: (Linux),  (FreeBSD / NetBSD / OpenBSD / OS X) or  (Solaris) (Unix)
How about using libevent which wraps all polling mechanisms and falls back to the best available one based on your platform libevent.org
Here are my two cents on this. According to documentation, epoll is available only on Linux 2.5.44 and newer. With code:Better yet, I reckon that the above could be turned into a nice decorator, to be used wherever you want in your program, that returns the correct function depending on the underlying os.
