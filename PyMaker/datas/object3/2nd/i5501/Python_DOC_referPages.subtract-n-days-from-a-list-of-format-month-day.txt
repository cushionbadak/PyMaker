You probably want to use the builtin datetime and 3rd-party dateutil modules for this. Note you will need to specify a year, since some years have months of differing lengths (i.e leap years) - will assume the current year:
You should be using inbuilt  and  objects to achieve this in simplified way as:PS: You shouldn't be even storing your initial and final list as "[Month, Day]" format. Simply store the list of  objects, and use it where ever you need.  yields the month and  yields the dayNote: You must consider about the year in your code. It is necessary in doing your computation and calculating the days. For example, the calculation for February for leap year and non-leap years yields different results.
