This question already has an answer here:Is there an expression for an infinite generator?                    7 answers                Why does this not create an infinite loop? or thisor thisIs there any way we can create infinite loops using a  loop? I know there is the  loop for that but I was just curious.
 is a class, and using in like e.g.  creates an object of that class. This object is created only once, it is not recreated every iteration of the loop. That's the reason the first example will not result in an infinite loop.The other two loops are not infinite because, unlike the  object, the loop variable  is recreated (or rather reinitialized) each iteration. The values you assign to  inside the loop will be overwritten as the loop iterates.
Consider a  loop:The idea is that as long as  is unchanged, we will loop through each and every  inside  once. For example,will output . In particular, we find that  is a easy way to represent an iterable . Thus,will output .Example 1In this case,  is evaluated once, when the loop begins.Example 2In this case,  is reevaluated every loop, before executing the  and  statements within the body of the loop.Example 3Just like Example 2,  is reevaluated every loop.
You can't, in this case, update the iterator that your  loop is looping over.The  in  is actually a function - it takes a value, a, and returns an object that contains the values that it will loop through. Once you've built that object you can change the input variable as much as you'd like, and that object won't change.Imagine if we made our own similar function called  that generates a list (whereas the built in  function generates a ):Now if we were to use our new function, like so:It'd be obvious that we can't update the list object that we're looping over by changing , because the list that we're looping over has already been made, and isn't being remade on every loop.Can you make an infinite loop in python? Yes, just add a new entry to the object that you're looping through, e.g.:Now we're updating the object that we're looping over.
Because a range is either a list (Python2) or a  object both of which are finite. That range is created once before the loop starts. Your loop variable is assigned the next element of the range at the beginning of each iteration, regardless of what you assign it later in the loop body. You need an infinite iterator for an infinite for loop, e.g. :
 loops and the  objectIf you write  Python does not translate this into something like  (in the C-programming language family).Furthermore the range object is constructed once, before the  loop. The  object, does not know which variables have been used to construct it. Once constructed, the range is fixed.It sees  as an iterable object, and each iteration, it takes the next item the iterable yields. So whether you set the variable or not in the  loop, has no effect for the next iteration.In python-2.x,  is not a specific object, but a call to construct a list. So if you call  (without the  loop), you get .Why it does not work?So then why does the examples do not work?Here we construct  once. After that, the variables based on which it was constructed can change, since the  object does change anymore. Incrementing  thus will not mean the  object will get larger.The  loop each time takes the next item of the iterable. So if we first have collected  from the  loop, the next iteration, we collect . This is regardless what the value of  is.For the very same reason:  does not take into account the previous value of . It only fetches the next item the iterable (here  yields). Since  is fixed, it will simply feed the  loop the next item.Emulating an infinite loopSo we need to construct an iterable that keeps yielding elements. A way to do this is :Or in case you are not interested in any value, we can use  as well:
 copies the parameters given to it for internal use. So changes to those afterwards have no effect. Same as with the loop variable, which is only created from the internal values every time.That's different though if you use a mutable object like a  to iterate over:This loop will indeed run infinitely.
