I am trying to establish a TCP/IP connection between SIMULINK (client) and PYTHON (server). I tried sending the value of a variable in a loop. But the value I receive in SIMULINK is some random values(like 2.5e-09 or something) which hasno relation with the value I sent. I have tried changing the data type on the SIMULINK side.But no luck.Following is the code in PYTHON:Following is my simulink block and the block parameter settings:Can somebody please help?
The Python server is not sending a big endian double which it seems that the client is expecting. Instead it is sending a sequence of new line terminated strings: , , ..., .You can use the  module to format a float as a big endian double for transmission over the connection.There is no need to UTF8 encode the data since it is a binary value that should be sent. takes a format string and a value to pack. In this case the format string  means a big endian double. The returned value is a bytes object representing the packed data. For example the packed value of the float 20.1 is:As you can see, the size for a double is 8 bytes. You might need to set that as the data size in the client.
