I'm suppose to write a code to give me the output of a value between  and  and the current time in the 24 hour clock. However I am getting stuck when it comes to writing the formulas for the 24 hour clock and the print function. Here's the code I have written so far.
Firstly, get the current hour, minute and seconds:Then simply output it:
It seems to me you are asking the user to enter a number between 0 and 86400 and then you want to translate that to  format. But your code is not getting any input from the user, and the last line of the code has syntax errors.To get you started, you need to fix your  calls at the end. Put one statement to a line, and use commas not fullstops:That will give you the output:Which is correct, in the sense that an offset of 70,000 seconds from 0h00 today is 19h26m40s. If you want to get actual user input, then you need to ask for it, at the top of your program, before you do the calculations, in an  call:If you want pretty formatting of the answer then doNone of this relates to finding the current time, which Suraj Kothari's answer addresses.
