I have a data analysis tool that I wrote in Python. I want to be able to schedule this tool to be run as new data comes in, which I can do in Visual Basic.Net.  What I want to do is have a VB process spawn the python process and then send the data it receives from the python off to be reported, but I haven't been able to find much online for this kind of scenario.  What tools should I be using here to make this happen?Edit:What I ended up doing was using .Nets's System.Diagnostic.Process class to start the Python process, and then simply read off of the standard output stream.  This site explained how to do this on the VB side.
You could go for a file based approch: vb tells python about the file to create as well as the data and waits till processing is done, reads the file in againYou could use a shared databaseOr interprocess communication:you could use "the ususal" interprocess communication stuff: named pipes (Python read named PIPE), client/server (UDP Client/Server Socket in Python) , sockets ((Very) basic Python client socket example), ...A good starting point would be the python documentation on interprocess communication
