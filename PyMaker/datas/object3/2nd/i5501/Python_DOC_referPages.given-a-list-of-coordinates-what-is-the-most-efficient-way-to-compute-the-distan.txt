I have a list of coordinates (x,y).What is the most efficient way to compute the distance between each coordinate ?So far it seems like I have to do something like:Is there no faster way ? Or atleast is there a better way to write it ?
Use itertools.combinations:
How about:or:
You could also embed a  function in your class, which calculates the distance between a coordinate and another coordinate. Your class would then look something like this:Then you could just use  to get the coordinate distances between the  objects, as others have suggested:Which Outputs:
You can use list comprehension over multiple index rages:You can make it more readable by extracting the distance calculation into its own named function.
