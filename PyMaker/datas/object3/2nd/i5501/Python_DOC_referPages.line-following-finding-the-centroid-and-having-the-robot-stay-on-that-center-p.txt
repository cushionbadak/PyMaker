Natural Text
I'm having trouble running the last part of my code here. Im using Raspberry Pi, OpenCV, PiCamera, and servo motors. NOT SHOWN i have the code to find the centroid, and from the centroid it will then determine how far off '160' it is. Im not totally sure if the centroid's middle point is 160, so do any of you know that? As well as I get a SyntaxError on the "if: cx>151 and cx<169", would any of you know why that it, or could you help me to figure out a different approach to telling it how to follow the line?
The colon on this line needs to be moved to the end of the line:Also the  lines have the same problem: a colon is missing at the end of the lines!
