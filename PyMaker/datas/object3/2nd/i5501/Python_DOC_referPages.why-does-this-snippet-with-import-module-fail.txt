The following code creates a Python package , then tries to import it. It fails, but works fine if I comment out the line  inside the try/except!When i run it on my Mac (official Python 3.6 installation), I get:This issue only happens on my Mac, not my Windows Python 3.6.It seems that on Mac, the  is adding  to ; I think this could be connected to why the later import fails.
It would appear that  caches the result of your failed import of . When you try to import  it already thinks  doesn't exist, even though you created it. You would have to call  from the  package before trying to import again.Reference: https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.import_moduleIf you are dynamically importing a module that was created since the   interpreter began execution (e.g., created a Python source file), you   may need to call  in order for the new module to be  noticed by the import system.
