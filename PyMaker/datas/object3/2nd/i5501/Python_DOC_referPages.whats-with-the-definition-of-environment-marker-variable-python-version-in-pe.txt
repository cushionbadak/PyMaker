Just a quick question I stumbled upon. It's not really important, but I'm interested in the reason for this and haven't found a quick answer, yet.According to PEP 508 -- Environment Markers (section "Specification" - "Environment markers") marker variable  is defined as .So for Python 3.5.2,  is going to be .However, what if either major or minor version number is higher than 9? The version number would consist of more than 3 characters and  would crop it. Isn't this a possibility for future Python versions?Why not use something like  which still seems very basic and won't overly complicate the code?
I'm sure it is just an oversight or simplification for documentation purposes. The intention is clearly to provide a  version string.Note that historically, there never has been a minor version number with double digits. So far, Python has managed with just one digit, always. The highest numbers, so far, have been ,  and . That's not to say there never will be a  in future, but so far, it just hasn't come up.I'd imagine an actual implementation to use :orHowever, both forms are rather a bit more verbose to fit into a PEP table column aiming to document rather than prescribe code.If in doubt, write to the Python-dev mailing list. I'm sure that if this was to become so confusing as to be problematic, the PEP can be adjusted.As for pip; it uses the vendored  library to handle environment markers, which has implemented the  marker verbatim as specced in the PEP. If you feel strongly about it, you could file an issue there, the PEP maintainers are active on that project.Note that there is still plenty of time. So far, 3.x releases each take about 18 months to appear (3.2: 2011-02, 3.3: 2012-09, 3.4: 2014-03, 3.5: 2015-09, 3.6: 2016-12, 3.7: expected 2018-06), so we have 5 years or so to address this.
