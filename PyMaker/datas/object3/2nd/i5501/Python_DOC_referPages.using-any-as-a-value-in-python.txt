I'm writing a function like this (in the context of AWS/SNS):The value  in the condition is actually the built-in function any. But here I'm not using it for its designed purpose, but as a constant, to indicate that any topic would be accepted without colliding with any possible existing topic value (which are strings).I have the feeling this is not a good idea, but I can't find a good reason why it isn't. Also, I've tried googling this, but "any" is too common a word and I haven't had luck finding a discussion about this.Is this right, wrong, pythonic?
Not sure what you want, but using  as value is wrong unless it's correct to call  with  as second parameter:To check if  is not  use .It's possible that you want  instead .
