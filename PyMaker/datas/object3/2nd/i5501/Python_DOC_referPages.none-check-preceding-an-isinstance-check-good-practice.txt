Is it good practice to test for not  preceding an  check in Python? For example: Or can I do without and is this sufficient?
To answer your question, doing a  check is unnecessary, because - Meaning, if  is , then the  condition would return  anyway, making the  check redundant. So, in summary, Works just as well.Furthermore, if you want to test whether an object is numeric in nature, a simpler way to do so would be using the  module - Note that  tests all numeric objects from the very root of the hierarchy. This also includes complex numbers, so if that isn't what you want, you can test with  to  instead.
It raises no error, so I would actually prefer the version without the 'is None' check, as it is just less code.
