Getting an error with this code(SyntaxError: invalid syntax)Result:but same code working fine when i use it without list comprehension method.result:
You are missing the . Also, you should use  to test ints and strings for equality because  checks object identity:You could also shorten the  to a  check and generally consider to use  for more robust suffix checking:See the docs on list comprehensions.
The problem is the yield part of the expression:You want to add  to the list, so:But the code is very inelegantly. You use  which is reference equality. Although most interpreters cache characters, and small integers, it is a bit risky to rely on it: the more assumptions that have to be satisfied for a program to work, the more can go wrong.Furthermore you can detect whether  will end with , by checking . Since  is a multiple of , we can even drop the first check then. We can check for an integer  being zero with  (this is  is ).So a more safe and shorter solution is:This then produces then:
