Natural Text
I am running a terminal command to list a directory, I would like to loop through each line returned and search for a particular filename, I have this so far...But this is just outputing the list and doesn't seem to be searching for the file, anyone have an example they can point me at?
Calling  from within  would return a  Object.So, first, You might want to convert the returned value to a String.And then split the  with New-Line ("\n") as delimiter.Afterwards, you can iterate and search for your Needle in the List-Values.
You can try to pass in the encoding  and split it by .As originally,  was returning bytes, thus we pass in encoding here. Also, since you want to search it line by line, we split it with . (Tested on Python 3.): ... By default, this function will return  the data as encoded bytes. The actual encoding of the output data may  depend on the command being invoked, so the decoding to text will  often need to be handled at the application level.This behaviour may be overridden by setting universal_newlines to True  as described above in Frequently Used Arguments. -- cited from https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.check_output
Why not use something that is more reliable such as  or :The  function returns a list of files that match the wildcard. In this case, you will have  if the file exists, or  if not.

to output the contents of a directory, i would recommend the os module.then you have a searchable list.But are you sure, your file ist named (myfile.txt) ??
