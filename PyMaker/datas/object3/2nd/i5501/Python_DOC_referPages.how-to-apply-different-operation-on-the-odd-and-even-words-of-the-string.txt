I am trying to update my string such that:every word on the odd position becomes uppercase.every word on the even position gets reversedFor example, if my input string is:I want my output string to be:Here's the code I tried:
Your solution is incomplete. Instead of slicing every alternate word and performing one kind of operation at a time, iterate over each one in turn, handling it as appropriate.Here's one simple way of tackling your problem. Define a little function to do this for you. split the string into wordsfor each word, check if it is an even word. If it is, then uppercase it. If not, reverse itjoin the transformed words into a single stringWhat  does is split the string into a list of words.  transforms the list into a list of (index, word) tuples. Use the index to determine whether the word is an odd or even word.  transforms the function into a generator, yielding one word at a time from the loop. Finally,  joins each word back into a single string.Note that there are other ways to accomplish this. I leave them as an exercise to you.
You may use  with the list comprehension expression (along with ) to get the desired string. For example:Note: Here I am using list comprehension instead of generator expression because though generator expressions are more efficient but that is not the case when used with . In order to know the reason for this weird behavior, please take a look at: Raymond Hettinger's answer for "List comprehension without [ ] in Python"Blckknght's answer for "List vs generator comprehension speed with join function" Most of the comprehension based answers here are using generator though they are referring it as list comprehension :D :D
A little be more descriptive in one single line:OUTPUT:
Another list comprehension solution:Output:Another solution:Output:
taking not to high level, just by if-else:
Another way to answer your question using comprehension : Output:
How about:Iterate with  to keep a count.Check the odd vs even with Uppercase if even, reverse string (i.e. ) if oddJoin the list of substrings with
