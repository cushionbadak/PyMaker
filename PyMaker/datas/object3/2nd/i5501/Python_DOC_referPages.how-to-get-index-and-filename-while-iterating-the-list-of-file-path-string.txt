Say I have a hypothetical list that lists down some csv files:And I would like the print to be like:Doing a simple  loop prints only the first string three times. I thought I would specify the indexes for python to 'recognise' which file I'm referring to, like so:This too however prints out only the first string. How do I customise what is printed for each index?
Job for : enumerates the list with setting starting index as  prints in desired format, with  getting the last member of the  -ted list.As  is the directory separator in POSIX systems, no filename can contain , so  should works the same as . But, it's better to use  BTW.Example:
 your list, print a formatted string. You can get the base-name of a file with .
You need  (to get indices while iterating) with  (to get filename from the filepath) to achieve this. Here's a list comprehension expression as an example:
