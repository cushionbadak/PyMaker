You’re close to two different solutions here! One is to make a list (well, an iterable) of true or false values indicating whether each item of  is in , then check if any one is true:The other is to check if the set intersection between the tokens and the operations isn’t empty:The former is more typical, but this might have been what you were going for with the second .
If you want to know the tokens corresponding to file operations in the input, we can do:operations will be a list containing all tokens that represented a file operationFor example:operations will contain ["open", "move"]If you want to print the list:Hope this answers your question.
