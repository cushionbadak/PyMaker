I have some functions:I'd like to put them in a list, shuffle them, and call each of them in succession: My idea was to call each function like this:But this throws a What am I doing wrong, and how can I get this to work?
You have a task to choose one of these functions at random. Here's a small demo does what you're doing, but correctly.Or, if it's only one function you want, there's no need to use  at all. Use  instead. Why Your Error Occurs performs an inplace shuffling, as the docs mention. So, when you call the function, expect nothing in return. In other words, expect  in return. Further, calling  on an object invokes its  method. Since  objects do not have such a method, this errors out with . For an object to be callable, you'd need - As an exercise, try removing  and rerunning the code. Calling  should give you the same error.
