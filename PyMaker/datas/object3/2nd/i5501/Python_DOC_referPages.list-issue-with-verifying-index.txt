Need to make a program that will receive 20 numbers (1 to 10) from the user and put them in a list. Afterwards the user types in a number; it should print how many times the number the user typed appears and the index of such numbers.I have tried but can't find a solution.
To get number of times number appears in list use:And to get indices of appearances use:
https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html explains that index returns the 0 based index of the first occurrence of the value.  If you want to count the occurrences of a value, use  instead.  
I used List comprehension to iterate through the list and enumerate to find the index.
Instead of using a list you could use a dictionary to store numbers with each unique user entry as a key and it's count as value.
Although Zipa's answer is pretty much the best , if you want another method for this  operation then you can try this:def count(x,list_):        return len([i for i in list_ if i == x])NOTE:  This method is slower than  as it involves array generation and  counting and I am sure  must be using some very optimized algorithm in comparison to mine.
