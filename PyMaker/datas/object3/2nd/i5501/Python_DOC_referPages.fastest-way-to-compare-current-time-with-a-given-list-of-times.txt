I just want to compare current time (in only hours and minutes) with a given list of times and get the closest time (or just previously available time in the list) value from the list.What I want:Assuming that my list is in sorted with time, what could be the fastest way of doing this?
Binary search for  in your array. That's the simple part. The more complicated part is to define some comparing logic between your hours, to decide if your binary search algorithm should continue searching in the left part or the right part of the remaining array.This will guarantee a O(log(n)) complexity time, and a O(n) space complexity. 
I am not sure if this will be the fastestAbove will result to 6:00:00 AM.
