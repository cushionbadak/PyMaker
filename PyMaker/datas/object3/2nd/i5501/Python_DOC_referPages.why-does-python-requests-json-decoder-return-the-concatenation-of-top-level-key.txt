I am using the Requests library to decode a JSON response as follows:Payload Being Decoded:Code:Output:objectOneobjectTwoI followed the simple example from the official documentation:JSON Response ContentIn addition I wrapped the response in  brackets to see if the response must be in a JSON array but it just returns an array with 'objectOneobjectTwo' as the 1st and only element. 
You have misdiagnosed what is happening.  is returning the correct dictionary. But you are passing a dictionary to , without any further processing. However,  is not set up to handle dictionaries. What happens is that  takes an iterable and will serve each value from the iterable as a string. In essence, you told Django to send only the keys, concatenated, to the client. From the  documentation: should be an iterator or a string. If itâ€™s an iterator, it should return strings, and those strings will be joined together to form the content of the response.and from the  documentation:  Return an iterator over the keys of the dictionary. This is a shortcut for .If you wanted to send JSON data, use a  object instead. It is set up to encode Python objects correctly:or don't bother with decoding and re-encoding, just pass on the original response data:Note: I removed the class and  decorator; there is little point in wrapping static view functions in a class when no state is shared. Use modules to create namespaces instead. 
Your data is a JSON object, which is parsed into a Python dictionary. HttpResponse expects an iterable, which it iterates through when returning the response upstream; usually you pass a string (ie the result of rendering a template), but here you pass a dictionary. Iterating through a dictionary gives the keys only. If you want to show the full output, convert to a string first by passing  - which of course is pointless since it will just be the same as the raw response.
