I have a python object that represents a connection to a rest api with a large number of endpoints. I need to come up with a strategy to organize hundreds of method calls (right now I am using prefixes on the methods). I would also like to break up the files if that's possible.I am working in python 2.7Two give more clear questions -1) Is it possible to split an object into multiple files in some sort of effective manner in python? Specifically without introducing more complexity?2) Is it possible to make "submodules" for lack of a better phrase, sorather than
You can implement the groups as mixins. For example like this:user_actions.pythe_api.pyThen you can call  once you have an object created.
