I am trying to add values for duplicate keys in a dictionary. I am not sure why my code isn't working.I would like to get a list with the added values as result at index 3 and 0 for an index that doesn't exist:My code: I am making list of zeros and adding dictionary in a loop.It's throwing an error:TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not strAppreciate your help.
you don't even need a dictionary here (but I'll leave it in). just zip indices & values and add to your zeroed list. Also the length of your result list is incorrect. Compute it using  of the indices plus one:result:
This loops over the items at the top-level of : first  and , and then  and . But you're looking for  to take on the values 0, 3, 7, 3, etc., and for  to be , , , etc.To loop over the indices in  and the values in , use . It will pull one item at a time from each sublist in parallel.
Using a shorter, though not as effecient, list comprehension:Output:
