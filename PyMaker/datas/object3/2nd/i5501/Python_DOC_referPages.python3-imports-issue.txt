Python looks for files with a .py extension when importing modules. So a file named myfile will not be recognized simply by the command . The pythonic way to ensure that the interpreter will find the module is to ensure it has a .py extension. Renaming myfile to myfile.py and install to install.py and then changing the import command toshould solve the problem.
