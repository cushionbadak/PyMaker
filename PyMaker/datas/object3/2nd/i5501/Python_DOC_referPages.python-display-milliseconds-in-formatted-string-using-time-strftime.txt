I am trying to format milliseconds to formatted string preserving the milliseconds part. Here's my code: where 1515694048121 is a time in milliseconds. It returns me:2018-01-11 18:07:28:fAs we can see, the millisecond portion of time is not returned.What is correct format to include millisecond portion of time? Is  not correct ?
There is the no directive mentioned in  that will return you the milliseconds. Not sure from where you got the reference to use . In fact  holds the precision only upto seconds.As a hack, in order to achieve this, you may explicitly format your string by preserving your milli second value as:Here's the list of valid directives:
In fact time.gmtime gets a number of seconds as input parameter. As a consequence, the milliseconds are not taken into account:The function documentation clearly mentions it:Fractions of a second are ignored.
