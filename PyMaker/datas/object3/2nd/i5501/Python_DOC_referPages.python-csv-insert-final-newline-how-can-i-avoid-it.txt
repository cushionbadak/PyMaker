Let's say I create a csv with two lines:When reading it, I get a final new line:Of course, this can be expected, but in my case I would prefer not to have it since it would be easier to interpret: No need to check for empty lines when doing a split.
As a workaround you could use a  object to write to. The output could then have  applied to it before writing to a file:This has the benefit of preserving the full functionality of the CSV library. I would though recommend you keep the trailing newline.For an iterative approach:This writes the data a row at a time and then deals with the last row using the  approach to remove the trailing newline.
After a bit of investigation, I found the writerow source: https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/tip/Modules/_csv.c#l1254And, from what I can guess, there is no such option in there
