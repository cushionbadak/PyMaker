Natural Text
I have two text files,  and . In  are students and in  are questions. Each student corresponds to one question, but sometimes questions are the same and I want to not repeat questions.
If you want to pair up each student with exactly one question use:Output:If either list given as input to  is shorter, zip will only create pairs up to that item, the rest is discarded - so make sure you have at least  questions.For more then one question per student without repeat you can  use:Output:Remark: this is much slower then the solution by Jojo using  because you need to reshuffle the compllete list of question for each student, while  will only draw k samples per student.Doku for shuffle: https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.shuffle
What you want is to draw a random sample of the questions. From the docs:random.sample(population, k): Return a k length list of unique elements chosen from the population sequence. Used for random sampling without replacement.In that way you avoid drawing the same question multiple times for a single student.Something like:
Changeto to remove all duplicate questions.
