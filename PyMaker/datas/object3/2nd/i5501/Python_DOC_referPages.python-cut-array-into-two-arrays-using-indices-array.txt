I have an array, let's say arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]and another indices array: idx = [0, 3, 4, 6]and I want to get two arrays, one is only those indices from arr: [1, 4, 5, 7]and another one is all the rest: [2, 3, 6, 8]Can someone help me with that? I can only think of ugly ways to do it, but it must be some function that does it elegantly. Thanks a lot!
You could do it like this:If  has no duplicates, you could also do:
Way to do it:
With one traversal:Or (as commented by Chris_Rands):Though  should either be small for this or turned into a set (same goes for the solutions in the other answers, I guess they just don't want to talk about it).Demo:
There is a neat solution with :
You can use  for a one line solution:Output:
You can also map each value in  to a dictionary, indicating if it's index is present in :Which gives this dictionay:I also converted  to a set since in this case, duplicate indices are not necessary, and set/dictionary lookup is . However, list lookup is , so this optimization is worth it if possible. Once you have this dictionary,  you can  out the elements you want to keep, and the rest of the elements from this:Which Outputs:Note: You can also use list comprehensions above filtering of  and :
