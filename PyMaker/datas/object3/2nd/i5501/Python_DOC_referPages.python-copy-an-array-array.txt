Is there a way to copy an  (not a ) in Python, besides just creating a new one and copying values, or using  and ? I can't seem to find anything in the documentation. If not, is there a similar builtin datatype that can do this?I am working on a high-performance module, so the faster the answer, the better.My current solution is just using  and , which is about 1.8 times faster from my tests.
Not sure what your  includes, but using a sample:Some set up:Timing various methods(using the %timeit magic in a Jupyter Notebook):SlicingDeepcopynumpy copy ... NOTE: This produces a numpy array, not an array.arrayList Comprehension and array.array conversionnumpy copy and array.array conversionCopying to an existing array
 would work fine.
