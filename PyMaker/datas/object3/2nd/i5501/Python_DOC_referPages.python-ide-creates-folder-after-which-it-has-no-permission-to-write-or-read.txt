In a project I have a function that creates a folder when it doesn't exist yet with the os package.Now I run into the error then when this folder is created (I run the script with the IDE pycharm) nobody has access, hence the error "IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied" occurs.The project runs in a virtual environment, python2.7 and the function is in the gist of:What is causing the folder to be inaccessible? Any insights why this is occurring? If I missed any relevant information please let me know.(changing the permission rights per folder is no solution as the folders need to be created on the fly by user input)
According to the documentation you can set the permission on directory with:Beware that mode is not string but octal
