Your server doesn't support CRAM_MD5.Check the CAPABILITY of a server before you try to use an extension:Gmail supports Authenticate methods XOAUTH2, PLAIN, PLAIN-CLIENTTOKEN, OAUTHBEARER, and XOAUTH (plus the baseline non-authenticate LOGIN).PLAIN is standard.  I'm not sure what PLAIN-CLIENTTOKEN is.  The rest are variants of OAUTH.
