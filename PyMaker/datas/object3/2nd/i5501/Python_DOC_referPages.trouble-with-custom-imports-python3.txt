I am trying to import my own files in Python3. My directory looks like this:init:custom_module:custom_module2:launcher:it says that there is no module named custom_module
Actually, if you just put an empty file called  file, python will treat the directory as a package and you can import it with the dot notation.then from launcher.pyThe init.py files are required to make Python treat the directories as containing packages; this is done to prevent directories with a common name, such as string, from unintentionally hiding valid modules that occur later on the module search path. In the simplest case, init.py can just be an empty file, but it can also execute initialization code for the package or set the all variable, described later.Source: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#Packages
