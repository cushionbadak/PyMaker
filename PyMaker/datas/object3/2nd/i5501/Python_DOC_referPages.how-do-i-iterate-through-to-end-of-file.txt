Natural Text
I want the following code to read this existing text file.How do I do write some good to get this output.This is what I have so far...

This might be one option to solve your Problem: Explanation:Initializing our counter for the rowcountOpen our file in read mode an put each in an array called 'data'.Now you go through each element of the array, its value is stored in line. The print line calls our countervariable, adds a blankspace, puts the line from the file. .rstrip() cuts some crap like newlines. NOTE: This one is build on my opion how your file could look like. You should post what your file contains "exactly".Tanks to @Guy his proposal makes the code more simple and understandable:
To just print the line number:If you want to make changes to the existing file, you need to do it in two stages, i.e. read it in, close file, write out the updated values, for example:Assuming that your input file is:You will get an updated output file: is used to give you a counter for each line. If you wish to start the counter from  you could add . is used as each line read in from the file will already contain a trailing newline. Using  also adds a newline, so with you need to remove the trailing newline or stop Python adding one when printing.
