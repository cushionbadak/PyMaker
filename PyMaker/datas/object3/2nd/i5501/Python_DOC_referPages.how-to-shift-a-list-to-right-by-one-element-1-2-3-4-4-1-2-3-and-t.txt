I am making a basic bubble sort and I am still quite new to programming and so my code is probably not that efficient or well designed. My Code:I have come across an error in the loop as if you enter: 142, 324, 23123, 645, 643 it will push 23123 to the right but the rest of the numbers will be in descending order. Now because this was a problem I tried to solve this by making a new if statement to check the last and first number, then it would have to put the last number to the front [2, 1, 3] --> [3, 2, 1]. But when doing this i used a for loop without the: - and numbers[i] != numbers2[i + 1] - (see problem), this ended up changing the whole line of numbers into the first number in the list.I added the second list but then I tried the code above and i get this error:TypeError: '>' not supported between instances of 'bool' and 'str'So I searched to see if I could put a but in instead of the and but I found nothing. Sorry for being a long question.
Simplest way to achieve this is via using list slicing feature as:Move RightMove LeftYou can join these logic in a single custom function to shift left and right as:In the above  function, for:shifting left: pass positive integer  to shift left by  stepsshifting right: pass negative integer  to shift right by  stepsSample Run:As an alternative, you may also use  with list comprehension and . It is little complicated than above solution, but still a way simpler than yours:Move RightMove Left
