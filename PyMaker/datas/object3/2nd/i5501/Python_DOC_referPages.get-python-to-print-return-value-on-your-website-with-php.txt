I'm running apache2 web server on raspberry pi3 model B. I'm setting up smart home running with Pi's and Uno's. I have a php scrypt that executes python program>index.php. It has rwxrwxrwx >I'll change that late becouse i don't fully need it. And i want to real-time display print from python script.  Let's say that output is "Hello w"How can i import/get printed data from .py?
shell_exec returns the output of your script. so use should work! let me know if it doesn'tedit: oh hey! your question got me looking at doc to check myself and exec actually returns the last line of output if you need only the last output.or, you can set a second parameter to exec() to store all output lines in an array (1 entry per line) as thisaight! this was fun!
First make sure you have permissions to write read execute  for web user.You can you user For php file and file you want to run. Credits ---> Ralph Thomas Hopper
