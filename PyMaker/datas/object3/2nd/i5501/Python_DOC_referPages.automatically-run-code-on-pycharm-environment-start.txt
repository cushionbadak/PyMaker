So, I have just started using PyCharm because I want to get more into Python (have more experience with other languages), and have run into a conundrum that there has to be a solution for. Some custom function I created relies on a module being imported in a particularly verbose way, so I don't want to have to copy-paste the same two lines every time I want to code, as opposed to simply typing import numpy as np.So is there a way to automatically run some code on my environment's start? Particularly to import some modules? I looked around PyCharm's settings, and have found nothing, so I'd be extremely grateful if anyone can help me out
Do   (or ).Then: This gives you a dialogue with an edit box Starting script. Put your import code there. That will run every time you open a new console.
