I am trying to create a function, which returns a vector and then integrating it element by element. This is what I have so farThis works if I type something likeHoweverdoes not work, or any reasonable variant I can think of. How can I get it to work?either i get TypeError: 'function' object has no attribute 'getitem' if i leave out the b or ValueError: invalid callable given if I have it in.
The first argument of  must be a function, something that call be called. Something that you can put (0.1) after and it will make sense. Does  make sense? To me neither. The form  is syntactically correct but  only allows scalar outputs of the function, so it won't work with your . Instead, you need to make a new function that uses  but then returns only one of its components. Instead of having another  somewhere, it's better to make such a function right where it is needed, using  syntax:This says: take , put it in , keep the index-2 entry of the returned array.
