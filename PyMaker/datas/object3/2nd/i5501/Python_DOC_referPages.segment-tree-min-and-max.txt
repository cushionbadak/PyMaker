I am trying to build a segment tree whose parent node should contain min and max values of its children nodes.Now when I am trying to implement this I am facing an error which is that one child can return an integer whereas other child can return a list and operating max or min function will raise an error.How to overcome this?
This will work using isinstance(object, list)Edit: reformatting for clarity: 
You could write a min/max function yourself if I understood the problem right:
