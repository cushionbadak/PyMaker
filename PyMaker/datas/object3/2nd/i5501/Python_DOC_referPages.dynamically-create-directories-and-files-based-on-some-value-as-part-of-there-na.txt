In order to generate your string for the file and directory name, you may use  function. For example:Also, it is better to use  in your case, because it creates the directory recursively, without checking for it whether path to it exists or not. (But be careful to give the correct path) (Note: with this an  is raised if the target directory already exists.)Now you need to use nested  loops for your case. Outer loop for your directory generation, and inner loop for your file generation. Here's the sample code:Modify the above sample code with your logic.
If you are using Python3, you need to use the format() function.
