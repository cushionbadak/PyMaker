I made a simple program with ten ovals. I will work with them later and I'll need to move ovals, so I need unique name for every oval. However, there is a lot of ovals so I don't want to make every oval on new line of code. I used loop, but then I am not able to make unique name for them. Like for example:self.oval_id1 = self.canvas.create_oval(40,40,60,60)self.oval_id2 = self.canvas.create_oval(60,40,80,60)...etcIs there any way to make such names in loop please?
You probably want :So, something like:
Even if tricks could allow you to achieve that, you do not want that. It you need it to be iterable, use an iterable container first, here a list.You can now use  to access the i-th oval
