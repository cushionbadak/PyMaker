I'm quite new to Python and I am still having a hard time actually using the language itself into my program. Here's what I have so far:Now the program is supposed to yield outputs like these:

This composes a list comprehension using  from itertools (which is part of the standard library) to interleave items from both lists into a , which by default uses  as the fillvalue. This also uses  also from  to flatten the list. Finally it filters the  items from the list: Or as recommended from @EliKorvigo, use  for iterating lazily:Testing
A basic approach:You could  the lists normally, and append the rest of the biggest list if both lists are not the same size:Which works as follows:Another possible approach:You could also use  to convert the lists to  objects beforehand, and pop off the beginning of each one with , until one of the objects is empty. Then you could append the rest of the list that is not yet empty. Here is an example:Note: Both of the approaches are  time, which is expected for this kind of problem. 
Here's a solution that deals in iterators. The advantage to this is that it will work with any iterable data structure, not just lists.
If you don't care whether your original lists ( and  in the following example) change, you can use the following snippet:Produces the following output:
