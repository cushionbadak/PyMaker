I am making a game in Python 3.6.4.When the player touches the red circle, the player should teleport back to the start. Question 1: How do I move the turtle to the start if it hits the red circle? My code:The error I get is:Question 2: How do I fix this error?
The approach I would take to solve both issues is don't do the position comparisons yourself, use the  method that turtle provides:Here's a complete example that lets you click on the screen to move the player around but if the player gets too close to the heart of the enemy, it will teleport back to the start where you can once again move by clicking on the screen:
 returns the turtle’s position; it doesn’t test being present at a given position (as attempted by your  line) or set it (as attempted by your last line).  The former job is performed by  comparison, while the latter is .Separately, your code contains no provision for user input, so there is no way to “react” to the player arriving anywhere; perhaps you already know that.
It seems that you are not familiar with the founction pos().This kind of arguments are  not satisfied requirement.I suggest you read the helping document agau
In your if statement, you wrote .  returns the Turtle's position. To check if this position is equal to (100, -100), simple do: . To make change the player's position, use . The following code should be what you are trying to do: Hope this helps!
