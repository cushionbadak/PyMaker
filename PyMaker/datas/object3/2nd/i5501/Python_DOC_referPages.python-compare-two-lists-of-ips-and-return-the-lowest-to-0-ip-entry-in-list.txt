I have managed to compile two lists of IP addresses. used and unused ips as suchwhat I want to be able to do now is compare these lists and return the next free IP. in the above example the next ip would be 172.16.100.2/32, until it handed out all of those from 1 to 32 then it would hand out 34.im not sure where to begin with this, I can convert these to IPv4Network objects if there is something built in for this but I couldn't find anything in documentationThanks
I'd keep a  of  objects and manipulate them to allocate and de-allocate the addresses, like so:Note: is a nomenclature for IP networks, not IP hosts. objects are comparable, so functions like  work on them. is a perfectly valid IP address, depending upon the netmask. If you don't want to allocate it, either keep it out of , or make the program aware of the netmask in use.
You want ips that are in unused but not used:You want to sort them to get the one that's closest to zero. Naive sorting will not work as you have strings; 172.16.xxx.xxx is sorted higher than 172.100.xxx.xxx for example. You can convert the IPs into lists of numbers to sort them correctly.
If you're just trying to iterate through a list of the available ips, you could do something like this:
