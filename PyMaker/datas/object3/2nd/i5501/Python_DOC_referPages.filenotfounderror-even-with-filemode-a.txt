I have code that looks like this:This should open the file  (or create it if it doesn't exist). However, I get a :All resources I have seen indicate that  instead of  should fix this, but this clearly fails. How can I resolve it?
The  function expects a path-like object that points to a file in an existing directory. When the directory does not exist an error is raised, in my case in Python 3.6 the error is:NotADirectoryError: [Errno 20] Not a directory: '/Users/grr/datei.log/'As @cᴏʟᴅsᴘᴇᴇᴅ pointed out the trailing  adds a '/' at the end of your file descriptor making it appear to be a path instead of a file. This is what is causing the error.
