Natural Text
I have pulled JSON files from an API using the command line. I am hit with decode errors when attempting to load the file using the JSON module. As far as I can tell the files are definitely JSON. When I copy paste the JSON file to a new text file and save it as a JSON file, I can parse the file no problem. I would like to avoid manually copy, pasting, resaving all these files every time i need to run my script.Sample of Json:How i am opening:Error: 
I think I've got it. Most likely, the original file is saved in Unicode - also referred to as [Wikipedia]: Wide character ( - check [MSDN]: Working with Strings for more details) in Win world.To demonstrate, I created 3 files containing the json below, but each having something different:ux.jsn - Ux style eoln ( or 0x0A)win.jsn - Win style eoln ( or 0x0D 0x0A)uc.jsn - The Wide character format that I talked about (the eolns are Win style, but that's irrelevant)Then, some code that for each one of the files:Opens it in binary (or raw) mode, gets its content and displays it (using [Python]: repr(object)) on screenOpens it in normal mode and tries to load its json content (and display it on screen as well)code.py:Output (running Python3.6.2x86 on W10x64):Conclusions:Although they apparently have the same content, it's not the case. The faulty file has twice the size, that is because each character is represented on 2 bytes (and since they are all regular ASCII characters, the 1st byte is  or 0x00)For some reason, json does not like that and throws an error when trying to parse the content (although the errors are a little bit different)When you copy/paste the file, Win automatically converts it to a normal format and therefore json is able to parse it afterwardsAs a fix, I converted it using a dummy method (note that if the json content may contain legitimate s, they will be removed as well), although I'm sure there are tools that do this properly:
