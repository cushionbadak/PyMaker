How would I find all possibilities of a 10 char string using the chars "a","b" and "c". I know there are 3^10 possibilities but I'm not sure how to code it. I know there's a good chance there's already an answer for this but I just can't find it. Thanks.EDITI've already tried to do it using the itertools module, in particular using the permutations and combinations modules but all to no avail.
Look at the itertools module.  should do the job.
