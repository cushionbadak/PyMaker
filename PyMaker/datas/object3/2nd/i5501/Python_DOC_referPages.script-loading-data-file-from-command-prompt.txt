This question already has an answer here:How to read/process command line arguments?                    17 answers                Kinda new to this, and writing a script that loads in latitudes and longitudes from a CSV file and converts the formatting for another program to read...finally got it all to work.I was wondering how I might set this up so I could maybe run ./converter.py filename.csv from a command prompt rather then having the filename embedded in the script?Currently I have this:
Since you said you have a working program (albeit hardcoded for filenames), I'll provide a solution:A couple notes: module contains access to pass CLI arguments is a list of argument variables as discussed in the docs. syntax is referred to as a context manager.

When you exit the  block, the file with automatically close. flag is specific to Python 3, if you do not have that version simply omit it
