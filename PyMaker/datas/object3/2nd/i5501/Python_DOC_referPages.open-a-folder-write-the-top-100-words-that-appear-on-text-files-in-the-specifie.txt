Natural Text
I want to code a class called  and within this class I have to code the following functions based on a folder directory.: returns a  of the frequency of the overall top 100 words found in the text files of the said folder, not caring for CAPS.: returns a  of frequency of the letters (a-z)How do I write this  ?
Just do for loop inside of the file(text file ofc) and add every word and how many times it occurs and return the dictionary. To split words just add the whole text of the file in one string amd use split function to separate the words into list and loop through it and do the dictionary thing i told you at the begging.
Use in  to iterate over filesUse in  for counting objects(words, letters)ExampleEnvironment:Data:Snippet:Output:
