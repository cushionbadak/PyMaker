Natural Text
I am new to python this is what i am trying to achieve: I am trying to achieve words that can be formed by any 4 common letters for example: Is there easy way to do this in python without using regex.
You'll need to do this in a few steps, I think.First, you need to figure out what your set of letters is. You could use the whole alphabet, but I'd recommend against that if you can avoid it. I'd try using a set:Next, you need to iterate through all combinations of four letters in your pool and check which words can be formed with them. This is why it's probably better not to use the whole alphabet; this is a lot of combinations. In the example below, I'm storing the results in a dictionary keyed by the combination of letters, but you could modify that to suit your needs.Note the  syntax; it means if the loop does not break, the code in the  clause executes. Basically, for a given combination of letters, this code checks each word and determines if it is composed of just those letters. If it is, it stores that information. If a given combination doesn't form any words, its entry in the dictionary is removed (to save on memory). Note that this is a pretty naive solution and will not scale well. If you want to print out the results, you can do:
You can achieve this using sets and itertools.combinations:
