This question already has an answer here:How do you rotate a two dimensional array?                    60 answers                I'm trying to 'rotate' a grid 90 degrees clockwise and came up with the following Python code.printing rotate90(grid) on the grid  outputs , whereas I expected . What is the reason for this difference?(The reason I haven't converted these to ints is that eventually I will be using '@' and '-' characters rather than numbers.)
Your function doesn't work because you didn't make a new structure when you initialized .  You made a copy of each row, but the elements are pointers to the originals in .  When you assigned within the loop, you were pointing to shared matrix locations.Fix it with this:Given that change, your code produces the desired output.
We can easily transpose a list  with , then reverse the sublistsreturns
