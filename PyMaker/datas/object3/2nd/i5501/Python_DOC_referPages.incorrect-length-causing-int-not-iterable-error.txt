I am attempting to loop through a matrix, called , randomly using the  function. My matrix is an 8x8 and prints fine.  However when I attempt to randomly loop through each element of this matrix I am getting the error 'TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable'Due the upper limit of the range, . I'm unsure as to why this is. I have not used  in a loop before, is it perhaps that it can't be used the same way range is used? I've also tried to set the range as: I thought maybe the length was one too long but to no avail.
You are correct.  returns a single element from within the given range. On the other hand,  returns a list of elements, and is therefore iterable.You could try something like this:
The method  does not return a range, but a randomly selected element instead as can be read in the doc.Return a randomly selected element from . This is equivalent to , but doesnâ€™t actually build a range object.That is why you get a , you are indeed trying to loop over an .I would not recommend looping in a random order over your lists, but if it turns out to be necessary, I would use .Note that in Python3, you would need to cast your  to a  first.
