I have a NumPy array with the following shape:I would like to generate a list of arrays where each one has the following shape:
You can use  to signify all dimensions up to the last. For example:The list of the last dimension arrays can be constructed as @Usernamenotfound mentioned or with  like so:Each element has the shape . Likewise you could so the same for the first dimension, making 4 (3, 2) arrays.
You can also permute the axes with  then simply iterate through the array:
You can slice the 3D array usingThe above would give you a list of 2D arrays.The same process can be scaled for multidimensional arrays
