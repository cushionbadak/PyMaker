What goes on under the hood in  statement? For example:Can we say that implicitly something like this happens?
The value ofis surprisingly neither  nor  - it's simply  or  :-)More precisely - from Python Language Reference:The expression  first evaluates ; if  is true, its value is returned; otherwise,  is evaluated and the resulting  value is returned.Then, for evaluation in the  statement:In the context of Boolean operations, and also when expressions are used by control flow statements, the following  values are interpreted as false: , , numeric zero of all types, and empty strings and containers (including  strings, tuples, lists, dictionaries, sets and frozensets). All other values are interpreted as true. User-defined objects  can customize their truth value by providing a  method.So, in your particular case,  is empty, so its boolean value is interpreted as , andwill evaluate to the value of the variable , i. e. to .Thenis interpreted asbecause  is not empty.
if you saythen  is equals to . So if evaluates expression and operates on that answer. Since Python takes non empty strings, lists, non  values, not zero numbers - as  then whole system follows bool algebra.
