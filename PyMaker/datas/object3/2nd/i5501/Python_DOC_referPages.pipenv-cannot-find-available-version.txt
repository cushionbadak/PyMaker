Warning: I'm new to python and pipenvI'm trying to create a reproducible DC/OS test setup using  with . I think what follows is more of a  issue.I first installed: and if I do  I can see:Then, I attempt to install  and it complains that it cannot find Despite of the error message,  seems to be installed and working.My Pipfile after the failed install looks like this:I also tried to explicitly install  but I get the same error message as above.I did try a "plain"  within the virtualenv () of both dependencies and it doesn't give me any issues. (I did clean up the  directory between trials to avoid polution)Am I doing something wrong or am I facing some bug? 
So this runs fine for me. If I start from scratch on MacOS or UbuntuNow looks like your might be running  from an already sourced venv or https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/I would start from vanilla shell. Or check that the PATH variable on your shell doesn't make it point to a 'different' python binary on your system
