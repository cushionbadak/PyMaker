Natural Text
Say I have an interface class  intended to be inherited. I need to define a static method in  that would read and print a text file next to a successor's definition. My attempt was as follows.Example structure:Base.py:A.py (same for B.py):When I import  class and call , this code attempts to read  and not , as  seems to be calculated against  and not .Is there a way to read  and  in the static method without additional code in  and ?
From the docs:__file__ is the pathname of the file from which the module was loaded, if it was loaded from a file. The __file__ attribute may be missing for certain types of modules, such as C modules that are statically linked into the interpreter; for extension modules loaded dynamically from a shared library, it is the pathname of the shared library file.Thus having  point to Base.py makes sense as this is where the module  initially is loaded from.An appropriate choice here could be getfile from the inspect package:inspect.getfile(object): Return the name of the (text or binary) file in which an object was defined.
