i am a beginner of python and programming in general. I am trying to write a small program for some calculations. I have a material: concrete and several types of it. I created a base Concrete and several subclasses. Base class Concrete has some attributes that are equal for all subclasses. User should select a concrete class. So i have two questions:1. How do i access the value that is equal for all subclasses(alphabt in this case). 2. how do i keep the chosen concrete? I am trying to use QCombobox but can't figure out how to use it properly for assigning. in materials i have concrete classes declared. Can anyone tell/suggest/help what i am doing wrong or show an example of same usage. Thank you in advance. 
I don't use Qt, so I can't help you with that side of things, but I can offer some suggestions to improve your class. You don't need subclasses for the different types of concrete, just create instances of your Concrete class. To do that, you need to give the class an  method.The  attribute can be defined as a class attribute, which is shared by all instances of the class.It's a Good Idea to give a class a  and/or  method so it provides useful information when you convert it to a string, either explicitly or when using .outputNote that we can access the  attribute from a  instance or from the  class itself.BTW, the format string  can be simplified to  in Python 2.7 and later.You could use the  helper function to create some pre-defined concrete instances in your  module, or you could just use it in your  method to create them "on the fly".
