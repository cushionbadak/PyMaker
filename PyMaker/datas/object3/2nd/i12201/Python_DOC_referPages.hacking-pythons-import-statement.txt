I'm building a Python module for a fairly specific purpose. What I'd like to do with this is get more functionality behind ing things from it. I'd like to have a setup by which saying  would run a function and pass the string . This function would return the object that should be imported. For example, maybe I want to make a cloud-based import system. I'd like to store community scripts in the cloud, and then download them when a user tries to import them. Maybe I use the code . This would check a cache to decide whether  had been downloaded. If so, it would return that module. If not, it would download the module before importing it. How can I accomplish something like this in Python, by which a dynamic range of submodules could be seamlessly ed from the cloud? 
Full featured support for what you ask probably requires a bunch of complicated code using  and hooking into various parts of the import machinery. However, a more limited solution can be implemented with just a single custom class that pretends to be a module.When you import a module, Python first checks in the  dictionary to see if the module is a key. If so, it returns the value associated with the key. It does this regardless of what the value is, so you can put any kind of object in  and Python will treat it like a module. A module's code can even replace its own entry in , and the replacement will be used even the first time it is ed!So, to implement your fancy module that downloads other modules on demand, replace the module itself with an instance of a custom class, and write that class a  or  method that does the work you want.Here's a trivial example module that returns a string for any attribute you look for in it. The string will always be the same as the requested attribute name. In your code, you'd want to do your fancy web-cache lookups and downloading, and then return the fetched module object instead of just returning a string.On my system I've saved that as . Now if I do , I get  with the value  in my local namespace.Note that this only works for one level deep imports. If you do  it will not work because there's no  entry in .
