Natural Text
I am attempting to pull out multiple (50-100) sequences from a large .txt file seperated by new lines ('\n'). The sequence is a few lines long but not always the same length so i can't just print lines x-y. The sequences end with " and the next line always starts with the same word so maybe that could be used as a keyword. I am writing using python 3.3This is what I have so far:This pulls out the starting line (which is 5 lines below the keyword line always) however it only pulls out this line.How do I print the whole sequence?Thankyou for your help.EDIT 1:Current output =  ABCDCECECCECECE ...Desired output = ABCBDBEBSOSO ...Edit 2 Text file looks like this:The sequence between the " and " is what I needTL;DR -  How do I print from line + 5 to end when end = keyword
Not sure if I understand your sequence data but if you're searching for each 'keyword' then the next " char then the following should work:This simply compiles a list of all the positions of all the keywords and " characters and then matches the two and prints all the lines in between.Hope that helps.
I agree with @Michal Frystacky that regex is the way forward.  However as I now understand the problem, we need two searches one for the 'keyword' then again 5 lines on, to find the 'sequence'This should work but may need the regex to be tweaked:
1This can be done rather simply with regexEventually to use this sample code we would  from the dataset. Its important to note that we catch only things between  and  another , if there is no " mark at the end, we will miss this data, but accounting for that isn't too difficult.
