I think I understand class inheritance in python, basically you can inherit the attributes of the parent class on the child class for re-usability and also to "add" to it to make even more complex classes. Here is my question: I have a  class below that has  as parameters, after that I created a new child class called  that inherits from the parent  class...and now when I call  with ", I get the following error:TypeError: init() takes exactly 2 arguments (5 given)I know got to fix it. I need to add ,  and  to the  class. But why do i have to do that? It seems this defeats the purpose of inheritance if I need to re-define again on the child class. 
I need to add ,  and  to the  class.You don't. Python allows you to call methods of parent classes you've replaced. You just have to call the constructor of the parent class explicitly.The first argument of  is the battery type. Store the rest of positional arguments in a list () and unpack them to the parent constructor:
When you define the  method, you are overriding the method of the parent class.  Such overriding is why the super() function was created.
You need to pass  model, color, mpg in your ElectricCar class. Then you can call super to initialize the base class.
