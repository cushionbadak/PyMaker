I need to write a function, , which takes a string, , and another string, , and two integers,  and .The function should return a new string in which all occurrences of  in , ranging from index  up to, but not including, the index  are replaced with .Built-in functions or modules that perform the same or similar information may not be used in this task. Example: It's from an old exam and I can't figure it out. I guess that it should use a for loop?
Even though you did not post any code, it still seems to me as though you actually did attempt to do this task yourself but you were just really stuck. I decided to help you out here because I see that you're a new member and probably don't know all the rules of the site yet, but in the future, know that people will probably only answer your questions if you include the code you tried:Or the equivalent (but disgustingly un-readable) one-liner:I had to change the name of the first parameter from  to  because  is the name of a built-in function in Python, and it is generally considered poor practice to mask them. Additionally, your example did not really make sense given your algorithm description. I believe the main source of contradiction is that you didn't realize that Python is a zero-indexed language, meaning that the first character of the string has an index of zero, not one. So to get your desired output for the example, I instead called . I  this helps!
