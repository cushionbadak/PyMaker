I have a Python code like this,The output of variable "new_word" should be "ythonpay", but now the new_word contains "pythonpay". Could anyone let me know what is the mistake i am doing here.
You are not assigning the result of the slice  to anything. You could just do the slice on your previous line, e.g.:What version of python are you using, Python3 introduces a new unpacking syntax that makes this quite easy:No need to slice because the  assignment already separated the string.
You say  but you aren't doing anything with it.  Change that to .  Slicing creates a copy of the list with whatever items you decide.  In your case it creates a list of all items except the first.  It does not change the original list, however, so you need to assign  to it.
The problem is with the indexing and what you are printing.In your code  returns the original word itself as the first part, you need it to include all of the string except the first letter. That you can achieve by using  i.e all characters after the first (or 0th) index of the string. The above will output "ythonpay" for python.
