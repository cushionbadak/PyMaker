I've stumbled upon a strange behaviour with Python's  module:I wonder how the command is run with the  environment variable unset? Is there any default ?
Yes, there is a default PATH, at least in Linux.Consider this quote from the Linux execl() man page:If [the PATH variable] isn't defined, the path list defaults to the current directory followed by the list of directories returned by confstr(_CS_PATH). (This confstr(3) call typically returns the value "/bin:/usr/bin".)
There is :The default search path used by  and  if the  environment doesnâ€™t have a  key. Also available via .It is hardcoded to  in  ( on POSIX systems) and  in  ( on Windows).
