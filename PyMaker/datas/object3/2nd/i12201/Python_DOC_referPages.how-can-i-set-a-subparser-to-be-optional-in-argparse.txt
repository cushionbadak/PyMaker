Output: error: too few arguments.As per this link: https://bugs.python.org/issue9253 it states that subparsers cant be optional. Can this behaviour be changed?I would like my subcommands to be optional. How can I achieve this through argparse in python 2.6?
There's not much that can be added to that bug/issue https://bugs.python.org/issue9253. is a special kind of positional argument.  Normally the only way to make a positional optional is with the  parameter. As detailed in the bug issue, in recent versions, subparsers have inadvertently been made optional.  That's a result of a change in how the parser checks for required arguments.I won't say it is impossible to retrofit this behavior into the 2.6 version, but it's not something you can do with just a parameter value or two.  I think it would require a good understanding of this bug/issue. It either requires a code change to , or maybe a custom  Action class.In earlier versions, a missing subparser string will be caught by:where  is a list of positional Actions.  When a positional is processed it is removed from this list.  Actions with  and '*' get processed even if there's no string (since the accept empty lists).  So anything left in  was not seen.Newer versions dropped this test, substituting instead a test on the  attribute (which was already being used to test ).
