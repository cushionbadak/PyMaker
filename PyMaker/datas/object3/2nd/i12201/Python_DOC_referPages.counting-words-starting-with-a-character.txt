Write a function that accepts a string and a character as input and  returns the count of all the words in the string which start with the  given character. Assume that capitalization does not matter here. You  can assume that the input string is a sentence i.e. words are  separated by spaces and consists of alphabetic characters.This is my code:The only part missing here is that how to check if the first word of the sentence is stating with the user given character. consider this output:Your answer is NOT CORRECT Your code was tested with different inputs. > For example when your function is called as shown below:count_input_character  ('the brahman the master of the universe', 't')    ####### Your function returns ############# 2 The returned variable type is: type 'int'    ### Correct return value should be ######## 3 The returned variable type is: type 'int'
You function misses the first  because in this linewhen  is , then  is  which Python will resolve as the last character of the string!To fix this, you could change your condition toOr use  with a list comprehension. Or a regular expression like , with  meaning "ignore case",  is word boundary and  a placeholder for the character..
Instead of looking for spaces, you could split  on whitespace, this would produce a list of words that you could then test against . (Pseudocode below)
Although it doesn't fix your specific bug, for educational purposes, please note you could rewrite your function like this using list comprehension:or even more efficiently(thanks to tobias_k)
