How can I write a mixin, which raises an Exception if the class which is using this specific mixin is not created properly. If I do these checks and balances in the __init__ or __new__ methods of the mixin, Exception is raised when this  erroneous class tries to create an instance. Which is late, ideally the exception needs to be thrown when the compiler detects a wrong class. (Assuming, how to detect if a class is acceptable or not is a trivial matter)To Illustrate the question I am right now performing the check in the init method of mixin. Which raises an exception if rule returns False. Now this needs to be done at the time AClass is read by interpreter and not when I try to create an instance of AClass.Is it possible even in dynamically typed languages like Python 3.5?
This sounds as if you want to create a custom metaclass that performs the check upon creation of the class object. See the documentation for metaclasses.
