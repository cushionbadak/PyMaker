I have two scripts a.py and b.py.a.py runs with python3 and b.py runs with python2.7. Now I want to import these two scripts in a new script called c.py and run c.py. How exactly should I accomplish this. How should i tell bash which versions to use for which script. My default linux python version is 2.7. Thnaks for your help.
If you want to import  and  into , you must choose one Python version for . This will probably have to be Python 3. So you have to port  to Python 3.This has nothing to do with the shell.
You cannot practically do that i.e by calling both the files in another file as the other two files a.py and b.py are two different versions of Python.Syntax in both 2.7.x and 3.4.x are quite different this is the reason.
you can modify  and/or  so it work in python 2 or 3 regardless by adding a  import, of course you can't use python 3 exclusive stuff like function annotation or like thisor just import the features that are different between version that you need like  or With this you can open a.py in python 2 without problem.Also you must have installed all the same packages in both version in case that you import something elseyou can also add this to if you use any of those so they work the same in both python 3 and 2
If you want to run them sequentially: If you want to run them simultaneously:(Assuming that  is a python 2.7 script and  a python 3.4 one)And if you want a new script you could try something like:
