I have the below code which is working fine but when my string is "", I am getting  but I want  as one integer. How do I achieve that?
Using , you can join multiple strings into one string:BTW, instead of using regular expression, you can use  with :UPDATEAs Donkey Kong commented, you can also use  to remove non-digit characters:But, with this you can't check whether there was digit or not.
I don't understand what you intended to do with manually assigning values to  after taking user input to it.
