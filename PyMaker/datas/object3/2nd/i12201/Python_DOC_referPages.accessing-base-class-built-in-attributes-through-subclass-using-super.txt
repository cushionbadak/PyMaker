I'm playing around with super() in order to get a grasp of how it can be used. So I'm trying to use it to access the  and  attributes of a base class through it's subclass. This is what I have as an example:After running the code I receive this output:This is the base classand then an error which essentially says:AttributeError: 'super' object has no attribute ''How come the first statement successfully prints the doc string, while the second one fails to print the class name? The other thing is the fact that the error message uses super rather than the base class' name to refer to the object in question. I would have assumed that  would internally be replaced by the base class so essentially it would be something vaguely resembling . However, that's obviously not the case since the error message specifically mentioned a super object.
What version of Python are you using? Neither of those methods work running your code in 2.7. The problem is that you're using  with old-style classes:
