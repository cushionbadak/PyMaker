You'll have to extract the triples you need for comparison.
If you want sorted output (particularly if you already have sorted input)  and  combine nicely for this. If the inputs aren't already sorted, you'll need to do so. Either concatenate and sort all at once:or if they're already sorted, or you want to sort independently, you use  and avoid making shallow copies of the inputs:Whichever approach you chose, you then follow it up with a simple comprehension over  to keep only one copy of each unique key by just getting the first entry in each unique group:
