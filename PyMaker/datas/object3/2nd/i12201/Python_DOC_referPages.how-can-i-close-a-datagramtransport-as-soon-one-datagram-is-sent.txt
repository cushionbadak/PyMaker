I'm trying to  close the transport right after sending the UDP packet and I'm getting an The full stack trace that I get is while running the snippet above in CPython 3.5.1 is:I believe the exception is only generated if the UDP packet is actively refused, with an ICMP Destination Unreachable (which I'm not interested in).So the question is what is the right way of doing this. I'm not interested in this connection anymore after sending so I want to get rid of the transport as soon as possible. The documentation for  just says that the methods doesn't block. But how do I know when the sending is completed? (And by complete I mean when is handed over to the OS, not delivered to the remote). Is there any other  coroutine to send an UDP packet asynchronously and simple  (maybe even skipping the whole ) ? 
Is there any other asyncio coroutine to send an UDP packet asynchronously and simple ?I would, base on  source, wrap it in  to be yieldable/awaitable. It will raise exception on error and return  on success. The example PoC code:Than simple example would look like:
