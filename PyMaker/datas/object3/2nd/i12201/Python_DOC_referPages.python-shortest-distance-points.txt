Write a function called  that takes in two points (so two lists of two elements each), and computes the distance between them. Make sure this works on the example below before proceeding to the next step.  Use  in a nested loop inside  to compare each element of the list of points with every element in the list after it. So, basically, find the shortest distance between points in a list.Here's what I have so far:That finds the distance alright between two points. I just need some help figuring out how to start writing  to compare all points and keep track of the shortest distance. UPDATE: The error was resolved and I'm good to go now. Thank you to everyone for their assistance!
This is a fully functioning example based on a list of points.
This should do the job
I think code below would move you into right direction:Let me know if you don't understand some parts of code and i will give more explanations to it.Good luck! 
First, you might want to use tuples rather than lists. Either way will work, but given the values "x" and "y" are different, albeit both "numbers" (doubles,int...), a tuple is typically used.You can pass in the points like:And they can be accessed like you would access a list:As for writing , you'll want to take in a list of the tuples from above: e.g. [(0,1),(2,4),(3,2),(1,3)]So something like this for the def:Then for each point you can compare it to each point after it using the following, which stores it in a dictionary.That should get you started. It assumes that the points are not duplicated.
