As a trivial demonstration of what I mean, 's  is always a  string.But:Moreover, if I follow Convert bytes to a Python string, It's trying to convert and compare byte strings, but I can't figure out how to eitherturn them into proper bytesmake the strings look the sameIn this case, I happen to have the flexibility to read the  of the singular char and compare  with . What else can solve this?
Your second byte string, , is indeed not the same string as . The former is the character , which is ASCII codepoint 0x30. You'll notice that: represents the NUL character.See the Binary Sequence Types and String and Bytes literals specs, which describes the  syntax:Only ASCII characters are permitted in bytes literals (regardless of the declared source code encoding). Any binary values over 127 must be entered into bytes literals using the appropriate escape sequence.
