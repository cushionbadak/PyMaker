I would like to copy a function's signature to define a new function that extends it. Python 3.4, if the version matters to the solution.In :In :I would like to define  so that if the user has a different-but-compatible version of  installed, the  function will include any changes to the arguments in .Ex:
To answer your question in parts, to get the signature you can use  or  from the inspect moduleThis returnsFullArgSpec(args=['pork', 'salt', 'taste'], varargs=None, varkw=None, defaults=(False,), kwonlyargs=[], kwonlydefaults=None, annotations={})With this, you can build up the string of argument calls. First building up the postional args and then the keyword arguments. Crudely put, something like thisNote, that this can fail if any of the positional arguments are missing. If needed you should add a check to cleanlly exit at this point.To second part, where you want to build the function up, I was hoping to find something like apply, but it seems to be deprecated. The reason for building the  was to execute this using the exec to execute a call to  with the built argument string matching a normal function callThe string passed to exec isspam(pork=2,salt=3)
