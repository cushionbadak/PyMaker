Natural Text
I am trying to write a program that asks the user to type in a sentence, than it asks them to repeat it however times they desire, but I am having trouble. This is what I have so far, but I don't know what to do next or add to it. I just need help trying to repeat the sentence that outputs according to the amount that's inputted.

Do this:Yours doesn't work for two reasons:  returns a string, not an integer; and range() requires at least one argument.
