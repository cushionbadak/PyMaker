You can check if anything is part of a an iterable with "in", it works for :Tuples. I.E : Lists. I.E : Strings. I.E : Dict. I.E : Can I do the reverse of this by checking if multiple substrings are in a single string?  As in, something along these lines:Ideally, I would like it to return True since one of the substrings are in in "Welcome".Is there a built in function for something such as this?-Thanks
You should use  with a generator expression: will short circuit, so if the first item in the iterable is in the string, the rest won't need to be checked.
