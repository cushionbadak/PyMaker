I'm new to python mocking.I know we can use mock.patch to mock f1 for f2 testing. Like this:But I found if I directly mock f1 in test case like below, it doesn't work. I have no idea why can't just directly mock "f1" at here?
Even  and  are in the same package they have a different duties: By  you are creating a mock object  (local variable) By  you are patching  reference in  module (the one you are running) default behavior is to use mocks to replace the original reference, but you can use it also for installing stubs or fakes: the main duty is to control the context where you replace the reference.Just a tip: take a look to where to patch ... it can enlightening you.
Not sure why you think that would work. All you're doing is defining a new local variable called  which happens to be an instance of Mock; just as if you'd defined  it doesn't affect the module-level name at all.
