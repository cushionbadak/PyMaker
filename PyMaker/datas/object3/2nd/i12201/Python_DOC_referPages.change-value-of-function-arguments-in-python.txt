I'm new to Python and OOP in general (so far I've been programming mostly in C) and I have a question about functions changing value of multiple variables. I'm doing lexical and syntactic analysis of a string and created a function for getting characters one by one.Code:I don't mind string being destroyed. The problem is that I need to change value of both char and string which in C would be done by dereferencing &. Is there some way I can achieve this in Python? Also: if the solution involves objects and classes I would be thankful if you could dumb it down a little since I have very little experience with them.Thanks in advance!
You would not, and can not, modify the values of the parameters; strings are immutable in Python. Instead, simply return the new values and reassign them in the caller.Note that generally it is a bad idea to try to program in one language as if it were another. Python is not C, and you shouldn't attempt to apply C concepts like "dereferencing" which simply have no meaning in a language without pointers.
In python you can just iterate a string char by char. But you can't modify a string in place, you have to create a new string (though you can use the same name for it).E.g.will get you:And for your example with 'hello' in comments, you could use generator:Will print:or you can use it in a loop:will give you:
