What was doneI have a form that receives a code that is given to the user so he can verify his email address. To check if the form is valid I created a custom field validator, see ProblemIt looks like if  would always fail in the -block. Is this normal behavior or did I something wrong?forms.pyEdit with ugly solutionI ended up with the code below.
