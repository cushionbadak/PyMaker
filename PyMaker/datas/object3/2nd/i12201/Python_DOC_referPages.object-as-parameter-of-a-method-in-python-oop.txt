I'm trying to build a simple RPG game to learn more about classes in Python, but I'm struggling with the fight method. The idea is that after both player and monster are created, the method  would have the parameter , that is the monster the player is fighting.Here is what I did in the  (it's inside 's class) method:Here is the call I'm doing right now (in the main file):but, whenever I run it, I get the following error:Both classes( and ) inherit from the  class, so what's the deal with this error? Do I need an  from enemy to solve this?EDIT1 : Above the complete  class:The  class:And my actual  class:My  is as follows
In  you are using  which instantiates a new  object and calls  on this new instance. Use  to call the method on the instance of the Fighter.Never use  to access methods of the super class. You are inheriting from that class so all methods from the super class are available in the scope of the subclass. 's purpose is to call the constructor of the super class (__init__()).Edit: Methods from the superclass can in fact be accessed by using . The problem here is the wrong number of parameters to the fight() method. (See comments below)
