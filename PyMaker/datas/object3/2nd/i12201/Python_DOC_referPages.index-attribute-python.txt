When I was reading this answer https://stackoverflow.com/a/9841401/5175044 to a question on removing duplicates from a string, I couldn't understand what the  attribute meant in I did this example run:which leads me to think that it helps in keeping the order of the characters.
As mentioned by others Pythons  function and  the  method of a list provides the  parameter to specify a function to be called on each list element prior to making comparisons.The key thing is that this  parameter is a function object that takes when it is called only one argument and returns exactly one value which is used for the sorting.A anonymous "lambda" function is often used for this purpose, since its definition does not include a  statement and therefor always contains an one expression which is returned.For instance creates an (anonymous) function objectwhich takes one argument and returns a value and would therefore be a valid  for sorting.If you want to call the  function  object now you would simply do this:To solve your problem you could create a lambda function as  which takes an element and returns its index in the  string to keep the order of the characters:On the other hand -- since  is a function object itself which takes one argument and returns one value -- you could pass this object instead to the  function and by-pass the lambda definition:Hope this helps :)
 is a method used for most ordered sequences to find the first occurrence of some element in that sequence.  For example  would return  because the first occurrence of  is at position .  It is used for strings, tuples, lists, etc.  The documentation on sequences has more about it.
