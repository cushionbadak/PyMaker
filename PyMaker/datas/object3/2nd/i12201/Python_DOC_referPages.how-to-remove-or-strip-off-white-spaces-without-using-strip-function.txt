Write a function that accepts an input string consisting of alphabetic  characters and removes all the leading whitespace of the string and  returns it without using .strip(). For example if:input_string = "    Hello  "then your function should return a string such as:output_string = "Hello  "The below is my program for removing white spaces without using strip:I chose the remove function as it would be easy to get rid off the white spaces before the string 'Hello'. Also the program tells to just eliminate the white spaces before the actual string. By my logic I suppose it not only eliminates the leading but trailing white spaces too. Any help would be appreciated.
You can loop over the characters of the string and stop when you reach a non-space one. Here is one solution :Edit :@PM 2Ring mentionned a good point. If you want to handle all types of types of whitespaces (e.g  \t,\n,\r), you need to use isspace(), so a correct solution could be :
Here's another way to strip the leading whitespace, that actually strips all leading whitespace, not just the  space char. There's no need to bother tracking the index of the characters in the string, we just need a flag to let us know when to stop checking for whitespace.outputThere are various other ways to do this. Of course, in a real program you'd simply use the string  method, but here are a couple of cute ways to do it using an iterator:and

Just to be thorough and without using other modules, we can also specify which whitespace to remove (leading, trailing, both or all), including tab and new line characters. The code I used (which is, for obvious reasons, less compact than other answers) is as follows and makes use of slicing:
you can use itertools.dropwhile to remove all particualar characters from the start of you string like thisto make it more flexible, I add an additional argument called remove, they represent the characters to remove from the string, with a default value of , then with dropwhile it will ignore all characters that are in remove, to check this I use a lambda function (that is a practical form of write short anonymous functions) here a few tests    the previous function is equivalent to
