Natural Text
I am new to python. I am just opening a file and writing some text into it. Later reading the content find all the characters in it by using regular expression.  but I am getting the error as 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'read'. if I use readlines also, I am getting the error.
The  method returns  in Python 2 (in Python 3 it returns the number of bytes written, for a binary file).If you want to both write and read with the same file you'll need to open that file in  mode, and seek back to put the file position back to the start:Note that looping over the file object can be done directly, producing individual lines.I made two other changes: I renamed your variable to ; you have a file object, not just the name of the file here. And I used the file object as a context manager, so that it is closed automatically even if any errors occur in the block.
 is the function that returns  type like every function in Python if it's not specified otherwise with a  statement. So the value of the variable  is  and You are trying to read from that. Try  instead.
