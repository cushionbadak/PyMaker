I'm writing a utility that takes a .gz archive and checks if it's contents already exist in a specified folder. If they don't, it will extract the archive there.The way I planned on doing this is reading the filenames of the files in the .gz archive one by one and checking if such a file already exists in my directory. But from what I understand this isn't possible with gzip.Ideally, I'm looking for something like this:Is this possible?
While it is true that the .gz file is simply a compressed file, the original file name can be truncated or indeed the compressed .gz file can be renamed. can be told to provide the original file name using the  flag and if used with the  (minus lowercase L) it will tell you the original file name without uncompressing the file.For example:You can hack your way through this in python as well.result:    I do not believe that the python gzip package allows you to access the original file name.Someone else may know different!
A  file is not an archive, it simply is compressed. If you have a  file, you can use .
