Thanks Everyone, im close.  Im using Python within a survey software tool called Decipher, so it may appear a little different.  My issue now is I need to "pipe" in the age based on a respondents answer, that would be your_date_string.  But when I put that in my dob variable I get an error from the system: ValueError: time data 'your_date_string' does not match format '%Y,%d,%m', but printing the your_date_string returns the exact value needed.  Not sure how to fix this.
You first need to convert your string to a date object:And then use that date object to compute the number of years. A quick and easy way to do that is to rely on  third-party library that you can install using . Here is an example:In this example, .
check the month and day, if today less than date of birth than minus one from year difference
