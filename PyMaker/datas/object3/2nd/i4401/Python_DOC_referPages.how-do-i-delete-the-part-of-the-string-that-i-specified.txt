how should I delete everything on the string that starts with the letter I specify?Let's say:I want to delete everything that starts with '/'  so what's left would be 'PHP'and how do I do the reverse? Starts so that USD would be the only one left?I only found answers on deleting the middle or deleting string that starts with something, but no a PART of the string. What is the better approach on this? is it something with  replace documentation that I have misread?
Use  and replace the pattern  with empty string:If you wanted the reverse, then use the pattern .
