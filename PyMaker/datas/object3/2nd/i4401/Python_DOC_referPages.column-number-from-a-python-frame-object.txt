I know how to get the line number from a frame object in Python. For exampleIf you save this to a file  and run , it will print But is it possible to get the column number, that is, something like(or some offsets thereof)? The docs seem to imply it isn't saved, but maybe it can be reconstructed from the code object somehow? If it requires using  that's acceptable, but I'd like to have something that's always correct, not heuristics. My goal here is to make a debugger that would let you step into specific parts of a single line expression. 
Python doesn't save the column number information you want, whether in the frame object or the code object. You'd have to retrieve the source code, examine the last executed bytecode instruction, and figure out what column of the source code to match that instruction to. That's probably going to be a lot of work.
