I am trying to write a class that search for all files on my computer with a specific extension. To make the process faster I use threading. It searchs all hard disks at the same time.I know it finds all the paths when I print them But the values won't be appended in the  and I do not know why.Here is the code:
As mentioned in @Trap's answer, you need to return the results from the  method instead of trying to append them to the  in . This is because each invocation of  runs in its own address space, so there's effectively a different  list object in each one.Here's something with those changes made that seems to work on my Windows machine. Note that I based it on the sample code shown in the ProcessPoolExecutor Example section of the documentation which uses the  method instead of calling  repeatedly.
I've never used the ProcessPoolExecutor class, but I think your error is due to the fact that self.allfiles is not shared across the processes created.Your SearchHarddisk method should return a value, and after the process are done, you have to gather every results and append them to self.allfiles.This is what I would have done, but since I'm not running Windows, I can't test so I'm not sure it will work.
