The following works in my current script:I am trying to move this to its own function using the following:When calling the function using:I receive an error:I've tried a few other ways to convert the inputted values, but I am stumped on making it work.
You can't just take a fragment of Python code like  and append it to an object and expect it to work as if you'd used the code.On the very rare occasions where you really do need to do that, you can build a string out of the entire expression and call â€”but this isn't one of those very rare occasions.What you're actually trying to do is apply a "key path" to a nested dict. The best way to do that is something like this:validateChildren(json_data, ('contents', 'rootFeature', 'childFeatures'))If you're trying to do anything more complicated, like getting a list of all , or accepting a path as a string from the user rather than building it up out of string variables you already have separately, you may want to look at something like  (or, if you're dealing with Cocoa stuff rather than internet stuff, maybe a KVC library), but for simple cases like yours, just iterating or recursing over the keys is all you need.
