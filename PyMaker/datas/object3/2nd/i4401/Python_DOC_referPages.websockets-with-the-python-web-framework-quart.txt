I need help with the python web frame work, Quart, more specifically the websockets.  I would like to be able to register a client when it connects (add it to a python list), and unregister them (remove it from the python list) when it disconnects.  The closest thing I could find on the web is this code: sourceBut this does not work with quart websockets.Help would be appreciated.
This decorator when used to wrap a websocket handler, will add and remove websockets from the  set. The  method of the websocket is required to get the websocket in the current context, and the try-finally is required to ensure the websocket is removed regardless of any errors that are raised. Note the  must wrap (be before) the  usage.Edit:I am the Quart author.
