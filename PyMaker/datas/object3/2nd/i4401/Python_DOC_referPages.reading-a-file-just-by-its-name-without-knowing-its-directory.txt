Natural Text
I am currently working on a project in which I am trying to read some files by only knowing their name, and not the directory in which they belong. The script file might be in the same or in a different folder than the text files (text file directories are unknown).
Warning: The following code will run for days, but you asked for it.... where  is your file name, and  is whether you want to read it() or write(), append, etc.The reasoning behind using  for this is that  on giant file systems are not efficient. The overhead of creating a process is alleviated by the  backend from , and it will end up costing much less as the number of files scale.
If you're asking how to search for a file with a given name, you can use  and check the names match what you're looking for.  Naturally, there may be multiple files with the name you're looking for.
This is impossible in one line, but you can use the os module to search for a file in all directories, for example using os.walk().https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/os_walk.htm
