Natural Text
I am trying to extract data from mailchimp export api, which returns responses based on the following specifications:Parameter -     text    Description:a plain text dump of JSON objects. The first row is a header row. Each additional row returned is an individual JSON object. Rows are delimited using a newline (\n) marker, so implementations can read in a single line at a time, handle it, and move on.To get the data I am using:If I use .json() it errors out with a JSON decode error. The output of the above is something along the lines of:{data..}{data...}I am unsure whether each dict is on a separate row, however I am under the impression it's actually just one continuous string as many of my attempts to decode it ended up with an error 'str' object cannot be...etc. . I don't see the '\n' separators anywhere when I am using the .text method. What's the best way of going about and make each dict a separate item in a list or a row in a dataframe (which I can unpack later).Thanks
You can get all the data from the  using a simple approach. Please note that I am using , only available in Python 3.6+.
Provided that the text response isn't insanely badly formed json, you can use the  library. In particular, the loads() function. loads JSON into a python dict from a string. EDIT:The Mailchimp API states that each JSON object is separated by a newline character. We can create a list of dicts with the following code:
