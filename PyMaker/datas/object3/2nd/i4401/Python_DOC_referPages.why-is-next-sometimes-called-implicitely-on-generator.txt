I am just learning generators in Python. It seems that if you assign generator to a tuple then next() is called silently behind the scenes - as if unpacking was forcing that call. But if you assign to tuple with single value then you get generator object itself. Do I get it right?Trivial code follows:Output is:
The first two lines use tuple packing/unpacking: they yield all values from the generator and then set them to x and foo. This is because  is syntax for a tuple (a pair of items).However,  is syntax for a variable. You would get what you expected if you write , which is how tuples of size 1 are created.
The syntax is not a tuple of one item.  You want:or Then you'll find the generator is called, just as in your other examples, due to "unpacking".  Note that in the expression  it is not the  that make it a tuple, it is the comma.  The parentheses simply bound the expression .
