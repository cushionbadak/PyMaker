In the current project that i'm working on, i need to regroup (group) a queryset by category and put contents with same category in a list all provided together.I have the following model structure:I would like the output serialized result to be like:I know i can always iterate over the queryset and group them manually, i'm wondering if there is a native efficient way to do this.Thanks
I don't believe this is possible using the ORM itself, although as Guybrush mentions,  can be used to achieve this - and in a reasonably elegant way.
If your goal is to regroup them in a template, have a look at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/templates/builtins/#regroupNote that you'll have to sort your objects by category first, as  relies on that order to produce correct output.If your goal is to regroup them in the code (as opposed to templates), you can rely on  (see https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.groupby). Again, you'll need to join and sort your data first.
