I am trying to make a script that reads in a group of CSV files that I stored in my data directory called 'database', stored on my desktop. In those CSV files are weather data, the last list index 16 of the CSV is perciptitation which I am trying to get and calculate the total monthly precipitation for each Station. Each station contains 12 months of weather data, and in the CSV the last index is precipitation. At the end I want to output a single CSV file that contains 48 rows (12 months x 4 stations) including station ID, month number, and total precipitation for that month at that station.Here is what I have so far:Here is what my folder looks like:And here is what the CSV file looks like, trying to get the last index:So I am trying to create a function that calculates the total precipitation given a month worth of data. As it accepts a months worth of weather data, I want to have it return a single float value containing the total amount of precipitation that month. I know i'll need to loop through all the elements int he list (each day of the month), and then split each element by a comma, and then do an inside loop to add up the total for the month. Just not entirely sure how to go about it and what I am doing wrong so far.
This code should work properly for your totalPercip() function. Your mistakes were 1) you didn't increment the  variable and each loop assigned it to a different, new value, and 2)  would probably give you an  exception since .I would also suggest that you do not use  as a variable name since it overshadows a built in python function called by that name.Hope this helps!
