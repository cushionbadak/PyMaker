Natural Text
I would like to save bytes to a file and then read that file as a text. Can I do it with one ? What should I use, ,  or ?
You don't need to re-read the file if you already have its contents stored in :The encoding Python assumes when reading files as text without an explicit encoding is platform-dependent, so I'm just assuming UTF-8 will work.
Here is some information on what mode we should use :The default mode is 'r' (open for reading text, synonym of 'rt'). For  binary read-write access, the mode 'w+b' opens and truncates the file  to 0 bytes. 'r+b' opens the file without truncation.Read more here.https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open
If you want to do it with one "with": When you write it "wb" is good. when you read the file try it
