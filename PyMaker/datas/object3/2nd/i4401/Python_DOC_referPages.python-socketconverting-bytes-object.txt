I received data via TCP socket, it should be  as value. I tried also to convert it by  in  and ,...However it didn't work well.Actual value I got is Which kind of way should I use for converting it to integer?EDIT: on Server side(really typical)on Client side(it is came from PLC)I'll put command line.It works, if is only 1234.It doesn't work, in this case 12340001.it doesn't work and structure itself is strange.
