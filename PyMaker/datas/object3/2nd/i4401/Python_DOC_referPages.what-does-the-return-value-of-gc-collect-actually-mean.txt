When I do  in my Python script, it returns values like 86, 14, etc. I understand that this call performs garbage collection and I've already gone through the documentation here. But can someone explain through an example what do the numbers actually mean?
As you're being chided about for not reading yourself ;-) , it returns "the number of unreachable objects".  But the docs aren't really detailed enough to know exactly what that means.It's really the sum of two numbers:  the number of objects that were identified as garbage and actually freed, plus the number of objects that were identified as garbage but could not be freed.  For an example of the latter, objects directly involved in unreachable ("garbage") reference cycles containing at least one object with a  method could not be freed automatically before Python 3.4.Here's an example under Python 3.6.5:In general, there's scant use for this return value.
