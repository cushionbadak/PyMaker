I have my modules in the following example structure:Now if I am in panel.py how should I import converter.py? would it befrom myapp.converter import converter? (assuming sys.path is set)from converter import converter (assuming sys.path is setimport converter (assuming sys.path is set)Do these points depend on where the main python application is run from? i.e. if converter.py was the program to run or panel.py was the program to run?
You should prefer full paths over relative paths, so in my opinion the first one is the best way to do it, although you should consider adding an alias since converter appears twice.Furthermore you can look up the Python recommandation (PEP8)https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports
If  is not a module (ie. does not have  at its root), there is no way to import something from e.g.  inside e.g.  unless  (or a parent module) is added to the .If  is a module (has ), you can use relative imports: .Relative imports indicate explicitly that you want to use something that is "local", and is usually the way to go. See https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#intra-package-references for an example. Updated: Fixed terminology to make things easier ;)
