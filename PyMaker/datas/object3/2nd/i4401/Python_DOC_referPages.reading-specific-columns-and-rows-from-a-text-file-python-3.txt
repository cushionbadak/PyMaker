Natural Text
I am trying to figure out how to get my program to read just the first 5 columns of my text file line by line without reading the text above and between the columns and rows because that doesn't contain the data I need to find the day and year of the lowest recorded temperature.This is how an example of how my text file looks like: This is my code(below) that I have so far. I used print to check if I get just the data I need but when I run the program I am getting the text and the hyphens as well. Its not much but I am still working on figuring it out but I am not to figure out what to do next. Thanks to everyone who is willing to help me out in advance.I am trying to make changes and add on to my existing code below to find the expected output. The output I get from my code: Expected Output (example):This is the I made changes to my code. This is an example of how I get the output after making changes to my code. How do I get rid of the text from being read in my output and read just the numbers instead?Day: 88Year: 1910Lowest Temperature: 88        Day: MaxYear: YearLowest Temperature: Max        
For your test data, you can simply ignore lines without digits, and use :Output:
