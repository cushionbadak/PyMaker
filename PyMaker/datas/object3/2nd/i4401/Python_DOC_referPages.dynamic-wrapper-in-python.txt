I'm looking to create a dynamic wrapper class that exposes the API calls from a provided object using data in the object.Statically it looks like this:ProducesI'd like to figure out how to do the same thing but make dynamic. It should search the concrete objectfind the functions, and create functions of the same namethat call the same function in the concrete object.I imagine that the solution involves  orat least some use of  and , but I've not seenan example on how to put all this together.
