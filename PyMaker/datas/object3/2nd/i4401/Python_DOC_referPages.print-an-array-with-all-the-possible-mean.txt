Suppose I have a list 'a'. Now, I want to print a list with all the possible mean(only integers) from all the possible pairs of list 'a'.For example:Now, I want to print a list b such that;If (a,b) is taken as a pair then (b,a) wont count. But it would count if there are duplicates of a and b present.
