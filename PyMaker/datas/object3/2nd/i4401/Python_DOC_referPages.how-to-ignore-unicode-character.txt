Natural Text
I am trying to read a csv file which has some rows having Unicode character(â€) in it. Pandas is not able to handle those characters. When opening in MS excel, row looks like this ColumnsRowPandas is reading it as CodeIs there anyway around it?
Your problem is caused by using the wrong encoding definition. Without having access to the raw file it's impossible to know what's correct.I'd remove the  entirely first and Pandas should cope. If that doesn't work then  would be my next attempt.Check out the page at https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings for some details on the encodings supported by Pandas.
