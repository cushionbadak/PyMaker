Using Python 2.7Existing : Columns and same hostname multiple entries:  New : In 1st  there are multiple entries for the same host with a different  date and/or . For the new  I am trying add to the  when hostname does not already exist. But the new  seems to be an exact copy of the first . It is like it is not checking for only the hostname in the new list. I do not care about the  date or  for either entry.How does it validate the entry if I am only checking the name of the host?i.e.:So when it looks for the hostname in zlist is it also validating the other columns and sees it is different based on the whole row?Hopefully this is not clear as mud.My goal is to have a list with no duplicate hostname entries regardless of  or .
The problem is that zhostname is just a string so when you compare it to the Index objects using  the string zhostname will never match the Index's in zlist.I recommend using a dictionary using the name of the host as the keys.https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries
