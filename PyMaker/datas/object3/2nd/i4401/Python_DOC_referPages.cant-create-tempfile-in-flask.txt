I'm creating Line Bot using Flask and trying to save image with code belowBut mktemp() doesn't really create empty file on desktop as expected, so an error occured when trying to open img_tmp. And it does happen the same for NamedTemporaryFile() as well...So, Can anyone explain how "creating files" works with flask? because it can create files normally not using flask.Thanks in advance and sorry for a newbie question
Try using the tempfile module for this ( https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html )
