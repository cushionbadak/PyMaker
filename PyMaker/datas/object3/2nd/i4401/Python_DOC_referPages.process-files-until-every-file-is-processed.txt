I've got the following situation: I have a lot of html files in the directory "path". My pipeline works on these html files and produces an xml output of the file to the directory "out". Using python, I call my pipeline like this:Now my question is: How would you upgrade the code s.t. it checks whether the filename which the server is working on is already in "out" or not? If it is already in "out", the next file in "path" can be picked. If the filename is not in "out", the computer should continuing working on this file. Thanks for any help and advice!
I am not saying this is the only way, but you can do it.
