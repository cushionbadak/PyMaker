I'm trying to create a pandas dataframe with  from one dictionary and  from another, and the values for row[i]-column[j] defined by any operation done on the key-value pair of both dictionaries (i.e. value of  can be calculated from a function which accepts values: dict1[key] and dict2[key]).So far my code looks like this:Eg. And the resulting dataframe after doing operations on the two dictionaries should look like this: What would be the most efficient(and hopefully parallel) way to do this ?
Checking the documentation, it seems that it is more efficient to build a  object and use it multiple times instead of using  every time. However, it does not seem to provide parallelism on its own (which is strange, because the library on which it is based claims to implement SIMD parallelism, so I may be wrong), but you can use regular Python multiprocessing to parallelize things:
This piece of code will do the trick:
