I am running a python program from github and getting this error:Can anyone help me as to why?  I can provide source code if needed.The program seems to run ok for a while and then errors out, but this can happen sometimes after creating one account, other times it creates 30 before it happens.  Not sure what's going on, was hoping someone here would possibly be able to help.
The error is caused because the weblink you are passing in as the delimiter, is not found in your "link2" object. I think you might not understand the split method entirely. The first argument the split method takes is a delimiter value. This is the value it looks to split the string on. ExampleWhere  is the string object the split method is being called on, and  is the delimiter.Now I am not exactly sure what your goal is, but if you were actually trying to pull that entire weblink out of a string,  is not a very good way to go about it. Try something like a regular expression. Something like this:
