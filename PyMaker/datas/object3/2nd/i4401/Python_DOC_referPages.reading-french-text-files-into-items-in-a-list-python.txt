Natural Text
I want to read a bunch of text documents in french, and store the content of each text document as an item in a list, in order to calculate the td-idf score later on (by counting words and etc).This is how I started my code, the point of it is to read each document 's full text as a string seperately:When i execute this, he is able to print some of the text, but then I get the following error :I am obviously opening the file with an encoding of utf-8, I don't understand what i'm doing wrong.Also, I would appreciate any suggestions on how I could store the variable  that contains all the text in the document in an item of a list. The following solution didn't work:Thank you
It seems that the files you are trying to read are not encoded in UTF-8. Best is to try and find out the encoding used to save the files. If that is not possible, your best bet is to try a couple encodings and see which one works (see https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings).For your second question: documents.append(data) should work. Your mistake is that you don't initialize a Python list up front. So this is all you need:Final tip: you're opening files, but not closing them. The  operator can help you here.
