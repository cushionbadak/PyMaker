I want to censor words by using Python regex.My word is defined as Alphanumeric[a-zA-Z0-9] and separated by Non-Alphanumeric[^a-zA-Z0-9].And the words should be censored by inner characters are replaced by * and others remain the same.Ex:Result should beI have tried to use the regex to do it.I use re module in python3.1.I try to match the pattern.2.Capture the group in matched pattern without the censored word.3.Try to concat the groups with the word.For example:  I tried to censor the word 'test'.Since I don't how to replace it with *, I try to replace with 'SUB' to see my pattern is right or not first.Also, is it possible to use one line to do above thing, I don't know how to use the group in one-line pattern.But it doesn't work well.My ResultI see my pattern somewhat doesn't match some 'test' and I don't know why.https://regexr.com/3nk9lSo, my questions are1.What is wrong with my pattern?2.How to let the matched word be replaced with * in its inner?Thx
