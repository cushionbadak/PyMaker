You can use , in addition your methods must be declared as :
b is still a string. You need to evaluate it into an expression:Note you shouldn't be using  on any string that is a user input because it can lead to security vulnerabilities.
First, your methods should either be static or have  as first argument. Once that is fixed, you could use  instead to choose the method out of a list. This has the advantage of not depending on the methods' names.
