Natural Text
I've been doing this checkio tasks and I got stuck.I was given a list of some words and a string followed by a text. The task is I need to count the number of words from the list in the text and create a dictionary where the key is a word and value is amount. It must look like this:and the output:I did almost everything but I don't know how to add a word to this dictionary which is not in text (like 'near' : 3)That's what I got:I tried:But it doesn't work :(
first, word.split() already gives you a list. No need to convert it into a list again.Second, what you should be doing is iterating through check (you only care about words in check), instead of through a.Third, you could use dictionary comprehension to speed things up:going over the code, words.split() is the same as list(words.split())The code for results in a pythonic (and faster) way of doing the following:
Try this, it should be faster than iterating yourself. The Counter class has the added benefit of handling words not found in the text.

Your code is not very efficient, as you're looping through the whole text, word by word, but then using  which also loops through the whole text. You might want to increment a counter (which happens to be your dictionary) like this:. After looping through your text, you can loop through your list of popular words and adding them to the dic if they're not in: 
You should initialize the result dictionary from the given list of interesting words, and then increase the count each time you find a word:
