I need my python TLS client to offer only version TLS 1.2 (disable TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, SSLv3, SSLV2). I am using python 3.6.5 and the openssl library under Windows 10. According to the official documentation here, these two lines should prevent TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1:ssl.OP_NO_TLSv1Prevents a TLSv1 connection. This option is only applicable in conjunction with PROTOCOL_TLS. It prevents the peers from choosing  TLSv1 as the protocol version.New in version 3.2.ssl.OP_NO_TLSv1_1Prevents a TLSv1.1 connection. This option is only applicable in conjunction with PROTOCOL_TLS. It prevents the peers from choosing  TLSv1.1 as the protocol version. Available only with openssl version  1.0.1+.New in version 3.4.And the above doucumentation says they are only applicable with the newly introduced:However, in practice, I tried to disable TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 and test connecting to a TLS 1.0 (ONLY version supported in the test server) and my script still able to connect to it.Am I doing something wrong? how the above two lines syntax in using them in conjunction with ?This is the script I'm running:NOTE: for testing a live TLS 1.0 server, you can find any TLS 1.0 server by searching or use this link but I think they are using a different port than 443.NOTE: I did not add:   nor  because they are disabled by default when using  
The documentation for SSLContext clearly states:SSLContext.protocol  The protocol version chosen when constructing the context. This attribute is read-only.Thus, any attempts to set the protocol using this attribute will fail. Instead you need to modify the SSLContext.options:
