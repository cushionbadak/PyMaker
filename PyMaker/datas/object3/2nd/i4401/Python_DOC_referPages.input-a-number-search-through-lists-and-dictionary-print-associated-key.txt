I am having an issue pulling from a combined dictionary and list. I understand how to pull keys from each one individually but I need to combine them and pull the keys from both. The following is an Example of a dictionary listing years. Each year has a title and director associated with it.}I also have the code prompting for an input year between 2005 and 2016. If the year is not between those years it will print a N/A.Now here is where I am having an issue. Right after the else statment, I need to also print the title and director of the movies associated with the input year. Example if you input the year 2011 the output needs to be:Enter a year between 2005 and 2016:2011The Artist, Michel HazanaviciusThe Help, Tate TaylorI have the following code written.But it does not output the correct information. I have tried listing it multiply ways but it sill not pull the information correctly. I am still new to python and I did try google and bing with no luck on the information I seek. Can anyone point me in the right direction? Have I written the dictionary incorrectly? Or am I just not using the correct way to print the information.Thanks  
If you want to stay with your data structure, modify the listing code like so:However, this will not give you what you want since, as mentioned in the comments the duplicate year keys overwrite each other - test this with:1: Depending on whether you always access the movies year first, or by any other attribute, use a list instead of a dicts with the year attribute as part of the movie:The output code would read like so:2: To maintain your by year index, the datastructue would be a dict of lists, which looks like:and the output code becomes:A small note, I am using dict.get instead of slicing because if a movie entity is missing an attribute, or in second case if year has no movies this will return the safe provided default instead of crashing - this also reduces the amount of 'if thing in dict' code. If you are 100% sure the keys exist, you can slice, but be warned! see https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict for more info on this.cheers
As the keys are years which are integers we need to convert to string. So I converted using str() at the last line.
