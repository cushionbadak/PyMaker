I'm a bit new to running code from the terminal. I am running a test module called  from the terminal by running:And am getting a error:The folder  does exit:Please see below for the beginning of the module (where the problem is).If I run the code from the terminal do I need to change the way I reference imports from different folders?Thanks
python don't know where to look for the dao modeladd the follwoing lines before the import also you will need to have a init.py file (empty file) in each directory of the dao so python could recognise it as a module  
Please check whether pythonpath environment variable is properly set. You can refer this.How to add to the pythonpath in windows 7?
In addition to shahaf's answer, it is worthwhile to look at the official documentation on module resolution : https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#the-module-search-path
