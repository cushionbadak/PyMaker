I have a simple python class, that I want to be able to compare. So I implemented compare operators. I then realized that I've been doing that same thing for so many classes, and it feels a lot like code duplication.So I think a simple solution would be something like this:But it seems so basic, that I feel like I'm reinventing the wheel here. I'm wondering if there a more 'native' way to achieve that.
As described in the docs you can use  to save some boilerplate in writing all of the comparisonsTo avoid the hassle of providing all six functions, you can implement , , and only one of the ordering operators, and use the  decorator to fill in the rest. To be explicit, the six functions they are referring to are: , , , , , and .
So, you want some automation while creating rich comparison methods. You can have this behaviour by using  higher-order function. See the reference for more details.
