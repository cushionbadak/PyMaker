Natural Text
I'm trying to read a file (reading every line in this file, with letters, numbers and characters). The script needs to work generally and the files will be similar but with some changes.Now it reads when it finds a line looks like this: "**HWCOLOR COMP 1066 30". I need that the script read all lines until it finds " **HW ". The script below is working for first problem explained.How can the script be written to read the file until it finds "**HW" and stops there?I tried to replace '**HWCOLOR COMP 1066 30" with **HW" but it won't work, because all characters don't match.
I'd recommend using a regular expression instead of string match.https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.htmlIf you aren't familiar with regular expressions, go find a tutorial and once you know the basics play some Regex Golf.  Regular expressions are extremely powerful and useful, so I'd strongly recommend learning them.Alternatively, you could also do something likeor
