Natural Text
Consider the following example strings:I want to capture the groups that occur between the abc, e.g. I should get the following groups:I'm trying this regex, but somehow it does not capture the in-between text:What am I doing wrong?EDIT: I need to do it using regex, no string splitting, since I need to apply further rules on the captured groups.
 approach with specific regex pattern:The output: - non-captured group to match either  substring OR start of the string  - captured group to match any character sequence as few times as possible - lookahead positive assertion, ensures that the previous matched item is followed by either  sequence OR end of the string  
Use re.split:Note that you get an empty string, representing the match before the first 'abc'.
Try splitting the string by  and then remove the empty results by using  statement inside  comprehension as below:
