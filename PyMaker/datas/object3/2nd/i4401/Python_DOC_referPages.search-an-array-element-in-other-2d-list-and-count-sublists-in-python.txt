You can loop over  and update a  for each sublist, using  to remove duplicates:
You can use :Output:
You can loop and compare in both lists
You can try dict approach :output:
You can use a list comprehension with  to construct .This has the same effect as using nested for loops:
Here is a solution with .Performance noteThis may not matter, but the performance differential is interesting as it shows clearly the  overhead (4x slower).
