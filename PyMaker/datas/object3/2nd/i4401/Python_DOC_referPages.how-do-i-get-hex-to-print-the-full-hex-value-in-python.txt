Natural Text
Say I have 2 hex values that were taken in from keyboard input.E.g. val1 = 0x000000 and val2 = 0xFF0000and I do,I get the right output for val2 but val1 is just 0x0, how do I get it to print the whole value? By whole value, I mean, if the inputted value is 0x000000, I want to output the value as 0x000000 and not 0x0. 
You can pad the hex value to the specified number of digits by using the  method.Whenever the string is less than the specified width, it'll append the specified filler character to extend it. In your example example, .Strings that are already long enough are preserved so that 0xFF0000 will still work.A couple of important things to note that have bitten me in the past:Make sure your width includes the length of the leading "0x"This is because the  function operator operates on raw text and doesn't realize it's a hex stringIf you give a width value shorter than you need, the strings won't be filled up enough and will have different lengths.In other words  because you need a length of 8 characters to fit both cases
Use the format() built-in function to show the hex representation to the expected level of precision:The format code  means "eight lowercase hex digits padded with leading zeros".
You say the user typed this input in on the keyboard. That means you already started with the strings you want, but you parsed integers out of the input and threw away the strings.Don't do that. Keep the strings. Parse integers too if you need to do math, but keep the strings. Then you can just dowithout having to go through a reconstruction process and guess at how many leading zeros were originally input.
