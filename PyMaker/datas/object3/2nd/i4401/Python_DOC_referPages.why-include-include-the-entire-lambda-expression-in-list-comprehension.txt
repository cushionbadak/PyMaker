This question already has an answer here:Callback function tkinter button with variable parameter                    2 answers                In his writeup on Python programming mistakes, Martin Chikilian includes the following to illustrate misconceptions regarding variable lifetimes inside closures:The output is understandably surprising to some as  maintains its final value (4) in the closure between calls to . Martin includes a hack to get the desired output (please see his article for details).What I'm wondering about is what is being accomplished by including the entire  in the list comprehension? Is it a common idiom in some field such as scientific computing? Because, to me, the following is much easier to understand:Output:[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]The output from the 2nd version roughly matches that listed as desirable by Martin. So what's going on here?
They accomplish different things. The former returns a list of lambas that return numbers and the latter returns a lambda that returns a list of numbers. You can imagine different use cases for each.
