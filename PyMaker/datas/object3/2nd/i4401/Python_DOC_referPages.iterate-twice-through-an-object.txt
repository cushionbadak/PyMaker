I'm trying to create an iterable object, and when I do 1 loop it is okay, but when doing multiple loops, it doesn't work. Here is my simplified code:How can I make this object (in this case ) to iterate twice and get all the combinations of number  and  in the example loop?
You want an instance of  to be iterable, but not its own iterator. What's the difference?An iterable is something that, upon request, can supply an iterator. Lists are iterable, because  returns a new  object (not the list itself). To make  iterable, you just need to supply an  method (more on how to define it in a bit).An iterator is something that, upon request, can produce a new element. It does this by calling its  method. An iterator can be thought of as two pieces of information: a sequence of items to produce, and a cursor indicating how far along that sequence it currently is. When it reaches the end of its sequence, it raises a  exception to indicate that the iteration is at an end. To make an instance an iterator, you supply a  method in its class. An iterator should also have a  method that just returns itself.So how do you make  iterable without being an iterator? By having its  method return a new iterator each time it is called, and getting rid of its  method. The simplest way to do that is to make  a generator function. Define your class something like:Now when you write and  both draw values from separate iterators over the same iterable. Each call to  returns a different generator object that keeps track of its own .
