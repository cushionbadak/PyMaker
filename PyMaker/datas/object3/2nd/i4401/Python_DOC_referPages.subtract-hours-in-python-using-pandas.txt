Natural Text
I want to display the result by subtracting two-time slots into a fraction e.g 8.5 hours. At the moment I am getting the below output but I want to get 8 and if it was 8:30 for it to say 8.5. I am using Python PandascurrentOutput

If  is a  object (see [1]), then you just need to do:to get the time in hours.
