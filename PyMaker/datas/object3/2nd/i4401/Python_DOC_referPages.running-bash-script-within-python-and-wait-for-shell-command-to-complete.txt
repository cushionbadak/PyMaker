I have the same question as here with python 3.x. I tried the solution provided but it does not work for me.  Python does not wait bash script to finish and prints "end" before bash script to be terminated. I am on windows and have cygwin isntalled.callBash.py:sleep.sh:
You never check the return value of , so it's likely that your script doesn't even start properly, maybe because of invalid PATH / CWD or permissions or something else.Use  instead, so that an exception is raised if your script fails to run. Exceptions are not so easy to miss.Also if you have Python 3,  is newer and generally easier to work with.
