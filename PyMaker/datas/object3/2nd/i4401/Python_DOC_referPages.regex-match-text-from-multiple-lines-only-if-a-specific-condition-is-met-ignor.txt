Natural Text
I have the following text:I want to get the attribute name plus its description field ONLY if the attribute has a description field. From the text above I want to build a regex such that returns the following:Notice the attribute 'Something' is being ignored as it doesn't have the description field. Also, the description field of attribute 'Things' is inline with another field (note the \n is intentional).So far I have: but I it is including the attribute without the description (attribute 'Something')I am trying to do this in python | pcre
