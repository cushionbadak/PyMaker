hi I'm fairly new to programming and am currently writing the classic dice rolling simulator in python 3.6.I'm trying to make it as user-friendly as I can hence the amount of code there is, I've written the code and it works but I'm having trouble creating a part of the code where if the user types in 'quit' into the 'usersInput' variable it will break the loop and quit the program. I'm not currently sure on where and how to place this condition into the code any help will be of great thanks.
