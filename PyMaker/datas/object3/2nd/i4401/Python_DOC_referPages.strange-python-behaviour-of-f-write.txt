I was writing some python code and I found a strange behaviour in my code.This is the code:It generates the file test1 with lenght 1000000000 (1,0 GB) filled with 0.Is this supposed to happen(if yes, why?) or is a bug?
The  function creates an array of bytes from a parameter  and the documentation states:If it is an integer, the array will have that size and will be initialized with null bytes.So you are then just writing 1 billion null characters () to that file!
Initialising a  with a single integer value creates an empty (i.e. filled with zeroes)  of the size specified (as documented here). Your code therefore converts the string "1000000000" into an integer and then creates a  of that size which it writes to disk.There is nothing strange or surprising about this behaviour.
