I am trying to create a script in python that listens to multiple sockets using websockets and asyncio, the problem is that no matter what I do it only listen to the first socket I call.I think its the infinite loop, what are my option to solve this? using threads for each sockets? 
Your code appears incomplete, but what you've shown has two issues. One is that  accepts a coroutine object (or other kind of future), not a coroutine function. So it should be:the problem is that no matter what I do it only listen to the first socket I call. I think its the infinite loop, what are my option to solve this? using threads for each sockets?The infinite loop is not the problem, asyncio is designed to support such "infinite loops". The problem is that you are trying to do everything in one coroutine, whereas you should be creating one coroutine per websocket. This is not a problem, as coroutines are very lightweight.For example (untested):
this is what I did eventually, that way its not blocking the main thread and all subscriptions are working in parallel.
