I've been trying to get keypresses to be detected in a Python program. I want to find a way to do this without using Tkinter, , or . Here's what I'm going at:Does anyone know how this is possible?
Python has a keyboard module with many features. Install it, perhaps with this command:Then use it in code like:You can set multiple Key Detection:
I took the liberty of editing your question slightly so it makes sense and has an answer, at least on Windows. (IDLE only interacts with your keyboard by means of the tkinter interface to tk.)  On Windows, the answer is to use the msvcrt module's console io functionsFor other systems, you will have to find the equivalent system-specific calls.  For posix systems, these may be part of curses, which you said you did not to use, but I do not know.These functions do not work correctly when the program is run is run from IDLE in its default mode.  The same may be true for other graphics-mode IDEs.
