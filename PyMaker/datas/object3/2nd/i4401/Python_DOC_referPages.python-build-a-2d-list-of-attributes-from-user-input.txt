Very new to python. I am interested in learning how to build a 2D list, where each row contains an object number in column one and its attributes in the following columns. This will be done for as many objects as the user defines. It would look like this:Object1 big heavy squareObject2 small heavy roundObject3 small light roundSo if the user says there are eight objects, a loop would ask for the object number, size, weight, and shape of each object and populate the list. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks
You've already done most of the work in your last paragraph. There are a few ways of doing this:Na√Øve  loop:Nested  loop:Nested list comprehensionYou can see that each version is based on the last. A list comprehension is a neat way of building a list; you may or may not have come across it before.
