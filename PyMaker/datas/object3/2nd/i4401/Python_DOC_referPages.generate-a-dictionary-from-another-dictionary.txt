Can anyone guide me in this?I have a dictionary in the following format:My requirement is to create a dictionary in the following format:I have tried splitting up the dict using keys and values.Tried joining multiple dicts. But I am unable to receive the output in the above format.Based on your experience in Python, can any of you suggest me a way forward or help me in this.Thanks,
The answer to this is relatively simple, just loop through the dictionaries and assign the values to the correct place e.g:The most awkward part here is that those dictionaries won't exist, so this code won't work. While you could manually check that and construct them, the easier option is to use a  to automatically construct them. E.g:This means whenever you try and access a user that doesn't exist, a new dictionary will be created for it. This makes the above code do exactly what you want:Another option is  which allows you to do this at access time, rather than when you set up the dictionary, e.g:
You can use pandas:Convert the dataframe to a dictionary:
First, we flatten the 2-level data you have in :Then we use itertools.groupby which "returns consecutive keys and groups from the iterable" (note that groupby require its argument to be sorted to function correctly):
This is what I would do:note that the keys  and  are used in the opposite order in the last line.
I think you may have mistyped your output, as it doesn't correspond to you input.As @pissal comments, the output you requested is not possible.I guess you want your output to be:Then you want code like:Edited to include : You may need to use defaultdict as specified in @Gareth Latty's answer
This will do the work:
