I read ip addresses from a file and insert them to a set along with bool value 'False'. I use 'add' function.Then I insert the set into a list.example for list I want to get : [{1.2.3.5,False},{10.10.10.1,False}]But sometimes I see that the order of the IP address and the bool getting changed.this is the codethis is an example of the outputas you can see for example in the third value inside the set - order is switched and I don't know why.I would like you to explain why it is happening.Thanks,Omri.
Sets are unordered. You cannot and should not expect the output of a set to be printed in a particular order.What you want is a list of tuples:A list of lists is equally possible via . The main difference between  and  are lists are mutable while tuples are immutable.
Sets are unordered as they use a hash function to insert the items into it .You may use a dictionary representing ips as keys and bool values as a vaules.It will look like The advantage of using dictionary vs lists of tuples is that the search or looking for an ip will take O(1) time vs O(n) for lists of tuples .In a pythonic way using comprehension :If you want to keep the order of ips as the file you can use OrderedDict .
