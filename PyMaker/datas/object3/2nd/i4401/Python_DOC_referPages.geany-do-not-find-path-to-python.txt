I've been using PyCharm for a month but decided to give geany a try.I've spend hours looking at all the installation and setup tutorials on the web and youtube and even in my book it tells you how to set it up. They all say the same thing and as far as I know, I've done exactly what they said. (I found a question on here by someone with the exact same problem but it was never answered.)go to Build>Set Build Commands, in the box next to Execute, put in the path to where python is located.Here is my pathI don't know why my python installed in such an unusual place. Everyone else's look like this: . Is that the problem? When I go into , the  folder is not visible. Is this for security? Is Geany not able to access those folders cause they are invisible?I'm pretty sure you don't need the  so I deleted it.When I hit execute, I can see the command window appear for a split second and then disappear, probably because it tries, but can't find python so closes.I don't know what the  is but everyone has it anyways.Before I entered all that into the text box, by default in that text box, there was  I don't know what that is all about.
If you're question is about  look at Geany's manual at Substitutions in commands and working directories section:The first occurrence of each of the following character sequences in  each of the command and working directory fields is substituted by the  items specified below before the command is run.Note: If the basepath set in the project preferences is not an absolute path, then it is taken as relative to the directory of the  project file. This allows a project file stored in the source tree to  specify all commands and working directories relative to the tree  itself, so that the whole tree including the project file, can be  moved and even checked into and out of version control without having  to re-configure> the build menu.
