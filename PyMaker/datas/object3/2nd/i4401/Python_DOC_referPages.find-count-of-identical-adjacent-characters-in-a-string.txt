You can use  for this. This is an O(n) complexity solution which loops through adjacent letters and builds a dictionary based on a condition.Your output will be a dictionary with keys as repeated letters and values as counts.The use of  is to avoid building a new list for the second argument of .Result:
You could use a :
You may use  with dictionary comprehension and  as:Here's another alternative to achieve this using , but this one is not as clean as the above solution (also will be slow in terms of performance). 
One way may be as following using :Result:
You can try it with just  method without importing anything :output:
