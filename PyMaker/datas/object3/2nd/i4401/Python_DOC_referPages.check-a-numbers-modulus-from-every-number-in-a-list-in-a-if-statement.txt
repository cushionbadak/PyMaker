I'm trying to make a program that involves checking if a number's modulus is zero for every number in a list, and then, if it's modulus of all of them is zero, it adds it to the list. Like this:If you're wondering, It's for calculating primes. Thanks in advance.
There is a function called  for this kind of thing.
