I made a neural network (which has unfortunately grown in complexity and become rather CPU intensive) which analyzes screenshots in real-time. I wish to pause it when I press the letter 'a' and un-pause it when the letter 'a' is pressed again. What is the most efficient way to pause it (without breaking the loop altogether)? It uses Python OpenCV library, but I don't use cv2.imshow, hence I can't use cv2.Waitkey. I'm running this on Windows 10. Could you please provide example code to your answer? Here's a bit of the code:
Use  from the  package in the Python standard library.  won't work on Windows.EditYou can do what you want in a platform independent way by using the  library. Here's a short example program (needs the  package if you're running on Linux or Mac):The above program will run two threads. The main thread will run the  function, which adds 1 to a count every second. The other thread runs the  function, which will wait for user input. If type , the  thread will tell the  thread to pause and print out the current count. You can type  again to resume the count, or you can type  to quit.
