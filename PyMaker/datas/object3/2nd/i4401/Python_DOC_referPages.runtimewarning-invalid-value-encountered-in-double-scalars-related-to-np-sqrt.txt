Natural Text
I have defined a mathematical function with np.sqrt(a positive number) in it.It returns me RuntimeWarning.After I simplify it to a very simple mathematical function that anyone can solve manually, it still return me the error.Below is the simplified function:It returns:And  is It works well if the input , or I remove  to the result of the square root of the number inside the .What's reason of that.I have noticed the type of np.sqrt is a bit different to another number. Is this the reason?
Your issue is not with the  square root. The value you are trying to return to , involves raising a negative number to a non-integer power. This is mathematically undefined.The mathematical operation, although I am quite sure python uses a different numerical approximation, is:Now imagine what happens if  is negative: you try to take the natural logarithm of a negative number. This will result in a . Depending on the function used, you will be presented with a range of errors.The solution is to enforce the quantity  to be positive.
When you call your function with the values , you can see the value of your variables.Sometimes, the roots you will find are imaginary when you have negative number and fractional exponential, however sometimes it will just throw you an error. For a little more information you can check this respose.
