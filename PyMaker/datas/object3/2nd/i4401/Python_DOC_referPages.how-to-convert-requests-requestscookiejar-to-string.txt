I think you need to work with a Python dictionary of the cookies. (See my comment above.)Your example:
NEW ANSWEROk, so I still don't get exactly what it is you are trying to achieve. If you want to extract the originating url from a  object (so that you could then check if there is a match with a given subdomain) that is (as far as I know) impossible. However, you could off course do something like:Then if you do:You could then do:Which would give the output:While: Would output:Then, if you (if needed) fine-tune the regex & create a list of urls, you could first loop through the list to create many instances and save them in eg a list or dict. In a second loop you could check another list of urls to see if their cookies might be present in any of the instances. OLD ANSWERThe docs you link to explain:items() Dict-like items() that returns a list of name-value  tuples from the jar. Allows client-code to call  dict(RequestsCookieJar) and get a vanilla python dict of key value  pairs.I think what you are looking for is:Now I can run it like this:
