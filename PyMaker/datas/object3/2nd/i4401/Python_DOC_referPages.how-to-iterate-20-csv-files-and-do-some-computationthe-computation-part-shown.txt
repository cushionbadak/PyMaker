insteaad of naming the file each time, i want to iterate 20 files
If  is static and you just want to loop through this for the 20 files, then you can make use of  and  to reduce the amount of code you need to write.This assumes that the only files in your path that have  in their name are the ones you want to analyze, but if that's not the case, you can either modify the list creation or think about file naming and organization a bit more to facilitate things like this.
