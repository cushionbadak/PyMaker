I'm currently studying threading, multiprocess, and os documentations to improve the structure of my program. However to be honest to me, some of it is sophisticated, I can't get it to implement on my program, either it crashes due to stackoverflow, or gets the wrong ourput or no output at all. So here's my problem.Let's say I have a list of names that gets passed into a function and that function is what I want to run in another console with - ofcourse a python interpretter. and have it run there in a full cycle.Let's say I have this: what should I use in order to run this function to open another console programatically on python and run it there  is it subproccess/multiprocess/threading or perhaps ?And how should I execute,  in this example? The multiprocessing Pool and Process always crashes with me. So I think its not the right solution. So far from what I've searched I haven't seen examples with threading and subprocess being used with functions. Is there a workaround on this? or perhaps a simple solution I might have missed? Thanks.Edit:A similar code:http://prntscr.com/j4viat - what the error looks like
 is always usually preferred over .The docs contain a number of examples - in your case, your  function might want to use  if you want to see the results of the command. eg.:All this does though is launch a new process, and waits for it to return. While that's technically two processes, it's not exactly what you'd call multi-threading.To use run multiple subprocesses at synchronously, you might do something like this with the multiprocessing library:this maps an iterator (the list of names) to a function (execute_function) and runs them all at once. Well, as many cores as your machine has at once. map_results is a list of return values from the  func.
