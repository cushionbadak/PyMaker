I have this assignment:context.options |= ssl.OP_NO_TLSv1_1taken from ssl python here. Since the value after the assignemnt, can take different values: I thought of adding all the values in an array to make my code more readable. So I did the following:Then:But I got an error: Is there any way where I can put these non-string values in one place and call them by reference like an array? 
Maybe you mean this:why did you convert them to  anyway?I guess this code will work then just fine.
Instead of putting strings in your  list, you can put in the actual values.Then should work.
