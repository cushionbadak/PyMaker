I have a dictionary like below, as you see I am trying to print  which is not in dictionary. I want to check if my  exist in dictionary, print the value and when the  is not in dictionary print .When I put condition , it will print two times  (= the number of element in the dictionary) but I just want to check only , meaning if the  is in the dictionary print  if only  is not in the dictionary print .
Here is an example of how you can do it:
First of all  is a list, not a dictionary.Judging by your code, I understand your question as follows: out of the dictionaries inside the tuples held by , you want to check whether any holds a specific key.Here's one way, using the  builtin function (which returns a boolean, which we convert to an  according to your requirements) and tuple unpacking:Depending on what your actual problem is, it might be beneficial to construct a  from your dictionaries. The following example introduces the concept and also solves the original question.
