I am currently reading data from a .yml file. Inside the file is the following part for every main entry:I've been able to read all the data, including 'prerequisites', but here I have a special problem:Where with the other data, I was able to access sublists it seems to be different for this:The "any:" part is optional, so it could also say something likeReading the .yml file converts the part above toSo in my code, for every "tierX", I check if it contains a key "any:" viaBut it never seems to be true. Since "Attribute:", "Feat:" and "Other:" are also optional, I do the same for those inside the if-else-statement and it's the same problem with them though for those there's no else-statement.Below you can find the code I'm using. It won't be the prettiest since I litterally started with python today but I hope that you'll help me anyway:I'm doing stuff like the  in order to get every element except the last so I can add a  in front of the last element, should there be more than one.EDIT:My desired Output would be something like:If no any exists andif it doesn't
Your problem is that  iterates over the keys of the predicate dictionary, thus the subsequent  actually evaluates  which is of cause always false.What you want to test here is . When working with dictionaries (i.e. mappings) you have to differentiate between a  and its corresponding .Interestingly you have gotten it right for the next level down:Ways to iterate over a dictionarysee python documentation here and hereAs you are new to Python and do not know what is possible, allow me to present you a much more elegant solution with out all the repetitive string operations:
