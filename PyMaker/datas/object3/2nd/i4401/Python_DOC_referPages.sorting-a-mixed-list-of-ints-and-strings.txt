Natural Text
I am trying to sort the following mixed list of ints and strings, but getting a TypeError instead. My desired output order is sorted integers then sorted strings.
You can pass a custom key function to :This key function maps each element in the list to a tuple in which the first value is a boolean ( for strings and  for numbers) and the second value is the element itself, like this:These tuples are then used to sort the list. Because , this makes it so that integers are sorted before strings. Elements with the same boolean value are then sorted by the 2nd value in the tuple.
I can see from your comment that you want integers to be sorted first then strings.So we could sort two separate lists and join them as follows:Output:[4, 6, 9, 'ashley', 'chay', 'drooks', 'may', 'poo']
