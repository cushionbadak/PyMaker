I am required to input a string, calculate the number of vowels in that string, and then calculate the most and least occurring vowels. When the string contains no vowels at all, a message should print saying "no vowels were entered". Where there are vowels which occur the same number of times (e.g. if a and e both occur twice ), these vowels should both appear as being most or least occurring. However, if some vowels are in the string but not all, then the ones which do not appear in the sting should be ignored (rather than printing "a=0"). I think the counting part at the start is correct to an extent, but not quite. As for the most/least occurrences, I don't even know where to begin. Any help would be appreciated!
seems like a much easier way to do it ...
Well, you've got a list, , with 5 counts in it. How do you find out which count is the highest? Just call  on it:Now that you know the max is 10, how do you know which letters have counts of 10?You should be able to figure out how to do the minimum count as well.But there's one extra problem for minimum count: it sounds like you want the minimum that's not 0, not the absolute minimum. I'd write it like this:â€¦ or, maybe more compactly:But I'm guessing you don't understand comprehensions yet. In which case, you'll need to explicitly loop over the values, keeping track of the minimum value(s) that aren't 0. This implementation of  should help guide you in the right direction:All that being said, this is one of many cases where using the right data structure makes the job a lot easier. For example, if you used a dictionary instead of a list, you could replace the whole first half of your code with this:Using a  or a  makes it even easier; then you don't need to explicitly initialize the counts to 0.
here  function will try to find the 'x' from  if found return position of 'x` else return -1. so in flag i will get the position else -1
