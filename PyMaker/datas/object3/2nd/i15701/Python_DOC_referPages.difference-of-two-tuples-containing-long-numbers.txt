I have two tuples of  values. I need the difference of them, something like .expected result:but it does not matter if it is tuple or listI am looking for a way not to do it element by element if possible. Speed is a constraint. I searched for it but couldn't find an answer.Thank you in advance
In pure Python fastest way will be to use  with :If that is not enough switch to Numpy:Let's time them:Using (Python 2) or simply  in Python 3 will make the list comprehension version almost as fast as :
You can  the tuples, the iterate over the pairs and perform your subtraction in a list comprehension.
You can use  function (Make an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables.) :
here is basic:Note: assuming that len(x1) and len(x2) are always the same
You can use map/lambda while zipping the values
