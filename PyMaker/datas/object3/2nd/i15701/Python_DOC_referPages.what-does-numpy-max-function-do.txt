I went onto a piece of code which goes like this:I am trying to replace the  with some regular Python (math?) function, but I can not find what exactly does  does.I tried googling but I only found: which is not the same as  I suppose.And: which is again not what I need.Does anyone know how I could replicate this numpy.max funtion into some standard python one?EDIT: I am using Python 2.7
You can't replicate the behavior of  very easily in pure Python, simply because multi-dimensional arrays aren't standard in Python. If the  and  in your code are such arrays, it would be best to keep the NumPy function.For flat (one-dimensional) arrays, the Python  and  do the same thing and could be exchanged:For arrays with more than one dimension,  won't work: By default,  flattens the 3D array and returns the maximum. (You can also find the maximum along particular axes, and so on.) The Python  cannot do this.To replace , you'd need to write nested loops over the axes of the array; effectively trying to find the maximum in a list of  nested lists. This is certainly possible, but is likely to be very slow:
 is the same thing as :Or, more specifically,  is an alias for the  function.The purpose of this function is listed in the docs link you gave, but it seems that it is mainly used to find the maximum value inside a  regardless of how many nested levels it has.  You can mimic this behavior with a simple function to flatten a list:and the built-in  function:See a demonstration below:
