Hi I want to two elements from string but my string has whitespaces at the beginning.How can I split it with elimanting whitespaces from beginning?
Will strip white space from the left of the string only.
If you use  and don't add a separator then leading and trailing whitespaces will be discarded. If you add the  parameter only leading whitespaces will be discarded. No need to use  here.
