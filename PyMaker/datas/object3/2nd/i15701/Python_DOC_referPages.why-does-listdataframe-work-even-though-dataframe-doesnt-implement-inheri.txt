I can't find an  method defined in , nor in any of its base classes*Yet, I can use this code to convert a DataFrame into a dict:Why doesn't  in the above code trigger a ?* Determined by running the following code:
The  method works in terms of the  method.* And, as the docs say:Without a second argument,  must be a collection object which supports the iteration protocol (the  method), or it must support the sequence protocol (the  method with integer arguments starting at 0).Here's an example of a class that's iterable** without defining :The output will be .If you're curious, this "sequence protocol" if effectively how  loops worked in early Python, but the modern definition was created for backward compatibility back when iterators were added in Python 2.2.*** It could have been removed in 3.0, but there were good arguments for why it was useful, so it stayed.***** Actually, at least in CPython, that's not how it actually works, but it's documented to work as if it were calling .** But notice that it's not an , even though that's one of the few "automatic ABCs" that you don't have to inherit from/register with. The documentation explicitly doesn't say that  means iterable; it says "See also the definition of iterable".*** For example, third party libraries like , the predecessor to today's , provided collection classes that worked in  loops in Python 2.1, and they wanted them to keep working even though  loops were now implemented in terms of iterators.**** I don't remember what exactly the arguments were, but it must have had something to do with certain classes being more readable/easier to understand by thinking in terms of the sequence protocol instead of manually reproducing the same thing in terms of the iteration protocol. You'd have to hunt through the python-3000 list archives for details.
I think every robject implements rinterfaceyou can see the  method inhttps://bitbucket.org/lgautier/rpy2/src/08ec0c15bd5ef8170ad8a49c2dc2b4a8dea36d64/rpy/rinterface/_rinterface.c?at=default#cl-2446at least I think ... it gets pretty tangled pretty quick
