Natural Text
I want to create a code that will return "true" (if I type in a palindrome regardless of case or if there are special characters in it), and "false" otherwise. The code I have so far works for phrases with no special characters such as commas, apostrophes, spaces, etc. when I do:it returns True because it is a palindromewhen I do:it returns False because it is not a palindromewhen I do:it returns False. but I want to create a code that considers this a palindrome
You need to filter before testing then:would pick out only the letters and lowercase them, after which you can test of those letters form a palindrome:This works because  returns  only for letters.Combined into your function:Demo:
This should recreate my_str with only alphabetical characters, using .isalpha(). Then do the test on that. If you want to keep a record of original string, just stored the recreated version is a temporary string.
If you just want to exclude punctuation and spaces you can use :
You may get just alphanumeric character in your string;By the way this one works, if you ignores non-ASCII chars.
