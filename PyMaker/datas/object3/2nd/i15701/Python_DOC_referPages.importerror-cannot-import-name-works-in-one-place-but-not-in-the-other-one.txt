So I have this directory structure:So what I'm trying to do is from fileB.py import a function in FileA.py. So I tried this:When I do this I get the following error:But If I do this instead:I dont get the error.. Can some one explain why am I getting this error?NoteThe file FileA.py only has two functions, the first function I import it when I run start.py using from subDirA.fileA import funct. I get the error when I run start.py and in fileB.py I try to import the second function using from subDirA.fileA import funct2
There is no  on your  module object at import-time.  While circular imports are the most common cause of this problem, it is also possibly a typo, or one of a few other issues.If you import the module as a whole and refer to  as , the issue might go away because then  will only need to be available at run-time instead of import-time.You might also try doing a  immediately after importing it to see what things are in it at that point.  You might also put a  immediately after the definition of  in  to see whether the definition is executed before you get this error:If you are trying to execute  by itself, you would not expect these imports to work because the working directory is not .  The working directory must be  for these imports to resolve correctly.  However, that is clearly not the issue here or you would not be able to do a star-import.
