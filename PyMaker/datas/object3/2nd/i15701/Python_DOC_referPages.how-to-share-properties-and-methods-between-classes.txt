Having been here: Python class inherits object, and here What is a metaclass in Python? I'm still unsure of how to get my code working. I'll be honest those explanations were a bit complicated for me. (BTW This is all in Python 3.4).I'm trying to make Objects for my game in the form of creatures. Example: I want an Object called Dragon, but I want Dragon to inherit the class Entity, and the class Monster.Here's what I've got:I don't know how I can give Dragon all of the values of both an entity and a Monster? Obviously setting Dragon directly to monster doesn't work.*****I've now tried this*****:class Structure:    passclass Dragon(Entity, Monster):    passDragon(10, 10, 10, 1000, 'Dragon', 1000)The Dragon is saying it doesn't have all the parameters of both classes though? 
You can inherit from Entity class:  in declaration. You can find detailed information in documentation
Python can have classes inheriting from multiple parents. You can simply do:Just make sure that the resolution order between those classes is what you expect. Search for "python mro" for more details about it.
