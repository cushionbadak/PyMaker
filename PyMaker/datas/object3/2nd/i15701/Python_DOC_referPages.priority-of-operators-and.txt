This question already has an answer here:Why does the expression 0 < 0 == 0 return False in Python?                    9 answers                I'm trying to guess which operator has priority:  (greater than) or  (equal). This is my experiment:As far as I know, this has two possible solutions.Neither one returns , so how is the first code resolved by Python?
This has to do with operator chaining.  Unlike C/C++ and most other languages, Python allows you to chain comparison operators just like you would in normal mathematics. From the documentation:Comparisons can be chained arbitrarily, e.g.,  is  equivalent to , except that  is evaluated only once  (but in both cases  is not evaluated at all when  is found to be  false).So, this expression:is actually interpreted as:which becomes:which is .Using parenthesis however changes how Python interprets your comparison.  This:becomes:which is  (see below for why).  Same goes for:which becomes:which is also .Because of PEP 0285,  was made a subclass of  and  while :
