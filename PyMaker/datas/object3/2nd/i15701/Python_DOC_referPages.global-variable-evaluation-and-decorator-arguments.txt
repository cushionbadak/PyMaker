I'm coding with unittest and i have question.I want to skip test case depend on global variable.I thought test2 would be skipped after execution test1 (global variable _SKIP_TEST set to True), but both test was executed.It maybe come from variable scope or evaluation timing issue, or something i dont know....How can i make this code work as i expected?Thanks.
The decorator is applied at module import time; by the time you set  to  that decorator has long since been applied.You could call the  method in the test instead:or write your own decorator that uses that raises the  exception based on a callable:then use that as:Not  is tested when the test is executed rather than at module import time.
