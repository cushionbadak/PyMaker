I have an object like:I want to convert it to a string like :using str() give me this:Notice that '\xe4' has four chars. I guess that str() simply calls repr(). One solution is traveling all the key of the object and recursively handle it. I am wondering is there any other way to achieve it. Such as converting the '\xe4' to 'ä¸­' or directly convert obj1 to the excepted result.Thanks!
