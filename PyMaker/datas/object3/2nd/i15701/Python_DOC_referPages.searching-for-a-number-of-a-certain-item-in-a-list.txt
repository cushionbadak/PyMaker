I want to look for a certain item in a list, but there may be more than 1 of this item in the list, but I want it so that for each item in the list, it will do something.For example:and it should print out  twice, for the 2 s in the list.
You can use the count method to do this:One liner:Note: I have changed the variable name 'list' to 'lst' as a good practice to avoid the python's keyword overriding.
You can do this easily with python's built in filter syntax:The advantage of this method over the others presented is that you can actually do something with the elements that match your criteria as you iterate, should you wish to.Usage:
I think this is the simplest, most readable syntax.  It says exactly what it does, imports no modules, calls no functions and creates no temporary variables.  It would be easy to substitute any comparison and any function taking  as a parameter.
