I am trying to write a simple Python program. It's supposed to return a a closure that returns successive fibonacci numbers:I get this error at run time:EDIT: In my original post, I had not included  in the definition of  but it was actually a typo. I would still get the same error anyway.
Python determines the scope of variables at compile time, based on binding behaviour. If you assign to a name, or use it as an  target (and a few other ways) you are binding the name in a scope.You are binding to  and  in the  function; both are being assigned to. This makes those two names local in , and Python won't even look at the surrounding scope.You'll need to override this behaviour, and you can do this by using the  statement: tells the compiler explicitly that you don't want it to look at binding behaviour but instead treat the names as closures.Next, you are using  in the first branch of the  test, but you haven't defined it anywhere outside of the  branch. You should just return  there anyway:Last but not least, you can swap two variables by using tuple assignment, no intermediaries needed:
You can't modified enclosing variables, n_1, n_2 is in  space not in space of function that's why you can't cahnge the variables.Use  keyword
