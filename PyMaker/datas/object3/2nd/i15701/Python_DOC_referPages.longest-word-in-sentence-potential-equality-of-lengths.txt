The code works if the longest word in a sentence is strictly longer in symbols than any other, however, how should I adjust the code if the sentence is something like:How can I return that there are n words that are equally long? Obviously it's enough to count the symbols in one of the words, but the:returns only the first of the longest words.
You probably need to make two passes along the list of targets, once to get the maximum length, and then to select all words whose length matches the maximum:Quick test:
Use the  module. It has a  function that can be used to group an iterator based on a custom-defined function, in this case :
You can first get maximum length, and check and fetch each word of the same length:You can also define a customized  function to count only characters,and replace  with  in the previous example.
My function returns a list with the longest word or words.
