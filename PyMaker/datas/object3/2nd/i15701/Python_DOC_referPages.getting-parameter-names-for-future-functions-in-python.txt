My 2.7.5 version of  doesn't allow use of the  argument:I'll ask about why this is in a separate post if I can't figure that out. For now, I wanted to see what arguments were available in my environment's version of this function. I looked at this SO post and some related ones, but these do not seem to work when I try:I'm guessing that the special nature of  functions is why this standard technique fails. Is there another way to check what args my version  takes?
You are trying to treat a built-in function (implemented in C) as a user-defined function. They are not the same thing.   is only defined for user-defined functions (implemented in Python).The  module only holds metadata about features, the  object is not the same object as the  function. Instead, the object tells you more about what version of Python first supported the feature, and in what version the feature becomes mandatory (and the  import becomes a no-op), as well as a bitfield flag for the  function:In Python 2.7, built-in function objects such as  simply do not have enough information for you to discover what arguments they support. In Python 3, this is slowly changing as more and more built-in types are given metadata, but the  function is not yet among them:I'm not sure where you got the idea from that  is a valid keyword for  in any Python version however. No version of Python exists that supports that argument.The only argument that is missing from  in Python 2 and present in Python 3.3 and up, is the  argument, see the Python 3 docs for :[...] if the flush keyword argument is true, the stream is forcibly flushed.Changed in version 3.3: Added the flush keyword argument.The only way to test for that (other than testing with ) is to try and use it:
