Environment     Python version : 3.4.2    OS version : OS X MavericksHi,I wanted to do some web scraping example with python.So, I created the script file and named it 'html.py'. ( in my project directory)But, when I executed it with python3, it generates errors like this.------------------------------------------- Error Msg -----------------------------------------------But, I installed 'BeautifulSoup4' by ' sudo pip3 install BeautifulSoup4 '.And, I checked it is installed in the right path.Strange thing was that I tried to import 'BeautifulSoup4' with python3 shell mode in the different directory(for ex. not in my project directory),it makes no errors. Errors appear only when I execute the script file in that directory. (where 'html.py' exist)So, why is this happening?And, errors are also disappered when I changed the script file name. (html.py -> test_html.py)What's wrong with file name?Am I not allowed to use module name as my script files?
 is the name of a standard module.I'm guessing that, at some point, BeautifulSoup is importing this html module. However, Python will (by default) first look for modules in the directory of the script file you are running. So it will find and import your  instead of the standard module.From the docs on :As initialized upon program startup, the first item of this list,  path[0], is the directory containing the script that was used to  invoke the Python interpreterYou could change the name of your script (good idea) or modify  to change the order of where Python will look for modules (bad idea).
