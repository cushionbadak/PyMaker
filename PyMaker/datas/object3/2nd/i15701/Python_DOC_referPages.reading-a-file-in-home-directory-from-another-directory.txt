The short answer is: use , as m.wasowski shows:But why do you have to do this?Well,  doesn't actually mean what you think it does. It's just asking for a file named  in a subdirectory named  in the current working directory.Why does this work on the command line? Bcause shells don't just pass your arguments along as typed, they do all kinds of complicated processing.This is why  gives you  in your —because the shell does glob expansion on  by looking in the directory for everything that matches that pattern and turns it into .In the same way, it expands  into  by looking at the appropriate environment variables and platform-specific defaults and so on. You can read the gory details for ; things are similar with , , and most other shells (except Windows  and ).Python talks to the filesystem directly, it doesn't go through the shell to do it. So, if you want to do the same things shells do, you have to do them explicitly: , , , , etc.The cool thing about doing it all in Python is that it works the same way everywhere. Even on Windows, where the shell doesn't know what  means, and the right answer may be some hideous thing like  or ,  will give you the right hideous thing.
