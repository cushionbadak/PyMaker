I was looking for FTP server implemented in Python and came across this https://gist.github.com/scturtle/1035886 . I tried to understand it but being a web developer and fairly new Python I found it confusing.Here's what I don't understand :From where did this attribute appeared , Its not defined anywhere  Line no : 22, 23Where is this function / code defined ? Line no : 223, 224I know basic OOP in Python any reference material to understand the code and become more power Python programmer will be appreciable . Thanks! 
(1) The variable is defined in (2) FTPserverThread inherits from threading.Thread. The attribute and method are defined in the parent class.When puzzling through code that uses the standard python library, it helps to read the docs. Search for "threading" and read away.
