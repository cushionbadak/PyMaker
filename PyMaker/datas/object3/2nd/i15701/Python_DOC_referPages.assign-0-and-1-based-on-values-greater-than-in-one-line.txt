Natural Text
Say I have an array with integers 1 through 10 and have to replace all integers less than 6 with 0 and all integers equal to or greater than 6 with 1.  Currently, I am doing this:I was wondering what would be a way to combine these two statements into one line of code, or any other solution for that matter.
I assume that  is a numpy array (the smart indexing that you are using seems to indicate this). In that case you can simply do:where  will convert the array of booleans  to an array of integers.
You can use a simple list comprehension:Which is equivalent to the following loops:
for numpy array,  gives an array of / which you can multiply by 1or add 0or cast to 
This works because  is defined to be the same value as  and  is defined to be the same value as .
