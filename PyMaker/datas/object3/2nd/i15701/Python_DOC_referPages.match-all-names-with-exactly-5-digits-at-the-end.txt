Natural Text
I have a text file like this:I have millions of entries like this.I want to pick up the name and number which has a number 5 digits long.  I tried this:but it's giving me results which have at least 5 digits.Q1: How to find the names with exactly 5 digits?Q2: I want to append the zip files which is associated with these names with 5 digits. How do I do that using regular expressions?
That's because  includes digit characters:You need to be more specific and tell Python that you only want letters:Regarding your second question, you can use something like the following:Or, without all the comments:Below is a demonstration:Keep in mind though that it is not very efficient to read in all of the file's contents at once.  Instead, you should consider making a generator function to yield the data blocks one at a time.  Also, you can increase performance by pre-compiling your Regex patterns.
OutputCommentI tried to keep it very simple, if your input is very long you should, as suggested by iCodez, implement a generator that s one record at a time, while for the regexp match I tried a little optimization searching only the last 7 characters of the header.Addendum: a simplistic implementation of a record generator
You need to limit the regex to the end of the word so that it wont match any further using see for example http://regex101.com/r/oC1yO6/1The regex would matchpython code would be like
