Is there a way I can use only one print statement, yet still  achieve the same effect as is in the code below?  I have attempted end statements to which either one don't work in this situation or, I am using incorrectly:
Yes, you can use  to insert a newline:It's not necessarily better, though. IMHO using separate  statements here is more readable.You could make it slightly better with string concatenation:Which, again, is not necessarily better IMHO.I also used  to improve readability; this removed the need for manual  calls, and is more readable (it can do a lot more, see the link).I have attempted end statements to which either one dont work in this situation or, I am using incorrectlyI assume you used something like , this won't work, because  is only appended to end end of all the arguments; the  parameter is printed between the arguments (this defaults to a space).So what you want to do, is: The downside of this, is that you will need 3  calls, or keep your "ugly" string concatenations.
It looks like you are using Python 3.x.  If so, then you can set the  parameter of  to  in order to have each argument be separated by a newline:Although this does make you line pretty long.  You might want to consider breaking it over two lines:Note that you could also just drop a few newline characters in select places.  This would allow you to write the above as simply:The nice thing about this solution is that it gets rid of all those calls to  ( automatically stringifies its arguments).Last but not least, if you are actually using Python 2.x, then you can import the Python 3.x  function from .  Place this line at the top of your code:
You can use template rendering like:I however do not get the balance formula, can you explain?
Or you can use this
