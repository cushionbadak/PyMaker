Class is as follows Now if I create object of  class and access attribute , then shouldn't it access the  method?If I create another class which inherits  class and I create object of  inside derived class, then  and  are getting called.I am confused by this behavior.According to the docs, descriptors are invoked by the  method  and  make different calls to , what is  over here?
 is not a descriptor object. It doesn't have any methods that would make it a descriptor.  does not exist. It is just a string object.The fact that  itself has such methods doesn't matter here, because  is not the attribute,  is. is a descriptor object,  does exist. So when you access , you get the result of the call to the  method.It is always the attribute itself that implement the descriptor protocol. It must directly have descriptor methods for those to be called.
