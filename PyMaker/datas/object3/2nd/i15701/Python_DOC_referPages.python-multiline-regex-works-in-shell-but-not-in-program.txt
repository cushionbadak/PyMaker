I'm trying to find and replace a multiline  pattern in a JSON feed. Basically, I'm looking for a line ending "}," followed by a line with just "}".Example input would be:and I want to find:and replace it with:I've tried the following:This works in the python shell. However, when I do the same search in my python program, it finds nothing. I'm using the full JSON feed in the program. Perhaps it's getting a different line termination when reading the feed.The feed is at:http://hardhat.ahmct.ucdavis.edu/tmp/test.jsonIf anyone can point out why this is working in the shell, but not in the program, I'd greatly appreciate it. Is there a better way to formulate the regular expression, so it would work in both?Thanks for any advice.=====================================================================================To make this clearer, I'm adding my test code here. Note that I'm now including the regular expression provided by Ahosan Karim Asik. This regex works in the live demo link below, but doesn't quite work for me in a python shell. It also doesn't work against the real feed.Thanks again for any assistance.
