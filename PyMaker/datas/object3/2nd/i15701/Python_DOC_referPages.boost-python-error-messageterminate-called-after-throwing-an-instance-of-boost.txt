I have a main.py which I loaded in c++ and run with the main.py has line: (which is test.py)located in the same folder inside main.py.when test.py has an error I cannot cach what error I got, application crash with:terminate called after throwing an instance of 'boost::python::error_already_set'is there a way to cache which file or which line got an error?
You can use  or  instead (doc reference).The real problem is getting error information from exception object.It's easy to print exception to stdout by  from  block, but if you need more complicated analysis the code becomes cumbersome. In  block you have to get exception info by , normalize by  and, say, analyze call stack by iterating over traceback objects.
