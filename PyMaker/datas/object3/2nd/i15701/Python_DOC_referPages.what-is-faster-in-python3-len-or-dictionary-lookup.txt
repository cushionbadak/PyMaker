What is faster (Python3)?or:Does in depend on the length of the string or the length of the dictionary? I did some simple test and it looks like  is more expensive, which seems counterintuitive to me.
The  solution is marginally slower because there is more involved.  You can see this by breaking down the code with :Notice that the  solution has an extra name lookup for  as well as a function call.  These each take time.  But, as you can see from the  tests below, the performance difference is pretty insignificant:Also, these stats will not change depending on the dictionary's length because both  and  have  (constant) complexity with dictionaries.
See Python's Time Complexity on a list is O(1) in all cases whereas lookup in a dictionary is amortized worst case O(n). Complexity and runtime are different. For some situation a dictionary look up will take longer, but it may happen so rarely and only for such large size dictionaries that it will not be the most performant for your uses.
