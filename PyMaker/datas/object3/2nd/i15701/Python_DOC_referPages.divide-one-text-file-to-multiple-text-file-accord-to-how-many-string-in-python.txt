Something like this will write each line of the input file to a separate output file (if that's what you meant):
'a' ensures that if the file already exists and it has some content then it is not overwritten.This may or may not work depending on the format of your inputTextFile. This is assuming that the strings are delimited by spaces. You can read about csv here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html
