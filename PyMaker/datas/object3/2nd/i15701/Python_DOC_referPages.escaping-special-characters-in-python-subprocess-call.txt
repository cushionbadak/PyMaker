I can't seem to be able to escape these special characters - *.I'm trying to copy some files using a Python script with the following lineBut I get the following error at the 2nd lineAlso I hate passing it using the CSV Style ("arg1","arg2"...). Is there any way of passing it as a raw string?
args should be a sequence of program arguments or else a single string.
Better don't do this via subprocess. Believe me it's a bad idea.For simple filesystem copy operations take a look on python shutil module.For creating new directories use os.makedirs.For creating files of certain size see this answers.
