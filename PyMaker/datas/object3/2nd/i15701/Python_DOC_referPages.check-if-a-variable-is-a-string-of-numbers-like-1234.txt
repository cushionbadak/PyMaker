Natural Text
I am making a small interactive text game in python.i need to check if a string, from the user, is  (a number in a string that would work with  ) or  (just a string, python would traceback if I called  on it)thanks in advance!
If you want to know if something is "a number in a string, one that would work with int()", you do that by just calling :This is a general case of the EAFP principle: It's Easier to Ask Forgiveness than Permission. Instead of trying to guess whether something would fail, it's usually easier to just try it and see if it fails.That's especially try in cases where trying to guess is more complicated than it looks. For example, people always suggest using the  method here, but that fails in a number of cases. For example: is false for negative numbers, because the  character is not a digit. is false for numbers with trailing whitespace (e.g., because you're not ping newlines from your input). is true for hundreds of non-western digits and special-form digits that can't be used with . has changed its rules at least twice between Python 2.0 and 3.4, and could always change again.You probably could come up with a complicated rule that was exactly the same as "would work with int()" as interpreted in some specific Python version, but why, when  is  obviously guaranteed to always do the same thing as ?
