I'm trying to write hex data taken from ascii file to a newly created binary fileascii file example:my code Thought  holds already hex converted data and  should write these hex data into a file, but python writes it with ascii modefinal output:  which is wrong!where is the issue?
Use :
replace:With:Or,ExplanationObserve: should translate into a single byte but  returns a four character string.   will send all four characters to the file.By contrast, in python2:This does what you want:  converts the number  to the character single-byte string which is what belongs in a binary file.In python3,  is replaced by .
