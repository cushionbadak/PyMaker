There are functions: ,  and  in unittest module.But how can I achive the opposite behavior? How can I assert that lists are unequal? 
Those functions are actually used by , when both values are the same type and a type-specific method is present.The inverse is simply to use .There are no nice 'formatting' options in that case, but if the test fails, that'd means that both lists were equal, so there is no point in showing how they match exactly!
You should use  to test that two sequences are unequal. The main feature of sequence related assertions is their ability to compute the difference between subjects upon failure.
