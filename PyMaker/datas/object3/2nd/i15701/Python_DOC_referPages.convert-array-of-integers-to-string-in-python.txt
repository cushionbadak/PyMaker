I want to convert my list of integers into a string.  Here is how I create the list of integers:Like this:new == [1,2,3,4,5,6]output == '123456'
There's definitely a slicker way to do this, but here's a very straight forward way:
With Convert a list of characters into a string you can just do
Coming a bit late and somehow extending the question, but you could leverage the  module and use:In practice, it creates an array of 1-byte wide integers (argument ) from your list of integers. The array is then converted to a string as a binary data structure, so the output won't look as you expect (you can fix this point with ). Yet, it should be one of the fastest integer-to-string conversion methods and it should save some memory.

You can loop through the integers in the list while converting to string type and appending to "string" variable.
