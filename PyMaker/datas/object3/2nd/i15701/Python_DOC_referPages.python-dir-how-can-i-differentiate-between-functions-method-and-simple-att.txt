 returns a list of all the defined names, but it is annoying to try to call function I see listed only to discover it is actually an attribute, or to try to access an attribute only to discover it is actually a callable.  How can I get  to be more informative?
To show a list of the defined names in a module, for example the math module, and their types you could do:getattr(math,name) returns the object (function, or otherwise) from the math module, named by the value of the string in the variable "name". For example type(getattr(math,'pi')) is 'float'
There isn't a way to make  'more informative' as you put it, but you can use the  and  functions:Obviously functions are still attributes themselves, but you get the idea.
Another way is to use  function in . You can get a similar result to James's one by For more information, please take a look at:https://docs.python.org/2/library/inspect.html#inspect.getmembers
