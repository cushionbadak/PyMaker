I'm learning Python's nested loops but couldn't use nested loops to fill a list with the combinations. So far I haveWhen this prints I get:Which is a list of the possible combinations but if I try an extra for-loop to index them it doesn't seem to work and only gives the first element. I'm trying to get an array in the form:where I can index said array and get  and so on.Any hints on how to do this? I've tried for-loops and using the append function neither giving me the results I wanted.
You can append the lists to the result:This says: create a result list  and append the  value to it at each step. You'll then have a list of lists and you can access the first element as  (which is indeed ).
I like list comprehension!But it creates three lists (the iterated two stay in memory) in python 2.7 which is the common one nowdays.If you're using big values try this:which uses Generators :)
The easiest way to do this is to use :Note that this solution is also very flexible.  For example, if you want to find the combinations of the numbers one through five taken three at a time, all you need to do is change the numbers given to  and :
You can achieve it using :If you really need lists instead of tuples:
