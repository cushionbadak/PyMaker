In (this section)[https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#exceptions] about exceptions with subprocess.Popen the documentation says that "The most common exception raised is OSError".Are there other, undocumented Exceptions that might by raised that are not of type OSError and are not due to invalid arguments?I am asking this because I have the following code:and I want this to be 100% exception free. The system I am working on is Debian GNU/Linux 7.7 (wheezy).I not only ask this for a safe way to write my program but also out of curiousity for the python  implementation. So please be a bit more specific than just saying to catch .

this will covers most of it:
