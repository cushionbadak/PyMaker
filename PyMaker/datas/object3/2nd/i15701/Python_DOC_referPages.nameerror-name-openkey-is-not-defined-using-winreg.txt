In Python, I'm trying to open a regedit Key to add String value to it. However, it's somehow not recognizing the  or  method.
As you have imported it with  you need to refer to all methods within that name space using . As such, you need to use  and .Alternatively, you could doThis would then allow you to use , etc without the need of the  prefix.
The  function is located inside the  module.  Meaning, you need to prefix it with  in order to access it:The same thing goes for with , , and any other names you use from the module.  You can read about this behavior in the docs:If no other name is specified, and the module being imported is a top level module, the moduleâ€™s name is bound in the local namespace as a reference to the imported moduleAs you can see, importing a module only makes the module available for use.  All of its contents (globals/functions/classes/etc.) are still retained inside module's namespace.Alternately, you could import the names you plan to use directly:Then, you do not need to prefix them with .  But I would only recommend doing this when you are using just a few names.  Importing dozens of names like this leads to ugly code and a cluttered global namespace.
