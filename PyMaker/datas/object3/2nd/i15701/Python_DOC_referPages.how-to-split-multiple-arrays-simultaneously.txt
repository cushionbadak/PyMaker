I have 3 lists, all of the same length. One of the lengths is a number representing a day, and the other two lists are data which correspond to that day, e.gWhat I need to do is to take  and  for day 1, perform operations on it, and then repeat the process for day 2, day 3, day 4 and so on.I currently have:This is supposed to append to the x array whilst the day stays the same, and then if it changes append all the data from the x array to the temp1 array, then clear the x array. It will then perform operations on temp1 and temp2. However, when I run this as a check (I'm aware that I'm not clearing temp1 and temp2 at any point), temp1 just fills with the full list of days and temp2 is empty.  I'm not sure why this is and am open to completely restarting if a better way is suggested!Thanks in advance.
Just zip the lists:    Not sure what your while loop is doing as it is outside the for loops and you don't actually return or use  and  so that code seems irrelevant and may well be the reason your code is not returning what you expect.
 and  are a good solution for this problem. It lets you group bits of sorted data together.  allows you to access the elements at each index of , , and  together as a tuple.  is just a function that tells  to group the tuple of elements by the first element in the tuple (the day value).
Another option is to use defaultdict and simply iterate over  adding data as we go:This creates two dicts like . Note that this solution doesn't require  to be sorted.
Running several threads is similar to running several different programs concurrently sharing the same data. You can call a thread for each array.Read more about threading on the threading documentation
