My problem at this time is, that I want to detect a keypress through the commandbut when I import  onkeypress and listen from turtle, a turtle window pops out, when I run my program. Do you know how to close it again, or how to not even let it appear?Thanks for hopefully coming answers, sorry for my bad english (I'm german and 13)
