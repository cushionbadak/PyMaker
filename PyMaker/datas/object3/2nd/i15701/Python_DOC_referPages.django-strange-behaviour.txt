I have a view in Django which calls external library/class. The problem is that for some reason Django keeps caching results coming from previous calls of that class.Please consider the following simple example:Django view:Demo class:You expect result to be [1, 2, 3], right ?WRONG!The first time a page is loaded you'll get the correct result. But on all following requests it will keep incrementing: [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]... [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3] ...So my question is obvious - what is going on here ?How do i receive [1, 2, 3] every time i call a class inside Django view ?Django 1.7 / MacOS X.
Define  in  as an instance attribute.If you print  in your code then you will get that  is assigning just once, is a mutable object, whenever you made an instance of the class it refer  to the same reference.In case of Immutable object:-Output:-
Why don't you try initializing the  inside your  method something like this ?
