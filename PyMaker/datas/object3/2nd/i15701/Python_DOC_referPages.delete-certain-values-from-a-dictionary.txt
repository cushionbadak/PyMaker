I want to delete the keys in my dictionary with the value of , but the only way I know of is to manually input keys to delete which is inefficient. Any ideas?I have a feeling I should use:For example, if I had the dictionaryhow would I delete the keys with a value of  so that I can print a dictionary purely of keys with values ?
You can use a dict comprehension to filter the dictionary:Note that you should use  if you are on Python 2.x to avoid creating an unnecessary list.
You could go though each of the items (the key value pair) in the dictionary to check the conflict and add value in new Dict.(here.. result) that not contain duplicate.
To create a new dictionary with the items which has the value greater than 1 use dict comprehension like below.
