Made changes to environment variables. This is my User Variable: Variable: PATH  Value: C:\Python34\Scripts;This is my System Variables: Variable: Path                               Value: C:\ProgramData\Oracle\Java\javapath;C:\Python34;C:\Python34\Scripts;The error that I get When I am trying to run it from command prompt.What else did I miss installing???EDIT: I moved to Python 2.x. While downloading Python from official website, I saw something like this: Windows x86 MSI program database (2.7.8) What does this exactly mean??
In Python 3.x,  is a function. (not a statement) You should call it as a function form.BTW, you don't need to append  at the end of the statement in Python.
It's not a problem with the install, it's a problem with version compatibility.In Python 3, the print statement changed, and it needs parenthesis like:. So you're trying to run Python 2 code with the Python 3interpreter. If you notice, you're error message doesn't say anything about anerror in your install at all.Here is some info on the differences between 2 and 3:https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3Edit: I saw you mentioned Beautiful Soup. From the Soup homepage:Beautiful Soup 3 works only under Python 2.x....Beautiful Soup 4 works on both Python 2 (2.6+) and Python 3.So you'll need Soup 4 or higher.
