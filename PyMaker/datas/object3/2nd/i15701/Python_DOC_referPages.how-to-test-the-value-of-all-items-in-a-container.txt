Let's say I have a container such as a dictionary or a list. What is the Python way to test if all of the values of the container are equal to a given value (such as )?My naive implementation is to just use a boolean flag like I was taught to do in C so the code could look something like.While this method works just fine, it just doesn't feel right given how wonderfully Python handles other common patterns. What is the proper way to do this? I thought perhaps that the builtin  function would do what I wanted but it only tests the values in a boolean context, I would like to compare against an arbitrary value.
You can still use  if you add in a generator expression:Or, with an arbitrary value:
