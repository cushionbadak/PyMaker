I'm wondering about the  function when used in a python Does range initialize the entire iter-able list before entering the loop or is it smart enough to generate the values as it increments?In other words if I say.  Will there be overhead from very large ranges like such?    
In Python 3, range produces an "immutable sequence" not a generator or iterator In Python 2, range generates a list Python 2 also has xrange to make an object which is an "opaque sequence" which has virtually no memory overhead but  is not available in Python 3.
This depends on the Python version:In Python 3,  is a generator-like object that produces values on demand.In Python 2,  creates a materialised list. If you want a generator-like object, use .
In case of any doubt, it is easy to check. In IDLE (e.g. using Python 3.3):
Yes! python initialize the entire iter-able list before entering the loop if  is used. But there is an easy way of overcoming this overhead using  which generate the values as it increments. This can be verified as:
