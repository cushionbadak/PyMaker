Natural Text
If I have a text file () in a directory named documents:How would I define a function named  that would count the number of entries that start with  in the file of above pathway and return this count with the syntax , in which the  is the counted number of entries?What I have so far:
There are a few things here:The name  is not visible outside of the function .  Consequentially, the  line will raise a  because Python will be unable to find .  However,  is returned by the function, which means that you can access its value by calling the function and then printing the result.You made  take an argument that is never used.  Is this supposed to be the path to the file?  I'm going to assume that it is, but you should remove it if not.Not a major problem, but you are not closing the file when you are done with it.  You should always manage and properly release the resources that your program aquires.  The easiest way to do this with files is to use a with-statement to open them, which will automatically close them for you.In all, your code should look something like the following:Also, there may be a fourth problem in that  will return the count of every  in the file.  But you said in your question that you only want to count the entries that start with .  You will need to fix this bug if so.
