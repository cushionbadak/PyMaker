Here is my code :What I want is this to return  but instead I get :I've read Python Descriptors examples and if I change my code to follow that it works - but why can't I do it on my class as it is? Is there any other way? EDIT : Thanks for the comments, I had not understand it very well. Could  solve my issue?What I want is that I am changing a string value into an Object, I want to treat this object as a string, with some extra attributes.
You can use your decriptor class as follows:When set as class attribute on another class and accessed via an instance of said class, then the  method of the descriptor is called. See the Descriptor How-To Guide.
