I'm using PyCharm with Python 3.7.  In my Python console, how do I reload a module that I've changed?  I created a file, "services.py" where I created a service class inAs I test this in the console, I can't seem to figure out how to reload it.  This is the error I getHow do I refer to my class to reload it?  (Or better yet, how do I get the console to automatically reload everything I've changed?)
 only imports the class into your namespace, so you have no reference to the module in the namespace.  From the importlib.reload docs:Reload a previously imported module. The argument must be a module object, so it must have been successfully imported before.So make sure to import the module if you want to reload later:This should work as well:
