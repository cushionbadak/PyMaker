Given the code below, can anyone explain to me what's different between  and ?
 is a list. The  index of a  will return the first item. E.g. is a string representation of a part of the  list (that's what  does, it returns a slice of the list, up to but not including the 4th item). Indexing the  element of a string will return the first character of the string, or .The reason that the indexing works on both the  type and the  type is that they are both sequences. See here and here.
