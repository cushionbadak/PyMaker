I've been using Python for a good period of time. I have never found out how built-in functions work. In different words, how are they included without having any module imported to use them? What if I want to add to them (locally)? This may seem naive. But, I haven't really found any answer that explains comprehensively how do we have built-in functions, global variables, etc., available to us when developing a script.In a nutshell, where do we include the builtins module?I have encountered this question. But it gives a partial answer to my question.
The not-implementation-details part of the answer is that the  module, or  in Python 2, provides access to the built-ins namespace. If you want to modify the built-ins (you usually shouldn't), setting attributes on  is how you'd go about it.The implementation details part of the answer is that Python keeps track of built-ins in multiple ways. For example, each frame object keeps track of the built-in namespace it's using, which may be different from other frames' built-in namespaces. You can access this through a frame's  attribute. When a  instruction fails to find a name in the frame's globals, it looks in the frame's builtins. There's also a  global variable in most global namespaces, but it's not directly used for built-in variable lookup; instead, it's used to initialize  in certain situations during frame object creation. There's also a  reference in the global , which is used as default builtins if there's no current frame object.
