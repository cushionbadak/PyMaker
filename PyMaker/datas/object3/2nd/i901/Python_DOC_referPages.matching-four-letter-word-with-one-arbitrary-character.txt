Since the site has no option to discuss the problem, I am asking for help here instead:For Input:Your Output is:
Your logic is actually pretty close. The only problem is that  is an integer, so the comparisons  will always be false. You would expect to get a match when , but , ever.The fix is to use  to index into , as it seems you intended:You will also want to loop in a way that doesn't run past the end of the string:A more robust solution would be to use regular expressions. The following pattern matches the strings you want:You can count occurrences using :
Reason behind your code not working is you are checking if an integer is equal to string in this line of code: .This line of code:  returns integer number from  to .What you need to do is check if the string of th position is equal to your desired stirng. like: This would be the correct version of your code in your logic:
You can use a list comprehension:
FindAll matches of the pattern int he list then get the count of the list and you will get the number of doge or dofe or any such
