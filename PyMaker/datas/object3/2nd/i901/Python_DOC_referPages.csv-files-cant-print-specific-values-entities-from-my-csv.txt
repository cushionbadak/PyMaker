For a game I am planning, I want to create a piece of code that will write one specific value from a list of all the items in my game into the player's inventory (e.g.: player gets item "potion", which would require searching the items CSV for potion and then putting the relevant info into the CSV). Whenever I run my code however I get the error "TypeError: '_io.TextIOWrapper' object is not subscriptable".I've tried researching and asking peers but the closest I've gotten to a clear solution is someone mentioning writing to a list from the CSV, but they didn't explain much more. Hoping someone could elaborate on this for me or provide an easier solution.
The problem is  is a file object returned by open and the statement  iterates over the lines of such file so, you are trying to use a  as index in that file. Also, you have to open  in write mode (using 'w' or 'a') to be able to write to it.Just use  instead of . The snippet below should do the job:So, the complete code could be:CodeI dont know what do you want to accomplish, so I tried to stick as much as possible to your code.If you want to only write the item provided by the user if it is found the current list of items, this would do the job:CodeI hope this can help you. Let me know if any of this worked for you, otherwise, tell me what went wrong.
