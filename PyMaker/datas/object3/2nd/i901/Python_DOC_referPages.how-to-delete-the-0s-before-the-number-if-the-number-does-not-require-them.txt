Natural Text
Im making a program that prints all possible mixtures of numbers from 0 to 9 and I want to delete the numbers that my code puts before the actual number if the output is less than 6 places.I`ve tried putting "" before 0 in every array, but it also puts random spaces in the output.So I want it to output lets say 895 and not 000895. It does taht until it reaches 100000, but thats logical.
Replace:By:
Although the following code helps you with a similar approach you took in your question I would suggest another way of achieving what you want:The above method is using the trick of converting individual numbers to strings, concatenating them with  string method and re-converting them to . With this,a string like  will be converted to . But a better way is to utilise  with the same trick:Here inside  I used list comprehension for brevity.
