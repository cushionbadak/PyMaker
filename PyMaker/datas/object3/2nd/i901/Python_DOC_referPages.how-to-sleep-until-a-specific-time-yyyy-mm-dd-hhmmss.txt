If you subtract one timestamp from another, then you get a :of course, you can put that in a function:You can check the return value: only if it slept, it returns True.BTW: it's OK, to use a date in the past as target. This will generate a negative number of seconds. Sleeping a negative value will just not sleep.if your time is a string, use this:or
You can use a  loop.
