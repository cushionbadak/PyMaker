This question already has an answer here:Multiple assignment and evaluation order in Python                    8 answers                I'm new to python so I want to ask you a question..Previously while I was writing a fibonacci function I tryed to replace with  Believing that it was the same thing but I noted that the output is different (and wrong)Shouldn't these two codes do the same thing?Here it is the full code:
when you do: will hold the previous value of b and  will hold  based on previous value.But when you do:Value of  is updated to  during  and hence  will have different result as  is now updated.For example, see simple code to swap two values. It is possible because of the on the fly change in values:
 is the same as  (a tuple). When you do  you implicilty assign the first element to the variable on the left and the second value to the variable on the right.In your replacement, you changed 's value before calculating , which didn't happen before.So, if we assume  and , we have:In your latter example, we'd have:
