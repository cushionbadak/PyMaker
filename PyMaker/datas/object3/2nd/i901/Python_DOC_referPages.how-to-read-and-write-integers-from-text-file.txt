This question already has an answer here:Write to a file from a list with integer Python                    3 answers                float values into a file.When I try with .write() it takes the input as a string.I guess it's really basic of Python but I'm new to it.Hope you guys will not get angry with this question :Dif I run this, I can get the result like below.It's the list of string, not the int values. (And also wonder why there is '\n' in the 'data' list!)
You probably have your  file formatted something like this:There's nothing in that file that remembers the value you inserted is an integer and since it is a text document () it isn't going to encode the numbers as such either. As for the , each number is on its own line meaning there has to be some character signifying a newline, hence the  newline character.If you look at this line in your code:you are explicitly writing the  after each number. If you want to read the numbers from the text file and have them be integers, you must explicitly convert the string value to its integer representation. You could rewrite that logic to:where it will map the  type onto each value of the list returned by  and then convert the  object to a  again. And, if you were wondering,  disregards whitespace (spaces and newlines) like you have in each line.
The  you see on the console is merely Python's default esentation of a string. If you want to write lines of data to a file and print a file line by line, you could do this (all I did was iterate over your list and print it one line at a time instead of printing the array):
The method readlines() reads until EOF using readline() and returns a list containing the lines.Open sample.txt with notepad o from prompt execute:
