Natural Text
Python's doc says:Both patterns and strings to be searched can be Unicode strings (str) as well as 8-bit strings (bytes).But I was wondering whether searching with  and  would always give the same result. I mean, whether this function returns true, for all valid  and :
answer: noexample: note that's an "en-dash" and not a hyphen — any non-ASCII character should have the same behaviour
The main difference is in classes.For example, U+00FF is , but is not an ASCII character. So  (Match "word character", or letters)(And other unicode letters would work too)If you look at https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html, you can see the three classes this applies to: For Unicode (str) patterns:Matches any Unicode decimal digit (that is, any character in Unicode character category [Nd]). This includes , and also many other digit characters. If the  flag is used only  is matched.For 8-bit (bytes) patterns:Matches characters considered whitespace in the ASCII character set; this is equivalent to . For Unicode (str) patterns:Matches Unicode whitespace characters (which includes , and also many other characters, for example the non-breaking spaces mandated by typography rules in many languages). If the  flag is used, only  is matched.  For 8-bit (bytes) patterns:Matches characters considered whitespace in the ASCII character set; this is equivalent to . For Unicode (str) patterns:Matches Unicode word characters; this includes most characters that can be part of a word in any language, as well as numbers and the underscore. If the  flag is used, only  is matched.For 8-bit (bytes) patterns:Matches characters considered alphanumeric in the ASCII character set; this is equivalent to . If the  flag is used, matches characters considered alphanumeric in the current locale and the underscore.So if you set the  flag, they should be mostly the same.For your exact function, an example would be:
