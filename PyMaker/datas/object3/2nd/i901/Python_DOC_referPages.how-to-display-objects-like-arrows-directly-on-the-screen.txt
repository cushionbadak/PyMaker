Is it possible in Python to draw objects (arrows, rectangles etc. of a specific color) directly on the screen (there should be possibility to click underneath this objects)? EDIT: I meant printing objects DIRECTLY on the screen, not in separate windows, like below (blue arrow on desktop) 
You can do this with the  statement.
You probably want to use TkInter, which is the standard GUI library within Python. A Hello, World! example is provided in the documentation. Of course, there are many other GUI libraries for Python (e.g. https://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming) for more specific or advanced purposes.
