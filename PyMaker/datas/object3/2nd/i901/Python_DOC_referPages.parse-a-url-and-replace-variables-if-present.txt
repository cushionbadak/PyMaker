I have URI's specified in an xls file. I want to read that xls file, get the URI from there, parse it, and replace variables (if present) with the corresponding values, and then make an API call to that URIFor example:(Where user_id is a variable, that has to be replaces by an appropriate value.)  is there an easy way to parse the URI and check if there's a variable present there, if yes, get the value of the variable and form a new string with the value and then use the URI to make an API call. Else use the URI as is.

Fortunately, Python has a built-in mechanism for handling this!
