Is anyone here familiar with Google Cloud Functions?  I read their documentation and based on that, I customized my script to try to work in their hosted environment.  https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/python-runtimeSo, my Python script looks like this.Also, my requirements.txt looks like this.My script has been working fine for the past 2+ months, but I need to run it on my laptop each day.  To get away from this manual process, I am trying to get this running on the cloud.  The problem is that I keep getting an erorr message that reads:  To me, it looks like no arguments are given and no arguments are expected, but somehow Google is saying 1 argument is given.  Can I modify my code slightly to get this to work, or somehow bypass this seemingly benign error?  Thanks.
The following takes your code and changes it to run in Google Cloud Functions using an HTTP trigger. You can then use Google Cloud Scheduler to call your function on schedule. You will also need to create a  with the modules that you need to import. See this document for more information.
You're misunderstanding how Cloud Functions works.  It doesn't let you simply run arbitrary scripts.  You write triggers that respond to HTTP requests, or when something changes in your Cloud project.  That doesn't seem to be what you're doing here.  Cloud Functions deployments don't use main().You might want to read the overview documentation to get an understanding of what Cloud Functions is used for.If you're trying to run something periodically, consider writing an HTTP trigger and have that invoked by some cron-like service at the rate you want.
