If no exception is raised, then ,  and  are undefined:Return:After the exception is raised somewhere, all these values are accessible.My question: is it safe to  these values?My Python version is UPD: More info. I'm writing a C app using Python C API. The user enters Python code line by line, and I use Python C API to execute it. After each call I want to check if exception happened (by getting ) and if yes, display it to the user (via ,  and ). After that I want to clean up ,  and  so later I can check again if they were recreated by some new exception and return this information to user again. Does it makes sense?
Yes, you can safely  those attributes.  However:After each call I want to check if exception happened ...In this case you should probably adjust your code to look directly at  instead.  The , , and  are just side-effects of an unhandled exception - and they are intended for use in an interactive session, not for flow control.There are legitimate use-cases for clearing the last exception info.  So much so, that Python 2 had a helper function for doing just that:From the docs:This function is only needed in only a few obscure situations. These include logging and error handling systems that report information on the last or current exception. This function can also be used to try to free resources and trigger object finalization, though no guarantee is made as to what objects will be freed, if any.It was removed in Python 3.0 library changes:https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html#library-changes
