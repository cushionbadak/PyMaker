I know this one is pretty duplicated however:I WANT TO use  dot function(syntax) to access variables declared in other functions like :should print out:Wouldn't it make things so much easier?And I know this can be done by using  or many other ways too.But why won't it work this way? Are there any 'must' reason(s) behind this way of access? Will it make Python vulnerable? or will it make python unstable? I wasn't able to find a perfect, concise, clear, accurate explanation for this accessing issue.Many Thanks.to be more accurate for @GoyoorI just feel it is more instinctive way of writing codes.Maybe it is just me.
A function (in your case a procedure since it does not return anything) is a treatment on data, not a data holder like an object or a structure. When you write b = func() you expect to get the result of func(). You don't have to know what happens in func. a in your function is an internal variable that might be garbage collected at the end of the function (no one referencing it) 
It's because you didn't say  in the  function, so you should do:
You are mistaking  with
