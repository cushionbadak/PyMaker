I often do this in python exception:This is helping me when I want the script to keep going but still tell me that there is error. But,  isn't as detail as if I let the exception raised. Is there any way to show the error more detail without raising the exception?
There are a number of ways to print traceback information.As mentioned in the comments, you can use the traceback module's print_exc functionIf you are using the logging module, the logging.exception function will automatically log the traceback as part of an ERROR level log message. If you prefer to log the traceback at a different log level, you can pass  to the log function to have the traceback logged.
