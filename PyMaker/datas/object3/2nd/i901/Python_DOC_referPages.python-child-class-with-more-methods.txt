I have a quick question about how to deal with an inheritance problem.Let's say we have a vehicle objectAnd then a truck that inherits from vehicleWe have lots of classes all with the same methods and properties e.g. bus, car, train. However, we also have an airplane which inherits from vehicle but only airplane has a new method called  Is it OK to only have it in the airplane class or should you also add it to the vehicle class with a default of ?
It's perfectly OK for a child class to define more methods than are available on the parent class. Indeed, this is the usual reason for creating a child class in the first place.Do not add a method with  onto the parent class unless you're trying to define an interface / abstract base class. This is almost never needed in Python, so if you're not sure what it means you can safely forget about it.
