I want this program to automatically check if a file exists or not. I want a way for it to always check the document folder of the current user.So like the target is always the current user that is logged in and I don't have to keep changing the code for different users and etc. I don't want to create multiple python files for different users/directories.User: MarcoMessageBox:'Please open the csv and then press ok. It will work after 5 seconds'User: JamesMessageBox: 'Please open the csv and then press ok. It will work after 5 seconds'
