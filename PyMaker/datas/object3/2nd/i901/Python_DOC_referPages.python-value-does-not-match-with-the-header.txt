Natural Text
I'm converting the CSV file into JSON in the following format.CSV file:Wrong result: Code:Expected Format: The  is header and the  suppose be value. As the result, you can see the value will duplicate for all the row and it doesn't match to the header. The second loop, the value will duplicate the  for all the header and so on. 
Maximilian Peters pointed out why your code isn't working in a comment. In general, I would avoid all that and build each dictionary manuallyThe  is necessary because the csv you posted has white space after each comma.
