I have two files: 'my_main.py' and 'my_functions.py'. I wrote two functions in 'my_functions.py', 'first_function' and 'second_function' and imported this module into 'my_main.py'. However, I then added a third function into 'my_functions.py' called 'third_function':I found that I could not import 'third_function' into 'my_main.py', getting an error - AttributeError: module 'my_functions' has no attribute 'third_function'. To understand this, in 'my_main.py' I then ran:and had as my output:For some reason 'my_functions.py' would not recognise any more functions after the initial two, meaning I couldn't then import 'third_function' into 'my_main.py'. How can I fix this?
Make sure you have saved your file my_functions.py before running my_main.py. Unless the file is saved, the update (addition of third_function) won't be recognized. Have been doing this for years, and still make this mistake constantly. Editing not enough. Need to edit and save. 
You need to explicitly reload the module if you've made changes since the last import. There is a built-in function for thisYou can reload your module as follows:See this answer for a much more detailed explanation.
