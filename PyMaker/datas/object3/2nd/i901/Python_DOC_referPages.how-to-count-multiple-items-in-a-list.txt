I have the following list:The data represents the Year, Month, Day, Day of week, count. I want to obtain a dictionary of the total counts per day of the week. Something like this I believe the best way to do this, please correct me if i'm wrong, is to use collections.Counter. I abandoned this effort for a dictionary comprehension but have been unable to solve the problem
Since you want to sum and not count it might be easier to use :If you insist on having zero entries you can instantiate it before:At this point you may use a normal dict over  if you are sure that the input will not have invalid days:
If, as in your input data, your  is sorted by day of week, i.e. all sublists for a particular day of week are adjacent to each other, you can use  with a dictionary comprehension:If your data is not sorted, you will have to sort by day of week first:
You can tackle this problem with a simple loop instead. Create a results dict with initial values for each day set to zero, and just add to it step  by step.
As you asked to use Counter from collections, you could use it like this:
