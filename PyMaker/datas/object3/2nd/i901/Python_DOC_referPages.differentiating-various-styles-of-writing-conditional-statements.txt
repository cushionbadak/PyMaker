Natural Text
I can't understand why some codes in Python are written with no indentation. Both functions do the same thing but why the first function which is  is_leap1 are writting in style with return only and no if statemnt? How did the first function return True and False without using if and else: ?output
Comparison operators such as , ,  , , , , etc, all return Boolean values naturally. Therefore, you do not need to use  statements to return  or  when using these operators. You can test this trivially yourself:The official documentation makes this explicit:Comparisons yield boolean values:  or .
In the first function Logical operators are used which output True or False.Since the condition year % 4==0 and (year %100 !=0 or year %400==0) is written using Logical AND, OR, these functions will compute the value and produce the value True or False, which is then finally returned using the return keyword from the function
