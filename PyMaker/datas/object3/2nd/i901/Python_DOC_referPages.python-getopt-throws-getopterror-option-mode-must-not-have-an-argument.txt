GetOpt seems doesn't work when I specify a command line option, throws exception, this file named o.py:Then I get runtime exception when:File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/getopt.py", line 159, in do_longs    raise GetoptError('option --%s must not have an argument' % opt, opt)getopt.GetoptError: option --mode must not have an argumentSo where did I get wrong and how to fix it?
Your long option names are missing a trailing . See docs, namely:longopts, if specified, must be a list of strings with the names of the long options which should be supported. The leading '--' characters should not be included in the option name. Long options which require an argument should be followed by an equal sign ('=')...I.e.
