I'm new to using API endpoints in python. How can I access dynamodb table in aws using self created API endpoint (url)?I have access key and security key of aws, and the x-api-key of the endpoint url.I'm able to post the details to dynamodb with postman tool using above given details, but I want to run this in a Python script. Please answer with a sample example, if possible. Thank you.
If you want to access dynamodb VIA the rest endpoints you'll need to sign your requests with your credentials. You're in luck because they have examples how to sign your requests with pythonhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4-signed-request-examples.html
