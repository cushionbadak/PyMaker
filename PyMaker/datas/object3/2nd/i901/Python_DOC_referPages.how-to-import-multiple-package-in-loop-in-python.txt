I am trying to import many files. I have a list (myList) of strings that are the names of the files of the modules that I want to import. All of the files which I want to import are in a directory called parentDirectory. This directory is in the folder that this code is in. What I have so far is:This code just treats moduleToImport as a module's name, but I want the code to understand that it is a variable for a string.
If you want the same effect as  , then one way to do it would be to import the module using  , and then use  function to get the global namespace and add the imported module using the same name there.Code -Then later on you can use -Example/Demo -
