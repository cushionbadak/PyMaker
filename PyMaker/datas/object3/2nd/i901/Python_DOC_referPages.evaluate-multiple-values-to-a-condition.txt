I have a bunch of variables that I need to verify whether they are within a determined range.Below is a quick example to demonstrate what I want to achieve.I expect it to print yes but it prints no. What I'm I doing wrong?
What am I doing wrong? is a set of three values. It's not a value between 0 and 6.The condition  actually produces an exception in Python 3, because it doesn't make sense to ask if a set is more or less than a number. If your code prints , then you're probably using Python 2.If you want to check if a condition holds for every value in some sequence, you can use the built-in function .
With Python 3.x, for integers you can use  with :For non-integers or Python 2.x, you can use chained operations:The problem with your logic is Python does not implement vectorised operations with comparison operators.
