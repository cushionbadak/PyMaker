In a python list, I want to delete all elements repeated less than 'k'.for example if k == 3 then if our list is:then the output must be:what is a fast way to do that (my data is large), any good pythonic suggestion? this is what I coded but I don't think it is the fastest and most pythonic way:
You can use  to construct a dictionary mapping values to counts. Then use a list comprehension to filter for counts larger than a specified value.
A brute-force option would be to get the number of occurrences per item, then filter that output. The  object works nicely here:Under the hood,  acts as a dictionary, which you can build yourself like so:
I would use a Counter from collections:
Any drawback with this option?
