I have an input file that I am trying to build a data base from.  Each line looks like this: And so on.  The first string is an actor\actress, and then movies they played in.  The data isn't sorted and they are some trailing whitespaces.  I would like to create a dictionary that would look like this:  The key would be the movie, the values should be the actors in it, unified in a set data type.  It doesn't work... it doesn't solve the issue that when a key already exists then the actor should be unified in a set with the prev actor  Instead I end up with:  
Output:This will loop through the data and assign the first value of each line to  and the rest to  (see here for an example of how  unpacks tuples). Then for all the movies, it uses .get to check if it’s in the database yet, returning the list if it is and an empty list if it isn’t. Then it adds the new actor to the list.Another way to do this would be to use a defaultdict:which automatically assigns  if the key does not exist.
