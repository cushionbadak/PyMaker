Natural Text
I have a list l.  I have a dictionary d.  I want to iterate over l. For any list-item, I want to iterate over the d.keys.If some condition is met, I would like to 'update' my dictionary.  I have naively tried to nest two for-loops and put in an if-statement -- One cannot change the length of the object one is iterating over.  This is the output I get:
You should not change the size of a dictionary while iterating over a view of that dictionary. You can, instead, construct a new dictionary and then print whatever you like. For example:As described in the docs:The objects returned by ,  and   are view objects. They provide a dynamic view on the  dictionaryâ€™s entries, which means that when the dictionary changes,  the view reflects these changes....  Iterating views while adding or deleting entries in the dictionary may  raise a RuntimeError or fail to iterate over all entries.
Instead of looping over  you could loop over a copy.
