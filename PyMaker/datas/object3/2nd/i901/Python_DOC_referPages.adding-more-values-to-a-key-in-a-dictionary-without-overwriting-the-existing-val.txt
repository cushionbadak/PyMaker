I am creating a bingo game where the user is guessing on five numbers and the computer takes out ten random numbers between 1-26.The part I am having trouble with is that when the user have guessed, the numbers have been compared and added to the dictionary. If I then play the "game" once more it overwrites the last rounds points (which I want to keep).  is a list that contains the dictionaries.cpu_random is the computer's randomly generated numbers. is where the compared points is stored.-edit-I forgot to mention is that there is more dicts in the list players so that i can add more players to the game.
With  you're correct_guess variable turns into a set object due to the curly braces. You could then operate with this object according to PythonDocs Set Types. That's not what you want. Like suggested try to work with a list with append or use an integer if only the current points are important, this would be for example:See also 'PythonDocs Data Structures'Suggestion: Try to get familiar with a good IDE like PyCharm, set a BreakPoint to  and see where you going wrong (you will be able to see the state of all variables/objects simultaneously.
