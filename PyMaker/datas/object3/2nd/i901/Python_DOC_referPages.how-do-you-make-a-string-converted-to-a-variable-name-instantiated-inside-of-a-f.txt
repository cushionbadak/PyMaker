Sorry for that confusing title, in my function my parameter is the name I want I want to set as a global variable name. I can do this outside of a function, and I can instantiate a global variable without a string as its name, and I haven't found any other articles with a solution to both problems at the same time.

Using , like so (notice that  is unknown before the call to ):This produces  as one would expect, see a demo on ideone.com.So, in your case just go forQuestion remains: why would you want to do that? Don't clutter your global namespace with variables only a class/function needs.
