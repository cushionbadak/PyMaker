Natural Text
I'm new to Python and BeautifulSoup4 I'm trying to extract (only) the textual content of all tags that are either 'div','p','li' and only from the immediate node, not the child nodes - hence the two options These are my attempts:and Both of these give me no output, do you know what I'm doing wrong?EDIT - adding more code and a sample doc that I'm testing with,  is empty
From your Question and comments on the previous answer I think you are trying to find the innermost tagsthat are either 'p' or 'li' or 'div'Should contain some textSample of the output
You can iterate over your tags, then apply  on each tag:Which prints out each ,  and  tag on the HTML page. You can also set  to traverse the document recursively and extract all nested child tags. If you don't want these nested children, keep .You can also use  instead, which is faster than . You can see the differences in this answer. This might be beneficial if the HTML document is very big.
