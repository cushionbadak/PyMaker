I'm following along with the videos for Interactive Python's course on data structures and algorithms.  In one segement the following piece of code appears. It's to demonstrate a example of O(n**2) complexity.It's supposed to loop through the range starting from 1000, and ending at 10000. But I have no idea why 100000 is given to the randrange function in the list comprehension on line 2. Thanks in advance!Note: i'm following along with this course - http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/AlgorithmAnalysis/BigONotation.html
This is a time trial, testing how fast  is. That's best done with randomised data, to avoid pathological cases. The list comprehension produces the test data. The  is just an upper bound for the random values in that list, high enough to ensure that even for a list with 10k integers there is a nice spread of values.Note that it is better to use the  module to execute time trials.
