Natural Text
I am new to python and I want to replace same substring occurrences of a particular string with different substrings by using python. I already tried the .replace() function of python, but it replaces all the occurrences with the new substring. Example for the question is below.string = "I am a student as well as a teacher"Here I want to replace the substring "as" with "xas" and "yas" by adding extra character to the substring. The final result should be "I am a student xas well yas a teacher"Code that I have tried:
