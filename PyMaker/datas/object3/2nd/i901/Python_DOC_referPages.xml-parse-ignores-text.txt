Natural Text
I have the following issue, trying to get information from a bunch of xml files in python. I'm not doing anything special, eg:This works with most of the info I have - but one section of the xml is in the following format:The above code gives  - I can locate the  element and the  element, though. I just can't find the text. If I edit the file to remove  then the above code returns the text I need.Is there something very basic that I don't know which would allow me to access the text without modifying all my xml files to remove the label? (It is relevant). Thank you!
From [Python 3]: xml.etree.ElementTree.Element.text (emphasis is mine):These attributes can be used to hold additional data associated with the element. Their values are usually strings but may be any application-specific object. If the element is created from an XML file, the text attribute holds either the text between the element’s start tag and its first child or end tag, or , and the tail attribute holds either the text between the element’s end tag and the next tag, or ....To collect the inner text of an element, see itertext(), for example .I created 3 files, based on your specification:file0.xml:file1.xml:file2.xml:and some sample code.code.py:The algorithm is straightforward: if the node doesn't have the text attribute set, iterate over its  and pick the last value, as the label (or any other) sub node comes before the text.Output:
