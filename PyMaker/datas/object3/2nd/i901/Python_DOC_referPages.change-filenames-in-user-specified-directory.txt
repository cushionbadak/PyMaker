I have this little script that changes characters from the beginning of filenames in the directory script is ran in. I would like to let the user input the directory to change files in. Im not sure how to implement that.
From the documentation:os.listdir(path='.') Return a list containing the names of the entries  in the directory given by path.Hence just change  to a string containing the path of the directory.For example, from command-line, you can do: can be both absolute or relative path.EDITI forgot to say: as mentioned also here  needs the full path of the file if they are in a different directory.Something like this should work, if  is the full path:If not, you should build the full path.
