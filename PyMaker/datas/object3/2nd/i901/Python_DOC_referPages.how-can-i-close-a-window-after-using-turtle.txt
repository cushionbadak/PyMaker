I am trying to use Turtle in Spyder and Jupyter but I am having trouble when I try to close the window.I am using Python 3.7 on Spyder 3.3.1 and Jupyter 5.6.0, on Windows 10This is what I have triedI works fine, but if I close the window and try to run the same code again, I get the following error:I have tried multiple combinations of , and  but I cannot make it work
Here is an excerpt from the turtle documentation:If the value “using_IDLE” in the configuration dictionary is False (default value), also enter mainloop. Remark: If IDLE with the -n switch (no subprocess) is used, this value should be set to True in turtle.cfg. In this case IDLE’s own mainloop is active also for the client script.Thus, you can add  to  file to solve this issue. This will prevent  to enter the mainloop.
