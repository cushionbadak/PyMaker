I have two lists  and I would like to sum these to give me the following: .This was done by doing , ,  and .I understand that  would do this, but it would fill the mismatch in length with  at the end, giving me  and not the value I want.I would like the mismatch in length to be solved by filling the first length with zero.
The built-in  function could be used to do it like this:
You can pad the second list with zeros and use :Output:
You could build a shift by using repeat, then concatenate the shift with the shorter one using chain:Output
You can use the  function to generate the two lists in reverse order so that  would align the zipping from the other end, and then reverse the result afterwards:This outputs:
You could go around this problem be reversing your lists befor ing with .and finally, reverse again, to produce the desired result:The main advantage of this method as @CoryKramer says in his comment is that you do not have to know beforehand which list is the longest.
