I have a project in Pythonlike with a structure like belwo:Actualy, I would like to dispatch the development of module1 to a seprate person and he can work it on Git repo, Can I use the module1 each time from a git repo, Shoud I write a requirements.txt in my project?
I believe @aws_apprentice's comment was suggesting that you could build module1 as a proper python package by writing a setup.py for it, then install that as a dependency of Mypkg.  But during early development you can just put one git repo in another and .gitignore it.then to update module1 from changes the other person pushed to git,
