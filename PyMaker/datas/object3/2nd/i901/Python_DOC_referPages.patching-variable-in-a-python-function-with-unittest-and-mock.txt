I have the following my_func.py with create_config function.*my_func.pyI tried the following approach to mock env.host variable where env is an import from fabric.state.*test.pyI am getting import error with 'env'. What is the best way to mock variable within a function with python mock.
mock variable ?get the type of  first is instance variable of a class, the mock is a little different, mock_env is object(AttributeDict), the assignment of instance_variable host is direct assignment, not with a return_value
From the unittest.mock documentation on patch (note  is the first argument of ):target should be a string in the form 'package.module.ClassName'. The  target is imported and the specified object replaced with the new  object, so the target must be importable from the environment you are  calling patch() from. The target is imported when the decorated  function is executed, not at decoration time.So you need to include the full path to the function you are patching. Note also in where to patch that the target should be the path to where the function/object is used, not where it is defined.So changing your  call to:should fix the .
