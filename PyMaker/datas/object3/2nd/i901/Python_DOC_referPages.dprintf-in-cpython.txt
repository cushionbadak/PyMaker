I want to check the log printed by  in Cpython such as this one, but there is only one parameter for  here, how to check those logs? Thanks a lot for your help. 
If you've got a release version of Python, the s are stripped, and there is no logging by these statements. It is not possible to see the output from them. is a macro that is actually only defined in . The definition isi.e. if  is set and , then the log is printed using , to standard output. For this you would need a debug build of Python. Iff you have a debug build, the value of  can be controlled with the environment variable :i.e. the variable must be present for the variable set to a value of , and if set to for example 9, this would enable both  and .
I think you need to recompile Python to see those. When configuring, give the  option. It should come out on standard out. You may also need to set the environment variable PYTHONTHREADDEBUG to 1, but that shouldn't be nessesary.https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#debug-mode-variables
