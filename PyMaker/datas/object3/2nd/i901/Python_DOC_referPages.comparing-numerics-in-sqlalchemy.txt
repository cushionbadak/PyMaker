I want to store non-integer numbers in my database, and be able to compare them in order to spot duplicates. Obviously, the comparison should be done to within a preset number of decimals (say, 2). So my question in a nutshell: What is the most efficient way to do this?My first attempt was to store them as Numeric, in SQLAlchemy that would be:and then do the comparison as Now, this failed, the condition seems to turn out false if I input y as a float.Can I fix the above approach?If not, what is the cleanest way to do what I want? (What is the tradeoff between fast and clean here?) Do I have to resort to converting my data to strings or integers? Or work with inequalities..?
I think I solved it. It seems that the numbers will be compared as strings, so I should convert my reference value to a string before comparing:
