I am trying to figure out how to list out all the standard library functions/methods (still learning the difference, I'm a noob). So I get how to import a module and use dir() and help(). These have been a great help and when I try to rewrite a program I learned to write and I get lost I try to use the dir() and help() to spark my memory.However, for example, I was re-looking through some code and I had .replace() and I was scouring through my imported modules to find it and then found out it's in the standard library and a sub-part of the str() function. Is there something I can type into dir() that will spit out str()?How can I print out all top level built in function/methods like I would when I do dir(re)?I've tried re-wording this question in search engines several ways and I can't find anything and the results get muddied with "python list _____".Thanks so much!
Is there something I can type into dir() that will spit out str()? on a value of that type.
Ah, I never tried typing just "dir()" that listed I could put in dir(__builtins__) and that is what I was looking for. I'll leave it here in case someone else is a noob too and knows where they can start. Just start with dir() and go down the rabbit hole!
