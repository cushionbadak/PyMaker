I would just store each row in a dictionary:Then you can access each row like this:UPDATE:As requested in the comments, if you file has a semicolon  as a delimiter, you can use the csv library:
Just use  to transform list of string to list of ints and append in the output list
You can use   function for reading CSV file. Afterwards you will have a  object. Using  you will get the list of all rows as lists.
Python:  Output:  
If you would want to make later mathematical operations on your data, you might consider using  module for that, you can use  function (remember that  files are in fact plain text files).Usage example: is file I created, it contain 2 rows each with 3 valuesThen you can create numpy array following way: is name of file,  is information that you wants integers and  means that values in file are space-separated. You can access values in numpy array by giving index of row and index of elementIf you want to get  of values simply pass  into
