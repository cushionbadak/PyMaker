I know python is a high level language and manages the memory allocation etc. on its own user/developer doesn't need to worry much unlike other languages like c, c++ etc.but is there a way through will we can write some value in a particular memory address in pythoni know about id() which if hex type casted can give hexadecimal location but how can we write at a location. 
To begin with, as noted in the comments, it's quite a question why you would want to do such a thing at all. You should consider carefully whether there is any alternative.Having said that, it is quite easy to do so via extensions. Python itself is built so that it is easy to extend it via C or C++. It's even easier doing it via Cython.The following sketches how to build a Python-callable function taking integers  and . It will write the value  to the memory address whose numeric address is . Note Once again, note, this is a technical answer only. The entire operation, and parts of it, are questionable, and you should consider what you're trying to achieve.Create a file , with the content:Create a file , with the content:Create a file , with the content:Finally, create , with the content:I hope you use this answer for learning purposes only.
Python itself does not include any facilities to allow the programmer direct access to memory. This means that sadly (or happily, depending on your outlook) the answer to your question is "no".
I can't advise how but I do know (one) why.  Direct writing to registers allows one to set up a particular microcontroller.  For example, configuring ports or peripherals.  This is normally done in C (closer to hardware) but it would be a nice feature if you wanted to use Python for other reasons.
