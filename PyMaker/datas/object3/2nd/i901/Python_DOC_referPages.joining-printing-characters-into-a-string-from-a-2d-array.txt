Might be a simple fix but I've tried everything. I'm trying to join and print the values from my 2d array in a single string without each character being separated if not separated by an actual space. For example what my code does now "H E L L O W O R L D" instead of "HELLO WORLD". Can someone please help.
You can use a list comprejesions:Or justas @Tomothy32 noted.Here an expressionwhich creates a string from a row, for example:Almost the same for the outer loop which iterates the row, but it joins the strings with a whitespaces: Or you can do it step-by-step, but it's not so clear:I don't know how to do that easily without comprehensions. Probably you should use it.EditHow it works: Python iterastes trough the outer level first, i.e.will print something like that:each row is a list (in this case). So, we can iterate through it, using inner loop (list comprehension):( just cahnges newline to the empty string). Now you can change print to the  method and get what you want.How iterate columns? Well, it's not so easy, especially when lengths of the strings are different. If the length is equal, you could use dollowing comprehension (answered here):But probably it's easier to generate you data already transposed. There are some tutorials about a comprehensions, you can read it, for example, this one. Comprehensions is a very useful tool.
