I am trying to create a code that as fast as possible can update a large number of pandas values at the same time based on the values of an ID column. The code I am using atm insert multiple rows at the same time base on an ID_column, but cannot insert multiple columns + rows at the same time.The below code is a simplied example which updates 2 columns (value1 and value2) based on the value of column name ID.The code I ideally would use would work something like this:Meaning both column value1 and column value2 would be updated at the same time Is this doable?
You can construct a single NumPy array via  and then assign to multiple columns:Alternatively, you can  your input lists:
You can also use dictionary to enter columns corresponding to their updates.
