Natural Text
In my path  are several files with this character , , ...I want to seperate the  part without path and .Im newbie so I tried first with full namebut I got only the "*.pdf" as a text. What is wrong with the path oder placeholder * ?EditI got 2019-01-18_RG-Telekom[] from orign ReT_march - I want 2019-01-18_RG-Telekom_march (text after underlining)   xx is a folder here is the whole code:
Use glob,  don't know how to process masks, but  works:Output of the glob:Apply  to this list and extract basenames, as it shown above.EditIf  in the path  is just a folder name, not a mask, you should use following expression:because  is expression which masks a folder name and it's unnecessary that case.
