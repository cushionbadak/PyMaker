I am not sure what I am trying to do would be called so I am finding it difficult to find the answer to the following...I am deleting the contents of a number of tkinter entry widgets.I have four lines that look like I could replace with one line using a loop.I tried ... but I do not know how to feed the value in...Below is my code - I apologise for stupidity of this question
You can make this work by changing your loop iterable to a tuple of these four entries:Since you don't want to create this tuple every time, let's move it into object initialization:And then you can simplify this a bit further into:You can then use loops in the form of last example elsewhere in your class code.Since you removed the previous identifiers for the entries, you would need to change your code to use the new tuple wherever they were used. That is, change references of  to ,  to  and so on.
You could solve this creating the attribute name as a string and using , ie:But really when you find yourself using a "var1", "var2" (...) "varX" naming scheme you probably really want a list instead.
You can use  like that:See this part of the doc.
You can get the variable names using a string.
