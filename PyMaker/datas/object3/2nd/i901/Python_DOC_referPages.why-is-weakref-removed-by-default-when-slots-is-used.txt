I think the main purpose of  is to save the memory usage by allowing to specify properties explicitly, instead of using  allowing dynamic property assignment on the instances. So I somehow understand why  is removed by default when using . But why does it meanwhile remove  by default?Reference: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#slots
I can't read minds, but I suspect the rationale goes like this:If  wasn't disabled by default when using , providing a way to save the associated memory explicitly would require yet another special opt-out mechanismMore special cases add complexity to the language, and this one would provide no real benefitGiven how infrequently weak references are used at all, it was probably deemed simpler to simpler have it disabled by default, with the option to opt back in.Diving to implementation details, in a sense, unslotted user-defined classes have precisely two "slots" (one for , one for ) over and above the base object header, so having  say "Replace the default with this explicit list" makes it natural to remove both  and  when  comes into play.
