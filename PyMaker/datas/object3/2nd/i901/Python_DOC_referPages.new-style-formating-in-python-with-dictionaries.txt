Natural Text
I'm learning python and I don't understand something about the 'new style' of formatting. Here is my code:but when I type in the console:So why in the formatted string, 0[n] without quotes was able to read from the dictionary the value with the key 'n' (in this case the key is a string) but when I've tried this in the console, it didn't worked.Also, what would happen if the key is not a string?Thanks
 is a string that is interpreted by the method . The Python parser does not care about the content of that string, and  can use any notation, regardless of what is valid in Python and what is not. is not a string, it is a Python expression. When Python parses it, it attempts to resolve  as a variable, which, in your case, does not exist. Your attempt would work if you executed  before the lookup.
