Given a function (e.g. ) which takes many keyword arguments, how do I know which arguments have default values, and what exactly are the default values?To give full context, I'm using the boto3 AWS Python API:For example, the  function takes an argument , but I want to know whether it has a default value. I looked around in the inspect module but wasn't did not find anything useful.The documentation of  is at https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/ec2.html#EC2.ServiceResource.create_instances
 should normally give you everything you need. Align  and  on the right side. For example:As @9769953 says, if a parameter is bundled in , it is processed by the function's code, and is thus not found in the function signature.
