Natural Text
I want to remove the text that appears in the console to be removed after it was typed in, I need it to be removedso it will say in the console, "Insert word:(word that they inserted)" So then in the console after they have entered the word it would get deleted
If you are on Windows you can use: Alternatively if you are in Linux / OS X: 
Normally you don't have full control over the end-user's terminal--your program simply sends text to standard output, and once it has been printed, it's under the control of the user's operating system or terminal emulator, so you can't take it back. There are three possible approaches though which might correspond to what you're trying to do.The first option would be to simply clear the screen. This doesn't technically "delete" what they entered, because they could still scroll up and see the text, but at least it will no longer be immediately visible on the screen.The second option would be to treat this as a password field. This would suppress the text from ever being echoed at all, so when the person starts typing, nothing appears on screen, but you still receive input.You can use  to change the default prompt ().Finally, if neither of those two methods work for you, I would recommend using the  module. This is a more complicated process, but it will achieve exactly what you want to do. The code below simply displays a string, then when the user presses enter will erase the string, and then when you press enter again it ends the program. Please check the curses Python manual page for more details on how to use .
You can do it via terminal code.For windows you dofor Linux you doAnd you just have to call clear()
You can use an echo-free input function such as  to remove the need to delete the user input:Output:
