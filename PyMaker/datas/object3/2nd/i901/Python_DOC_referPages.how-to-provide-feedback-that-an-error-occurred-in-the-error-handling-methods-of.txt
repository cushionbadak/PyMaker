I am working with a class in python that is part of a bigger program. The class is calling different methods. If there is an error in one of the method I would like code to keep running after, but after the program is finished, I want to be able to see which methods had potential errors in them. Below is roughly how I am structuring it at the moment, and this solution doesn't scale very well with more methods. Is there a better way to provide feedback (after the  code has been fully run) as to which of the method had a potential error?
Although you could use  to retrieve information about an  when one occurs as I mentioned in a comment, doing so may not be required since Python's standard / mechanism seems adequate.Below is a runnable example showing how to do so in order to provide "feedback" later about the execution of several methods of a . This approach uses a decorator function, so should scale well since the same decorator can be applied to as many of the class' methods as desired.Output:
