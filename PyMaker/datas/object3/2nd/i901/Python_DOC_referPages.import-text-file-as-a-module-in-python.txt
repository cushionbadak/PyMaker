Natural Text
I want to import a plain text file, no matter the extension cause I want to use my own, as a module in python.For example. I have the strings for my program in separated .py files, and, depending on what language is selected, I import one file or the other.Everything works well with this, but, I want to make this file, apparently not readable for a common user, so, I want to give them a custom extension that any of the programs installed can't read.But, due that  only work with .py files, I want to know if there is a way to do this with other file types.Or if is it another way to do something like this.Thank you.
