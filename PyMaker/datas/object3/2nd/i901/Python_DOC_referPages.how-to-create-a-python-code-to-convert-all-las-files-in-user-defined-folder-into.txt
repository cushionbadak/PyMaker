I have to convert  files in one directory to  files using  function. Currently I can do that in command prompt but I want to do it using Python: is it possible? Here's the link which i referred https://lasio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/exporting.htmlOpen CMD   switch to the folder having las files using " cd   las2excelbulk -r -i The file would be converted.
The argument to  can only be a single filename, but you can use the  and  modules in the Python standard library to step through all .las files recursively. is the equivalent of .It may also be useful to inspect the code behind the  command line tool for more information.
