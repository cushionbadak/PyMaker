I am launching a pyspark script with the command  redirecting the standard output to file too with  to have a log.The command is the following:The problem is that only the  inside user defined function  got printed only on the Terminal but not to the file  while all the the other prints will both write to terminal and file.To simulate this behaviour I created this minimal complete working example:In this case the string  got printed only on terminal but not to file.How can make output generated inside a pyspark UDF redirected to file too?EDITTo explain better my problem I add the line . This one will be printed to terminal and logged to file while the  inside udf only to terminal.
Edit: sorry misread the already redirectingA solution is to use proper logging instead of printing: lookup python logging: https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.htmlhttps://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.htmlExample to log to console and file:
