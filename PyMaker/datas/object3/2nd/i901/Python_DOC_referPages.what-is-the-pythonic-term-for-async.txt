Natural Text
I found the keyword  in some Python programs. It was being used just before  while defining a function . I needed to know the grammatical term for  (and for  too) and other such keywords in its leagues. It seems like some "modifier" like  in C++. So what is the pythonic term for that?
The PEP calls  a "statement qualifier": keyword is a statement qualifier. A good analogy to it are "static",  "public", "unsafe" keywords from other languages.
