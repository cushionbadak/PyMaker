I am trying to send temperature data over onto one of my website currently online. This code consists of measuring the temperature through a sensor(ds18b20), sending that data onto a mysql databse entitled temp_pi and specifically onto a table intitled TAB_CLASSROOM and lastly sending that data onto a webpage of mine. Everything in this code runs except for the  part. I specify the error right before this particular line. I have the PHP set up on my website for this to work.
If you want to send requests using , you need to ]create a pool manager](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide.html#making-requests) first.Alternatively, you could use the HTTP client in the Python standard library.  Its  function is called . Depending on what you are trying to do, the  package might also be an option, but it has certain disadvantages when it comes to certificate management for HTTPS URLs (the built-in client will automatically use the system certificate store).
