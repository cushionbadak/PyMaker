Started with simple Tkinter lessons, I'm stuck in the case even that simple code doesn't work:...And can't find the reason why, considering that this code is from official documentation.On the other hand, another code works:I have tried to update  from conda: , but nothing change. Can't figure out why.
The only way I was able to reproduce your error is by building the code directly in the IDLE Shell and closing the root window that pops up before creating the button.That said it is very odd to write a GUI in the Shell like this. If you do not close the tkinter window the code works fine. However GUI development should be done in the editor in a  file and ran all at once. Simple fix is to not close the root window before everything else in the GUI has been added.Proper fix is to build you GUI in a  file and then run it.I am not sure why you are saying that the editor is not working for you. When I copy your exact code it works fine on my end:All that said you really do not need to build your code in the Python IDLE. It would be much better to use something like PyCharm or Eclipse/PyDev. Those are my Go to IDE tools.One thing to note about Python's IDLE is it will not run code from the editor until you have saved the  file.Though not 100% required in the Python IDLE the  is a requirement for tkinter to work properly. Outside of Python's IDLE most other IDE environments requite the  so it is good practice to always include it.
I think you forgot to add  at the end.
