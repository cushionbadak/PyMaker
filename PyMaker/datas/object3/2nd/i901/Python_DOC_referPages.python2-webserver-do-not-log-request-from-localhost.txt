The following Python2 webserver will log every single request including the one from localhost (127.0.0.1).webserver.pyAs example;  (from the same machine) will produce the following log.My question: Would it be possible to make an exception for local request? I don't want to log any request from localhost/127.0.0.1.I'm thinking something like this but not really sure how to implement it in Python2 yet.webserver_v2_do_not_log_localhost.pyAny idea on the scripts would be highly appreciated. ThanksDesired Output when performing  (external IP only, not localhost)
