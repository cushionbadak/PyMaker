I'm trying to create a pattern in python. I need to have all the pages of a set of links (called "subjects_links"): ex. I've www.url/animal (with www.url/animal/page/1 ecc.) and www.url/plants (with www.url/plants/page/1 ecc).I've done this:but gives me an "invalid syntax" error. Is it not possible to use %d and += together?EditI've found a solution using while and parsing with beautifulsoup:This changes totally the way of doing it, but at least it works.
Since python 3.8, you'll be able to use the assignment expression. n += 1 is am assignment statement. 
  is an augmented-assignment-statement and you are trying to use it as an expression.The following does work:Note: I've modified the example so it can run on it's own
You should increase n separately as you are setting the value for n by doing  which it is basically . You could use n++ in other languages but I'm not sure that Python supports it.
