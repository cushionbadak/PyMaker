I try to read an email from a file, like this:and I get this error:The file contains a multipart email, where the part is encoded in UTF-8.  The file's content or encoding might be broken, but I have to handle it anyway.  How can I read the file, even if it has Unicode errors?  I cannot find the policy object  and there seems to be no way to handle an exception and let Python continue right where the exception occured.What can I do?
I can't test on your message, so I don't know if this will actually work, but you can do the string decoding yourself:That's going to get you a lot of replacement characters if the message isn't actually in UTF-8. But if it's got  in it, UTF-8 is my guess.
To parse an email message in Python 3 without unicode errors, read the file in binary mode and use the  (or ) method to parse the content (see the documentation of the email.parser module).Here is code that parses a message in a way that is compatible with Python 2 and 3:(tested with Python 2.7.13 and Python 3.6.0)
I doubt it is the best way to handle this ... but its at least a way ...
A method which works on python 3, which finds finds the encoding and reloads with the correct one.I have tried with , but it sometimes answers  while another encoding is available, hence the slightly involved encoding detection
