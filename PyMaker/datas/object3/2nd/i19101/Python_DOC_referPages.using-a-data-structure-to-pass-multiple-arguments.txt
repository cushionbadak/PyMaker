Is it possible to use a single data structure to pass into a function with multiple arguments? I'd like to do something like the following but it doesn't appear to work.Is it possible to do something like the following:instead of:What is the pythonic way of doing this?
What you want is:See Unpacking Argument Lists in the tutorial for detailsâ€¦ but there really isn't much more to it than this.For completeness, the reference documentation is in Calls:If the syntax  appears in the function call,  must evaluate to an iterable. Elements from this iterable are treated as if they were additional positional arguments; if there are positional arguments x1, ..., xN, and  evaluates to a sequence y1, ..., yM, this is equivalent to a call with M+N positional arguments x1, ..., xN, y1, ..., yM.
