I'm attempting to combine a few PDF files into a single PDF file using Python. I've tried both PyPDF and PyPDF2 - on some files, they both throw this same error:PdfReadError: EOF marker not foundHere's my code (page_files) is a list of PDF file paths to combine:I've read a few StackOverflow threads on the topic, but none contain a solution that works. If you've successfully combined PDF files using Python, I'd love to hear how. Thanks!
