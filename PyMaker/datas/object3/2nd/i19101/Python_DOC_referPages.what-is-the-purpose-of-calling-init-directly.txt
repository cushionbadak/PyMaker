I am having a hard time figuring out the purpose some code that I've come across. The code has a class , which has an  method that takes multiple arguments. From what I've learned of Python so far, by calling , it will pass this string as a parameter to  (which I think is supposed to be the equivalent of a constructor). But the issue I am having is that the code I am looking at is calling  directly. What is the purpose of this? I almost feel that I am missing some other purpose behind .
The  method gets called for you when you instantiate a class.  However, the  method in a parent class doesn't get called automatically, so need you to call it directly if you want to extend its functionality:Note, the above call can also be written using super:The purpose of the  method is to initialize the class.  It is usually responsible for populating the instance variables.  Because of this, you want to have  get called for all classes in the class hierarchy.
Python allows you to call the constructor () directly. By calling , you're doing an initialization/reinitialization of See this code:
Yes - when inheriting class invokes  of the parent class. AFAIK, this is the only valid case of calling  explicitly.
