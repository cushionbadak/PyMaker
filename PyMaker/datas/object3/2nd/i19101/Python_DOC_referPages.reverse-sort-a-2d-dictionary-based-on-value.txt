I have a 2d dictionary where my data looks like:So lets say I have this data in 2d dict..What I want is to reverse sort k2 for each k1 based on valueSo for above.. what i am hoping to get after this operation is:and so on..How do i achive the above in python 
This reverse-sorts on  for each , which is what your question asks for:If you also want to forward-sort on :If you want to reverse-sort on  instead of  (as your title asks for):Some explanation:You can call  on any sequence to get a sorted version of it. You can pass  to almost any sorting-related function to sort it in reverse, and  to specify a function that generates a sorting key from each value. See the Sorting HOW TO for details.(The  function given above only works for Python 2.x. In 3.x, you can use . Or you can just use .)And you can get a sequence of key-value pairs out of any mapping by calling its  method. In Python 3.x, this gives you a nice efficient view; in 2.x, it copies the pairs into a .Finally, keep in mind that a  has no inherent order.
The point of a dict is that it is unordered. If you want to create a new list of the values from your dict, and have those values sorted, that's a different thing. But you're not going to get a dictionary that has been sorted (unless you make yourself a sorted dict, which isn't actually that hard).
