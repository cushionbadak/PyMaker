Currently, I'm working on a Python program that returns the word that occurs most times in however many lines of input, with the last line being the string "###".Now, the main problem I have is the EOF error I get in the body of the while loop.  As far as I can tell, the reason behind this is that it continually calls for a new line of input, but it gets none.  I do not know how to rectify this.  Any help with the rest of the program would be appreciated as well.
Don't use  to read data, use  instead:This will read lines from the  file handle until closed, without throwing EOF exceptions. The loop body won't execute at all if  starts closed.
Using  as suggested by Martijn Pieters is the way to go here, but for completeness here is how you could continue to use .  You just need to catch the  exception and exit the loop:
