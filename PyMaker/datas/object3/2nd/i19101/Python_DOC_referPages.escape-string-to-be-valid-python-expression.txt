My question is simple. Lets assume you have string in python like this .What is the correct way to convert it to valid python expression like  (so you just simply can copy&paste it to python interpreter and it'll work)?I thought of , but there's gotta be better solution.
You can use the  codec; this produces a  instance: expliticly produces valid python string literals:Produce a string that is suitable as Unicode literal in Python source codeTo go back to Unicode, simply decode from ASCII:Alternatively, use :Return a string containing a printable representation of an object. For many types, this function makes an attempt to return a string that would yield an object with the same value when passed to , otherwise the representation is a string enclosed in angle brackets that contains the name of the type of the object together with additional information often including the name and address of the object.The output of  of a string can be pasted straight back into a Python interpreter without additional formatting.Note that  and  only escape quotes when absolutely necessary. Only when both styles of quoting, single and double, are present does one of these get escaped:
Thatâ€™s exactly what  is meant to do:
