I have tried googling this with no success, but I am trying to read in a file and find the length of each string. Each string is a set of numbers (i.e. 012345). I use the len() function and it works but it is adding 1 more to every line except the last line. I am assuming it is counting the eol/return character. How do I fix this? Thanks
You can strip the whitespace:Example: docs
You could trim the whitespace off each line that you read. You can use the strip (strips extra whitespace off both left and right sides), or rstrip function (strips off whitespace from the right hand side) for this.The rstrip() function can also take in arguments, if you want to strip, say, only newline characters.
Have you tried using Python's string replace function? It would go something like this:
