Natural Text
I have a text, in uncode, that I'd like to encode in latin-1. Some characters cannot be encoded. If I use encode with the "replace" parameter, I get the question tag character, but, is there a way to call a custom function to replace the character?For example, I'd like to convert all the possible characters to latin-1, and call  on the unencodable characters. Is that possible?
