In php, unpack() has the "*" flag which means "repeat this format until the end of input". For example, this prints 97, 98, 99Is there something like this in python? Of course, I can dobut I'm wondering if there is a better way.
There is no such facility built into , but it is possible to define such a function:
In Python 3.4 and later, you can use the new function .Iteratively unpack from the buffer buffer according to the format string fmt. This function returns an iterator which will read equally-sized chunks from the buffer until all its contents have been consumed. The bufferâ€™s size in bytes must be a multiple of the size required by the format, as reflected by calcsize().  Each iteration yields a tuple as specified by the format string.Let's say we want to unpack the array  with the repeating format string  (2 characters followed by a single character, repeat until done). With , you can do the following:If you want to un-nest this result, you can do so with .Of course, you could just employ a nested comprehension to do the same thing.
