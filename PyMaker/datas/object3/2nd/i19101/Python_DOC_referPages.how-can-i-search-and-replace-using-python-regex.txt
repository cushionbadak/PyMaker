You're looking for re.sub callbacks:This way you avoid 1) loops, 2) replacing already processed content.
You can try to use re.sub inside a loop that iterates over myarray.items(). However, you'll have to do backslash first since otherwise that might replace things incorrectly. You also need to make sure that "{" and "}" happen first, so that you don't mix up the matching. Since dictionaries are unordered I suggest you use list of tuples instead:
I'd suggest you to use raw literal syntax () for better readability of the code.For the case of your array you may want just to use  function instead of .The code is a modification of @tigger's answer.
to escape metacharacters, use raw string and backslashes
