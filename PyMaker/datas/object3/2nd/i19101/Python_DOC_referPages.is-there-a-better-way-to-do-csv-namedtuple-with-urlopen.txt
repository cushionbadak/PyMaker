Using the namedtuple documentation example as my template in Python 3.3, I have the following code to download a csv and turn it into a series of namedtuple subclass instances:This raises the following exception:I know that the issue is that urlopen is returning bytes and not strings and that I need to decode the output at some point. Here's how I'm doing it now, using StringIO:This smells funny because I'm basically iterating over the bytes buffer, decoding, rebuffering, then iterating over the new string buffer. Is there a more Pythonic way to do this without two iterations? 
Use  to decode the  response:Now  is passed the exact same interface that it would get when opening a regular file on the filesystem in text mode.With this change your example URL works for me on Python 3.3.1:The last lines appear to yield empty tuples; the original indeed has lines with nothing more than a comma on them.
