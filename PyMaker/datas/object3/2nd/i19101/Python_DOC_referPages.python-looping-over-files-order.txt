Does anyone know how Python arranges files when looping over them?I need to loop over some files in a folder in a fixed order (preferably alphanumerically according to the filenames), but Python seems to loop over them in a rather random order.So far I am using this code:and the filenames are printed in an order not really obvious to me.Is there any simple way to predefine a certain order for that loop?Thanks!
As far as I can see in the docs,  has no defined order. Given this, the easiest way to be sure is to sort the list returned to you:This will just sort as strings - which gives the simple fixed order you were looking for. If you need a specific order, then  takes  as a keyword argument, which is a function that gives sort order. See the documentation (linked previously) for more.
It's an alternative..(considering that  takes no parameter for ordering items, i just presented an alternative to  which is, .. It takes parameters that could be useful and I think that the downvotes are unfair but hey everyone's entitled to their opinion -.-)
