I'm trying to have a function where I can put in a list and a pointer, and have it apply that pointer to the objects in the list to give me the object with the lowest value of that pointer.Then I could do things like (assuming I have lists of these objects)  and have it check the area of each rectangle. Or maybe something more complex like .I'm going to want to use this in a few places around my program.Thanks in advance, guys!
