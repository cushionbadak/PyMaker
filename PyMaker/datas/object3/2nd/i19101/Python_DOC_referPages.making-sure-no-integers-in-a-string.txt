I have a simple question. I'm just wanting to know how I would have my program read the "input()" and see if there are integers or any kind of number in the string, and if so then print out a message saying so. Pretty much I just want to know how I would make sure that no one enters in a number for their name. Thanks!
Use the  method on strings, together with the  function: returns  for any string that consists only of digits. This includes any Unicode character that is marked as a numeric digit or numeric decimal. loops over the sequence you pass in and returns  as soon as it finds the first element that is , and  if all elements are .Demo:
see if there are integers or any kind of number in the stringreturns  for strings such as "123", "123.45", "abc123".
Depending on the strings, regular expressions might actually be faster:My results are:(Note that the regular expression engine wins even in the case specifically designed for  to be fastest).  however, with longer strings, I'm willing to bet that  will eventually be faster.
