I have a  file with a list of packages that are required for my virtual environment. Is it possible to find out whether all the packages mentioned in the file are present. If some packages are missing, how to find out which are the missing packages?
The pythonic way of doing it is via the  API. The requirements are written in a format understood by setuptools. E.g:The example code:
You can run  to see what you have installed and compare it to your  file.If you want to install missing modules you can run  and that will install any missing modules and tell you at the end which ones were missing and installed.
Based on the answer by Zaur, assuming you indeed use a  file, you may want a unit test, perhaps in , that confirms the availability of packages.This approach uses a subtest to independently confirm each requirement. This is useful so that all failures are documented.
You can create a virtualenv with access to the system site packages and test check whether the package (or another dependencies) are installed or not. This way the packages are not really installed (if you just want to check). An example using virtualenv wrapper would be: 
If requirements.txt is like :Then the following script will tell you which modules are missing :This would print :
