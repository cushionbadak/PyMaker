What you need is  function.So, having that, you'll have the following program:Here  reads a string from the user and  converts it to integer value. To have 3 values we have an generator expression  and  takes maximum out of the values generated.Or, if you don't need any command-line input from the user, you might just use it as it is: .

list= [[456, 700, 200]print "Max value element : ", max(list);output : Max value element :  700
