I need to create two classes for a program that takes in input variable for a book, title, author, number of pages and looks to see if it's checked out and then adds books to a dictionary in the following format . Then I need to print al of my information in a main function in this format: ""title author pages checkedOut." I basically need to print out the return value of my  function in my classes. Here is my code:It seems like something is wrong with the for loop in my  function in the class Library (the idea is that I want the loop to iterate over ever book in the collection) but I'm not sure what the problem is. Here is the error message that I get:
You are looping over the keys of a dictionary, you should not try to pass in a key in the loop statement:It is unclear what you are trying to do with that loop. You are then accessing  without doing anything with the return value, then you are replacing the value with  (which doesn't exist on , that is still the library), then you return something completely different as the  result.I think you want to create a list of your library books here:Now you return a comma-separated list of all titles and authors in your collection.There are 3 things going on there:Using a generator expression, we loop over the dictionary  method; this generates  pairs for everything in the dictionary.Each key and value is passed to the  method, using the string as a template to put a  dash between the title and author pairs stored in your  dictionary.The whole loop is passed to the  method; this method takes all the strings from the sequence given to it and concatenates them together with  commas between them.Next, you are creating an empty library, then print the output of the  method; there is no need to call that explicitly,  does that for you. Do not create a new library, just print the one you already have:
