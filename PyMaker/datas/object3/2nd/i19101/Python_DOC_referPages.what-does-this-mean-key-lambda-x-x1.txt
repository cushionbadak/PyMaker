I see it used in sorting, but what do the individual components of this line of code actually mean?What's , what is , why  in  etc...Examples
 effectively creates an inline function.  For example, you can rewrite this example:Using a named function:In this case,  will return the element in that array whose second element () is larger than all of the other elements' second elements.  Another way of phrasing it is as the function call implies: return the max element, using  as the key.
 signifies an anonymous function. In this case, this function takes the single argument  and returns  (i.e. the item at index 1 in ). Now,  sorts  based on the value of  as applied to each element of the list. Similarly,  returns the maximum value of  with respect to whatever is returned by  for each element. I should also point out that this particular function is already included in one of the libraries: . Specifically,  is equivalent to your .
This is the function.And here x is the list, in which we are adding  i.e 2nd element of list to the sort function. So, basically we are adding every list's 2nd element (i.e x[1]) to the sort function.I hope you understand this.
From a reference for Python 3.7 (https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html), The key is a parameter of  and . The first built-in function modifies a list in place while the latter accepts and return iterable.The key parameter can be defined as a function to be called on each element of list/iterable before comparison and sort, respectively. In this case, the inline function  is defined as a value of the key parameter. The lambda function takes input x return x[1] which is the second element of x. SupposedCan you guess what the result? mylistSort is then [[1,2,3], [2,5,6], [7,8]] from the sorted sequence of [8,2,5] which is [2,5,8]. The  in your example is applied to just get the max value from the outcome of the sort function. I hope this post is helpful.
