I am using Python's built-in sets to hold objects of a class I have defined. For this class, I defined , , and  so that I can compare objects by my custom comparison functions. That works just fine, until I find out that I actually need two sets of comparison functions, which will be used in different ways at different times in my code.I can't define two sets of , etc. methods in my class, and Python's built-in set type does not accept a comparator argument. I suppose I could go write a wrapper class around set, but that seems like a lot more work than necessary.Is there any easier solution to this than writing my own set class?
Let's say you have this class:Now, you want to put these in a set, but keyed by  instead of . You can't do that as-is, because a set expects its elements to have a consistent meaning for equality—and also a consistent meaning for hash such that  always implies . So, create a wrapper:And you can put those in a set:For example, let's say you want to uniquify your thingies, keeping exactly one thingy (arbitrarily) for each  value. Just wrap them, stick the the wrappers in a set, then unwrap them and stick the unwrappees in a list:This is part of a more general Python pattern called "DSU". This stands for "decorate-sort-undecorate", which is wildly inaccurate nowadays, since you almost never need it for sorting-related tasks in modern Python… but historically it made sense. Feel free to call it "decorate-process-undecorate" in hopes that it will catch on, but don't hope too hard.The reason you don't need DSU for sorting nowadays is that most sorting functions all take  functions as arguments. In fact, even for uniquifying, the  function in the  recipes takes a . But if you look at what it does under the covers, it's basically DSU:(The fact that it's a generator rather than a list-building function means it can "undecorate on the fly", which makes things a bit simpler. But otherwise, same idea.)
