I'm experimenting with multiprocessing module and copying example codes from this page. Here is one example:After running this code I get:Somehow I've find that this is due to  keyword. However this code is also using  and it is running:When I want to run mentioned example I have to modify it following way:The output then looks like this:Why I get an error when using  keyword, are those codes (with and try-catch) equivalents? I'm using python 2.7.10.
You have wrongly assumed that the multiprocessor Pool class of Python 2.7 returns a context manager. Instead it returns a List of worker processes. The Pool was converted to a context manager object from Python 3.4.3 and if your version predates that, you cannot use it with a context manager.To use with the with statement, the expression should return an object with enter and exit methods so you get the familiar error.
This PEP describes the context manager interface which is needed for using the 'with' keyword. Python 2.7's version of the Pool class does not support this interface so you cannot use the 'with' keyword in the way you described. You can just rewrite the code to not use with and join/terminate the Pool directly as in the example here or you can upgrade to Python 3 which does support 'with' for Pools.
