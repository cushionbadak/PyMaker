Why does print(squared) return 0 instead of 100?I thought that after being returned from the function - the value of the variable squared would be assigned to the the global variable with the same name?returns:
Assign the result of the function to the variable:This is the whole point of using  in the function, isn't it?
The function  never changes the variable  that is found in the global scope. Inside the function you declare a local variable with the same name as the global variable, this however will change the local variable and not the global variable. Then when you  you are printing that unchanged global variable which is still 0 as you initially set it. As a matter of code cleanliness you really should try to avoid having local variables and global variables sharing the same name as it causes confusion (as we have seen in this question) and makes the code much harder to read.To change the global variable from within a function you must tell Python to do so by using the  keyword to make the name refer to the global variable. You might want to look at this question: Use of "global" keyword in PythonThe easier and better option of course is just to use the return value of the function. Minimizing the use of global mutable state is a good goal.
Essentially what is happening here is you are creating a local variable in the square function.  To change squared, simply type:
Sort of. Your very close. You need to change the following:To:Hope this helps!
