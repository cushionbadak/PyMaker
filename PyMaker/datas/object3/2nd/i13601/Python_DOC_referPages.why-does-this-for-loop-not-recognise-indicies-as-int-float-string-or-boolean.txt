Here is a short piece of code which is meant to check what data type a certain variable is, the return says , followed by , , . Could somebody tell me what is wrong with this code and how I could do a process such as this more efficiently?
You have to compare the type with the word in the list and not it's type. Also note that  excludes the second argument, and hence you need to do  or  which is better.A better way is to use Return true if the object argument is an instance of the classinfo argument, or of a (direct, indirect or virtual) subclass thereof.You can change your code as,As  returns a boolean value, you can directly do
You don't want to do .   already contains types.  If you take the type of a type, you get .Just do .Even better is to do it this way:This has the added advantage of comparing all the types in the list, not just the first 3.Why you want to do this is another question.
Elements of  are classes (types) and  returns  for each of those. There're no types in , thus  will always evaluate to .This should work:You could also do this using  and :
