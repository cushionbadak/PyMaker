Natural Text
I have a text file list with both letters and integers. Eg,I want to display the list sorted highest to lowest in terms of the integers, so I used:But I keep receiving this error: I know it's because of the list function I used, however without it, I get this: 
Calling  on an  will return each character separately. See:For what you're trying to do, I would recommend splitting the string up using some other method. In this example I use  followed by  See here for more details: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.splitAlternatively you could build a dictionary yourself by looping over the characters, but that seems like a bit too much work for me anyway.Edit: I should mention that once you have a way of looking at the data properly, sorting isn't too hard. Lets say, using my example up there, you manage to loop over the data and store it as list of lists, ie:You could alternatively use a lambda function but this is easier to understand. The key argument is essential here, because it allows the sorted function to see what it's trying to sort. It'll iterate over scores and call the key as a function every iteration.Perhaps consider implementing your own sort algorithm, you'll probably learn a lot.
