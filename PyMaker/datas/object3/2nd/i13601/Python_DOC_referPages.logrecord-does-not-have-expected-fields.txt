In Python using the "logging" module, the documentation promises that LogRecord instances will have a number of attributes, which are explicitly listed in the documentation.However, it appears that this is not always true. When I do not use the logging module's 'basicConfig()' method, the program below shows that the attributes 'asctime' and 'message' are not present in the LogRecords that are passed to the LogHandler's 'emit' method.Running this on Python 3 gives:What is going on here? Did I misunderstand the documentation? What needs to be done to make sure that the LogRecord instances have the 'asctime' and 'message' attributes as promised?
It is responsibility of the  to set  and  so prior to calling , those attributes are undefined. From the doc of the  method:The recordâ€™s attribute dictionary is used as the operand to a string  formatting operation. Returns the resulting string. Before formatting  the dictionary, a couple of preparatory steps are carried out. The  message attribute of the record is computed using msg % args. If the  formatting string contains '(asctime)', formatTime() is called to  format the event time.Since your example code does not call  it is therefore expected behaviour that those attributes are undefined.To have  and  set, you must first call  inside the  method.
