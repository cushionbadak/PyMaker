Natural Text
Looking for some advice for text formatting. I am trying to print the results of a simple unit conversion (imperial to metric) but keep getting all these spaces when trying to print the double apostrophe symbol.Code:When I run the program I get:I'm trying to eliminate that space between the 9 and the double apostrophe.
Use formatting for the whole string:or you could tell the  function to not use spaces as separator:The default for the  argument is , a space, but you can set it to an empty string.Note that the backslash at the end of the first line is not needed at all since the  parentheses form a logical line already.Personally, I'd use the  method for the string template here; it is a more flexible and powerful method for interpolating values into a string:I also used single quotes to form the string literal, so that the embedded  doesn't have to use a backslash either.Demo:

You could use the '+' operator:
The easiest way to fix that is just do two string formats.
The other answers work (and the real issue is the comma-separated args to ), but I'd also recommend formatting with  since the  string formatting can sometimes cause problems (and eventually is going away?):https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/stdtypes.html#old-string-formattingAnother note, you can use single quotes  for your format string and then you don't have to escape the double quote .For example:Output is:For all your fun options with  see:https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/string.html#format-specification-mini-language
This is not an escaping problem. This happens because you devided print's arguments with comma, which does writing to stdout in blocks and appending space instead of new line.Like this:To avoid this you have to use one string instead of all you used.Add them together using "+" operator. Convert ints and floats to str() before and all will be fine:But much better solution would be to use formating as this:You can avoid even escaping by using single quotes:
