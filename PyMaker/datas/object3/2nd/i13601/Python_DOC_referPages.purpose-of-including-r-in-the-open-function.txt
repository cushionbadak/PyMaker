What is the difference between:...and:To my understanding, the second argument  for the  is essentially telling the system to read the file after opening it, which seems to me that it should make  redundant but if I attempt to print temp  in the second example, I end up with something similar to: So what was the point of specifying 'r' in the first place if it doesn't seem to do anything in these instances?
Opening and reading files are different operations. A file is opened as a first step in reading from it or writing to it. By default, the  call accesses the file in read mode. Specifying  as the second argument is just explicitly doing the same thing. (Specifying  opens the file in write mode.)Once the file is open, it can be read in one big chunk (such as your code does), a line at a time, a byte at a time or more complex schemes using different read operations.
There are three different things here:the mode in which you open the filethe operation you perform on the fileimplicit arguments sent via default parametersYour statement:To my understanding, the second argument 'r' for the open() is essentially telling the system to read the file after opening itis not quite correct. The  indicates that you wish to open the file in read mode; it does not read anything in itself. You can also read a file that is opened in other modes, incidentally.The  function takes a mode string with a default value of , so omitting this parameter yields the same thing.
