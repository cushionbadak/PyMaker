Natural Text
I'm trying to write a python script using BeautifulSoup that crawls through a webpage http://tbc-python.fossee.in/completed-books/ and collects necessary data from it. Basically it has to fetch all the  present in the chapters of all the books to a text file . There are around 273 books. The script written is doing the task well. I am using bandwidth with good speed. But the code takes much time to scrape through all the books. Please help me to optimize the python script with necessary tweaks, maybe use of functions, etc. Thanks

I have tried to break up the code and represented it using functions.Any suggestions to improvise the code again? How to dump the errors fetched from the website into a new html file with a table format having the details of the books and chapters that contains errors.Below is the updated code:
