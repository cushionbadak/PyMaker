I have the following codeIs it possible to calculate the data for the functions at the same time, instead of one after another?
you can use multiprocessing or threadingthreading in python doesnt actually run in parallel but allow you to run the functions at the same time (and python will iterate them, doing a few lines from each at a time)with multiprocessing they WILL run in parallel (assuming you have multiple cpu cores) but they wont share memory.here is a sample with multiprocessingyou can read more about it here:https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.htmlhttps://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock
My favorite way is using concurrent.futures which is a standard Python library (version 3.2 and above or available as a separate package for Python 2.7):This will run concurrently ,  and , passing  and  to each one. It will then print sequentially all the results as soon as they're available.
You can thread functions like that
Consider above:if you were to do this:you will end up waiting for 5 seconds, before you see however, if you utilize multiprocessing, you can spawn multiple processes to run the function at the same time.
