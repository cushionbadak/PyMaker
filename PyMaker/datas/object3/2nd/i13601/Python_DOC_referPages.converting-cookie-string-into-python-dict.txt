In Fiddler, I captured an HTTPS request with the following cookie string sent from the client (visible in Inspectors > Raw):I'd like to use this cookie in a Python Requests request. (I modified the cookie slightly, so that it can't be used by readers for nefarious purposes!).However, Requests appears to use a dictionary format for sending cookies, and I'm having trouble converting the above string/blob into a dictionary format.My question is:Is there an automated way to convert a string (like the cookie I captured in Fiddler) into a dictionary in Python?
You should be able to use  which is available in the standard Python library:If you are using Python 2, you will have to import from  instead of .Docs:https://docs.python.org/2/library/cookie.htmlhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/http.cookies.html
