I have the following code and want to turn a string from a file into a dictionary (to be read in and manipulated). In the following code, on execution, it comes up with an error: 'people is not defined'. Have I not defined this correctly or is the syntax wrong? This is Python 3
I am not sure what your end intention for your script is, but the following might be helpful. Python has a built in  module that can automatically read each line of your file in as a list of columns. Furthermore, it has a CSV  variation which might be more useful to you. This takes the first row in your CSV file and uses the header to automatically create a dictionary for each row as it is read in. If your file does not contain a header row, a list of suitable  can be provided. By using this feature, you do not need to create your dictionary.The following shows you how you could create a  dictionary. The key being the  for each of your rows. I remove the  key from  as it then becomes the key used by :So, if  contained the following entries:You would see the following output:If your file does not have a header row, the following line could be changed:
As you can see from the comments the indention is wrong, but I guess this comes from the paste here on SO and is not the issue in your actual code.But you two other issues in your code.  will fail when executed because  is not a valid key for your dictionary here. The only valid keys in your code are , ,  and . Therefore you can use  or . Then you could use  to avoid newlines in your data.
