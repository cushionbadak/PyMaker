I am using Python 3.4, to write a unicode string to a file.After the file is written, if I open and see, it is totally a different set of characters.CODE:-OUTPUT:-Thanks in advance
You need to specify the codec to use when reading as well:otherwise your system default is used; see the  function documentation:encoding is the name of the encoding used to decode or encode the file. This should only be used in text mode. The default encoding is platform dependent (whatever  returns), but any encoding supported by Python can be used. Judging by the output you got, your system is using Windows Codepage 1252 as the default:By using the wrong codec when reading, you created what is called a Mojibake.Note that the  line in your writing example is entirely redundant; the return value of that call is ignored, and it is the  call that takes care of the actual encoding. The  call is also entirely redundant, since the  statement already takes care of closing your file. The following would produce the correct output:
