I am trying to find the sum of the squares of the first 10 numbers.1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385 But my program will not allow the line . Can you help me fix this?
To do this in a for loop, you'd need to add to your b variable each time through that for loop, like so:You can also use python's list comprehensions to do this in one line, and skip the for loop:
 does not work like this. This function accept an iterable and compute the sum of each elements.This is why you have to set your  loop inside the , and this is called a "generator expression".
The sum function takes a sequence as an argument.  You don't need a loop if you use it.  Also, the exponentiation operator in python is ** not ^, so the you can say
