I have written a code to check any birthday input's validity. As I am new in programming, after several debugging steps, the code became very ugly. Here is the code:This code is very much inefficient. What can be your kind suggestion to improve the code? Thanks in advance.
First of all, use the same conventions everywhere! Don't use single quotations, then double quotations for no reason. The same applies for tabs vs spaces, although it's preferable to use tabs for indentation and spaces for alignment. And what's on with , , and then ; is that  needed? No, and it only provides naming inconsistencies.Secondly, in  there's a lot of unneeded code (ahem...  even if  is an integer?).Thirdly, you're being too monolithic! Get a little more modular and don't let  use globals for everything. Use arguments/parameters instead. And never return values by global scope, and, if they're boolean, don't use strings/integers to hold them! This can introduce very subtle bugs.Fourtly,  are useless outside of , so they shall go there, and should be named  after all... And, of topping,  is badly designed. It should map month names to integers, not to shorter month names! And, of course,  is in complete disorder.Fifthly, to avoid too much indentation, use operators such as  and  in  statements, instead of comparing a single expression as per indentation level.Sixtly, don't repeat yourself all the time!So, given this and a lot of other subtle stuff, the code may look like this:
