I have created a ThreadPool using Concurrent.Futures module.I have created threads and everything worked fine.But now i have a function which i want to make it parallel with threads,the problem is i need the return value of the function each thread should run and not sure how to get it when using the futures threadPool module.is there a way?
Your understanding of  is absolutely wrong. From doc:result(timeout=None)Return the value returned by the call. If the call hasn’t yet completed then this method will wait up to timeout  seconds. If the call hasn’t completed in timeout seconds, then a  TimeoutError will be raised. timeout can be an int or float. If  timeout is not specified or None, there is no limit to the wait time.If the future is cancelled before completing then CancelledError will  be raised.It is very clear that  will give you the result of that function you submit.
