I want to define a function,  that .For example, when I call  should return the ...Because:The function  needs to use a for loop to carry out this summation, and it will have to use a sum variable that increases in value over each iteration of the for loop.I have a working function that does not use a for loop, but I need to know how to use a for loop to accomplish this as well.Here is the working program:How do I use a "for" loop to accomplish this?Am I right in assuming the  should be nested in the  function?I have tried many times to do this using a for loop and I keep getting a ...Here is my code:
By Output:You can also use list Comprehension:Output:You can also use a mathematical series formula: 
you can even do it without a loop:if you insist on using a loop:but the mathematical solution is simply:(there are  elements with an average value of ; this will always be an integer since either  or  is even; the proof by induction is often the first example when math students learn about induction...).
You will get an error with sum(1, 2, 3, 4)TypeError: sum expected at most 2 arguments, got 4so the func will need to gather elements into a tuple, e.g.use * with your parameter to gather the caller's args into a tuple. * enabbles any-number of args to be supplied by caller and they are converted into a tuple parameter.produces the expected answers.
