I'm very new to python. I'm having trouble evaluating a function in an if statement. Some very simple code here:When I try and run the code I get: Not sure what's going on here. Could someone please give me some pointers to what I might be doing wrong?
 is a list of strings. The first string is the name of the script, so what you want is to take the second string and turn it into an .
 is a list of strings, where the first element is the script path itself, and the elements after that are the arguments you passed into the program in command line. If you wanted to pass in the number in command line and take it in your program, you should use -Also, you should convert it to int if you are expecting it as an integer.Explanation -
You have passed the  to your function, the  is a list of command line arguments passed to a Python script which its first item is the script name and from the rest of arguments are the custom argument passed to script, so in this case you need to pass the integer of  to your function (if you have passed one argument in command line).sys.argvThe list of command line arguments passed to a Python script. argv[0] is the script name (it is operating system dependent whether this is a full pathname or not). If the command was executed using the -c command line option to the interpreter, argv[0] is set to the string '-c'. If no script name was passed to the Python interpreter, argv[0] is the empty string.So you can simply do :Not that if you want to pass multiple argument in command line you need to get the items from second index to end :
I think you have to change one line in your code Then it will work.
when you call  it return a list where first element is the script name and remaining elements will be the user passed inputModification:output:
