The  method will help.int.from_bytes(bytes, byteorder, *, signed=False) -> intReturn the integer represented by the given array of bytes....If byteorder is 'little', the most  significant byte is at the end of the byte array.  It will convert bytes to integer:Then you can use or to get hexadecimal representation.Other solutions include and :Some timings for :For : is (predictably) fast for small byte strings,  is fast for longer byte strings.
