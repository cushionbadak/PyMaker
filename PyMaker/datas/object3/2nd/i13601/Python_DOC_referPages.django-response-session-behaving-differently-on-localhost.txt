I have the following lines in a Django (v1.8) application. is being passed to the template like this:On both my localhost and my server  is showing as nothing when rendered in the template by . This is to be expected, it's not there on the first load.However on the localhost this causes the  to apparently evaluate to false, because the message is not shown. This makes sense to me, and since it worked testing on the localhost I assumed it was defined behavior.On the server (AWS) though  seems to evaluate to true. The message is displayed. This also makes sense to me, because maybe  is considered less than anything. It confuses me though, because it behaves one way on local server and another on a remote server.What could cause this difference?
Are you on Python 2 on local, and Python 3 on the server? The way None is evaluated changed:https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html#ordering-comparisons
