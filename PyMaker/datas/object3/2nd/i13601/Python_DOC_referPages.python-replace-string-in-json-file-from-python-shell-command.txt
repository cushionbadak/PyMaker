Natural Text
I'm new to python and what I'm trying to do is replace text/string in a json file, from a python os shell command.  I'm somewhat getting the results I'm looking for, but it's appending extra whitespace/creating a new line in the json file.  This is basically what I'm trying to accomplish:I have a static json file (add.json)I'm running two OS shell commands within python, and storing that output into separate text files.I then want to take the values in those two txt files, and replace thetwo strings in a json file.Below is what I currently have (to make it simple I've replaced the true aws cli commands with simple commands)And this is the result that it's yielding:As you can see, after Name and Value, it indeed replaces the values, but adds a new line and produces invalid json.This is the file I'm replacing the values in:Thank you in advance for any answers.  I know what I have above is very dirty, and I'm sure there must be a better/cleaner way of accomplishing what I'm trying to do, but ultimately I know we all have to start somewhere and I can't even begin to explain how grateful I am with this community for all the help it's provided so far.
There's  module in python's standard library, it'll be much more error proof to use it rather than replacing strings.To load  file:I guess you got the idea.  module will take care that your json data are not corrupted (or at least it'll fail with exception when that occurs).
just open that file as normal text file and replace the string you want toSince you want to replace the string everywhere, it doesn't matter whether data is json or not
