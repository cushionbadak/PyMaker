I want to write a function to combine the numbers in the brackets adjacently.For example, this string as the input I want the output isAnd for example, this string as the input I want the output isCurrently I wrote a function as follows:And the output is only:I know maybe I need recursive method, but I don't know how to use it correctly.Can anyone help me?And I treat it as one-digit problem, and after the sum, I need to convert the number which is more than nine to a corresponding alphabet.Following is the function:So for example, the input(the base is 17):(16)The output needs to be:(G)Because I don't know how to modify the functionThanks.
I'd use regex for that:The second argument of  can be a function, which you can use to compute the sum:If repl is a function, it is called for every non-overlapping occurrence  of pattern. The function takes a single match object argument, and  returns the replacement string. is the matched string,  is the matched string without parentheses.  gets us the sum of all digits in the string. wraps the sum with parentheses (this is the replacement string).Please note that the code above only works for one-digit numbers. If this is a problem, you'd use
