I want to convert a list of string representations of tuples, such as:into a list of tuples, such as:This seems to be the most concise (and clear) way to do itHowever, Ive seen a posting Python course - lambdathat seems to imply map() may not be good python or may become deprecated.The alternative would seem to be something like the more verbose (and hence slightly less clear):Which is more pythonic?
 is fine when used with a named function; it’s when you use it with an inline lambda that a list comprehension or generator expression becomes cleaner. , on the other hand, is not really fine. Consider  instead.Also,  returns an iterable (in Python 3); if you want a list, you’ll have to call  on the result.
In my opinion using  is a nice functional solution, but can be seen as a redundant language feature since generators were added. On the other hand your example that iterates over the array and concatenates to a list is not Pythonic.Some Pythonic alternatives to :ororDon't forget to EDIT: as @minitech pointed out you shold use  instead of .
