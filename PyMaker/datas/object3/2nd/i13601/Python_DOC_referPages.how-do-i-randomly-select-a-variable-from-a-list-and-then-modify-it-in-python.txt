Here's my python 3 code. I would like to randomly select one of the cell variables (c1 through c9) and change its value to the be the same as the cpuletter variable.I'm getting a "Can't assign to function call" error on the "random.choice(cells)." I assume I'm just using it incorrectly? I know you can use the random choice for changing a variable like below:
Problem: returns a random value from your list, for example , and you are trying to assign something to it, like:which is wrong. Instead of this, you can modify the , for example:Solution:You can use .Output:
 returns a random element from , so if it returned element #0 and element #0 was the value , your original statement would essentially be saying  - obviously you can't assign the string literal to be something else, it's not a variable.  You'd instead want to get a random element #, and assign .You could get the random element number by something simply like:I think this is the same as what the other answer says, they just used  instead.
