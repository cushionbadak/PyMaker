I'm trying to make a Tkinter Login Gui but if I click Log in it the displays the message "TypeError: descriptor 'readlines' of 'file' object needs argument" I tried looking for an answer and most of them were because of case-sensitive errors. Could someone please help me out. I've set up the profile.txt file properly(I'm 100% sure)
Your problem is that you are assigning to  in function and it's not propagated to the globals thus in function  it's not what you are expecting. it's (as hinted in comments) builtin python type therefore you receive this kind of error and not  as it would be for undefined variable.Please check for example this question to get better understanding how variable scopes work in python.
