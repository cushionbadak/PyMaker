How can I get  to print like  in Python?
I'm going to use  for hexadecimal representation, avoiding the unnecessary slicing ().Python 2Just decode the string (using the  codec):or pack the integer with  ( for big-endian order,  for  - change format character to meet your requirements)Python 3 does that: is still an option, format strings are as for Python 2 (see the previous section):The  codec is now one of the binary transforms, use :Python 3.2 and newerPython 3.2 introduced the cool  method:It will produce a fixed number of bytes (4 in this example) or the  "if the integer is not representable with the given number of bytes".There's a way to calculate the minimum number of bytes necessary to represent the integer:Also, consider specifying the  argument thatdetermines whether two's complement  is used to represent the integer.  If signed is False and a negative  integer is given, an OverflowError is raised.
