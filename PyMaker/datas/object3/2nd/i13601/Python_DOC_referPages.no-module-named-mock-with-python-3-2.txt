I can import mock with python 2.7, 3.3 and 3.4 but when using 3.2 I get the following import error.    How can I resolve this for Python 3.2?
It looks like the module is not installed for python3.2.You have to install it. If you have  or  installed for that interpreter you should be able to simply do:or:If you are using a virtual environment you may first need to activate it.If you activate a virtual environment for the python3.2 interpreter you shouldn't need to specify the version of , so  should work)Note that this module was integrated in the standard library as  from python3.3+. So in python3.3+ you can  and this wont require any installation.
