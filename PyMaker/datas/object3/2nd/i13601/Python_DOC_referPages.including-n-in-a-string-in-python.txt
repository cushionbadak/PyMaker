As an alternative to escaping the backslash, you can disable backslash-escaping entirely by using a raw string literal:
You should escape the backslash so that it's not treated as escaping character itself:BackgroundThe backslash  tells the parser that the next character is something special and must be treated differently. That's why  will not print as  but as a newline. But how do we write a backslash then? We need to escape it, too, resulting in  for a single backslash and  for the output .Docs here, also see this SO question
