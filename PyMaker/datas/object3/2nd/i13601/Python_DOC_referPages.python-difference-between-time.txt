Looking for easiest way to calculate the difference between 2 python times and display the millisecond deltaI have 2 timesdo some stuff...This works fine and when I log the times out and I get something like this in my logs...When I try to simply subtract them like thisI get the following errorAll I want to do is show the difference in microseconds and I can't figure it outI want to show is 
If you just use the result of , and don't convert them to s, you can take the difference & extract the bits you want in the form you want; for example:
Try this:Hope this Helps.
To measure the difference manually, you should use  instead.If you don't care about leap seconds (~1s error once per year and a half) and you need to display the local time:The code works fine around/during DST transitions.Note: it is different from the code that uses just . If you use   (no argument) then you get a naive datetime object that represents local time and in that case if a DST transition happens between  and  times then  returns a completely wrong result i.e., the code may be wrong by an hour approximately couple of times per year in some timezones.
the reason why you are getting an error is because class  does not support subtraction. You must turn  into miliseconds (int format) to subtract from one another.instead of using , use 
The simplest solution would be to convert the datetime objects to timestamps and subtract those. If you use Python 3.3 or later you can simply do something along these linesThen you can just subtract those.In Python 2 you do not have the timestamp method available. One way around would be to use a timedelta object:A third option is to simply use raw timestamps with  and subtract them to get the time interval in seconds and fraction of seconds. To be extra safe you could use  as @Sebastian mentions.
