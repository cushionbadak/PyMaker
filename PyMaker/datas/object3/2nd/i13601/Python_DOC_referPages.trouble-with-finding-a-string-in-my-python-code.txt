I am new to python Here is my attemptwhen the print content code executes my website will display so if uniqueEmail prints out true or false depending upon if the email exists.Now my doubt is I know I did wrong in passing the email id variable through the parameter in the URL. and second is how to check if the value was true or false ?
Yes, you did wrong in passing the email-id variable, the  should be outisde the string, not inside it. Example -Secondly, if your website returns a response like -This seems like a json response, so you should parse it as json, using the  module and then that would return you a dictionary, and from the dictionary you can get the  information. Example -I am using  as that returns  if the key is not present, in which case it would mean the email doesn't exist.Also, since you are using Python 2.7 as can be seen from the comment -any idea why this error is being thrown now You should use  instead of  . Example -
