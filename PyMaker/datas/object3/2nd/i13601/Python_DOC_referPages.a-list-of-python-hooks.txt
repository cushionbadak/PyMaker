To better understand a program I'm trying to implement a tracing metaclass, that when a class inherits from it all its method calls get traced to a file.  I can't simply use a module like  because I don't have access to a console in my execution environment.  I recently learned about , a hook that gets called whenever python executes a line, and while it almost solves my problem I can't get relevant line information for the trace because I don't have any way to knowing which file will be executed.  I suspect I need a hook that gets called right before any method in a class gets called, that passes in the method name, and then implement that hook in the tracing metaclass.Is there a reference somewhere of all the python hooks?Thanks in advance
I'm not sure that I understand your question properly, but you can get information about file/line from the  member of the frame:More info about the frame and code objects: https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html
