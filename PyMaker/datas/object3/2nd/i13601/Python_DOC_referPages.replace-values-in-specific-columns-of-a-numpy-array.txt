Natural Text
I have a N x M numpy array (matrix). Here is an example with a 3 x 5 array:I'd like to scan all the columns of  and replace the values of each column if they are equal to a specific value. This code for example aims to replace all the negative values (where the value is equal to the column number) to 100:This code obtains this warning:I'm using numpy 1.8.2. How can I avoid this warning without downgrade numpy?
I don't follow what your code is trying to do:the will evaluate to something like this:I don't think this is what you want.  You should try something like this:Create a mask over the whole column, and use that to change the values.
If you are worried about the warning spewing out text, then ignore it as a Warning/Exception:As you can see in the comments, some people are not getting . That is probably because python suppresses developer-only warnings since 2.7
Even without the warning, the code you have there will not do what you want. i is the loop index and will equal minus itself only if i == 0, which is never. Your test will always return false, which is cast to 0. In other words your code will replace the first element of each row with 100.To get this to work I would do Notice that you use the name of the array for the masking and that you need to separate the conventional indexing from the masking
As others have said, your loop isn't doing what you think it is doing.  I would propose you change your code to use numpy's fancy indexing.
