As I transition from JavaScript to Python, I noticed I haven't figured out a way to add properties to the data type classes. For example, in JavaScript, if I wanted to be able to type  and have it return the last element in the array , or type  and to set the last element to , I would use:However, in Python, I'm not sure how to do the equivalent of Note: I am not asking for how to do the specific example function, I am trying to be able to define a property with a  and  onto the primitive data types (str, int, float, list, dict, set, etc.)
In Python 21, adding new attributes (aka member objects, including methods) to a new-style class (one that derives from ) is as easy as simply defining them:I use the  builtin that Dan D. mentioned in his answer, but this actually assigns the attribute after the class is created, like the question asks.Online demo1: in Python 3, it's even simpler, since all classes are new-style classes
See the documentation of the  function. It has examples. The following is the result of  under Python 2.7.3:
If I understood you correctly, you want to edit existing classes (add method) Check out this thread Python: changing methods and attributes at runtime
