Natural Text
So I'm new to recursion and i know there is a much easier way to do this but can someone explain how to fix this.this is basically a recursive function to find the total number of times a letter 'x' can be found in the variable 'text'.in         new(final_text)    RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceededso it works but it continues to loop.how do i make it stop thankyou in advance 
This condition will never be true, because  will always return a result .The correct return value to check for when there was no result is . But you need to be careful with the increment, since that will change the invalid result  to  continuing the loop. So you should reorder your logic a bit:Note that using global variables for such a function, especially for recursive functions, is a bad idea. You don’t have full control over it, and instead, you also need to make sure that you reset its value when you call the function. Instead, you should keep all the information inside, and pass it around to the recursive calls if necessary. You could change your function like this:This uses default parameter values to make sure that  starts with 0. And for the recursive call, it just passes the new  value, so the next function can start there.Finally note, that you should try to use descriptive names for your functions and variables. The function is supposed to count the number of occurrences of , so maybe  would be better. Also, the variable  in that context conveys a meaning that it contains the number of occurrences of  that you have already found; but instead, it’s the start offset from which to continue the search; and  is just bad, as it’s just the index of the next :Finally, just in case you don’t know, there is also a built-in function  which does the same thing :)
