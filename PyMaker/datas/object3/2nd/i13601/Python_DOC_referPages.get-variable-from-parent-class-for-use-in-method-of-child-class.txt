This question already has an answer here:Call a parent class's method from child class in Python?                    15 answers                I'm trying to understand how parent and child classes in Python work and I ran into this seemingly simple problem:I'm expecting the string 42 is the answer! but I get AttributeError: 'child' object has no attribute 'data'What am I missing?I experimentated with  and also  but couldn't get it right.
Since your  has its own  function, you need to call the parent class'   , otherwise it does not get called. Example - from documentation - super(type[, object-or-type])Return a proxy object that delegates method calls to a parent or sibling class of type. This is useful for accessing inherited methods that have been overridden in a class. The search order is same as that used by getattr() except that the type itself is skipped.So the first argument to  should be the child class (whose' parent class' method you want to call) , and the second argument should be the object itself , that is self. Hence ,  .In Python 3.x , you can simply call -And it would call the  method from the correct parent class.
