I've written a small python code that parses data from a file and then uses Selenium to input the data into a website, and I am trying to bundle it with a script.I was already able to bundle it into a pip package and upload it, but when trying to run it I get  for modules on the same directory.My structure is pretty simplyAnd the setup.py is also pretty basic:As of right now  simply calls :and chessil_tourney_inserter gives me an import error on:but if I try to run  directly it works, and if I add the package name to the import it would break So how am I supposed to set up the files so that imports will work correctly both when I run the file directly myself, and when I try to import it as a package or run it as a script?
Add  at the top folder too.See What is __init__.py for? for more information.
