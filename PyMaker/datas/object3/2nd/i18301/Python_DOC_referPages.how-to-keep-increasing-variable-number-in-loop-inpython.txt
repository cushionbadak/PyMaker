I need to create a code where the user can input a certain number of courses, and then it will take the gpa of them, but how can I change the variable name in the loop?I have this so farIf I want to change the variable name of mark_one to something different each time I go through the loop, what is the simplest way I can do this? And also is it possible to change it in my input statement to ask for first, second, third... as I go through the loop? I have tried searching on google, but none of the answers I can understand as their code is far behind my level or they didn't seem to answer what I needed either. Thanks.
