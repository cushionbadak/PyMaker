When creating a class when do I need to use init()?For the code below, when we create the PartTimeEmployee() class can we just inherit the init() from the Employee() class? Or should we retype it?I found that both codes worked:andIs there some kind of best practice here?
No;  is inherited like any other method. Because of this, however, you have to take special precautions when you do override it. For example, if we have a  class:We want to make a new class named  that extends it to add a  attribute. We could repeat the logic in the  constructor:But if  does something more involved, you probably don't want to do that. Instead, you need to use  to explicitly call the superclass's :But in the simple case where the subclass has no additional initialization, feel free to omit ; it will indeed be inherited from the superclass appropriately.
