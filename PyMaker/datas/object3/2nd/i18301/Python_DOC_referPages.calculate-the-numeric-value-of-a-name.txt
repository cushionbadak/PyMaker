You have to update the  variable everytime in the loop. Change your loop to:You can also use  function with generator expression:
You forgot to change your sum variable. Do it like: 
 lets us add the ascii values directly using . Then you need to subtract 96 for each character in the stringThis works about twice as fast as using ord() for each character on my computer even for short strings, and even better for long strings
First, avoid using python keywords as variables. In your code, you have set the keyword  which is actually a function to the value 0Second, observe that you are in a for-loop so there is nothing to store the accumulating sum into as the for-loop progresses.Here is what I came up with:One-line:
You just have to use  in the right place - use generator expression. It would be more pythonic than using a loop:You can also use list comprehension, but it would be slower
In fact, I think solution from @gnibbler is the best.Still, I want to share my idea. I would like use  rather than  loop or list comprehension:
