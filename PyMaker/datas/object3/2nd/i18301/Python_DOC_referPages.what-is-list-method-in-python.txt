I couldn't find any reference about  on the python site.Can you please provide a reference about it?Example of some code in Django:What does this mean?
 creates a Python list object.Given an iterable, all elements of the iterable are copied over to the resulting list:Return a list whose items are the same and in the same order as iterable‘s items.The expression  creates an iterable that results in 10  objects, whose name starts with  (with a case insensitive match).This simply creates a local copy of the query result, perhaps so the code can index directly into the list without re-issuing a new query each time.This is specifically documented on the Django  documentation:. Force evaluation of a  by calling  on it. For example:Be warned, though, that this could have a large memory overhead, because Django will load each element of the list into memory. In contrast, iterating over a  will take advantage of your database to load data and instantiate objects only as you need them.
