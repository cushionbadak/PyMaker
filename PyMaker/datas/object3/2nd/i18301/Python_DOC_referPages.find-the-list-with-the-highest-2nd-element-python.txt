Natural Text
I have a list made of lists(tuples?), and they follow the form belowI need to identify the element that satisfies the criteria listed:Has the highest 2nd(?) value. For example, in the above example, the output would be 7.In the event of ties, the element with the lowest 1st(?) value. For example:This would return 8; 9 and 8 both have the highest 2nd(?) value and so in the tie-break, 8 is lower than 9, so 8 wins.*I put ?s where my terminology may be wrong but hopefully my post will be readable
Just sort it by the second then the -first element:
Implement your own sorter:
You can also do this in one pass through the list, without having to sort it:
