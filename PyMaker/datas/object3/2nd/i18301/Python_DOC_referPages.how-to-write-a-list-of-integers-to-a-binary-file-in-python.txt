I have a list of integers which represent bytes of code. How can I write them to a binary file fast and more efficiently.I have tried:and both get me a result which I think is correct (I have yet to reverse the process) but both take a long time (6min and 4min respectfully).
Use a  object, write that straight to the output file:A sequence of integers is interpreted by a  as a sequence of byte values.In Python 3, you can use a  type as well, with the same input; you are not mutating the values after creation, after all.
