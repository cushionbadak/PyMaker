I have a file  which has data in the following format. The date at the top represents the last date at which data was written in the file and is there for the way I am collecting the data.I am using matlotlib to plot the data. But before doing that I need to separate the dates, questions, answers etc. into separate lists. Currently I am doing that in the function as shown below. As you can see there are many list comprehensions here. Is there a simpler way to separate the data into many lists?
 in conjunction with the  operator can be used to unzip a list:
The stdlib provides the  module to read comma separated files.And there's the  class that does what you want:Create an object which operates like a regular reader but maps the information read into a dict whose keys are given by the optional  fieldnames parameter. If the fieldnames parameter is omitted, the  values in the first row of the csvfile will be used as the fieldnames.  If the row read has more fields than the fieldnames sequence, the  remaining data is added as a sequence keyed by the value of restkey.  If the row read has fewer fields than the fieldnames sequence, the  remaining keys take the value of the optional restval parameter. Any  other optional or keyword arguments are passed to the underlying  reader instance.Here's how it may look like in your application snippet (untested):Personally, I'd change the code to just pass around the dict object .Your code to type convert the string is still required somewhere. Here's an answer on how to subclass DictReader to infer types on the columns.
