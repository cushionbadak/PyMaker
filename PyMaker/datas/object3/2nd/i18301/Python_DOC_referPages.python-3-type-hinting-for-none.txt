I'm trying to set a type hint in Python in a function, you can add more than one type hint with , but, what are the type hinting for ? :/
From your example:I've noticed that your use case is "something or None".Since version 3.5, Python supports type annotations via  module.And in your case, the recommended way of annotating is by using  hint. This has exact meaning you're looking for.Therefore the hint for  would be:
It's just !Or at least, it can be.Since these annotations are meaningless to Python beyond being in/correct syntax, it's sort of up to the tools.If you use typecheck-decorator for example, then you'll need to use :Typecheck also allows you to somewhat more clearly "add more than one type hint with" with  (OR),  (AND), and far more besides. Beware that  is a NAND-like predicate; not what you are looking for - with no arguments it will accept any type, equivalent to  or the more apt .
