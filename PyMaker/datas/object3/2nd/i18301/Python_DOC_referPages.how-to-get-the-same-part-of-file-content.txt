I have two files , and I want to display the content exist in file 1 and file 2 in the screen. But it seems nothing display ( but it should display ) . What is the problem?thanksHere is my codeOutput
You probably have more whitespace in one of the files than just a newline. You could loop over either  and , printing the representation of that line with  or  to make it easier to spot how the lines differ.I'd strip the lines entirely. Also, use a  for the lines of one file, testing will be much more efficient:Looping directly over the file itself reads the file line by line, letting you handle file lines without having to read the whole file into memory.Note also the use of  statements here; file objects are context managers, and when the context closes (the  block ends) the file object is automatically closed for you.With Katakana, there is also the possibility that one of your files uses decomposition for the  ZI character while the other does not; you can either express it as  or as ; (SI + COMBINING KATAKANA-HIRAGANA VOICED SOUND MARK):You can use  to normalize all your lines to either composed or decomposed forms. Here I force all data to use composed forms:
