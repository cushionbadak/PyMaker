I have a bit trouble with python testing.Below is a simple doctest in python. the information between """ has to be in the same file with the actual code.I remembered somebody told me that I can put Into a separate file if the output is too much or too long. When you do the doctest, open the file and compare. I just can't remember how to do that now.Can any body help me?thanks
I came across this from a Google search as I had the same issue. I noticed there is an answer in the comments but the question is unanswered so adding a proper answer for future visitors. From the docs: This allows you to specify code in a test file and run a test using this file.
