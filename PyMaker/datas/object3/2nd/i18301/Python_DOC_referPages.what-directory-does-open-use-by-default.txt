I'm trying to do this:and it's saying the file is not found. I have the file in the same direction as my python program. what's wrong? I thought it checked the directory to be SOLUTION: I used  and found out my file was actually named some.txt.txt
Relative paths are resolved from the current working directory.For example, let's say I have this directory structure:If I were in my home directory (), then I could reference the Python script by  and the data file by . You could also opt to use absolute paths, e.g.,  and .You can access the parent directory with . For example, if I were in the  directory and I wanted to access , I could use  (or an absolute path, as before).Your script can examine its current working directory using  and change the current working directory using .The critical thing to note is that while the current working directory and directory the script is in may be the same, that is not necessarily the case. If you want to access a file in the same directory as the script regardless of what the current working directory is, you can chain a few things together: is a predefined global variable corresponding to the script's path as it was provided to the Python executable. lets you get the directory from that. lets you combine that directory and the name of the file you want to access.
It uses the same directory as the current working directory. Useto find out where that is.
To add to icktoofay's answer, to open a file relative to the script's folder, you could do the following.
It should be the directory you ran the python script from.Use this to print it:
