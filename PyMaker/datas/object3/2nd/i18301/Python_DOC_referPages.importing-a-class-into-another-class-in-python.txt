as I'm still learning python I came up to a problem.Why does this work:but this doesn't:Both times I include a class, but in the second example it says: NameError: global name 'Tkinter' is not definedWhere's the difference between those examples and how can I solve this, so I'm able to use tkinter in my class?Thanks for your help.
Perhaps you meant ? the  module on Python 3.x does not seem to contain a class .As to the meaning of your question and example... well, the examples are absolutely irrelevant, and the question should simply be "why can't I create an instance of " or something.Python Lesson: This is also a good example of why it's a bad idea to use star imports (i.e , because  looks like a star). This imports everything from , but doesn't let you know if something you thought was there actually isn'twhereas thiswould have immediately pointed out that (the class)  does not exist in . Another option that some seem to prefer (incl. myself in some cases), is  followed by , which has the advantage that it's obvious where a class comes from. Futhermore, PEP8 also discourages the use of star imports (referring to them as "wildcard imports").
