Natural Text
I am trying to develop a list(lets called "l") of list of tuple of two natural numbers(excluding 0) such as "a" can be a memeber of "l" if len(a) == len and for every member(lets call p) of "a", p[0] <= max and p[1] <= maxFor example poslist_all(max=2,len=1)and poslist_all(2,2)So I am trying to make that list an iterator and came up with this code,but this always returnsWhats causing this error ? How to solve it ?Is there more pythonic way to do this ?
Others have shown you how to get rid of the error, but I'd like to address the actual problem.There is indeed a better, more pythonic way to do what you want.The itertools module, and specifically itertools.product() can make this task much simpler.This will return an iterator over iterators(I think that's at least close to the correct terminology).If you want actual lists, use the list() function as needed.Also, note that  and  are awful variable names; they shadow python's built-n functions.
The class instance is always passed as the first parameter to methods of the class.  Try:
