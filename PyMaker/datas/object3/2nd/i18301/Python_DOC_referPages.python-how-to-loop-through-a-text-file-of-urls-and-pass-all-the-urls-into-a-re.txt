Natural Text
I recently scraped a bunch of metadata using Python's BeautifulSoup Library. I saved all of the urls contained in that metadata to a .txt file. However, I need all of the redirect urls instead.  I'm able to do one url at a time with:I tried to pass the text file into a list and then pass that list as the argument and I get the following error: "TypeError: get_redirect_url() takes exactly 1 argument (11 given)"Is there a way that I can pass either the text file or the list representation of the data from that text file as the parameter of a function, loop through the file, and extract all the redirect urls?  Thank you all.
I thin you're calling  in the wrong way. is the "splat" operator: It takes a list as input, and expands it into actual positional arguments in the function call.So, by writing  you are saying . However your function accepts only one argument: url.To sum up, you have to call  with only one argument at time.
