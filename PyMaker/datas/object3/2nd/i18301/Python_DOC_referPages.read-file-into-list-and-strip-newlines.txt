I'm having issues in reading a file into a list, When I do it only creates one item from the entire file rather than reading each element into its own field. I'm using  as the thing to strip on, but I can't get it to work correctly.Result:
 reads entire file's contents, unless you specify max length. What you must be meaning is . But you can go even more idiomatic with a list comprehension:The  statement will take care of closing the file.
If you're okay with reading the entire file's contents into memory, you can also use   is similar to  but if your file ends with a newline,  will return an empty string at the very end, whereas  handles this case the way you want.
This incorporates the strip directly into the  statement.Or, if you know you don't need any space before or after text on a line, you can use this.
