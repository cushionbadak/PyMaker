How can I import an arbitrary python source file (whose filename could contain any characters, and does not always ends with ) in Python 3.3+?I used  as follows:It still works in Python 3.3, but according to  documentation, it is deprecated:Deprecated since version 3.3: Unneeded as loaders should be used to  load modules and find_module() is deprecated.and  module documentation recommends to use :Note New programs should use importlib rather than this module.What is the proper way to load an arbitrary python source file in Python 3.3+ without using the deprecated  function?
Found a solution from  test code.Using importlib.machinery.SourceFileLoader:NOTE: only works in Python 3.3+.UPDATE  is deprecated since Python 3.4. Use  instead:
Shorter version of @falsetrue 's solution:I tested it with Python 3.5 and 3.6.  According to the comments, it does not work with arbitrary file extensions.
Similar to @falsetru but for Python 3.5+ and accounting for what the  doc states on using  over :This function [] is preferred over using  to create a new  module as spec is used to set as many import-controlled attributes on  the module as possible.We are able to import any file with  alone by modifying the  list.
