So here's my problem. I am creating a telephone directory in python 3.3.2, and I need to know how to call seperate functions. Here is my code:So I need to know how to call the Add function right from the start.Any ideas?
you are defining functions inside of If statements that are never actually getting calledyou want something like this:Usually when you are starting off you want to define your functions first at the top, and then call them in other placesalso i think you may want to check your syntax.When you are making  ( you dont need a semi colon after it btw ), and then you later on call  this technically means you are calling  which is weird.plus, if you move the  stuff out of the  statement, you are using another variable called  in your code, which will cause confusion in life.
