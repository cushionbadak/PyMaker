I have an issue with my python code to make beeping noises.It just does an infinite loop of beeps even though it should stop.Thanks for any help
If you are using Python 3.x,  returns a string object.Comparing string object with int always return False.You should convert string object to int before compare them:BTW, it's better to use following instead of  loop:
Your problem is that  on Python 3 returns a string, so  will be a string, and therefore  will never be .Use 
Changeto You are reading  as string and comparing it against an  inwhich will never be . Thats why your code is infinitely looping.
