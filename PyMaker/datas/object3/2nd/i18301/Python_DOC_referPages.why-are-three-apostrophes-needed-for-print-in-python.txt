I'm making this Pythagoras Theorem Calculator in Python 3.3.2.I made print over several lines so that I could make a diagram:As you can see above, three apostrophes were needed instead of the speech marks. Why is this so? Is it an escape character? (I've tried searching on Google: http://bit.ly/15a4zes)
The three quotes allows you to make a string on multiple lines. It avoids you to add  everywhere or doing multiple  statements.Threes quote strings are also used recommended to make documentation, see the PEP 257 convention  (see also comments of this post)
Three apostrophes (or speech marks) make your string a triple-quoted string.  This allows it to span multiple lines.  Normal strings can not do this.If you want the same effect with normal strings, you have to put a  every time you want a line break (which is a little annoying and also makes your string hard to read).
They are not needed, they just make it easier to produce a multi-line string.The alternative would be:Note that Python lets you take your pick of  and  style quotes, whatever better suits your string contents.
