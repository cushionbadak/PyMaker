I have a clean install of Python 3.3.2 on Windows 7. I'm trying to import html.parser.HTMLParser, using the example from the documentation: Simple HTML and XHTML parserBut I'm getting the error:I have just opened the interpreter and typed the import line. Why it isn't working as expected? Why it is printing the weird "aee4" and "gg2" strings?
Just write "import HTMLParser" and it will work
