I have the following code and wondering if there is a simpler way to do this.I am creating a list of tuples that holds letters from a string and the corresponding number from a list. here it isThe output is here which is correct. I am looking for condensed version if possible
How about this:Note that here it works since the list and string are of equal length. otherwise, you might have truncations.EDIT:you have the last item in  missed out.
Use  function:This function returns a list of tuples, where the i-th tuple contains the i-th element from each of the argument sequences or iterables.Demo:Note that, in Python 3.x,  returns an iterator. You have to wrap the return value in , to make it a list.To get an iterator in Python 2.x, use itertools.. Also, if the length of your sequences are not equal, then you can use itertools..
This is a snap with zip:Note that I wrote this in Python 2.x.  In Python 3.x, you will need to do this:This is because, as demonstarted, the Python 3.x  returns a zip object instead of a list like it did in Python 2.x.
i don't know if the list is always just monotonic numbers, but if they are, you can either replace it with range(), or use enumerate to make this one line:
