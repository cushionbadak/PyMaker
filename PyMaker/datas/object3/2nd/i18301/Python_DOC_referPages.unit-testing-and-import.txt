My program reads a python script for configuration. So far I'm loading the script called  like this:But when I'm unit-testing it, I've a strange behavior:when I launch only one unit test calling this code, it succeedwhen I launch several unit tests, each of one calling this code independantly, some tests failedTracing the problem with , It seems the lab script is imported only the first time. This behavior seems coherent in respect of python but I was assuming than unit tests are isolated between each other. I am wrong ? If test are not independant in respect of the import, how can I write test to force the loading of my script each time ? 
I would suggest deleting the module from sys.modulesjust deleting the import will not work because import checks in sys.modules if the module is already imported.if you import then reload it works because it first loads the module from sys.modules into the local namespace and then reloads the module from file.
Try using .For example:In python 2  is a builtin function.In python 3.2+  is in the  module, but deprecated in 3.4+.In python 3.4+  is in the  module.
Maybe it helps if you run  with this flag:From the nosedocEnable plugin IsolationPlugin: Activate the isolation plugin to isolate changes to external modules to a single test module or package. The isolation plugin resets the contents of sys.modules after each test module or package runs to its state before the test. PLEASE NOTE that this plugin should not be used with the coverage plugin, or in any other case where module reloading may produce undesirable side-effects. [NOSE_WITH_ISOLATION]
