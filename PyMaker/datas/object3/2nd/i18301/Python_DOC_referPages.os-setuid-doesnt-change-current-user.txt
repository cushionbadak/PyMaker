I wanted to change current user for script execution. I did thisI am still getting . Is there better way than this? I want switch user once and then continue rest of the commands execution in the script with that new user.  
 doesn't use  or  to get the current user.http://docs.python.org/3/library/getpass.html#getpass.getuserThis function checks the environment variables LOGNAME, USER, LNAME and USERNAME, in order, and returns the value of the first one which is set to a non-empty string. If none are set, the login name from the password database is returned on systems which support the pwd module, otherwise, an exception is raised.
After trying modules , , , I realised that the problem is not whether the user is set. The user gets set or gets changed using , however, the methods from modules to get username like , , actually does not get username properly. If you run a shell command  or using  or , you will get the changed user. These are little puzzled outputs for me. Below is script which shows all these weird behaviours.
