I've been trying to write code for this function, but I can't get  to work in python 2.7. any ideas why?
Dividing integer by integer (as you do with  inside ) returns an integer (which is the floor value of the division result) in Python before 3.0. You must either convert at least one operand to  or declare at the beginning of the Python source fileRead http://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0238 for details
Code CorrectionsThere are a few problems:There is no built-in , it needs to be used from  as There is zero division. This originates from  integer division as @MichaelButscher states.There is no  built-in, also use If the inputs are s they are truncated to s, this seem unnecessary.Final corrected code:
