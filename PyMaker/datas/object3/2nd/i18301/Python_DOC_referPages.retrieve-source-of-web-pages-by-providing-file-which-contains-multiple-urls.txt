Try to break down the issue as best as you can. You've got a text file with each URL listed on its own line. You know that Python's got great support for reading line by line, thanks to , and you're probably familiar with  or , depending on your preference.So all you need to do is:Open the fileRead line by lineUse the line as an URL stringSend a request to the URL using urllib or requestsCapture the output and parse it/save itAnd you're done!
