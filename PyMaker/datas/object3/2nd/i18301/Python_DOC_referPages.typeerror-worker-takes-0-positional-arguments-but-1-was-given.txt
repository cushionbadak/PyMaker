I'm trying to implement a subclass and it throws the error: 
Your  method needs 'self' as a parameter, since it is a class method and not a function. Adding that should make it work fine.
If the method doesn't require  as an argument, you can use the  decorator to avoid the error:See https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#staticmethod
You forgot to add  as a parameter to the function  in the class .
