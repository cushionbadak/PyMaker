Using python, I am trying to figure out how to extract unique keys from a list of tuple pairs, with the highest, lowest and average values, as well as a count of how many keys, for example with this list:I need to extract this information:
You can use a defaultdict to gather the information.You should have no problem to implement the calculation of min, max and average (sum/len) for yourself.
Your target looks like a dictionary of dictionaries. So build dictionary taking the 1st element of each tuple as a key. Iterate through the tuples and build up the values for each.You should end up with something like:tally = {'a': {'count': 3, 'max': 10, 'avg': 7, 'min': 1}, ... etc.}
