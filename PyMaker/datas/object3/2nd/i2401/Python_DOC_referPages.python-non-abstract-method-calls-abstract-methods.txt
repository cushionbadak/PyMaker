I have an example below:The first script where I define the abstract class:And the second script where I implement the abstract methods:Since i know for sure that  and   must be called in that order, i want to write the non-abstract method  to do that (like in ). But it doesn't seem to work:Is there anyway to do that? Since i don't want to rewrite the same -method each time.Thank you.
The problem is that double_underscore attributes are somewhat magic in Python.From the docs:Any identifier of the form __spam (at least two leading underscores,  at most one trailing underscore) is textually replaced with  _classname__spam, where classname is the current class name with leading underscore(s) stripped.So instead of overriding , you end up with an abstract  and an implemented 
Ok ... i found what i need, i just need to change the protected methods  to normal method  and it all works.
