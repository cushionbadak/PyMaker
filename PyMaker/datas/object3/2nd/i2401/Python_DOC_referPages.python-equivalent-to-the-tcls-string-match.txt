I am looking for Python equivalent to the Tcl's string match operation. Specifically, I would like to handle correctly the special sequences (*, ?, and [chars]).For example, given three Python strings:the match operation  should return true, but  should return false.Thanks a lot!
You want the  module. While  provides full powered regular expressions,  performs the limited, shell-style globbing wildcard matching you're looking for.For a case sensitive match, it's as simple as:If you want to follow the operating system's case sensitivity rules (that is, insensitive on Windows, sensitive on most other operating systems), you'd use plain  to invoke automatic case normalization.
