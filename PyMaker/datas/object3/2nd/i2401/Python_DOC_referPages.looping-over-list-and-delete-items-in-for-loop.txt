I have list which has more than 1000 elementsand i have a page where i must add those elements from the list but the thing is the page only accepts 40 entries at a time.so what i am tring to do is  grab 40 elements from the list then submit those elements to the page using for loop then delete these elements from the list and grab 40 elements again, i need to do this till all the elements from the list are submitted to the page.this is what i have done so far and failed
You don't need to alter your initial data; instead, you can request successive chunks of a given size from it:something like this:In this example, if  is not a multiple of , the last values will be what's left in the sequence.The keyword argument  can optionally be set to start the chunks at an arbitrary location.output:
Why can't you slice the list every time, because remove will be a costly operationA generalized version to break a list into even sized chunks : is a list of lists with each list of size 40 (Maybe except the last one)
Even tho i don't fully understand the question, but i can do something that creates a list of list containing each forty elemnts, like:Demo:
