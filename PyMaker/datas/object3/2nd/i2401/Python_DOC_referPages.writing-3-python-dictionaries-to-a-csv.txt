I have 3 dictionaries( 2 of them are setdefault dicts with multiple values)-Score_dict-post_dict-comment_dict-My current approach is to write them into 3 different csv files and then merging them,I want to merge them according to a common first row(ID_row).But I am unable to figure out how to merge 3 csv files into a single csv file. Also , Is there any way which I can write all the 3 dictionaries into a single csv without writing them individually.Output required-How to do this in a correct way with the best approach?
You can merge them all first, then write them to a csv file:For reference: https://repl.it/repls/SqueakySlateblueDictionaries
I suggest you to transform your three dicts into one list of dicts before write it to a csv file.ExampleAnd then use the csv.DictWriter class to write all the rows.Since you have commas in your values (are you sure it's a good behaviour? Maybe splitting them in two different columns could be a better approach), be careful to use tabs or something else as separator        
I suggest writing all three to the same fileYou could get common keys by doing something like:
