Certain mathematical operations, especially on data read from hardware drivers, can depend on fixed width of the data type. Example: bitwise shift. What is the Pythonic way of creating integer variables with fixed width (e.g. uint32, int16 etc.) that would overflow/shift accordingly?
I would suggest the fixedint library. The classes in that library are named in the following convention:So for your two examples, the classes would beThis supports things like bit-shifting, etc
For interfacing with hardware we normally use the  standard library - specifically  and  not only are fixed widths handled but also endianess issues.  See the python 2 or python  3 library manuals.
