I have code like:The above code is executing in a serial fashion. I would like to make faster by processing each col in the parallel fashion by using python and I wrote the following code using multiprocessing but didn't help.I couldn't see any output and the kernel is continuously running without any output? what could be the issue? Is there any other way of doing it by other libraries in numba? (Note: this code is an normal example. The basic idea is that i have to take each column in a dataframe and perform DBSCAN algorithm. Based on the result of DBSCAN, i have another function to calculate score for that. I gave these two funtions in the above code. Incrementing operations in the above functions are used for verifying to to see whether it goes to funtion or not. That was my intention. Here in first part of code it is taking in a serial fashion whereas i need to parallelise this area of for loop so that i can process multiple columns in parallel fashion).
You have to use  as stated in programming guidelines for multiprocessing module https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing-programming. That is the second code you have provided should look like this:Output:EDIT:To run the code in Jupyter Notebook you have to place your functions into a module (in the simplest case it is  file in the folder where your  script located). Then you should import your custom module of course. This fixes the problem for me.
