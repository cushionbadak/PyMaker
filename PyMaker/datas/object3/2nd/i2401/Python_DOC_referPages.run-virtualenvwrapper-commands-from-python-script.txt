When I'm trying to create a new Python 3 virtual environment by using  (virtualenvwrapper command) and  like thisnothing happens. doesn't work either.The point is to quickly create a new virtual env and work on it later for each project (it's an automation script).  is the most convenient option.
The  and  commands are shell functions, not executables in your [0]. To make them available in the shell you execute them in, you need to source the  shell script defining them. You might be better off calling  directly.How to activate that virtualenv is another story, though, and will depend on the context you want to use it in. If you activate it in a subprocess, each process using it will have to be run in or under that child.Hth,dtkPS In addition, you might look into the  module (or even the third-party ) for calling external programs. Happy coding :)[0]: See  in a terminal vs
