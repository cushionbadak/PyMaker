I'm attempting to find a word by its known letters and letters position (similar to a crossword) similar to what crosswordsolver.org doesExample :I have all possible words (with the same length) in a list.the problem is, i can't find a proper solution to compare user_input to my list.comparing each index of each word on dictionary to user_input word letters seems to be a solution, however it is not efficient at all.is there any other way to approach this problem ? thank you in advanceEDIT : I should add that regex cannot be used as a solution because I'm working with Persian(farsi) words, which uses persian alphabet (similar to arabic)User input is taken letter by letter and is stored as List.There might be more than 1 missing letter and theWord length can be anything between 1-10
A quick hackYou can use a Trie data structure and that will be much more efficient.
I suggest that you build a tree with your list of words.Searching would be fast and memory consumption low.If you don't want to start from scratch, you could use the module anytree.
Have a look on regular expression packageSomething as:would work.
