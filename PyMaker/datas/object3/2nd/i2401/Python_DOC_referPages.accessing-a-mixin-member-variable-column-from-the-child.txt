I'm having trouble accessing a parent class member variable  from the child class.Gives me this error:On the other handGives me this error:
A class definition's body is its own scope and the names introduced will form the class' namespace. The problem (in your original question) with your model definition is that the name  has not been assigned to in the body of the class , so the joins in the  definition refer to the builtin function . You also cannot use  as shown in this question, because the Declarative metaclass will create a copy of it to , so it does not refer to the same column.The solution is to use lazy evaluation: either pass a callable, or a Python-evaluable string as the join:This works because the inter-mapper relationships of mappers are configured after the mapped classes have been declared and are used for the first time, unless explicitly configured using .Note that you cannot use plain  in the evaluable string either, but must instead refer to it using the  class, since it is evaluated later in a completely different scope from that of the class body, including names from the Declarative class registry, and metadata.The last error is the result of code such asThe assignment of  to another name – such as  – in the class body results in your model having a composite primary key, formed from 2 integer columns, so  expected to receive a 2-tuple of integers, not just one integer.
