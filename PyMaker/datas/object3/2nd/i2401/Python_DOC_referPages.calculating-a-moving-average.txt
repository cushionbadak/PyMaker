I struggle to implement the moving average formula in my function.Took me quite a while to get where the code is right now. Is there a library I could probably take?Input:Expected Output:My Output:I am running into the problem that the middle parts of my result is right but the rest is a mystery.Why does it return None for the last three values in the list?def ma(prices, n):(Sorry for all those  function calls, but I really wanted to get to the source of the issue).
There were several other logical errors in your code. I tried to correct it to make it work as you want. Following is only the modified version of the for loop. Rest stays the same. The added/modified lines are highlighted by a comment The problem was that you were using the wrong variable as the index:One major problem was that you were usingYou should use:Moreover, I added an if statement to take care of the average of the first three elements. Now gives the following output (you can round off later):
If you are ok using the standard library, this might help. What you really need is a sliding window over your iterator. You can use this function for that (this was based on  from itertools recipes):For the average you can use . The paddig part can be simply achieved by adding the average list with :Sample usage:
The reason why your program returned that  is negative indexing. When  is ,  is saying , which points at the last item of the list, . Understanding Python's slice notation could help explain that.
You could also solve this using list slicing to partition your input list smartly and calculate the avg over the list-partitions:Output ( included as comment):
