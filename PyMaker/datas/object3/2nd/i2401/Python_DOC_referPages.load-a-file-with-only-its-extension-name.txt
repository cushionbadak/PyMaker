I would like to load a file for only it's extension name in gensim. A normal code would be this:But I would like it to auto open any file with ".bin".Example:.bin files:It can be "news.bin", "file.bin" or "guess.bin". As long as it load only the extension. Thank you.
If you want to open ALL of them one by one, you can iterate over files in the target directory.    This is the code example for Python 3:If you only want to open ANY ONE of them, you can break out of the for loop after the first match:
The  library is perfect for this:This will loop over all files that match  according to Unix style pathname pattern expansion.
