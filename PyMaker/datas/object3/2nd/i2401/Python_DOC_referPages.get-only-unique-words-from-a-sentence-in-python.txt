Let's say I have a string that says "mango mango peach". How can I print only the unique words in that string. The desired output for the above string would be [peach] as a listThanks!!

Python has a built in method called count that would work very well here    Using list comprehension you can do this 
First - split you string with empty space delimiter (split() method), than use Counter or calculate frequencies by your own code.
You can use a  to find the number of occurrences of each word, then make a list of all words that appear only once.
