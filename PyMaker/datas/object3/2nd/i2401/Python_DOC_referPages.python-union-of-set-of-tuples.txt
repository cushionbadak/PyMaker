You can't do that with set intersecion. Two objects are either equal or they are not. Since your objects are tuples,  and  are not equal, and you don't get to change that. The obvious way would be to create your own class and redefine equality, something likeand create sets of such objects.
An alternative using chain:Output
Here is my one-line style solution based on comprehensions:  Using conversion to dictionary to eliminate the duplicates, you can also do that, which is a quite smart solution IMHO:
