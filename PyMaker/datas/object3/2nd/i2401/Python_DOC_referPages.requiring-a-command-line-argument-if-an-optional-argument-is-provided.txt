You can set the number of expected args with . https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#the-add-argument-methodNote that here the displayed help shows , which is kind of annoying (it duplicates the argument name by default). You can set  to a tuple to display better help messages for the two arguments you need to pass.For more on that, see here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#metavar
You enforce the extra argument in the  routine for .In there, you check for the existence and validity of the  you expect.For existence alone, a simple check for quantity of arguments will do the job.
