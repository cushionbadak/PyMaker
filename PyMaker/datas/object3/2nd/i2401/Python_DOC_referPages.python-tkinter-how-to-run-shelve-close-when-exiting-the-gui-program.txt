I have a simple gui(tkinter) program that writes data to a file. Uses shelve.How to run shelve.close () when I want to disable the program?
The canonical way of closing something no-matter-what-happens is to use context managers:This guarantees that shelve.close() will be called, even when you get any exceptions in the code.It is also the recommended way in the documentation:Do not rely on the shelf being closed automatically; always call  explicitly when you donâ€™t need it any more, or use  as a context manager.Alternatively, since you're using tkinter, you can use the  event:This method is worse because it depends on tk firing the event. Use the context manager method instead to cover all grounds.
The  call stops when your GUI stops. If you want to run some code after the GUI exits just put it after .
