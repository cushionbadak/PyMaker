I would like to make a list of tuples using two lists and a constant, as follows, I'd like to generate ob in the fast way possible. I need to make about a hundred thousand of these, so time matters...On average the size A and B have a length of about 1000I know zip(A,B) can create a list of tuples but I need the constant at the beginning. Here is the code I am using at them moment, I was wondering if there is a faster way to do this

I suggestion the following solution still based on  built-in function, without any needed import directive:  
use itertools.cycle
