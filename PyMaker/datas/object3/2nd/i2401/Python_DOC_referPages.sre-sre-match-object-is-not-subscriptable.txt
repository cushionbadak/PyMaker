i have below syntax but whenever runs in 3.6 will always threw error:'_sre.SRE_Match' object is not subscriptableScripts is works fine in python3.7 but error in python3.6
Your line here:attempts to access item  of , a  object.Since the  method is implemented since Python 3.6 according to the documentation, your code should work in Python 3.6, and if you are getting a  error, it means that you are not actually using Python 3.6, but an earlier version.Change the line to:and the code would work for earlier versions of Python.
