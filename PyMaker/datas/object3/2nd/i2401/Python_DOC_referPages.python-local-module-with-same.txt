I have a local python code repo like the following. In  I want to import  in . However, because  is under the  module, I cannot import . Since it's a largish repo with a great deal of legacy code, I cannot easily change any directory name. Is there any other workaround?Thanks in advance!
There a couple ways you can do this. The quick and dirty is to just add it to your interpreter's path.Here's my setup:Here's the contents of :and how you can import this function into :this outputs:or you can call it from the  directory and it'll still work fine:You can also just add the  directory to your  environment variable instead of calling . This syntax is shell dependent: so I'll let you google how to set environment variables for your particular shell.Ideally you'd want to make your modules deployable (i.e. use  and  or  and put  in each module), and then you can import "normally" (kind of like you can "just"  and it works). But since you claim it's legacy, maybe this might be hard for you to accomplish. I get it: in legacy systems all bets are off and sometimes the quick and dirty is fine (and maybe even ideal if you don't want to spend a lot of time fixing the issue).I can expand this answer if you're interested in creating deployable python packages, and if not, the above should get the job done.HTH.
