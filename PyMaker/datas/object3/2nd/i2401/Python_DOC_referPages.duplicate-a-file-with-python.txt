I'm trying to figure out how to duplicate a single file for example: I have a file in "C:\ ..." and would like to duplicate this exact same file once. If also possible is there a way to use python to open specific documents?thanks
I think you might be looking for . This will copy the file contents and as much of the file metadata (permissions, ownership, etc) as it can on the platform.  has more notes on what can and can't be copied and how to find out on your platform.
just using system() from os module
Using a module named shutil, the function copy2 can be called with the path of the source file and the corresponding destination directory you want to write to. For example, 
you can copy a file via the command line on windows: open cmd.exe then type  then type . more info hereyou can make python do this for you: you will need the subprocess module which comes integrated into python so you dont have to donwload anything. like this:remember that for this to work your python script should be in the same folder as "yourfile", why? because i type "yourfile" as a relative path relative vs absolute pathsubprocess works for python 3.3 and newer versions so another way to do it would be:to open specific  documents with python take a quick look at here: https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/files/reading-and-writing-files-in-python
