Going through the python tutorial, in section 4.7.1, a mutable default argument is stored somewhere but I can't seem to find it using , ,  or . I'm referring to this code:behaves as:I would expect to see this in the namespace of the function, say when I do  but it is not there.I had a look at this but this is way more than I'm probably looking for.
As per the Python Data Model:  A tuple containing default argument values for those arguments that have defaults, or None if no arguments have a default valueThere is also  for keyword-only arguments.Note that things in Python are not necessarily stored anywhere accessible. For example, the reference count of an object is not available as an attribute. It only exists in the C layer of the CPython implementation and requires builtin magic to access.In fact,  is not a "real" attribute either. It is a builtin property fetching the defaults from wherever the implementation stores them.
It's in :You didn't find  in  because it's not stored in the ; it's stored in a dedicated C-level struct member, which is mapped to the  attribute by a descriptor on the function type.
If you're using Spyder, when you type , autocomplete options should pop up. One of them is , which holds the defaults.
