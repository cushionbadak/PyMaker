Just in case I missed something and before I implement a own solution for the problem.In our build system, I always have to work with relative paths to keep all projects moveable. Therefore the build scripts should generate relative paths to files.Yet it seems there is no function in the python library, which can handle parent path steps as shown in the following example:I would like to get a path to , relative to . Therefore if I start in , the relative path would point to .The best result would be:Take this slightly more complex example:The best result would be:Both examples using the  methods do not work and raise an exception:The  method works as expected, but returns a string instead of a  object:So I wonder if I missed something here...How to I get a relative path with parent directories using Path objects?Why is the  implementation of the  object not working?
Some path x needs to be inside some base path. You're getting the  exception, because project_b is not relative to project_a, but relative to solution folder.For example, to better understand, you should have:EDIT:You can get relative directories in the current folder with  objects using either  or .You're going to find out which one fits better your case.Basically, you can do is:
