I need to see the logs that generated from a python application. This python application runs in a miniconda environment.Is there a way I can check the logs ?
I don't know whether I understand the question correctly. In case your application is using logging object (ref. ) then your output could either be in:Console: from which the application was startedFile: in case that you specified the logging output to a fileIt depends on your configuration and on the logging level as well. Some applications (like Django) use their own configuration to log.
