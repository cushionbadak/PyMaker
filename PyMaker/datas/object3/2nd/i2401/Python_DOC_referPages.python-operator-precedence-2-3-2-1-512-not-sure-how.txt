This question already has an answer here:Why is exponentiation applied right to left?                    3 answers                I am new to Python. Can someone please explain why 2 ** 3 ** 2 ** 1 is evaluated to 512. I understand about PEMDAS and left to right processing here, but couldn't figure out the reason for this output. Thanks much.
