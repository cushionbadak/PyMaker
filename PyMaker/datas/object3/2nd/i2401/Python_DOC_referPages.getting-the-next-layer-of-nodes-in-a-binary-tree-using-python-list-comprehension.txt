I'm working on the LeetCode problem Maximum Depth of Binary Tree, and would like to define a helper function  which, given a list of nodes in one 'layer' of the tree, returns the list of nodes in the next layer. I've tried the following:However, this test fails because  is not defined in the list comprehension:I've tried to compare with examples in https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions but so far don't see how to refactor the list comprehension to get it to work. How can I fix this helper function?UpdateI got the helper function to work when written as follows:However, this seems like the type of pattern that could be refactored using list comprehension.
You confused the order of clauses in the nested list comprehension. Correct expression:Think of a nested LC as a nested loop: an iteration of the outer loop () is executed first.
You should write your s in the list comprehension in another order:The docs for list comprehensions have an example on such a multi-level list comprehension with an explanation how it is evaluated.In your case it would be:Note that changing the order of the two  loops would make no sense, because  would be undefined.  This is exactly what happens in your code.
