I'm learning Learn Python the hard way.Explain why adding the two strings  and  with + makes a longer string.Even I know it can work, but I don't understand why and how? Please help me.
Python uses  to concatenate strings because that's how core developers of Python defined that operator.While it's true that  special method is normally used to implement the  operator,  ( bytecode instruction) does not call  because  treats strings specially in both Python 2 and Python 3. Python invokes the string concatenation function directly if both operands of  are strings, thus eliminating the need to call special methods.Python 3 calls  (source code):Python 2 calls  (source code):This optimization has been in Python ever since 2004. From the issue980695:... in the attached patch ceval.c special-cases addition of two strings (in the same way as it special-cases addition of two integers already)But note that the main goal was greater than elimination of special attribute lookup.For what it's worth,  still works as expected:and Python will call  methods of subclasses of , because  (or , in Python 2) from the code snippets above will be false:
The  method of the class  is called when you add (concatenate) two strings in this manner. The  method works as such, but the following is not verbatim from the source code:Example:
, , , and other operators will work on anything that implements the right methods. Since strings implement the  method, you can add two strings with .Try this: define your own string subclass and override its  method:The same technique, operator overloading, lets you create classes that can use the built-in operators like  or  usefully, like vectors that can be added together.
