I am finding it difficult in writing python code for the below scenarioI have a list called I converted the string to int but it is showing error because of the " " in between.How to calculate the sum of the digits by eliminating the " " in between. Answer should be 19744.
Something like:Or more simply (as pointed out by @wwii):Or even more simply (also as pointed out by @wwii):
Use + and  If you need the sum of all elements, can use  again
Use the  method to split by space:This takes each string on numbers in the list and splits it by space, returning the sum of it. Then each of these 'sums' are fed into the outer  call to get their total. This would look like the following when expanded:Remember that  returns a list of strings, so you still need to cast each item to  before summing it. 
You need to split by space and sum those numbers, one approach is the following:OutputA more robust approach is to provide a default value in case the cast fails:Output
Simple solution is
