I need to parse a localized string to a datetime object,use a datetime object to generate a localized string.The problem is that the default locale ("de_DE") does not match the localized string ("en_US").What options are there to implement the described conversions?
Please note that I have not studied all available libraries and just want to provide a starting point for others to solve their problems.I will use the following localized string during all examples: 1. Methods of 'datetime.datetime'This is the simplest approach, but it becomes unwieldy if you use locales other than the default locale.Information about the syntax can be found here.If you like to parse or format other locales, you have to change the global locale, which could result in undesired side effects. (I do not recommend this approach.) 2. The python library 'arrow'arrow allows you to pass a locale (otherwise it uses "en_US").This is especially useful if the desired locale differs from the default locale. 3. The python library 'babel' (mainly for formatting)The strength of babel is the formatting (Unfortunately, it seems that it can not parse any pattern. Only the format "short" seems reliable.) 4. The python library 'dateparser' (only parsing)dateparser is very powerful. It is able to lookup dates in longer texts and does support non-Gregorian calendar systems, just to name a few features. 5. Last but not leastThe following noteworthy python libraries have great features, but unfortunately I could not use them for this specific problem (or did not know how to use them properly).mayadeloreanpendulum
