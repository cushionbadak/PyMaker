I am trying to accept a sequence of integers separated by comma and would like to trim any blanks that come along with it. I am using below code.While executing the above snippet, I am getting following exception,I could succeed by altering the code if I give input such as 1,3,2 or 1 3 2. But the problem arise if I mix both.Using Python version 2. ( would not mind Python3 solution :) )
