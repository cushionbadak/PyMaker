I have not gone through your logic. Just corrected your code syntactically. You had passed the list without initializing it. Had created an infinite loop( never decremented the param d)
FYI there's a predefined shuffle function in the random packageFor your case, you need to define the array, before passing it to the function
You have quiet a few errors, I worked them out for you and I'll break it down currently working on explanation to all parts of where you went wrong.   First thing first:You are decalring  inside the function we need to move that outside so we can pass it into the function using This should be one line Now the good stuff :) First we have , if you want to use this we have to add something that eventually end this loop so after each run lets add in a , but even so you should be using a  instead which would be  no need to use  here since the amount of cycles is really up to you, the higher you go the more randomization we will get. In this example lets pass  along with our array.Next our Shuffling:In context of your code this would have been a random between  and , since  start at a  index your current  has indexes from so we want a random int in that range, in your code this would have been  since  was .This if says that  which is out of the range of indexes, lets though for the sake of it assume you meant , all this would do only ever give us a index of  which isn't what we want for shuffling we want a random index throughout so lets get rid of that.Lets instead grab another random variable to swap with so we always swap two random numbersHere we generate another random number for an index but also make sure its not equal to the one we are swapping withAnd finally we swap:Again if we use this method we would only ever swap the last digit, with a random digit, and not to mention again that  would be out of range`Instead lets swap two random positionsAnd then we can either:or Hope this helps ! :)
