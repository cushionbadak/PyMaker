Is there the possibility in Python 3 to distiguish the item lookups Foo[(1,2)] and Foo[1,2]? Since inboth produce the same output.Edit: On why I want that: I have a set of Classes that are "parameterized" and I wanted to implent a factory for those classes. e.g.  to instanciate the class with the parameters inferred from  and  to return the class that with the parameters passed via the key.I hoped that  might be used similar to  in the way that you can distinguish  from  similar to the way you can distinguish  from  .
Not easily. Although the source is tokenized differently, the code is eventually parsed the same way:There are two ways I can think of to detect the difference, both insane:Get in before the parser does, by registering a custom codec to use in the coding declaration.Use introspection to find the original source code, and check in there for the parens.A related question concerning the grammar: When are parentheses required around a tuple?
