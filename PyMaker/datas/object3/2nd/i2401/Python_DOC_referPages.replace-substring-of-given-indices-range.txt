I am new in Python programming. I am stuck at one point. Let's say I have string "hello-world". I want to replace all the characters of this string with "*" except first & last. so the result will be .One way to do this as below:If I want to replace all characters with "*" except first & last 2 charactersIs there any pretty way to handle these type of problems. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.
I think what you want to do is this:Turn the string into a list of characters. Replace the ones you want to obscure. Then join the list back into a string.
You can use  (and the  module to check against letters):Since you said you wanted  where the hyphen isn't replaced, you would need to test whether the characters are letters or not. You could change  to:...if you want to include other characters like numbers or punctuation. Or you can write out the letters you want to replace manually. You may also want to perform a check to see whether the string is 3 characters or more so that no errors are raised. 
You could define a function to not repeat yourself:You can also use some kind of string formatting instead of concatenation (which should be more efficient), e.g. f-strings available in 3.6+:
You can try this.
