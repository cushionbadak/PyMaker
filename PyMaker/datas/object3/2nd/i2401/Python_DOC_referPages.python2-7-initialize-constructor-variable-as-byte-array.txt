I know this C# code:can be converted to this Python code:but what if  were instead a byte array as follows:Normally, I would do:but no such variable like  exists in this case to fill that position, leaving me with  which is obviously syntactically invalid.Related to Mimic C# classes in Python
 is not the equivalent of a C# byte. There is no direct equivalent of a C# byte in Python; the closest would be an ordinary int. I would consider the most direct translation of that C# class to be objects are immutable sequences of bytes. If you want a mutable sequence of bytes, either a  or an ordinary  would be appropriate, or an  array. I'd probably go with the list unless I had specific reason to do otherwise, really:Note that  and  represent sequences of unsigned bytes; their elements go from 0 to 255, not from -128 to 127. An  would be a sequence of signed bytes.
