Sorry if this post is a dupli,I couldn't find an answer... I have the following code:I would expect that the  would return 10.0 and the  returns in this case , the last number being equal to the . For some reason, python returns Can someone please explain why?
What you're seeing is floating point inaccuracies.And in case you're wondering how you end up with floats when finding the determinant of a matrix made up of integers (where the usual calculation method is just ),  uses LU decomposition to find the determinant.  This isn't very efficient for 2x2 matrices, but is much more efficient when you have bigger matrices.For your 2x2, you get:The determinant is just the product of the diagonals from this, which ends up being , which resolves to  due to floating point errors.
