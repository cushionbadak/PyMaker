I'm trying to rename a list of 470 files with the name ,  etc to a specific name for each file. So I've got a list (.txt or .xls) in the correct order for those filenames, but I'm unable to figure out a for loop to rename this in a batch. I've checked other threads on this forum and Google, but unable to get the result i need. Hopefully someone has a solution for this... Python or cmd window are both possible.So in short:p01.pdf --> Blabla.pdf p02.pdf --> Othertext.pdf   ....
For a batch solution, create text file and add the names seperated by comma and let's call it something like :Then do as a batch file:or directly from console (cmd.exe) This is the exact same, we just use a single  instead of double 
Python 3First export your old and new filenames to a  file. Its content should be formatted like :Then create a python file  in the same directory.The script reads line per line from that file and uses  to rename your files accordingly:Now, to execute your script, open cmd.exe in that directory and type:Different PathsIf your files aren't all in the same directory just add their paths to the  like so:Pro-Tip: Navigate to that folder in Windows Explorer where all the files are, press CTRL + L to highlight the navigation bar, write  and confirm by pressing ENTER.  should now directly open with the correct path to your folder already set.
