More informationBelow is my code. I am in the process of making a small program that finds Palindromes. I want the program to take user input, save it to a variable, and then check for any spaces. If it finds a space to save its index, and then to take it out to check for a Palindromes. Out of curiosity and to further my programming skills, I want to be able to add the space back later while the word is in reverse. For example, nurses run = nursesrun backward and forwards, but I also want to display it backward and add the space back.Also, if you have any suggestions for how I can improve my ability to ask this question or a better way I can write this question, please let me know. Thank you for reading.
Just reverse  instead of reconstructing the modified !    Also  in your example isn't storing the index of the space -- it's storing the number of spaces in your input string.
As per the other answer, just for displaying you can print  instead of . But if you want to learn how get the original positions of spaces, here are a few hints:word.find(" ") will give you the index of the first space or -1 if none found, you can save it into a list, and than call  to call the next one, where  is the index of last found space, until you get -1 which means no more spacesanother, more educated (to my opinion), would to enumerate the string and collect all indexes for spaces in a list using list comprehension (or set, of you don't care about the order).
