Natural Text
I am working on a program, and I have written out a simplified version of what I'm trying to achieve. I want to line up dollar signs on the left hand side, while still keeping the decimals lined up on the right. Here is my code so far-The output lines up so that the decimals are all in a row, and the random number is right before a decimal. The problem is, when I try to add a dollar sign to the  it says it isn't compatible because the formatting doesn't work with strings.. Is there a different format option I should use, or is there a different way to arrange it? Any help would be appreciated. I just created an account here today and I've only been programming for about a few weeks so sorry if this is poorly written.
There are a few things you can do to improve this:The string formatting methods don't require the formatting string to be separated from the surrounding text. The "right" way to use them is to embed the formatting codes into a longer string, then attach the values at the end.You are using the older "printf" style formatting, but it is considered preferable to use the newer  method for new code. If you want to place the currency symbol close to your number, but also pad to the left of that up to a certain width, you will need to do it in two steps (first format the number with the currency symbol, then pad to the left), as described in this answer.With that in mind, here's some code that should do the job:
ThisGives output:I don't know how to nest the number formatting into the same statement as the string padding, though.
