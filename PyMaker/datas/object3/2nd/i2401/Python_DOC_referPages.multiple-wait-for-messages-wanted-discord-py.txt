Natural Text
Basically I am making a quiz and I want to be able to search through the answers and determine which message only has the artist in, which message only has the song name in, and which message says them both. I've made 3 check functions to show this however I want all 3 wait_for_message statements to run side by side. Any ideas on how this could be remedied?
The code you are looking for is . This lets you run multiple coroutines at the same time and wait until all methods are returned.The return list from gather is in the order of the inputs, not in the order of task completion.Since the rewrite version of discord.py has  throw an error instead of returning None, you can instead do this.
