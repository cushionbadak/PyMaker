This question already has an answer here:Intersecting two dictionaries in Python                    8 answers                Say, for example, we have the following dictionaries:What is the most efficient way of intersecting the keys of both dictionaries?Of course, one can use , but I assume converting the dictionary to a set first is not efficient at all. 
 is a view and has the intersection operatorOr simply
The  view object supports set operations:However, for smaller dictionaries using a set will probably be faster:Note that  accepts any iterable as an argument, so you can just pass  to it. Also, no need to call as a  object by default iterates over its keys.
