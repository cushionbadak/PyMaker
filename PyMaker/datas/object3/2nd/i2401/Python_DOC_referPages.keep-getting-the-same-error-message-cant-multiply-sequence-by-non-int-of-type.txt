I am trying to return the value of the horizontal component of force based on the user's inputs, and I have this, but keep getting the same error message that I 'can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'float'', and have run out of ideas as to what is wrong with it.
That should work:Comments: I could not reproduce your problem. In anycase the  method lets you check if a variable has a certain type. But that is not necessary since you already changed the type after the input. If somebody would type a letter for example it will raise a  which you should catch. How to do this is explained here:https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/errors.html
