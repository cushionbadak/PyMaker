I am using imapala shell to compute some stats  over a text file containing the table names I am using python multiprocessing module to pool the processes.The thing is thing task is very time consuming . So I need to keep track of how many files have been completed to see the job progress.So let me give you some ideas about the functions that I am using. is the function that takes a list of tables and perform the tasks. is the functions , that takes file location , no of executors(pool_workers), converts the file containing table to list of tables and does the multiprocessing thing I want to see the progress like how much file has been processed by job_executor , But I can't find a solution . Usin a counter also doesn't work . Help Me 
If you insist on needlessly doing it via , the easiest way to keep a track of what's going on is to use a non-blocking mapping (i.e. ):This will check every 100ms if some of the processes finished processing and if something changed since the last check it will print out the number of lines processed so far. If you need more insight into what's going on with your subprocesses, you can use some of the shared structures like  or  structures to directly report from within your processes.
