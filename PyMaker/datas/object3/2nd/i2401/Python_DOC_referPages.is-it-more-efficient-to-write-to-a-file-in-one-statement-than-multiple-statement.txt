I'm running loop that writes around 10000 lines to a file. I've been searching but can't find whether it's more efficient to concatenate a string in a write statement, or use multiple write statements. ie:orIs the first or second option more efficient?I imagine this has been asked before and I'm asking the question in a strange way, so if someone can point me in the right direction that'd be fantastic!
The default behaviour for the  method, when not specifying a buffering mode, is to follow the system default which is usually line-buffered. Which means that Python will flush the output to the file (i.e. do a write operation), for every new-line it finds. So I would presume in this example that both operations, as far as file IO performance is concerned, are equivalent, seeing as the new-line character is the last thing output.
