Natural Text
In python, I encoded numbers using It returns In cpp, how could I decode such string into a tuple of integers? 
It should be fairly simple to unpack that string, you can just copy the bytes out into the appropriate sized integer:
 is long long so 64 bit signed integers. From https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html:You could read this buffer and copy into an array of 2 long long (64 bit using  define)prints:I didn't handle endianness here. Just assumed they were the same. But if you want that, just swap the bytes using the size of the type and you're good to go.
