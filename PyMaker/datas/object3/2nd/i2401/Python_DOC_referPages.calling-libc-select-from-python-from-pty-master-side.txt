I'm trying to create a simulated TTY connected target device that I can connect to via i.e. minicom. I'm using  to create a pty and print out the slave name to be opened by i.e. minicom: . On the python side I then use os.read and os.write to do io and simulate my target:The whole process is quite combersome. I would like to use  on the python side which forces my to use ctypes again. I cannot wrap the self.fd3 into a file using  because I need to prevent  being called on self.fd3.So I have two questions:Does anyone know a readymade python library that handles pty creation and manipulation when implementing the pty master side in python?If not: Is there a example somewhere that describes howto call libc.select via ctypes?
As @CristiFati stated Python's select can be used for FDs, however for the sake of completeness below is my dirty hack for using ctype's select. This implements an tty echo server. Connect to the pty slave that is printed out, i.e.
