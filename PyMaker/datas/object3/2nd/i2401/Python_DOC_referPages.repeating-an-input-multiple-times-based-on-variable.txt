So I'm new to python and having a complete mental block as to how I can elegantly repeat this input for the product name based on the value of num_qc.So for example if num_qc = 4I would want the user to enter nam_prod1, nam_prod2 etc... As far as my understanding goes, I wouldnt want to pre-define these variables as the user could only enter 1 for num_qc or 50?
