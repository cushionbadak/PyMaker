Natural Text
I'm trying to take two things out of text files that are in folders and output them into a neat list in a single text file. I've never done something like this before and all of the online resources are either too simple for my task or too complex for my task.I have a feeling this task is specific to what I'm trying to do.All I'm trying to do is take the "displayname" and "author" text fields and output them to a file in a list with the format "(displayname) by (author)" a parser was the first thing that came to my mind when I wanted to try this (and python I heard was a good choice for this).So if anyone could point me in the right direction or give me some building blocks that would be helpful. 
You don't need to write a parser; this is (almost) standard .ini file format, which can be read by the configparser module. You'll just need to strip the quotes when you output the values.To get you started:
