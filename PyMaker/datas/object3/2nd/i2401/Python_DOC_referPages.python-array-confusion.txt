This question already has an answer here:What does “list comprehension” mean? How does it work and how can I use it?                    4 answers                I'm a python newbie. I come from a C/C++ background and it's really difficult for me to get my head around some of python's concepts. I have stumbled upon this block of code which just plain confuses me:So, it's an array that joins  with a variable  (both strings), which is initially uninitialized. The for loop then populates the variable  if the condition  is true.Now, from my C/C++ perspective I see this:A for loop that has an if statement that returns  or . Where is the logic that excludes all the files that don't end with  extension?
This syntax is called list comprehension. It constructs a list by evaluating expression after the opening square bracket for each element of the embedded  loop that meets criteria of the .

Python defines list comprehensions asA list comprehension consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, then zero or more for or if clauses. The result will be a new list resulting from evaluating the expression in the context of the for and if clauses which follow it.Syntactically, the code you gave is the same as If you want to learn more about list comprehensions, you can find out more here: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions
