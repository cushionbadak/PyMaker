Sometimes when I use a for loop to iterate through lines of a file, I get each letter separately instead of each line. Can someone explain why that is?
See iter() and Iterator TypesIf s type is a itereable,  will take all values of your iterable in turn. What exactly  becomes is hidden inside the  implementation of the object you are iterating over (afaik). If you iterate over a , it will present you with all values in turns.If you iterate over a , it will present you with all  in turns.If you iterate over a , it will present you each character in turn.Generators and sequences also provide iterating over, see Understanding generators in Python and Sequence Types If you iterate over a file, you will get (textfile, not binary) it line by line, unless you call other methods on the file first ():Demodata:Iterate of file using it as iterable:Output:Iterate over file.read():Output:Iterate over file using readline():Output:Iterate over file using readlines():Output:Iterage over binary file:Output:
