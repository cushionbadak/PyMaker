Is it possible to use assertRaises with multiple types of exceptions. Some thing likeboth these errors occur in my code at different places with the same call.How can I write a singel assertRaises statement to handle both. As you can imagine the unit test case fails when only one of the execptions is mentioned.
Straight from the docs:Test that an exception is raised when callable is called with any  positional or keyword arguments that are also passed to  assertRaises(). The test passes if exception is raised, is an error if  another exception is raised, or fails if no exception is raised.
