This question already has an answer here:How to input a regex in string.replace?                    7 answers                I'm using the following function to remove a specific string pattern from files in a directory:The pattern is as follows, where A is any capital letter, and # is any number between 0-9: A## - A## - My regex matches this format on regex101. When I run the above function, it completes without error, however no directory names change. Where am I going wrong?
 string method does not support regular expressions. You need to import the  module and use its sub method.So your code might look like this:But don't forget about flags and such.Edit: Removed  from the pattern as the filenames don't end there.
