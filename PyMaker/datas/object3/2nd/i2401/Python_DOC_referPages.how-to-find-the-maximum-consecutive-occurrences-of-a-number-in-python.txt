I want to find out the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of a number in python.I am using the following code from stack overflow.I get the following answer:The answer should be 5456 because it occurred 3 times.Can any body help me to resolve the issue?
the only change you need isyour code is comparing the length of the current group with the last .this returns the last item with maximal consecutive occurrence (if there were three times  later in the list this would be selected).
You can simplify that code by using the built-in  function to find the maximum .outputThere's no need to give  that inefficient : if you don't give it a key function it uses the identity function by default.FWIW, there's a more efficient way to calculate the length of a  group. It doesn't matter here, but it's handy when the groups are large. Rather than converting the group to a list & getting its length, we can loop over the group and use the built-in  to count the items in the group. Just change to 
You can use the following generator expression:This outputs:
