Natural Text
I'm trying to read a file and when I'm reading it, I'm getting a unicode error.Error:Why is this happening? I'm trying to run the same on Linux system, but on Windows it runs properly. 
As it looks, default encoding is ascii while Python3 it's utf-8, below syntax to open the file can be usedCheck your system default encoding, If it's not UTF-8, reset the encoding of your system.
