I have a function which accepts both regular and asynchronous functions (not coroutines, but functions returning coroutines).Internally it uses  test to see which type of function it got.Recently it broke down when I attempted to create a partial async function.In this demonstration,  is not recognized as a couroutine function, even if it returns a coroutine, i.e.  is a coroutine.The problem cause is clear, but the solution is not.How to dynamically create a partial async func which passes the test?ORHow to test the func wrapped inside a partial object?Either answer would solve the problem.
You can't make a  object pass that test, because the test requires there to be a  object attached directly to the object you pass to .You should instead test the function object that  wraps, accessible via the [ attribute[(https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.partial.func):If you also need to test for  objects, then test against :
