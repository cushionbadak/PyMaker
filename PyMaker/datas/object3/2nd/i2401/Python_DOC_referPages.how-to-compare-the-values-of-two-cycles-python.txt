Natural Text
I have two cycles:First cycle refers to one json (this is part)and from there get codes airports (ААЕ, ААН, etc.).The second cycle refers to another json that stores codes of airports and city names.I can not understand how can I compare the airport codes received so that, in case of a coincidence, I get the name of the city
You can save the values in a dictonary, indexed by city/airport codes.my_dic ={}Then, on the first loop,my_dic[airport_code] = airportAnd un second loop, you can look for an element in your dic with the code you have: my_dic[city_code]That raises an exception if the key does not exist. You can use my_dic.get(city_code) which returns None if the key doesn't exist
If I understood correctly, you need to use the difflib library. I might be wrong. But let me try suggesting anyway.Right now I am also trying to figure out how to compare two text files, but for all I know, comparing a line of text could be done using the following:See , but I haven't quite figured how to properly use that one yet. It compares lines and displays: removed lines, new lines and modified lines. Could be exported into a separate file.I'd probably try using  in your case.EDIT: But looking at your jsons to compare, there's a lot of different lines, so you'll receive a lot of unneeded lines.
