I have the following code in two modules.Module "main":Module "B":If I run this code I get:Why is variable "a" not set to "1" ?If I activate the commented line of code in Module "main" ( api_a() ) the variable "a" will be set to "1". Why is the variable not set when the function api_a() is called via the thread?In the example code I skipped the use of locks to make the code thread-safe.Any ideas?Thanks a lot in advance,Thomas
Such behavior occurs, because you passed  as the argument to python ().When you execute a script in such way, python interprets  module as , but  module still updates  variable instead of , because  has re-imported your main.py module as .So to make it work, we can either update  in  function from perspective of  module OR print  variable instead of  from perspective of  module. or  docs
