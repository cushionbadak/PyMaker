I want to dynamically add arguments to a function  that calls another function.If I do not copy the  object from  to , Python crashes as soon as I try to call .If I try to copy the old closure object to the modified function, it does not fit: "#ValueError: run_func requires closure of length 0, not 1"How can I do the modification properly so the modified function does not crash?
The easiest way to add parameters to a function is to replace it with another function that accepts  and/or . You can then also assign a fake  to the new function's  attribute in order to get a nice output from the  function.Code:Function and class reference: is used to obtain the wrapped function's signature instances are created to alter the obtained signature is used to match the received  and  to the function's parameters
