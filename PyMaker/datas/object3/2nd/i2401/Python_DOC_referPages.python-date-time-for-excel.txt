How to convert following dates in excel in float values by Python.Problem Statement: I have a dates data in which dates are entered but users and users used different cell format to enter dates.For example some used cell format as and some used  in excel cell while entering the data  ( in fact user used different excel format for dates in their files).When I am trying to consolidate dates then find that dates are  in different cell formats randomly. In excel I can copy dates column and paste all in a separate column as a value only,It gives me integer value which is same regardless and format used in cell. And later applied a single format to all value and gets all my dates in same format.But , I want to make a script in Python in which first: all different cell formats for dates are converted to float value (like i do in excel) then I will convert all dates back to standard format i.e .Formet  Dates   format  Date in numeric value   Reformatted in excle as  dd-mm-yyyyformat 1    30-08-2018  dd-mm-yyyy  43342.51551 30-08-2018format 2    08-30-2018  mm-dd-yyyy  43342.51551 30-08-2018
No script can tell you, if 03-05-2014 means 3rd May or 5th March. It's not God and can't do, what you're unable to do.Only clues:If some value consists of four digits, it's the year.If one value is higher than twelve, you can say that this value must be the day (or the year)If there are several date values by the same user, you may presume that he or she kept consistlently one format and deduce the format from another field.
Before answering your question, you need to know the special term for:dates in excel in float valueswhich is actually so called Serial Date in excelAnswerAssuming that the frameworks you use to read excel file does not convert cell values according to their format.The easiest way to achieve this is first manually set the format of cells with dates value to Number format to get the serial date value.Then, when you read the excel file you can convert serial date to datetime object with the following method:Now, you may then convert to any format you want with datetime.strftime
