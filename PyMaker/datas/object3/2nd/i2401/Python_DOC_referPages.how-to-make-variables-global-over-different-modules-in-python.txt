I have a small project where I need to initially introduce and use some quite large number of variables.Obviously, I can make some configure file, where I set up all the values of the variables. I have made just some Python file, where I give values:and call the file . When I do , I have all the variables with values initialized.Nevertheless, I have different modules in project with different subroutines (methods in it) and I want to have all those values from  known in every method and in every module.Obviously, I can do  in every module and/or  in every subroutine, but is it the best way how to implement the initialization of variables? 
Using a module as you describe is a viable way to setup configuration values for a script, but there are a few reasons you might be better off with something else.A few others in the comments have pointed out that  is frowned upon because it clutters up the root namespace with lots of variable names making it much easier to accidentally have name conflicts. Keeping them under the module name (ex: ) helps from an organizational standpoint in keeping track of names and preventing conflict.If you plan to distribute code that requires configuration, using a  module opens up your code to arbitrary code execution of anything that gets typed in that file. This is where things like ".ini .json .cfg etc" files are very useful. As an added bonus by using a common format (like json) it makes the configuration easy to port to other languages if a colleague is using a different language but needs to work on the same project. Off the top of my head, python includes libraries for .xml .json and .ini files.
In my opinion a solution that I would implement for that issue is to create a , as you said, and then define in it global variables as dictionary structures in order to be properly organized and easy-to-use on the modules that will be imported.For example:You need to avoid the  statement because you could put a lot of imports into the namespace and because it's not explicit about what is importing. So doing at the top of each module  you could use it without the need of importing explicitly every single variable that you want to use or without importing the entire module. I prefer that solution, and also could be better if you use json files to store the info of that global variables and then read and serialize them in the conf.py module before being imported in your required modules.
I generally agree with @@Aaron. What he outlined is very general / portable and safe.Since  is an antipattern, you could easily do  and then reference its values like .I think it's fine to use  files when needed. Aaron's point is good, but as long as the config is controlled by the person running the app, there's no security issue. The main reason to allow  files is when some of the config items need to be derived from other config items, or looked up / loaded at run time. If there's no need for that (config is 100% flat and static) then  or another flat file approach as Aaron mentioned would be best.
