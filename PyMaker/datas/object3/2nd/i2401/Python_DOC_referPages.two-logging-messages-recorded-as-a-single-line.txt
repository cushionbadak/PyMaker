I'm migrating from using  statements everywhere in my scripts to  a more serious logging system. I'm using the  module to manage the task. There's one thing I can't seem to achieve with it though:In some cases, I want to create a log entry in two distinct steps, but recorded on the same line. Something that would classically look like this:In this case, the  part would be recorded only if the task is successful.I used to achieve that with the following print commands:Is there a way to achieve a similar thing with the  module? Something like
You could use a  such as a  together with a custom formatter to achieve what you want. This approach buffers records in memory until flushed, and the flushing writes to a target handler and allows you to potentially merge two logging records into a single output event.
I am not sure it is a good idea. I don't think that logs are meant to be used this way. You will often see before your log message informations about date, time, nature of the log message.Do you really want a line like this : on the same line ?Often you will parse your logs using other technologies (I often parse logs with awk) and I'm sure I would be very disturbed by that kind of logs.
