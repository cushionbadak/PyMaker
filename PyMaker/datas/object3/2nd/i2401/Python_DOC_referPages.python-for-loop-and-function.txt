Am new to python and I have been trying to solve this problem but it does not seem to work as intended. your help is highly appreciated:Given two numbers X and Y, write a function that:returns even numbers between X and Y, if X is greater than Y else returns odd numbers between x and y.
Try this code it's working as per your need.The outputs are:Let me know if this doesn't serve your purpose.
And it is done. Basically if , you need to switch the first . You append the items normally(using  instead of ), and then return the full list, got it?Working sample: https://py3.codeskulptor.org/#user302_nwBq00w56n_1.py
Instead of testing for oddness/evenness all the time, use  range(start,stop[,step])  with a step of 2 starting with a (corrected, known) odd/even number:You need to also switch  and  if you do not need to iterate a range and add its element to a  iteratively - simply stuff the range-sequence into the  constructor and return itOutput:
It's so easy to do, and there are several ways to do what do you want, so i show you two ways to do that, first an understandable way and second an easy way ok let's start:-First exampleSecond exampleNote : But be sure that in both of my answers the  number is inclusive(exists in searching function) and the  number is exclusive, so if you wanted to make both of them inclusive so make loops  and if you wanted to make both of them exclusive just change loops to .
Knowing that  we then can just use  for evens since  will evaluate to true, here it is with comprehension and in extended form    Full loop:
Here in this i use the list comprehensions.list comprehension is a easy and readable technique in python.In this i include both x and y
