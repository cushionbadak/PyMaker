It probably is a problem with  versions, the original code of  using  and you using .Looking at the source code line where error originates, we can see that it calls the dictionaries  method and tries to access its members by position.Here is the problem:In ,  returns a list of tuples.In ,  returns a view, which cannot be accessed by position, only iterated over.Short answer: you cannot use the  repo with ; maybe some patching can be done, or you can just copy and modify the source code yourself instead of relying on the external repo.
