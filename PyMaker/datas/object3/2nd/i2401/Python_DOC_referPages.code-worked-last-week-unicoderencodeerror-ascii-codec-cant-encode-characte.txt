So, i wrote this code last week and everything ran just fine. I'm able to download the file, but now it's throwing me an error message when it tries to send the email.  I've looked around and i can't seem to find anything that specifically address this issue.  UnicoderEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode characters in position 651-652: ordinal not in rande(128)Any and all help is appreciated. 
needed to be added when setting payload and header.  Code in question has been corrected to reflect solution.
