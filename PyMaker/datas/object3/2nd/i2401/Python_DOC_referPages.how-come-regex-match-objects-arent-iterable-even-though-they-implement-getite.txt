As you may know, implementing a  method makes a class iterable:However, this doesn't hold true for regex match objects:It's worth noting that this exception isn't thrown in the  method, because that method isn't even implemented:So, how is it possible to implement  without making the class iterable?
There are lies, damned lies and then there is Python documentation.Having  for a class implemented in C is not enough for it to be iterable. That is because there are actually 2 places in the  where the  can be mapped to:  and . Both have a slot for  ([1], [2]).Looking at the source of the ,  is initialized to  whereas  is defined.The  built-in function, if called with one argument, will call the , which has the following code:It first checks the  slot (obviously  for  objects); and failing that, then if  returns true, a new sequence iterator, else a  is raised. first checks if the object is a  or a  subclass - and returns false in that case. Otherwise it returns the value of and since  was  for a  instance, 0 will be returned, and  raises .
