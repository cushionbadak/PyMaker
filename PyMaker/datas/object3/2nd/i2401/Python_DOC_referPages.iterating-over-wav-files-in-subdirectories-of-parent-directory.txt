Cheers everybody,I need help with something in python 3.6 exactly. So i have structure of data like this: I'm currently working from a directory where main directory is placed so I don't need to specify paths before that. So firstly I wanna iterate over my main directory and find all subdirectorys. Then in each of them I wanna find the .wav files, and when done with processing them I wanna go to next subdirectory and so on until all of them are opened, and all .wav files are processed. Exactly what I wanna do with those .wav files is input them in my program, process them so i can convert them to numpy arrays, and then I convert that numpy array into some other object (working with tensorflow to be exact, and wanna convert to TF object). I wrote about the whole process if anybody has any fast advices on doing that too so why not.I tried doing it with for loops like:The problem is that it always raises error 13, Permission denied showing on that data_path I gave him but when I go to properties there it seems okay and all permissions are fine.I tried some other ways like with os.open or i replaced for loop with:and it always raises permission denied error. os.walk works in some way but it's not what I need, and when i tried to modify it id didn't give errors but it also didnt do anything.Just to say I'm not any pro programmer in python so I may be missing an obvious thing but ehh, I'm here to ask and learn. I also saw a lot of similiar questions but they mainly focus on .txt files and not specificaly in my case so I need to ask it here.Anyway thanks for help in advance.
Edit: If you want an example for glob (more sane), here it is:For more info see  on the documentation. Glob patterns are a useful thing to know.Previous answer:Try using either glob or . Here is an example for .Note that you may be confused about what  does. It opens a file for reading, writing, and appending. Directories are not files, and therefore cannot be opened.I suggest that you Google for documentation and do more reading about the functions used. The documentation will help more than I can.Another good answer explaining in more detail can be seen here.
In terms of permissions on a path A/B/C... A, B and C must all be accessible.  For files that means read permission.  For directories, it means read and execute permissions (listing contents).
