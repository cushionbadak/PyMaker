I just installed python on VS Code and I can't run any python code using  command.python command:It seems to use the  command by default and it does not recognize it.When I right click and choose  it complains:Same goes for manually running .When I open an elevated PowerShell and run , it complains:py command:It doesn't try to use  command but it recognizes it. And when I manually call , it works.When I manually do  it writes my Question:How can I make it compile/run in VS Code simply by using the CodeRunner's right-click feature ()?I already have both Python folder and its Scripts folder in PATH.I'm using  and I have installed  on my machine and have checked its installer checkbox for adding the environment variables automatically. (PATH is ok)I also installed :  and  and  extensions on the VS Code.This is my  code:
The Windows installer for Python does not put  on your path by default (there's a checkbox during installation to add it). Make sure that you selected an interpreter that's installed by running  and choosing the interpreter you want (the extension will find them through the registry).
It turned out that I just had to restart my computer after I installed  and  and  extensions on the VS Code and added python's  folder in .Now both  and  commands work from anywhere like  or  in the right click menu.
