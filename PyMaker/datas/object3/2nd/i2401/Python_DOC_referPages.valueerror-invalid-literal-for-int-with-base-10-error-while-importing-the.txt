I am using Ubuntu 18.04 OS while importing requests module in Interactive shell the below error is being noticedDon't know whyI have installed requests using pip3as belowpip3 install requests and when i try to uninstall requests using pip3 uninstall requests it goes good and even at installing it shows it has installed succesfully with version number`
You named your own module , and it's shadowing the built-in  module. The additional errors are caused by the error handling hook itself having errors, but it's ultimately caused by them expecting the built-in module and getting your unrelated module. Don't name-shadow built-in modules.It looks like there is a further error where your own  tried to do  and failed because it read nothing from , but that's a fairly obvious error (either you entered nothing, or you launched it in such a way that  was closed).
