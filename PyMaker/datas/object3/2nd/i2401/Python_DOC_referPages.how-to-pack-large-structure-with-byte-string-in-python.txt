I am new to python and am looking for guidance in packing a byte string into a python ctypes class that corresponds to a C structure with ~100 fields. Is there another way besides defining a very large (and error prone) format string for use with pack()? This task is very easy in C with memcpy(). My goal for this task is to display and analyze the fields.Thank you.
 subclasses let you define the same structure in Python, with a memory layout that could be -ed into via a . It's more typing, but it's also far less error-prone than long  format strings.Once defined, the  equivalent in Python would be: uses the buffer protocol to create a view of the underlying raw memory,  returns a new view of the complicated structure as raw bytes, then  is used to slice assign from a bytes-like object.There are also alternate constructors that can copy directly from a buffer if you have one available at construction time, e.g.:or if  is a mutable  (or some other mutable bytes-like object) you can actually make a structure backed by it directly:
