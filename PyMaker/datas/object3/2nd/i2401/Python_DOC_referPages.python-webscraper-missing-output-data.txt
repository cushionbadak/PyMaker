Natural Text
I'm trying to scrape reviews from a website and store them to a csv using Python (3.7) & BeautifulSoup.  It seems the scrape is successful, but when I write to the file, only one column contains full data, and the rest just the first character.Any hints would be greatly appreciated, and sorry if it's glaringly obvious - it's a fresh hobby :)Thanks!

By using  you're getting the first character from that element text.You can try just:Besides that, consider using the  module for reading/writing CSV files.
