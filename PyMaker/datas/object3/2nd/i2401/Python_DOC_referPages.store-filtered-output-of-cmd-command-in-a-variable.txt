I am trying to store the output of a cmd command as a variable in python. To achieve  this i am using  but  just runs the process,it doesn't capture the output. Then i tried to use the  module.I am getting the following error FileNotFoundError: [WinError 2] The system cannot find the file  specifiedHow can I store the output of the command as a variable?
The issues here:passing arguments like this (string in a list, with spaces) is really not recommendedpassing arguments like this need  for it to have a slight chance to work, and  is known for security issues (and other issues as well, like non-portability) is not standard on windows, and the pattern is a regex which means you'd probably have to escape  ().when not found  returns 1 and would make  fail.when found  returns match(es), and a newline, that you'd have to stripI'd rewrite this:as:The second line is a "native" version of grep (without regexes). It returns the first occurrence of "bt.line" in the output lines or empty string if not found.You don't need  here (the above is not strictly equivalent, as it yields the first occurrence, not all the occurrences but that should be okay on your case). And your clients may not have  installed on Windows.
Hey I got the same problem as you. Sub-process can do what you want even with the . The trick is the communicate() method.Now you just need a little function to scan the  for the information you need: , etc
