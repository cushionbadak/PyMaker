I'd like to check the values of a tuple of tuples. In addition to checking each value of each tuple, I need to also compare the last element in one tuple to the first element in the next tuple.Can I iterate over a tuple of tuples without flattening it into a list? This is what I came up with that doesn't flatten into a list, but I can't compare last element of one tuple to first element of next tuple:For the tuple of tuples: ((0,1,2),(3,4,5),(6,7,8)), I get this error:
Start with taking the last element of the first tuple and then iterate through the rest of the tuples. Based on your question, here is a possible solution:
You want to iterate over pairs to allow comparison through consecutive tuples, itertool's recipes suggests the following implementation.The  implementation has the advantage of working with any kind of iterable, including consumables such as generators.
