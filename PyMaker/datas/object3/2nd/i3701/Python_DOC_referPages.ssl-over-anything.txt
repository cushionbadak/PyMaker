I would like to use SSL over something other than sockets. The  TLS/SSL wrapper is only for socket objects. For example I have my own IPC class such as: In these scheme I would like to wrap this above class to the  Python module. Is this something possible. Notice this  class is p2p communication. In the real world. I would like to use MQTT for the data exchange. I guess one option is to write a duck-type class to mimic a Socket Object, but I am sure there is a better option.
With recent versions of Python (3.5+) one is no longer bound to use SSL only with sockets but one can use memory buffers as a more abstract layer. How these buffers are the transferred to the peer is up to the application, i.e. it can use sockets directly but also implement protocols such as this proposal which essentially transports the SSL memory buffers by encoding these into base64 inside JSON and transporting then this JSON within a weakly authenticated HTTPS channel.To use memory buffers follow the documentation or have a look at example code.
