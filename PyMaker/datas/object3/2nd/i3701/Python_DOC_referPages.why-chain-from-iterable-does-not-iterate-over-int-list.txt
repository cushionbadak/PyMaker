why  gives error if argument given to it is  which is a list of integers instead it works perfectly fine when  is passed to it.
If you look at the source of chain.from_iterable:You can see that it expects an iterable, such as a list, of iterables. This works fine if you have, e.g., a list of strings. However, if your list elements cannot be iterated over, and that applies to any numeric value such as an int, it will throw the error you got.
