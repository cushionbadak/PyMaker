I was trying to apply what others have suggested from here:Beautiful Soup: Accessing <li> elements from <ul> with no idBut I can't get it to work. It seems the person from that question had a 'parent'  header, but the one I am trying to parse does not.Here is the webpage I am scraping:https://nvd.nist.gov/(I think) I located the element I need to manipulate, it's  and its following  sections. I basically want to scrape for the section that says "Last 20 Scored Vulnerability IDs & Summaries" and based off of what the vulnerabilities are, send an email to the appropriate department of my work place.Here is my code so far:this code returns NoneI'm at a loss
