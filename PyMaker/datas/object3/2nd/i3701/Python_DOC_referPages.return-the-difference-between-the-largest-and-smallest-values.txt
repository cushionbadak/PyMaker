Given an array length 1 or more of ints, return the difference between the largest and smallest values in the list. Note: I don't want to use min and max function.. [10,3,5,6] - 7 , [7,2,10,9] - 8 Here is my logic, first I will display the list of the inputted value and then I will use sort method to sort the list to find the min and max number from the list and then I will deduct from the max to min number but I am not able to achieve the result, Here is my code so far.. The above code is not even sorting the numbers thus not able to move ahead,  please help. 
The main issue is you need to split by whitespace (or another delimiter) in order for a user to submit multiple numbers via a single .Since  splits by whitespace and returns a , you can  each element to  and pass to . Here's an example:
A variation in your approach could be using an endless loop in which numbers are input until 'exit' typed by the user.
