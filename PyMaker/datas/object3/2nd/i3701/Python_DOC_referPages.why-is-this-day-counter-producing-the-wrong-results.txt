Hi I'm a beginner at Python and am currently using Python 3.4.1 on PyCharm. I have recently made a project that calculates the amount of days between 2 dates, but there are 2 problems.The first problem is that the counter returns an incorrect number of days between 2 dates. The second is that def get_second_day repeats at the end for some reason. I'll show you what I mean:I know for a fact there are exactly 1,000 days between 10/09/03 and 06/06/06, yet the project returns 1,087 days. If anyone could explain why this project is returning an incorrect number, as well as why it asks me to fill the second date again at the end, that would be perfect.As this is my first question and I'm a beginner at Python, I apologise in advance for any weird phrasing/bad practices seen in this question.
Problem 1:Your leap year calculation is off: Leap years are  but only for years not  unless they are also :Problem 2:In your input you premultiply the year by 365 w/o checking for leap-years - they schould have 366 days but got 365 - which would result in lacking days when computing the amount of days for years that leap(ed).Problem 3:You have a controlflow-issue: the  repeats because you do:fix it by putting a  after  inside Suggestions:You can streamline the input by reducing the amount of duplicate code between  and  - this follows the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself):A better solution would utilize datetime and datettime-parsing, especially if you want to handle input validation and leap-year estimation you would need far more checks.Using  module would simplyfy this a lot:Output:Good read: How to debug small programs (#1) - following it, could have at least lead you to the control-flow issue.
