I have a list of dir with name encoded in 'gbk', for example:However, when I use  is return a list of str, like below:How can I cast the string to byte and decode it to get the original characters? I tried  but still not working.Thanks.
You've used the string representation of  objects as the name of your directories, instead of creating directories using the encoded byte string as the name. To undo the plunder you could in this particular case use  to evaluate the string representation and then decode the resulting  object:Please note that  is used here only to recover the directory names and you should recreate them properly; in other words they should not have been created this way to begin with.
