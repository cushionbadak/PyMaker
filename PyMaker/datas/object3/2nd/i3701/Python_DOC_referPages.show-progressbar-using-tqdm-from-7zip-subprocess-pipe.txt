I'm using this function (based on this awnser) to compress a folder to an encrypted .zip file using 7zip in a subprocess:This works fine as is.My only problem is since the directory to zip is pretty huge i want to give information about the compression progress.I've installed and used tqdm succesfully before to display a progressbar but can't get it to work with this 7zip subprocess.For reference, this is how i used tqdm on a ftp upload script:tqdm even provides an example on how to use pipes but i don't really understand  it. The example also is using grep which isn't available on Windows.I also found this example which is even worse to understand.Any idea how to get and parse the information provided by 7zip using tqdm?
To use the  progress bar you can simply instantiate the progress bar with the parameter , as done here, then call  (as done here) passing the increment on the bar. You can also specify that the total is in bytes and you want to show it with  and This with 7zip can be done in three steps:By invoking  you can get the size of the files and their names, so the script can invoke the command and parse the output. The recommended way with recent  Python versions is through the subprocess module.Instantiate the tqdm object with the total final size of the uncompressed filesUsing  you can invoke  ( avoid builtin progress reporting)  , and pass  to be able to read the standard output of the process using  where process is the value returned by , and parse the output to get the current status. When a file is decompressed it reports its name and so you can call  with the relative size retrieved at step 1.
