I'm trying to understand the basic difference between array and list in python. I've written a sample code for Palindrome string check in python. I'm  trying to understand why it is not working. Here I'm comparing a string parameter with list parameter.Can anyone explain me why the below code is giving wrong output?Output for the above code is:One more thing is that, why it is printing the array value like ['t', 'a', 't', 'a', 't'] instead of tatatI have tried the append() method as well but no use and the result is same.
You are inserting characters into a list, the end result of which is still a list and explicitly not a string; that is why your palindrome test returns  because what you compare is .If you want to do this correctly you need to declare  as an empty string and append to it.
You are comparing a  (your word input) with a  of characters. You will have to  your characters into a  before comparing it to your original .
I don't know why people over react here. If anyone comes here for any help we should help him (if we can ) or at least don't discourage him. What's wrong in my question? If there is any wrong let me know in a smooth way instead of attacking altogether. We are here to learn something and grow together.Anyhow, here is the solution for the Question that I posted above:
