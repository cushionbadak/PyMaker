I have written a selection of functions to try and solve a N-puzzle / 8-puzzle.  I am quite content with my ability to manipulate the puzzle but am struggling with how to iterate and find the best path. My skills are not in OOP either and so the functions are simple.The idea is obviously to reduce the heruistic distance and place all pieces in their desired locations.I have read up a lot of other questions regarding this topic but they're often more advanced and OOP focused.When I try and iterate through there are no good moves. I'm not sure how to perform the A* algorithm. 
To implement A* in Python you can use https://docs.python.org/3/library/heapq.html for a priority queue.  You put possible positions into the queue with a priority of "cost so far + heuristic for remaining cost".  When you take them out of the queue you check a set of already seen positions.  Skip this one if you've seen the position, else add it to the set and then process.An untested version of the critical piece of code:
