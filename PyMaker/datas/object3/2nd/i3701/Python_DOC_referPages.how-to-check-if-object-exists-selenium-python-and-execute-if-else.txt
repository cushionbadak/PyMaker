I'm trying to create script in order to automate order entry. I'm struggling with client search results. I wrote following if statement:It looks for , because if there are any search results, this object exists. The problem is that when there are none, it stops the script with an error message  - it doesn't go to else statement and I have no idea how to sort it. I know that it could be done by  but the problem is that there are many statements nested inside those two so it would end up as a huge mess. I think that the best way to deal with this issue would be to create a try statement that checks if such object exists and it creates variable (which value depends on existence of the object)- but i don't know how to write it and how to pass the variable to following if-else statements.
You can use this:in this case you don't have to add , because if there is no element, the list will have a length 0 and don't throw any error. In your case it would be something like this:
EDIT :I forgot that  returns an empty or non-empty list, but this solution would be good for the various  functions.What you could do is use a try-except-else statement. For instance,The  portion is only entered if no errors are thrown in the  portion.
you can set searchCountCheck to 0 after exception.find_element_by_css_selector(css_selector) Finds an element by css  selector.Args:  css_selector - CSS selector string, ex: ‘a.nav#home’ Returns:  WebElement - the element if it was found Raises:  NoSuchElementException - if the element wasn’t found Usage:    element =  driver.find_element_by_css_selector(‘#foo’)
