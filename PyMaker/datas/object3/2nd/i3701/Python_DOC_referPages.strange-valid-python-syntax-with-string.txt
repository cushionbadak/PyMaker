Should not it complains with syntax error?I just tried in 3.5.2 and 2.7.11. Seems all valid. But it is valid?
From the Python tutorial:Two or more string literals (i.e. the ones enclosed between quotes)  next to each other are automatically concatenated.
Python will concatenate adjacent strings which are delimited by whitespace:https://docs.python.org/2.0/ref/string-catenation.html
