This question already has an answer here:Replacing instances of a character in a string                    9 answers                I am trying to make a program, which replaces letters with other letters, for instance 'Q' into 'R', or 'D' into 'U'. I'm stuck here:This returns an error. What can I do?
I just want to make a simple code which transforms A(Adenin) into  T(Thymin), G(Guanin) into C(Cytosin) and vice versa.Based on this clarification what you actually want to do is complement your DNA sequences. Biopython provides this functionality:You could build your own implementation if you needed, the biopython one uses  in an alphabet aware way (to check your not mixing DNA/RNA etc.), see the source code.
You have many answers to your problem but none address your issue, so looking at your code and hopefully this can help: is a string and as such is immutable in python, so:is not valid python. You already created a  so did you mean:Note, this still wouldn't work because  is not the index but a character in  but you can get both the index and character with , e.g.:In python  is ideal for translating multiple characters, e.g. for your simple example:And this is easy to extend, e.g.  and  and vice versa would look like:
If it's as easy as translating one character into another you can use replace. Is this what you want?
You can use str.replace:Output:
Here's one way using a comprehension and a lookup dictionary, which should be more easily expandable to include more characters:Example input 'QUAD' becomes 'RUAU'.
In simple terms, you can try making a dictionary and try to transforms A(Adenin) into T(Thymin), G(Guanin) into C(Cytosin) and vice versa.
