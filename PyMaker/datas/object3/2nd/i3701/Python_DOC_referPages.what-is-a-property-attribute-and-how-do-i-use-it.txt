I created a class that takes 2 coordinates and returns the slope and distance of the respective coordinates.It works fine but, apparently, what I did was wrong and was supposed to give an error.My code:I get the right output, but this is how I am supposed to do it:What is the difference and is mine wrong?
just put  behind the func some useful docs
you need distance/slope to be variablesThis way, distance/slope are floats, and not functions; so you'll get the error that you're after
