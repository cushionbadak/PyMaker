Is there a command argument parser for Discord.py similar to the 'argparse' module? I created a discord bot that accepts 2 integers and 1 string variable, processes them and outputs the result to the client. It's all well and good when users use it properly, but when they don't I need an easy way to pass errors to the client to tell the user that they used the command incorrectly. It'd be great if I could use argparse for this, else I'll have to write a parser from scratch - which would be a pain! Here's the code:Could you please tell me if there is a module similar to argparse or if there is a way to use argparse module with Discord.py?Edit: @Rishav - you're awesome dude! It worked, but now I have a new problem. Here's my code:Unfortunately, the errors come up in the command line terminal, but not in the client. How do I pass the error back to the client? And how do I access variables a, b and c? Thank you for your help so far!
You're importing the  extension, but you're not actually using it. It has great, easy to write command parsing built in.If you want to have more granular error handling, you can implement per-command error handlers
Yes, see this example from the argparse docs.It describes your need perfectly I think.
