I am having a list which has 1200 sentences. I want to compute the Jaccard coefficient of a sentence in a list with all the other sentences after it. Like sent1 will be compared with sent2,3,... Then sent2 with sent3,4,...I already have a function that takes 2 sets and returns the Jaccard coefficient. I just want to know how to write the python loops for the above scenario.I want to form a cluster of sentences which are similar based on the Jaccard Coeff score > 0.5Thanks
You can use itertools.combination like this: The snippet above would give you this output:
