This question already has an answer here:How to get combination of element from a python list?                    1 answer                Let's say I have a list of four values. I want to find all combinations of two of the values. For example, I would like to get an output like:As you can see, I do not want repetitions, for example (0, 1) and (1, 0)This needs to be able to be used with larger numbers, not just 4, and I will have to iterate through all of the combosI am using Python 3 and Windows, and this would ideally be an inbuilt function, a simple bit of list comprehension code, or something I can import. I have tried making this with range, but I do not know how to exclude the numbers that I have already done from it. Thanks in advance
It is very easy
Take just the lower triangular matrix if you only need a distinct set
