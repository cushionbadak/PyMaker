I'd like this to print the answer "15" but I'm not sure how I would go about this exactly, I'd like the list to work for any set of numbers so that "int(input()) would work.   here is my code so far:
just sum the  of your list: will (efficiently) remove the duplicates for you.if you  the elements to sum; you'd need to convert the string you get to  a list of integers; e.g.;just  will not work because you will not get a list directly; something like  might but is not great design...it all depends of what you want as input.
You can use set to create a unique list.{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}And you can sum it15
