I need some explanation as to how this code works. I do not understand the need for 'str' and 'grp' within the for loop. What are they keeping track of?
 groups consecutive iterators by some . If no key is specified, the default grouping predicate is that the consecutive elements should be the same. So, to summarise,  groups identical consecutive elements together.Exhausting the , you see it returns tuples:Each tuple is a pair of , which corresponds to  and  in the list comprehension.  is basically the elements in that group. The list comprehension is exhausting the  iterator and joining the characters together.
Do not use built-ins as variable names: If in doubt, dissabssemble list comprehensions into its parts and supply them to print statements (How to debug small programs):Output:If you still got questions about it, read the API or search SO: How do I use Python's itertools.groupby()?
