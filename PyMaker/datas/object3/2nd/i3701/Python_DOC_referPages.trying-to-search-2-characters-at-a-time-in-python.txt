Natural Text
I'm just getting back into python, and I'm trying to search over two characters at a time through a string, and replace them with something else. Such as searching through the string "aah" for the string "aa" and replacing it with something else, such as "xx" but when I try to run it, it says type must be a string, not int. This is my code, any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks
Ideally, you should use  or . But if you are committed to using a loop, here's what you may try:
The  operator does a  on two integers. Your for-loop loops over a string so the loop variable  takes successive characters of the string as its values. Hence the error: you are applying the  operator on a character. In addition,  is meaningless: it tries to apply the  operator to a character and an integer - python will complain that you cannot concatenate a character and an integer.The  expression was meant to give you two adjacent characters but it's wrong.There are a few ways to proceed: one is to loop over the string using indices (which I guess is what you were trying to do, since you named the for-loop variable , the traditional name for a loop index).will make  an integer ranging from  to . Then you need to slice off two characters of the string starting at position :You have to remember that the index over a string goes from  to  and you also have to remember that the slice  is the piece of the string between indices  and  (NOT ).This is not particularly idiomatic python, but I hope it's understandable.
