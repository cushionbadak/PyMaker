My problem is understanding why these certain lines of code do what they do. Basically why it works logically. I am using PyCharm python 3 I think.This is my first question so sorry I don't know how to format the code to make it look nice. My question is why when you use the for loop to print the dictionary key or value the syntax to print the key is to print every item? And what does it even mean to print(house_Number[item]).They both work to print key or value but I really want to know a logical answer as to why it works this way. Thanks :DI'm not working on any projects just starting to learn off of codeacademey. 
In Python, iteration over a dictionary () is defined as iteration over that dictionary's keys. This is simply how the language was designed -- other languages and collection classes do it differently, iterating, for example, over key-value tuples, templated  objects, or what have you. accesses the value in  referenced by the key .  is the syntax for indexing in Python (and most other languages);  gives the third element of  and  gives the value corresponding to the key  in the dictionary .Just a side note: Python naming conventions would dictate , not . Capital letters are generally only used in  and .
In python values inside a dictionary object are accessed using dictionay_name['KEY'] In your case you are iterating over the keys of dictionaryHope this helps
Dictionaries are basically containers containing some items (keys) which are stored by hashing method. These keys just map to the values (dic[key]).Like in , if you traverse using  loop, you get the keys from it (in random order since they are hashed). Similarly, dictionaries are just  with a value associated with it. it makes more sense to iterate the keys as in  (too in random order). 
Read more about dicionaries here https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries and hopefully that will answer your question.  Specifically, look at the  method of the dictionary object.
