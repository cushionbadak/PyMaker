I am brand new to python frame introspection and I am trying to set a profiler or a tracer in order to keep track of  function calls.  I have setup tracers in various ways but think I am missing some key understandings around frame introspection and how to get builtin function names (ie )When I run  I see no mention of any  calls in any of the profiled events.  I would expect to see some mention of  or  in some of the call stacks but only see the random calls:I've seen string calls in the python builtin profiles so I tried to look at how they get the c function names, in case that  was delegating to a c call.I tried to get the c function calls by inspecting  (both with  and  but it didn't show any string calls eitherIs anyone familiar with how to trace the python  or built in calls.
When I run test_trace() I see no mention of any str calls in any of the profiled events.That's because  is a type object defined entirely in C. Only function calls are traced, not type calls, so no  event is issued.You could work around this by replacing the  built-in; you can alter Python's builtins via the  module:You can now see  calls be passed to the profiling function.However, note that only calls from Python code to  will be traced! Anything implemented in C, like the  function, doesn't even call the  builtin, it just uses the C API to achieve the same results.
