This program is supposed to remove duplicate elements from a list but it doesn't seem to work,OUTPUT
I've used indexing to retrieve elements from a list, as others are solving this using set() which is impressive, but i guess you are a beginner like me so i wrote this program from basics just like you.
You are not returning anything from , so it defaults to returning . In order to return something, use .There's also a much simpler way of doing this.The set can only contain unique elements by definition - therefore, casting to a set removes duplicates. It is, however, unordered by default, so instead of just casting to a set we add members to a new list one by one, checking they're not already in our new list and, if they're not, adding them to our  set.

I'll put that as an answer. but note that you should probably clarify your title.Firstly, if your main goal is to remove duplicate, your best bet is to cast your  as a  since  don't allow duplicate internally. Also note that you could use that for a better output:
Besides for all the other good answers how to get the result you're looking for the logic is flawed. will always return the first instance of  inside the list.in your instance  will never be true since you will always be matching the first occurrence of the value represented by  and .Therefore whenever  then  will always equal .
