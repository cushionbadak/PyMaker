This question already has an answer here:Open document with default application in Python                    13 answers                So I wanted to create code that creates fake steam keys/adobe keys to fool my friends into thinking I can get as many games as I want. So I got everything working as planned, the code generates the steam key and then places it into a .txt file. However I find it very annoying that I need to keep manually reopening the file after every time I type "y" in the  line to access the new key. I was wondering if it is possible to have it open the .txt file for me. I have looked through many websites and can't find anything that actually launches the .txt. Hope someone can help me out here, full code is as follows:Note:The  function doesn't work yet so if you want to run it, just test by typing:
If you're trying to get the same result as you would by double-clicking the file, you're looking for . With this, you need to specify a filepath, and when called, this function will 'launch' the file (in this case, your  file). The file is opened with whatever application (if any) its extension is associated with.Usage:This will 'launch' the text file.Also, as @heather says in the comments, if you only use the filename (and not the filepath), your program will only work if the steam key text file is in the same directory - otherwise, you have to put in the full filepath.
