I'm making a noughts and crosses game and I'm looking to see if a combination is valid.I have a list of winning combinations e.g [0, 1, 2]How would I check if 'X' is in all three, here's what I got so far:
You can do it like this:Output:all()  checks if the test if valid for all elements of an iterableany()  checks if any element of an iterable statisfies a conditionExample to understand /Output:The linesimply checks if any element of your  (either  or  - 6 more conditions to be added by yourself) has all grid-indexes  (as given in this condition)  with a value given by  - so you can check for  or  - either one might win.
I don't know weather this is what you are wanting, but here's something that might work:Hope this helped.
Let me suggest an object-oriented solution. Since what you want to implement is a nested list with additional functionality, we can implement a  class.In particular, its method  will return a generator for all the legal winning positions. It then suffices to pick your favorite way to check if all elements in a list are identical. classExampleOutput
