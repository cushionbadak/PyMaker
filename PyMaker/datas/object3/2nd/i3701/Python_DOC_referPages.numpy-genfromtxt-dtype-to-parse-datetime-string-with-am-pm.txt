Natural Text
I have several data files with thousands of records like this:and I'm trying to pull it into NumPy using  like this:Unfortunately, I cannot figure out the correct dtype format tuple for the trn_date field to get these datetime strings to be parsed correctly because they use AM/PM suffixes instead of being in "military time".Any help would be appreciated.  I've tried to RTFM...
You might need to pass in a custom converter leveraging  for the dates with the  argument, since NumPy datetime parsing isn't super flexible beyond the ISO 8601 format. If you look at the table of format codes for  you can see it can handle AM/PM with the  directive.
The trouble here is that the way numpy.getfromtxt() parses datetimes is in the format: 'YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00'e.g. '2018-05-27T01:45:45'See the docsThe solution is to re-write the text to this format. There are a number of ways to do this such as making a new file, or maybe using StringIO.Here is my example of cleaning the text and writing it to a new file:You can do this different ways. You dtype was right though!
