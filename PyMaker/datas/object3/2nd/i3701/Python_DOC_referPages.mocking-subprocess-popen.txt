I have a module utils.py which has this run_cmd() methodI wrote a unit-test using mock and this link stackoverflow as a referenceI got this as output when I run the nosetestWhy is the pipe.communicate() not printing the ('output', 'error') or the pipe.returncode not printing the 0, but their mock methods? Where did it go wrong? How could I solve this?
Ah, You already have an answer of your question. look closely and you will know why. You have to mock like you did for . You forgot to mention  while creating mocked object.Now, mocking the nested function with multiple values, I think you should look at the side_effects and here.I haven't tested the below code but I hope it should work or at least give you some sort of lead.Hope that will help!
