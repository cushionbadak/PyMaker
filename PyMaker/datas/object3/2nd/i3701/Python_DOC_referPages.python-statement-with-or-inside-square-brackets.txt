This is a code snippet I pasted from a setup.py python file. I am new to python and don't understand this  variable. Could someone give me some explanation for that?
build_args' instantiation is simply evaluating a logical boolean OR statement inside of the list a list structure. After the OR statement has been evaluated there will simply be a single boolean value stored in build_args. (props to ukemi, beat me to the punch)Since it was also included in the code snippet I'd add that info for '.extend()' following can be found here. Essentially .extend() then just appends all items of an iterable structure on the end of the list, so build_args' content would then be 
If  is equivalent to , then .If  is equivalent to , then .Note: In python there are other values equivalent to  and , other than the booleans themselves:In the context of Boolean operations, and also when expressions are used by control flow statements, the following values are interpreted as false: numeric zero of all typesempty strings and containers (including strings, tuples, lists, dictionaries, sets and frozensets)All other values are interpreted as true.
