How to make python bot pick a random name. For example if I provide a list ofanswers.
You can use  (not ) to select  items with replacement, if you are on Python 3.6+
This Python function picks 5 random elements out of a given list. It iterates 5 times and uses a randomly selected integer to pull an element from the given list, then removes it to avoid duplicates. It uses the random module to accomplish this.I don't know about getting it to discord, but I think this is what you were looking for.
