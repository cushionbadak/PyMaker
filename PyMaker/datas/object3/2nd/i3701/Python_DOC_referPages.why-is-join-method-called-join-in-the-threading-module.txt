This is a rather silly question...yet it bugs the heck out of me. In the  module we have a  method.I understand that it blocks the calling thread, but why is  called 'join'?  Why is it not called  or  or something like that?Every time I see , I feel the child thread is joining something to get caclulations done. Is there some reason why this particular keyword was chosen for a method name?
This name is far older than Python.  It appears in the POSIX threading library (libpthread) as  (the "pthread" prefix is used because C has no namespaces).  However, for process level concurrency, both Python and POSIX use the name .Other parts of the pthread library do use the term wait, but usually for higher-level synchronization primitives, such as  or .  I imagine that  would have been ambiguous between "wait for [some synchronization object]" and "wait for a thread to terminate."
The child-thread joins the parent.  makes the parent give birth to a thread and let it free.  makes the parent block (wait) until the child is done doing its job.You can imagine it like this:the parent thread is a mighty god that can live for a long timewith  it gives birth to a mortalright after its birth, the mortal runs away and starts living its own life (executing its  method)the god may continue minding his own businesshe also may want to take a look at his offspring, to see whether, literally, it he also may start observing the whole life of the offspring, waiting for him to come back, right until the death of the latter (this is the  method). While doing that, the god cannot do anything else, because he enjoys admiring his creature so much (the call to  blocks the parent thread), but after the mortal dies, the god can continue his life
