The following code works in Python 2.7:However, when I run the code in Python3, I get the following error from the last line:In order to get a better idea, I tried printing  in both versions and found out that in python 2 the type is  and in Python 3 the type is .I've checked out these stackoverflow questions but neither of them have helpful answers for this:python 3.5: TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str' when writing to a filePython sockets error TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str' with send functionUPDATEA bunch of the answers here said to change to  but that just leads to another error: 
Ref https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/pickle.html#pickle.load, the file-like object you pass to  needs to return binary data. Files are opened in text-mode by default, which is why you're seeing this error. If you open the file in binary mode (by adding  to the mode), everything should be work.E.g.
As the documentation for the  method says (emphasis mine):The argument file must have two methods, a read() method that takes an integer argument, and a readline() method that requires no arguments. Both methods should return bytes. will open the file for reading text, not raw bytes. Thus,  will return , not . To fix that, open the file in binary mode: .
