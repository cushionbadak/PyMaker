I want to run a program, wait for it's output, send inputs to it and repeat until a condition.  All I could find was questions about waiting for a program to finish, which is NOT the case. The process will still be running, it just won't be giving any (new) outputs.  Program output is in stdout and in a log file, either can be used.Using linux.Code so far:  As is, the "do something" input is being sent multiple times even before the program finished starting up. Also, the log file is read before the program finishes running the command from the last while iteraction. That causes it to buffer the inputs, so I keeps executing the commands even after the condition as been met.  I could use  after each  but since the time needed to execute each command is variable, I would need to use times longer than necessary making the python script slower. Also, that's a dumb solution to this.Thanks!
If you are using python3, you can try updating your code to use  instead. It should wait for your task to complete and return the output. 
You can use commands instead of subprocess. Here is an example with ls command:
