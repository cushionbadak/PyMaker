I'm trying to access an instance attribute () of  class from an instance of , depending on an attribute of the instance ( of object ClassB).Here is my code:This is what I tried first:I overcome this if I chain calls to getattr:Out of curiosity: Is there a way to get an attribute of the Base class from grandchildren class besides doing two calls to ?Update: the reason I need it is I'm trying to:- Get an attribute fron grandparent class (either inst_baseA or inst_baseB)- Depending on an attribute on my instance (the value of x)So my code is actually something like: . I didn't explain it correctly at the first time, hope it makes more sense now.
There's , but it's really not meant for this kind of thing, so the syntax is pretty awkward:But this is really quite unintuitive, so to avoid confusing people who read your code, it's probably better to roll your own multi-getattr instead:
According to [Python]: getattr(object, name[, default]):Return the value of the named attribute of object. name must be a string. If the string is the name of one of the objectâ€™s attributes, the result is the value of that attribute. For example,  is equivalent to . is not an attribute of , but: is an attribute of  is an attribute of So, you need one  call for each "nesting" level. Considering that I've pasted your code in the interpreter's interactive window:Or, to take things further, you can create a getter that works with "nested" attribute names:But that's probably highly inefficient (and also, doesn't handle corner cases), and you'd better use @Aran-Fey's suggestion.
