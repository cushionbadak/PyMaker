I am new to debugging in Python, and I currently use Hydrogen within Atom to do most of my Python work. I have looked into debugging, and it seems that the Python package  is the standard way to debug in Python. Most of the examples I can find seem to require using a command line on a  file. However, in Hydrogen I would want to run it within the kernel on individual lines of the code, since I don't think  will work on a markdown () file. Is there a way I can debug within my workflow, or do I need to make  files of my code and run  on them?
I had read this answer and tried to implement "C. From Within Your Program". It had thrown errors, and I gave up. However, I went to the source that the answer had cited, and used this code:From this, I was able to get  to run in Hydrogen.
