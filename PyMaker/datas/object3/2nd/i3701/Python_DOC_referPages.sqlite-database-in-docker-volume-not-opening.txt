I am trying to create an sqlite db on a volume within a docker container. When execution reaches  a receive the following error:I wanted to re-use the connection process so built the following functions, which I think might be where the problem is:This is called with:This code runs outside of the docker container, which is why I wonder whether this is alpine or docker related. My docker file looks like this:Starting the docker container I have tried with and without the '--privileged' flag and still get the same error.Thanks,
This is unrelated to . From the docs:A finally clause is always executed before leaving the try statement,  whether an exception has occurred or not.This is easily testable,  will exist regardless:So it doesn't make sense to  a connection in a  block. I don't see any reason to close the connection at all in this function because it only tried to do one thing: open a connection. Either the connection is successful or it fails and therefore does not need closing (indeed, calling  in the exception handler is likely to throw an error because the name  will not exist).
