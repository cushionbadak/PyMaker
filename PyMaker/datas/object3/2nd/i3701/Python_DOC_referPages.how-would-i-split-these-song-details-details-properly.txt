Natural Text
This might not make sense but I have a file which consists of (in each line) Song name, length of the song, artist, album, and genre.  So, I try to split them by spaces, and of course that splits song titles, so I just use the first whatevers of the list depending on another calculation.  My example will be: So I have a for loop that counts the length of the list of those things split and it gives me what I want.I'm curious as to how I would get just the title out of it.  I guess its possible to iterate through the list and find the length until it finds a number, but I'm not sure how I would do that, or if there is a better solution.
I copy pasted your song lines into a text editor (I thought they may be seperated by tabs), but it's like 4 or 3 spaces randomly - that as may be, here's a possible solution if you're just wanting the seperated info:I get this as output when I run itHopefully this helps
