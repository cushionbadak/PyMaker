Background: I have a large file and I want to read the first few values from it.  I don't really want to read the entire file partly since I have no further use for it, so that it does not use unnecessary memory and is faster to execute (since it does not need to read this huge file).From the documentation I am using:test.txttest.py:It does not only partly read my file.Is there a way to only read part of a file?
From this answer What is the use of buffering in python's built-in open() function? you will see that  does not  actually read up to a range.  Instead set a range in .  So:returns  as you would expect.See the documentationTo read a fileâ€™s contents, call f.read(size), which reads some quantity of data and returns it as a string (in text mode) or bytes object (in binary mode). size is an optional numeric argument. When size is omitted or negative, the entire contents of the file will be read and returned;If you need to read values inside the text file, then you could use  see seek() function?
You have a couple of options. reads the entire file reads size amount of data (character for text mode, byte for binary mode)   all provide ways to read the whole file returns a single line at a time (read until newline char () or end of file (EOF))check here for documentation.
