I'm making a clone of Ballz, a mobile game where you have to shoot a whole bunch of balls at blocks that break after multiple hits. It's like BrickBreaker on steroids. I've got it working mostly, but I can't figure out how to shoot the balls one after another. I know from testing that at the time of shooting, the balls are at different places, but immediately after that they occupy the same space.Oh btw, the way that I'm keeping them separate is by making the balls go further back outside of the screen. So you can imagine it like setting them all up one behind the other, off screen, below the bottom of the player.Here's my code:Edit: Forgot to add the vector class.
Sorry, no reproduction, your balls are fine:No, but the problem you have is with mutable objects.When you setyou set all 's to the same object, so every collision detection will change the direction of all balls simultaneosly. Simplest fix:EDITI used a different  module, in your case you can either use  or create a custom  method:(This comes inside the  class, likewise for subtraction and mult.)END EDITAlso there are some problems with the way you reset when the balls leave the image and you should prevent the player from clicking again until the balls are reset, but I guess that comes in later development.AppendixNote: I'm working in Python 3 and either I installed a different  module, or they changed a lot, so had to change some syntax there as well. Hope it helps :)
Since you're passing the player's  to the ball instances and then just assign it to their  attributes, the positions of the player and the balls all refer to the same  object in the memory. You can instead make copies of the vector, for example with the  module, so that every  refers to a separate vector object.First import the copy function (it creates shallow copies).Then copy the vector objects before you pass them.I also recommend using pygame's Vector2 class instead of your own , because it is more feature-rich and efficient.And   is a built-in function.
