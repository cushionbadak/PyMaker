So I have the following script, test.py:I can run it well:But inside the interactive interpreter, I cannot import it:Do you see what is wrong?
There is already a test module (https://docs.python.org/3/library/test.html or https://docs.python.org/2/library/test.html), which is loaded before your local test.py on the PYTHONPATH because you used import.In the interpreter, you can see where it isYours may not be the test module. It tends to successfully import. You must have another test.py on your PYTHONPATH.Your command line does not have an import, so it is free to use the local filename when you pass it directly to the python executable as an argument.A simple way to avoid the name conflict, name your file "test_foo.py" and import test_foo. (unless you use test_foo.py in multiple places)Additionally, consider a run function, in combination with because right now it will execute those prints as part of the import. You will want to do that also in ... whatever other "test.py" you have.
It's either these two cases:1) Python built-in module "test" (https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/test.html) is being loaded and not your local test.py, however, you shouldn't have any problem importing your local test.py since its a default module, its strange that you are getting an error when you try importing it (unless you have modified it). You can try this to see the imported module cache and check for the test module pathIf this is the case then you simply have to open a new python interpreter to make sure no test module has been cached. If its still cached, then change the name of your test.py to something_test.py 2) The code you are representing above is not complete and you have a line "x + 10" and since you are assigning x as a string and trying to add integer, your import isn't working. I doubt this being true as I am sure if this was the case you would be aware of it :-)
