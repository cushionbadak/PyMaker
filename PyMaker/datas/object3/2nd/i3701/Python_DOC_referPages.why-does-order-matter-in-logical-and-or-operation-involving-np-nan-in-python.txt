Bool value of np.NaN is True. Then why and/or operation behaves so random in python.If  evaluates to  then why does  evaluate to ? And this is completely reverse for and operation: is  while  is .
This is due to the way the interpreter evaluates expressions with /: expressions:If the first operand is  or equivalent to , the second operand is not evaluated and the value of the first operand is returned.If the first operand is  or equivalent to , the second operand is evaluated and returnedExamples::  is , therefore return :  is , therefore return :  is , therefore return   expressions:If the first operand is  or equivalent to , the second operand is not evaluated and the value of the first operand is returnedIf the first operand is  or equivalent to , the second operand is evaluated and returnedExamples::  is , therefore return :  is , therefore return :  is , therefore return
