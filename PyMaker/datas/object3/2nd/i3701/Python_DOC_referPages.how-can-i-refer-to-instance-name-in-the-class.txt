Natural Text
in this code:I want to print [b, c] but it prints something like this how i can fix it?
Impossible*. Names refer to values unidirectionally. You cannot go from a value to a name. Consider many names refering to the same value, e.g. . What would be the true name of the value ? There is none, all names are equal.*without inspecting the source code. And as I said, what should happen to how  is displayed if you then assign ? What you are trying to do is fruitless and if you really need it you have a design issue.
If you want  to display a text for an object, you need to implement the __str__ method:Or did you want print to use the name of the reference of the object?
