I'm trying to save json to file .txt. Do I need to save information about Request Headers, Response Headers and in POST method - Request payload? Which function used to save this information?
The pathlib is just to handle with OS paths. You should use open method to save data in file.The info about requests can be found at request object.For more info, take a look at requests official doc.
