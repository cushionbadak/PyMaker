I was reading about bytes and byte array's. I read that byte arrays mutable types!so, when i am trying to modify it i am getting an error saying  Am i missing something here? The following is my code and the errori got the following errorTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call  last)  in ()  ----> 1 z[0]="H"TypeError: an integer is required
As the docs say:The bytearray type is a mutable sequence of integers in the range 0 <= x < 256.The reason you can create it with a string as each character is converted to its ASCII integer value. So when assigning  you actually mean to assign .If you want to be able to assign chars, then just pass each one into  first.
