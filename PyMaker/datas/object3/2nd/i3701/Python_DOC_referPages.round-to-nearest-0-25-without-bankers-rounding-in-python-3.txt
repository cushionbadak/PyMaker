I would like to round a series of number like this:I have heard that I can use round(x*4)/4 to find the nearest 0.25 unit. However, there will be some problems at the boundary with this functionIs there anyway I can do the above rounding correctly? Thanks
The  module gives more control over rounding behavior. Particularly, the  rounding mode rounds to the nearest option when there is a nearest option and rounds away from zero when there's a tie, matching what you want:
Simply multiply by 4, round, then divide by 4.
