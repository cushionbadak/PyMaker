I'm not super familiar with asyncio, but I was hoping there would be some easy way to use asyncio.Queue to push log messages to a Queue instead of writing them to the disk, and then have a worker on a thread wait for these Queue events and write them to disk when resources are available. This seems pretty widely necessary, as logging is a huge bottleneck in a lot of code but isn't always needed in real time. Are there any pre-existing packages for this or can anyone with more experience write a short example script to get me started? NOTE: This needs to interface with existing code, so making it all packaged in a class would probably be preferred.
It's handled in the standard library in recent Python versions. See this post for information, and the official documentation. This functionality predates , and so doesn't use it (and doesn't especially need to).For Python 2.7, you can use the logutils package which provides equivalent functionality.
