Let's say the name of the module is available in form of a string rather than module object. How do I locate its source code location and load the abstract syntax tree (if the source code is present)?
I'd take the problem in three steps:Import the module by name. This should be relatively easy using , though you could bodge up your own version with the builtin  if you needed to.Get the source code for the module. Using  is probably the easiest way (but you could also just try  and it is likely to work).Parse the source into an AST. This should be easy with . Even for this step, the library isn't essential, as you can use the builtin  instead, as long as you pass the appropriate flag ( appears to be  on my system, so  should work).
