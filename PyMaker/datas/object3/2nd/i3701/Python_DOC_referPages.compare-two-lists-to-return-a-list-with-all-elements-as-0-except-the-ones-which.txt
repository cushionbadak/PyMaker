I am a bit stuck on this:I want to compare the two lists and generate a list with the same items as , but with any items that don't occur in  set to 0. Valid outputs would be these:I would not know the number elements in either list beforehand.I tried  loops butIt removes all instances of 2. Which I only want to remove once(it occurs once in  for the moment). I need to add a condition in the above  to keep elements which match.
The following would work:or for a one-liner, using the fact that  returns :
If the elements in  are unique, this is best done with a , because sets allow very efficient membership testing:If  can contain duplicates, you can replace the set with a , which represents a multiset:
Here's one way using . Downside is the  copy operation and initial  conversion. Upside is O(1) removal and lookup operations.
