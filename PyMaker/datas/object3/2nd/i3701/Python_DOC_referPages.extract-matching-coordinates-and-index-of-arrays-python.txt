I have this following arrays, each element in a and b is supposed to be associated with Lon and Lat coordinates, a and b are referred to as the ID of the coordinates, the data can include negative float values:I tried different ways to get the result I need such using sets but they iterate over all the values and the result I am interested in is strictly extracting from the first set of arrays Lon1, Lat2 that appear in Lon2, Lat2 while using the element name from a and ignoring b.The desired results are three new arrays with values:This is just sample data, I am working with a similar set of 2000 points and I need to extract their ID if their coordinates match a smaller set of points.I tried searchsorted and I tried creating nested for loops with if lon1 = lon2 then append a new list with a[i], but that doesn't work either. I also tried creating a function that enumerates a and uses b as a set but it only seems to return 5 values and I can visually see in my data that there many.
