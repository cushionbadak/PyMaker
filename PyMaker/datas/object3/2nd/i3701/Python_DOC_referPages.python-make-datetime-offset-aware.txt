I want to get the offset for datetime and make an aware string.  The following IDLE code works:  The following code in a script gives an error: I realize that offset and timezone are different but at any given momentthe local time should be offset the same as an accurate timezone offset even though timezone offset may fluctuate during the year.  What is happening and why?  What is the best solution?  
The script is being executed by the python2 interpreter. Add an explicit python3 shebang to the script:
From your traceback: . Your script is using Python2, which is generally not compatible with Python3. In Python2 you have to provide a timezone. See the difference between the Python2 and Python3 documentation.In Linux, the  word specifically means . Python3 is typed using  unless you use an alias. To fix it, change all occurrences of  to , as inNote: From the Python3 Documentation, it does not work on all versions of Python3:Changed in version 3.3: tz now can be omitted.Changed in version 3.6: The astimezone() method can now be called on naive instances that are presumed to represent system local time.`
