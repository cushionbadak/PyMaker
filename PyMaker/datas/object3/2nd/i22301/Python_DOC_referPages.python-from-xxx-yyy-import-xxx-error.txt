I'm working with the  package in Python, and I've seen people mention numerous times that you can write an import statement as follows:However, it does not work. It states that  exists in the  module, rather than the  module. I assume I'm importing the  as , not that I'm receiving it from the  package itself.I'm using Python 2.6.How can I alias  as ?
This is the proper way to alias a module via import:
From the python 3 documentation (it works the same way in python 2.6, but I found the python 3 documentation explained it clearer):If the module name is followed by , then the name following  is bound directly to the imported module.So your statement should look like:and then  will work.Also see Can you define aliases for imported modules in Python? for additional aliasing options
If you're looking to import  as , that's how you need to do it.This way, you can access  like .That being said, it's more common to give it a non conflicting name, here it would be  or . Something that doesn't override the root  import.
