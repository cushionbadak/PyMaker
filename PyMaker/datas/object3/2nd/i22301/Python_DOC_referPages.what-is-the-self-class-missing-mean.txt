in pinax Userdict.py:why does it do this on .thanks
The UserDict.py presented here emulates built-in  closely, so for example:just as you can override the special method  to deal with missing keys when you subclass the built-in , so can you override it when you subclass that .The official Python docs for dict are here, and they do say:New in version 2.5: If a subclass of  dict defines a method (),  if the key key is not present, the   operation calls that method  with the key key as argument. The   operation then returns or  raises whatever is returned or raised  by the  call if the  key is not present. No other  operations or methods invoke  . If  is not defined,  is raised.   must be a method; it cannot be an instance variable. For an  example, see .
If you want to use default values in a dict (aka __missing__), you can check out  from  collections module:
