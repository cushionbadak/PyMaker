I want to run a python script from within another. By within I mean any state changes from the child script effect the parent's state. So if a variable is set in the child, it gets changed in the parent.Normally you could do something like But the issue is here the child script being run is an argument to the parent script, I don't think you can use import with a variableSomething like thisThis would be what I would expect to happen
You can use the  function which allows you to import a module dynamically:(You may need to remove the trailing  or not specify it on the command line.)From the Python documentation:Direct use of  is rare, except in cases where you want to import a module whose name is only known at runtime.
While  certainly executes the specified file, it also stores it in the python modules list. If you want to reexecute the same file, you'd have to do a reload.You can also take a look at the python  statement that could be more suited to your needs.From Python documentation :This statement supports dynamic execution of Python code. The first expression should evaluate to either a string, an open file object, or a code object.
