i have an array of 27 elements,and i don't want to generate all permutations of array (27!)i need 5000 randomly choosed permutations,any tip will be useful...
To generate one permutation use  and store a copy of the result. Repeat this operation in a loop and each time check for duplicates (there probably won't be any though). Once you have 5000 items in your result set, stop.To address the point in the comment, Python's random module is based on the Mersenne Twister and has a period of , which is considerably larger than  so it should be suitable for your use.
  I love big numbers! :)AND is PRIME!!EDIT:WARNING: This wont ever stop if RNG is bad!
. It's a generator, so it won't create the whole list of permutations. You could skip randomly until you've got 5000.
Usage: This uses the Lehmer code for the permutation as the values of  match that.
You may want the itertools.permutations() function. Gotta love that itertools module!NOTE: New in 2.6
You can try implementing the  itertools recipes.  For convenience I use a third-party library, , that implements this recipe for us:A random permutation is created for every call of the function.  We can make a generator that yields these results for  calls.  We will implement this generator and demonstrate random results with an abridged example:For your specific problem, substitute the iterable and number of calls  with the appropriate values, e.g. .See also  docs for further information on this tool.DetailsFor those interested, here is the actual recipe.From the itertools recipes:
