In python 2.6 under Linux, I can use the following to handle a TERM signal:Is there any way to setup a handler for all signals received by the process, other than just setting them up one-at-a-time?
You could just loop through the signals in the signal module and set them up.
As of Python 3.5, the signal constants are defined as an enum, enabling a nicer approach:
If you want to get rid of the try, just ignore signals that cannot be caught.
Here's a 2/3 compatible way which doesn't have as many pitfalls as the others:Since  is just a number, iterate over 1 to out of range setting the signal to a particular handle.
Works on Windows 10 and Python 3.7:Results:
That code won't work in the current version of python. There are many variables starting with SIG with the same value. For instance, SIGHUP and SIG_UNBLOCK are both 1. The only way I could think of to get a list of actual signals was to just make it myself.
