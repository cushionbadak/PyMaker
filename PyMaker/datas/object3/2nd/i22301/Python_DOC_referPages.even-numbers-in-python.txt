Does anyone know if Python has an in-built function to work to print out even values. Like range() for example.Thanks
Range has three parameters.You can write .
Just use a step of 2:
Try:
I don't know if this is what you want to hear, but it's pretty trivial to filter out odd values with list comprehension.orYou could also use the optional step size parameter for  to count up by 2.

There are also a few ways to write a lazy, infinite iterators of even numbers. We will use the  module and 1 to make iterators that emulate .All of the latter options can generate an infinite sequence of even numbers, .  You can treat these like any generator by looping over them, or you can select  numbers from the sequence via  or  from the itertools recipes e.g.:This is equivalent to .  However, unlike , the iterator is paused and will yield the next batch of even numbers if run again:DetailsThe options presented are all infinite iterators that  with an integer, i.e. .a.  yields the next value incremented by a  (see equivalent code).b.  is an itertools recipe that maps a function to each value of a number line (see source code). c.  yields the starting value ().  It then applies a function to the last item (incrementing by 2), yields that result and repeats this process (see source code).1A third-party package that implements many useful tools, including itertools recipes such as  and .
