I want to delete all files with the extension  in a directory. How can I do that in Python?
Via  and :Or via :Be sure to be in the correct directory, eventually using .
Use  to change directory .Use  to generate a list of file names which end it '.bak'. The elements of the list are just strings.Then you could use  to remove the files. (PS.  and  are synonyms for the same function.)
In Python 3.5,  is better if you need to check for file attributes or type - see  for properties of the object that's returned by the function. This also doesn't require changing directories since each  already includes the full path to the file. 
you can create a function. Add maxdepth as you like for traversing subdirectories.
First glob them, then unlink.
On Linux and macOS you can run simple command to the shell:
I realize this is old; however, here would be how to do so using just the os module...
