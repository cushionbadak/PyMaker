I have a string where special characters like  or  or  (...) can appear. In the string:how can I automatically escape every special character, so that I get this:
In Python 3.2, you could use the  function, e.g.For earlier versions of Python, check http://wiki.python.org/moin/EscapingHtml:The  module that comes with Python has an  function: However, it doesn't escape characters beyond , , and . If it is used as , it also escapes . Here's a small snippet that will let you escape quotes and apostrophes as well: You can also use  from  to escape html. This function should execute faster. The  function of the same module can be passed the same arguments to decode a string. 
The cgi.escape method will convert special charecters to valid html tagswill result inThe optional second paramter on cgi.escape escapes quotes. By default, they are not escaped
A simple string function will do it:Other answers in this thread have minor problems: The cgi.escape method for some reason ignores single-quotes, and you need to explicitly ask it to do double-quotes.  The wiki page linked does all five, but uses the XML entity , which isn't an HTML entity.This code function does all five all the time, using HTML-standard entities.
The other answers here will help with such as the characters you listed and a few others. However, if you also want to convert everything else to entity names, too, you'll have to do something else. For instance, if  needs to be converted to , neither  nor  will help you there. You'll want to do something like this that uses , which is just a dictionary. (The following code is made for Python 3.x, but there's a partial attempt at making it compatible with 2.x to give you an idea):
