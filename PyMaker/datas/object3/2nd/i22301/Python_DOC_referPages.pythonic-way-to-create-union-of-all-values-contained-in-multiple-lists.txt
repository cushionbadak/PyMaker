I have a list of lists:I want to flatten this list and remove all duplicates; or, in other words, apply a set union operation:What's the easiest way to do this? (I'm forced to use Python 2.4 for this project)
 does what you want:You can also do this with more than two lists.
Since you seem to be using Python 2.5 (it would be nice to mention in your Q if you need an A for versions != 2.6, the current production one, by the way;-) and want a list rather than a set as the result, I recommend:itertools is generally a great way to work with iterators (and so with many kinds of sequences or collections) and I heartily recommend you become familiar with it.  , in particular, is documented here.
I  used the following to do intersections, which avoids the need for sets.or,
Unions are not supported by lists, which are ordered, but are supported by sets. Check out set.union.
