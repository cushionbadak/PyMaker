I am writing a Python script in Windows. I want to do something based on the file size. For example, if the size is greater than 0, I will send an email to somebody, otherwise continue to other things. How do I check the file size?
Use , and use the  member of the resulting object:Output is in bytes.
Using :The output is in bytes.
The other answers work for real files, but if you need something that works for "file-like objects", try this:It works for real files and StringIO's, in my limited testing. (Python 2.7.3.) The "file-like object" API isn't really a rigorous interface, of course, but the API documentation suggests that file-like objects should support  and .EditAnother difference between this and  is that you can  a file even if you don't have permission to read it. Obviously the seek/tell approach won't work unless you have read permission.Edit 2 At Jonathon's suggestion, here's a paranoid version. (The version above leaves the file pointer at the end of the file, so if you were to try to read from the file, you'd get zero bytes back!)
Result:
Using  (added in Python 3.4 or a backport available on PyPI):This is really only an interface around , but using  provides an easy way to access other file related operations.
There is a  trick I use if i want to to convert from  to any other unit. If you do a right shift by  you basically shift it by an order (multiple). Example:  
Strictly sticking to the question, the python code (+ pseudo-code) would be:
