Natural Text
This question already has an answer here:A number smaller than negative infinity in python?                    1 answer                Is there a Python built-in datatype, besides , for which:where  is a value of that type? How about Python 3?
 is always less than any datatype in Python 2 (see ).In Python 3, this was changed; now doing comparisons on things without a sensible natural ordering results in a . From the 3.0 "what's new" updates:Python 3.0 has simplified the rules for ordering comparisons:The ordering comparison operators (, , , ) raise a  exception when the operands don’t have a meaningful natural ordering. Thus, expressions like: ,  or  are no longer valid, and e.g.  raises  instead of returning . A corollary is that sorting a heterogeneous list no longer makes sense – all the elements must be comparable to each other. Note that this does not apply to the  and  operators: objects of different incomparable types always compare unequal to each other.This upset some people since it was often handy to do things like sort a list that had some  values in it, and have the  values appear clustered together at the beginning or end. There was a thread on the mailing list about this a while back, but the ultimate point is that Python 3 tries to avoid making arbitrary decisions about ordering (which is what happened a lot in Python 2).
From the Python 2.7.5 source ():EDIT: Added version number.
