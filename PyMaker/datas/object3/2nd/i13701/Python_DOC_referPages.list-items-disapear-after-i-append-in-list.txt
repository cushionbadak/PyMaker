I simplify the list for better understanding.I have a list that dynamicly change (let say):And want to check if list match with some list inside a list (like the one bellow). This List of lists is read from txt file. If list is not inside I want to append it to list of lists (mDdata). My problem is that when I append. The updated list is not saved correctly. It is eather all lists inside list are the same, only last list is diffrent or  the empty lists gets appended (depending where I put  )My best guess  is that I should have some temp. variable or change list to tuple.
I believe the part which is causing your issue is -When you do -You are just assigning the reference of  to , they both refer to the same list. And when you do -  - you are appending that list reference inside the list .Then when you do -This inplace clears the list referenced by  , which is also the list  as well as the lsit you just appended to  . You should not be doing that . A very short Example to show this behavior -I am guessing you have some kind of wrong understanding of  , when the slicing is used on the left side of assignment operator, you are asking python to mutate the list inplace, this would reflect in all names which refer to the list. You should use this unless you really need to mutate inplace, and I do not see any need for that. You can just do -This would cause  point to a new list, without causing any issues to the list that it previously pointed to. You should use it like this everywhere.Also, when you do -This does not do any benefit, you can just write -
You can use the  function and with the  method to check if your list contains exactly the same elements with any sub-list in .
