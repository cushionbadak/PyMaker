Consider the following lines And then,while,Why type(x) and x.type give two different pieces of information ? What information is conveyed by them ?I also see that referring to Theano tutorial ,Why type(x) output is different in my case ? Are these caused by version specific implementation differences and what is signified by this difference ?
 has an attribute  which you are looking at when you sayThis is analagous to numpy objects  attribute that many of their objects carry (if you are familiar with that library).On the other hand  is a Python function that looks at the actual type of the object you pass in, which for  is indeed a So long story short, you are comparing an attribute to the actual object type.
 is a builtin. is an attribute that's defined in your object.They are completely seperate,  returns what type of object  is and  does whatever the object wants it to. In this case, it returns some information on the type of object it is
As others have mentioned,  is Python's builtin function that returns the type of the object.  It has nothing to do with Theano per se.  This builtin function can be applied to any Python object (and everything in Python is an object).  For example, is , is , is , etc.Interestingly, you can call  on  itself (everything, including , is an object) -  is .Incidentally,  is  ( to be precise)., as others have mentioned, is an attribute of the object .  It points back to .   returns  - this not only shows you the type of , it also tells you that  is scalar and it is 64-bit float.Other examples of the type attribute:
