I know that you can do nested for loops, for example:However, I've seen for loops that go like this:Are these two loops equivalent? Or does the second loop do something different than the first?
No, they are not.The second is an example of multiple assignment. If you assign to a tuple, Python unpacks the values of an iterable into the names you gave.The second loop is rather equivalent to this:As @Kasramvd points out in a comment to your question, this only works if  is a sequence with the correct number of items. Otherwise, Python will raise a .Edit to address  iteration (as brought up in comment):When you iterate over a Python  using the normal  syntax,  is the key relevant to each iteration.The type of loop you are talking about is achieved as follows:This is still the same kind of unpacking as described above, because  gives you a list of tuples corresponding to the  contents. That is:
