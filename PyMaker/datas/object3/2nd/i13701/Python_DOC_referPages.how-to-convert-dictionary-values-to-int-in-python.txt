I have a program that returns a set of domains with ranks like so:I'm trying to sort them by ascending rank with :However, since the values of "rank" are strings, then it sorts them alphanumerically instead of by ascending value:I need to convert the values of only the "rank" key to integers so that they'll sort correctly. Any ideas?
You are almost there. You need to convert the picked values to integers after replacing , like thisFor example,Note: I just used  function to pretty print the result.Here,  will be the current object for which the  value being determined. We get the value of  attribute from it, replace  with empty string and then converted that to a number with .If you don't want to replace  and handle it properly, then you can use  module's  function, like this
I just want to point out that the data structure could potentially be improved here. You have a list of mini-dictionaries but it seems like you could have a single dictionary since "rank" and "url" are implicit. Use each unique url as a key and each rank for that url as a value or count, which would take better advantage of the dictionary's capabilities IMHO. If you are getting the current data structure as an output from somewhere else, you can easily compress it into a more efficient counter dictionary with the conversion to integer ranks as values using the  function:If you are going to have a lot of data this will be more compact and it is more intuitive to work with. You can use this easily for things like nice print outs based on ranks:
Guess you should use  and then compare to be precise and accurate.Output:
