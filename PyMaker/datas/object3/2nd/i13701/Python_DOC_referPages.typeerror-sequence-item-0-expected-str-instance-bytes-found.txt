I am getting an error  its working fine in python 2.x, but not working on 3.4kindly suggest a proper solution for that
 is a string which you're calling its  method with a byte sequence. As the documentation's stated, in python-3.x:Return a string which is the concatenation of the strings  in the iterable iterable. A TypeError will be raised if there are any  non-string values in iterable, including bytes objects. The separator  between elements is the string providing this method.But in this case since you are dealing with byte objects you cannot use  related methods. The byte object itself comes with a  method that can be used in the same manner as . You can also use , or you can do in-place concatenation with a  object. As the documentation's mentioned  objects are mutable and have an efficient overallocation mechanism.So you can simply add a  prefix to the empty string to make it a byte object:Also, if your file is contain strings you can simply open your file in a  mode ()instead of byte ().Note that despite the separation between  and  objects in python-3.x, in python-2.x you only have . You can see this by checking the type of a string with  prefix:And that's what that makes the following snippet work:
You should be adding a line lines=str(lines)before running the command to avoid errors .This way you convert to string initially itself.
If you came here searching for a solution to join a custom class implemented in C/C++, the simplest method is to add a join method to the class itself and create binding to python.For example, a class that can have either list or map which should be joinable, example code in pybind11 would be something like this:Then in python, it is a simple matter of calling the join method for the class
