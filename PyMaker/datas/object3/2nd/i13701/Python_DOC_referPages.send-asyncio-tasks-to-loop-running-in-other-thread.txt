How can I asynchronously insert tasks to run in an  event loop running in another thread?My motivation is to support interactive asynchronous workloads in the interpreter.  I can't block the main REPL thread.ExampleMy current flawed understanding says that the following should work.  Why doesn't it?  What is a better way to accomplish goal above?
