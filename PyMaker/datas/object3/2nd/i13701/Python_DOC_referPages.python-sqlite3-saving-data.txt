Does anyone know how do I correct this as this code is not saving the data in a database?I just want to write the data in the database but when I am trying to retrieve it, it shows that the database is empty...Anyway thanks in advance...
You need to commit the transaction.
In addition to the best answer, think also to the use of the Connection object as a context manager, it can be useful and it is provided in the SQLite3 API :If your statement(s) within the  don't raise error, the transaction will be committed automatically. If something goes wrong the transaction is rolled back.(Another answer could be to set the isolation_level to None after loading the db, which will implies an autocommit mode)
