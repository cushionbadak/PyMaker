I currently have an issue with my Output in Tinker. So whenever I try to output my data read from a file the output dialog is too small to fit the huge list of data. For example:The window is too large to display all my data so I looked into adding a scrollbar for the window in order to better fit the data and easily see all of it.The issue arises in my code:When I add the scrollbar I get his as an output:So what I am trying to do is fit the data in a nice window dialog that has a scrollbar.This is the output: 
I think you need to change how the  is inserted into the , assuming its contents is newline separated (as shown in your updated question).The documentation presents the  method's calling sequence as:    insert(index, *elements)So one way to do things would be to call it multiple times, once for each element, in a loop:However, the  prefix on the second argument in  the documentation means that the method accepts a variable number of arguments starting at the point (each of which will be put on a separate line). This means the same thing could accomplished in a single call:What that does is first split the  data up into a list based upon the newlines in it, and then passes them as a bunch of separate arguments in the method call by prefixing the result returned from  with an , which causes it to be "unpacked" into multiple calling arguments.This is a fairly common Python idiom, so is worth learning and remembering. See Unpacking Argument Lists in the documentation.
