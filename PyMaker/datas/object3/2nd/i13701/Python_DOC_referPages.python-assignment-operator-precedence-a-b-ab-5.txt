From the Assignment statements documentation:An assignment statement evaluates the expression list (remember that this can be a single expression or a comma-separated list, the latter yielding a tuple) and assigns the single resulting object to each of the target lists, from left to right.You have two assignment target lists; , and , the value  is assigned to those two targets from left to right.First the  tuple is unpacked to . You now have  and . Note that  is mutable.Next you assign the same dictionary and integer to , where  evaluates to the dictionary, and  evaluates to , so you are setting the key  in the dictionary to the tuple  creating a circular reference. The  thus refers to the same object that  is already referencing.Because assignment takes place from left to right, you can break this down to:so  is the same object as :
