I have the following json output:I have this definition that should be looping through the JSON output received from a pycurl command and find all groups that start with KK for example and create a list from all the ID's in the respective monitors field to add to another section of a script I wrote. In the above output it should provide 9 IDs (3 from each group) ... For whatever reason it's only grabbing the first 3 monitor IDs.The output from this will be passed into the following:modifyMonitors is another pycurl definition that will post to a site.
If you are trying to create a generator function with -  , you have created it wrongly , when you do  it returns from the function, you need to use the  keyword , also, if you need to yield each id in `monitors list separately , you should loop over them and yield separately. Example -For Python 3.3 + , you can use  to yield all values from an iterable/iterator (called generator delegation) -
