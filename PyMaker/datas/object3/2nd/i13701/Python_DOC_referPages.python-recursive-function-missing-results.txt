Coming from Python recursively appending list function Trying to recursively get a list of permissions associated with a file structure.I have this function:That returns all the results except the folders that contain other folders.Output from function would be [True, False, False]another case would be, where A = allowed, R = restrictedOutput would be [True,True,False,False,True,True,True]
The basic issue occurs you are only returning the  , when folder does not have any children , when it has children, you are not including the  in your return result , which is most probably causing you issue. You need to do -This should result in (not tested) -
why not  os.walkWhen topdown is True, the caller can modify the dirnames list in-place  (perhaps using del or slice assignment), and walk() will only recurse  into the subdirectories whose names remain in dirnames; this can be  used to prune the search, impose a specific order of visiting, or even  to inform walk() about directories the caller creates or renames  before it resumes walk() again. Modifying dirnames when topdown is  False is ineffective, because in bottom-up mode the directories in  dirnames are generated before dirpath itself is generated.for example you can build generator (lazy list) that generates only non restricted directories
