Natural Text
I am using ElementTree to read an .xml file and save the output to a .csv file. I loop over all of the lines in the xml file and save the name and text pairs in a list.I then loop over the savedParameters and write them to a csv file. This all works fine apart from in one situation, take the example from the xml below.In this case everything will be stored as expected apart from the  field. This field should be empty however when I access child.text() it stores a blank string with a new line i.e all of the spaces between  and . Therefore when I write out to the csv it writes out the new line. I have tried  and  but neither solve my problem. Does anyone know a way around this?
You should be able to strip out the newlines (from start and end of a string) using  (without giving any arguments) .Example -As seen above,  would return empty string, if the string only contains whitespaces, which seems to be the case for your  . So you should be able to do -  before you try to store it in the dictionary. Example -
