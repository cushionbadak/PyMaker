I am using  to run a numerical simulation iterating over all possible combinations of my input parameters. In the example below, I have two parameters and six possible combinations:How can I get the size of  (six, in the example)? I'd need to print this before the  loop starts.I understand  is not a list. I can calculate , but this consumes the iterator so the  loop no longer works.I tried:but this doesn't work, either. I could do:but it's hardly elegant and pythonic!
To implement Kevin's answer for an arbitrary number of source iterables, combining  and :Note that this will not work if your source iterables are themselves iterators, rather than sequences, for the same reason your initial attempts to get the length of the  failed. Python generally and  specifically can work in a memory-efficient way with iterators of any length (including infinite!) so finding out lengths up-front isn't really a case it was designed to deal with.
How about:
