Here is my code and does anyone have any ideas what is wrong? I open my JSON content directly by browser and it works,thanks in advance,Lin
This error raised because the  is a unicode/str variable, change the second line of your code to resolve your error: get a file object in first parameter position and call the  method of this.Also you can call the  method of the response to fetch data directly:
 returns the content as a single (unicode) string. The  function however requires a file-like argument.The solution is rather simple: Just use  instead of :An even better solution though is to simply call  on the response object directly. So donâ€™t use  but :While this uses  itself internally, it hides that implementation detail, so you can just focus on getting the JSON response.
