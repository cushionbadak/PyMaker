I'm planning to use  to parallelize execution of functions. According to the documentation, its  object can only accept a simple function in . My actual situation involves initialization (loading of data) prior to execution of the 'to-be-parallelized' function. How do I arrange that?The 'to-be-parallelized' function is called in an iteration for many times. I don't want it to be re-initialized each time.In other words, there's an  function that produces some output to this tbp function. Each child should have its own copy of that output, because the function depended on that.
It sounds like you're looking for an equivalent to the / options that  takes. Currently, that behavior doesn't exist for , though there is a patch waiting for review that adds that behavior.So, you can either use  (which might be fine for your usecase), wait for that patch to get merged and released (you might be waiting a while :)), or roll your own solution. Turns out, it's not too hard to write a wrapper function for map that takes an , but only calls it one per process:Output:
