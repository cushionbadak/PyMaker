I'm struggling to understand what the init() function does in the python mimetypes package.  Is it an outdated function that isn't needed in more recent versions of python?
 is useful if you want to add MIME type / extension mappings beyond the default. If you don't need to do that, then there's no need to call ; just use the utility functions normally, and they'll call it themselves if necessary. If you do need to do that, aside from  there's also  and .This applies to Python 2 and 3.
According to the  module documentation:The functions described below provide the primary interface for this  module. If the module has not been initialized, they will call init()  if they rely on the information init() sets up.Initialize the internal data structures. If given, files must be a  sequence of file names which should be used to augment the default  type map. If omitted, the file names to use are taken from knownfiles;  on Windows, the current registry settings are loaded. Each file named  in files or knownfiles takes precedence over those named before it.  Calling init() repeatedly is allowed.Specifying an empty list for files will prevent the system defaults  from being applied: only the well-known values will be present from a  built-in list.It's there both in Python 2.7 and Python 3.x.
