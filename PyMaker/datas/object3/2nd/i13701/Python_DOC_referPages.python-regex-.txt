The issue is that the file is encoded in one format, but you are openning the file in a different format . Most probably, the file is  , but you are openning in some ANSI format (I saw similar issue in notepad ++ , when I changed the encoding from UTF-8 to ANSI , for  ). Example to show the same behavior -My  -Code -You need to open the file in correct encoding, by passing the encoding as argument to  , like done above.From documentation of  -encoding is the name of the encoding used to decode or encode the file. This should only be used in text mode. The default encoding is platform dependent (whatever locale.getpreferredencoding() returns), but any text encoding supported by Python can be used. See the codecs module for the list of supported encodings.
