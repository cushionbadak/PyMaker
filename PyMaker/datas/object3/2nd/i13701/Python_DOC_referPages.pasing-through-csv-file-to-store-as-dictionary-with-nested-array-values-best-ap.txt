I am trying to take this csv file and parse and store it in a form of a dictionary (sorry if I use the terms incorrectly I am currently learning). The first element is my key and the rest will be values in a form of nested arrays.The issue was that in each line, some columns are a quotes because of multiple values per cell, and some only have a single entry but no quote. And cells that had no value input were inserted with an N. Since there was a mixture of quotes and non quotes, and numbers and non numbers.Wanted the output to look something like this:I wrote a script to clean it and store it, but was not sure if my script was "too long for no reason". Any tips?
There's a  module which makes working with csv files much easier.  In your case, your code becomeswhere the  lets us skip rows which are empty or have an empty first element.  This produces (newlines added)In practice, for processing, I think you'd want to replace 'N' with None or some other object as a missing marker, and make every value a list of floats (even if it's only got one element), but that's up to you.
