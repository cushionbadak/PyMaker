I've been adapting an old piece of code to be Python 3 compliant and I came across this individual scriptOn the second function,  the first line fails with:Is this a deprecated function or another problem alltogether? Should I be replacing  with something like ?
In Python 2,  and  are mostly equivalent.  is the type and  is a function with a slightly friendlier name; both take the same arguments and do the same thing when called, but calling  to create files is discouraged and trying to do type checks with  doesn't work.In Python 3, the file implementation in the  module is the default, and the  type in the builtin namespace is gone.  still works, and is what you should use.
You can do what the documentation for  suggests -When opening a file, itâ€™s preferable to use  instead of invoking this constructor directly.You should use  method instead.
