Natural Text
I need to parse text of text file into two categories:UniversityLocation(Example: Lahore, Peshawar, Jamshoro, Faisalabad)but the text file contain following text:I have written code that separate locations on the basis of 'comma'. The below code only work for first line of file and prints 'Lahore' after that it give following error 'list index out of range'.Please help I'm stuck on this.Thanks
It would appear that you can only be certain that a line has a location if there is a comma. So it would make sense to parse the file in two passes. The first pass can build a  holding all known locations. You can start this off with some known examples or problem cases.Pass two could then also use the comma to match known locations but if there is no comma, the line is split into a set of words. The intersection of these with the location set should give you the location. If there is no intersection then it is flagged as "unknown".Output would be:
Your input file does not have commas on every line, causing the code to fail. You could do something liketo handle the lines without comma differently, or simply reformat the input.
You can split using a comma, the result is always a list, you can check its size, if it is more than one, then you had already at least one comma, otherwise (if the size is one) you didn't have any comma
I hope this will work, but I couldn't get 'London' though. May be the data should be constant.o/p [' Lahore', ' Faisalabad', 'Lahore', 'Peshawar', ' Jamshoro']
