Natural Text
I'm writing a website/search engine with a Python back end, and every time a paragraph symbol shows up in my search results, the page gets a 500 server error. Does anyone know how I might be able to reformat the string containing the results so that it will get rid of the paragraph symbol?Thanks!
This sounds like a problem with text encoding. Make sure you're using Unicode strings as much as possible, and if it's not possible, always specify the encoding.
