I have a few lines of code for making a rotated string for a Caesar cipher and just for fun I am trying to condense them into one. Obviously this is pointless since it is completely unreadable but I'm curious. Still, I can't quite figure out how to do it. Here's what I have tried so farHere is the readable version which actually works is the amount to rotate the alphabet or the key for a keyed version of a Caesar cipher. You should be able to just run the code as is and see exactly what's wrongI know this is bad code but I find this kind of code interesting since the language supports linking so many if/else/for/lambda/whatever together into a single line. 
You can rewrite the else case using  (it’s  in Python 3):And then you can combine it to one line:But you’re absolutely right: It makes no sense to write it like this. It’s really unreadable.Since you’re using Python 2, you can actually use  here too, to remove the characters in  from . This uses the  parameter of that function:Your one-line expression is then a little bit shorter:
Given this simple test caseThe following one-liner seems to do the trick
This is just a quick golfing of your code (178 bytes):
The simplest one-liner you can have: All you need is a function , which you've already provided yourself in the question (I made few modifications from  to ):There's no need to force one-liners. You gain nothing, you lose readability.
