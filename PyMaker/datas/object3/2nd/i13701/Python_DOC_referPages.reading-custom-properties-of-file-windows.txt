My family has a hard time deciding what to eat for any particular week. Because of this, I am going to make a program that will select randomly select recipe files from a directory based on recipe attributes: amount of preparation required, serving temperature of the dish, etc.In order to accomplish this, I am hoping to store recipe attributes in the custom attributes section of the file. Any suggestions on python modules that would allow me to access the custom properties? I am currently running Windows 10, if that makes any difference.Disclaimer: I am aware that this question has been asked before. However, it has been quite a while, and the win32 solution suggested is not compatible with Python 3.4.
Pywin32 has builds for Python3.4 available, both 32-bit and 64-bit.But if you know which MS-Windows API calls you need, and you know which DLL they are in, you could always use .Alternative solutions are to put the attributes in a file (probably in the root of your tree of recipes). Each method has its pros and cons.JSON (easiest to edit)A pickled  of  or  object (fast to load, easy to use in your program)SQLite database (easiest to select recipes)Since you want to choose from recipies based on criteria, the SQLite database might be the most suitable option in this case.
