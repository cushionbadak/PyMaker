I am trying to mock a coroutine. As such, this mock's  and  are called. While mocking  works, I cannot mock :What am I missing? How to make sure my mock's  method is called?For now, I am using the following:However, I very much rather use a standard mock.
You need to use , not , to have magic methods like  available by default:Quoting from the documentation: allows you to assign functions (or other  instances) to magic methods and they will be called appropriately. The  class is just a  variant that has all of the magic methods pre-created for you (well, all the useful ones anyway).So, alternatively, you could still use the regular  object, but then you need to explicitly add that attribute:That's because although  creates attributes on the fly as you access them, any attributes with leading and trailing underscores are explicitly exempted from that. See this footnote:The only exceptions are magic methods and attributes (those that have leading and trailing double underscores). Mock doesnâ€™t create these but instead raises an . This is because the interpreter will often implicitly request these methods, and gets very confused to get a new Mock object when it expects a magic method. If you need magic method support see magic methods.But note that the magic methods are usually meant to be looked up on the class, not the instance, so directly adding the  attribute to a  instance can still fail; the  class takes care of this specific issue for you.
