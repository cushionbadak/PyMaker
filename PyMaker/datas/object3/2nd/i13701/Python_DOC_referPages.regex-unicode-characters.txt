The following regex working online but not working in python code and shows no matches:https://regex101.com/r/lY1kY8/2s=re.sub(r'\x.+[0-9]',' ',s)required:re.sub(r'\x.+[0-9]* ',' ',r'cats\xe2\x80\x99 faces')Out[23]: 'cats faces'basically wanted to remove the unicode special characters 
As another option that doesn't require regex, you could instead remove the unicode characters by removing anything not listed in 
Use  flag.Use  as  starts matching from beginningwith EDIT:The correct way would be to decode to  and then apply regex.
Assume you use Python 2.xMeans chars like  is with 1 length, instead 3. So that you cannot match it with  to match it.Help this help a bit.
