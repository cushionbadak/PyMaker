I coded an algorithm in python and intend to compare its results with another software. Unfortunately, I am getting different results for an identical problem because python considers all decimals in parameters while the other software round numbers into two decimals. I wonder if there is any option or package in python that automatically rounds decimals as mentioned. I have a lot of calculations during the code so I need a solution which automatically does that.Thanks
You can use the built-in function round()It is explained here:https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#roundif you want to round the float a to 2 decimals you need to use:    round(a,2)
