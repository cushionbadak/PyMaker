I am trying to write iterator class that will allow me to specify the length of steps the iterator makes. But I am stuck with that problem.My code:this shows me letter 'l' alwaysbut loop gives me: =TypeError: next() missing 1 required positional argument: 'step'`:
Your  method should not take any arguments (other than ). You are not even using the  argument, you are (correctly) using . Just remove the argument:Next, you have an error; you want to test if the index drops below  after subtracting, otherwise you generate negative indices. You could test the index together with the step subtracted:Demo:
I realize this is not a direct answer to the question, but in case you just want to get the job done, and think you need to implement it all yourself; you don't.
To implement this:as your own iterator:Example:Note: starts with  does not accept any argument except first you get  then you decrement the indexA more flexible design would separate the reversing (e.g., delegate it to the  builtin) and using  (accept an arbitrary reversible iterable and/or use/implement extended slicing) e.g., based on @Cyphase's suggestion:
