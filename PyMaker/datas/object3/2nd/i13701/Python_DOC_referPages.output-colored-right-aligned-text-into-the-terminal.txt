Natural Text
I want to output colored text completly aligned to the right in the terminal (like in this screenshot of pacman (packet manager of the arch linux distribution)(not colored)) Currently I'm using :This works great until I add colors via ANSI escape codes:Which looks like this: I.e. the right side is not completly right aligned. Which is "right", because  is actually  which of course has a higher lenght than  and thus needs less spaces to be right aligned. Until the terminal gets the text and only displays  (with color).Am I missing anything in the python std lib or click? Or is there a simple library that deals with terminal colors and alignment that could help me? Or is there a simple solution to this problem?
click's documentation does not mention alignment (which is why you are using python's built-in string class).  You could stay within the current set of interfaces by telling your script to remember the lengths of the strings before calling , and adding the difference to the width used for the format call.  (This would not work as well if you were centering text).There are perhaps other libraries, but you could use the curses interface with the  function to draw single-line displays.
First, I want to figure out that  provide a way to get the terminal size: , the documentation is hereAnd my solution, should works even you resize the terminal:Since  actually is , we increase the width by hand to avoid the problem.Edit: PyFormat is useful for me when do string format in python. It helps me understand string formating. Hope it will help you.
