Say I have a class:Much like this user, I want  to change to  all by itself, without me having to do anything else, as soon as something is appended to the list.  As it is above,  is still .  However, I want mine to go "one way".  That is, I don't want  to change  into .  (So technically not a duplicate, right?)How can I accomplish this?It seems I should be using property setters, but despite googling around for a few hours, including reading up on the linked question, I still don't understand how to do this.
You should use a  , the property would be evaluated everytime you try to access it, so you would end up checking the latest  . Also, if you only specify the getter for the property, without setter, you would not be able to do -  , etc. Example -Example/Demo -
This should do it (I changed some things to follow better practices):Demonstration:A  essentially gives you the syntax of accessing an attribute's value, while behind the scenes it's calling a method. Properties aren't just for getting a value; you can also use them for setting and deleting. For more information, see the  documentation.
