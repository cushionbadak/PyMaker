I want to parse the cmdline option to be  type in argparse.For example:Generally:In the above,  is the option.  in this way I want the argument to be present. It should flag an error if it is not in the proper format and print the help message. I can use regular expression once I collect the project value using . If not in the above format can flag an error. But is there a way to filter out this and flag an error at parsing the cmdline arguments itself?
You can take advantage of this fact from the argparse documentation:type= can take any callable that takes a single string argument and returns the converted value:For example, to support the first format () you could do something like:This gets you, with valid arguments:And with invalid arguments:You could apply a similar solution to your second example.
