Test File Contents (in Binary)Test CodeWhat is ReturnedRunning the the code returns this. For my program to work correctly, I need the values like b'!' to be returned as b'\x20'. What can I do to accomplish this? Thank for your help!
The byte values are correct. Python just choses to show you ASCII characters when possible, to aid debugging:The actual byte value is still 33 decimal, 21 hexadecimal, but that byte maps to an ASCII character. Any printable ASCII codepoint will be displayed as such whenever you produce the representation () output for a  object, as that is far more readable. Certain characters (newline, carriage return) are displayed using their corresponding literal escape syntax, e.g.  or , while only the remainder uses  hex codes. Would you rather Python displays  or  when debugging code handling bytes?If you want to display hex values, explicitly format the byte value:to display it as a 2-digit lowercase hex, orto include a leading . Use  for uppercase.Demo:If you want to display a series of bytes, you can use the  function:With a bit of formatting, you can make any binary file display in both hexadecimal and ASCII representations.
