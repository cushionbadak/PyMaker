Hi so I'm trying to figure out how to create an iterator object using Python that would remove duplicates or more so omit duplicates.For example I have a list (1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5) and I get (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)I understand that in order to get an iterator object I have to create it. So:I'm actually not entirely sure what to do next in this problem. Thanks in advance for any comments or help!

If preserving original order is not important, simply use :
