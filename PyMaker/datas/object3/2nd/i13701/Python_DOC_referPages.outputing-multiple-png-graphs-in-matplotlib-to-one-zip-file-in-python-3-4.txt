I wrote a program that outputs multiple different pie charts (more than 60) from a CSV file using MatPlotLib in Python. I don't think I need to share all of the code, but I have a  function that creates the graph, that ends with the following:This function successfully makes one of my graphs as a .png file in the cwd. I then run a loop that creates a pie chart for each section of my data. The code is as follows:I'm wondering if there are any Python packages that would help me automatically output all 60+ graphs to one zip file.
Sure, there's the standard zipfile module, which can zip existing files, and it can also zip a string of bytes. So if you don't want to create the files separately and then zip them you could save them to BytesIO objects and then zip up those byte buffers. I've linked you to the Python 3 docs, but those features are also available in Python 2.
If you want to save both 's and the , maybe for debugging purposes, you can do something like using :
