I am trying to do 128 bit manipulation in Python, to split the 128 bit after 32 bitI have tried the But there is no built-in length operator to find the length for  variable. I researched bitarray module, I don't want to use bit array in my code, is there any thing in pythonic way?Expected output would be .
You could use bit shifting () and bitwise AND ():where  is your integer. The resulting list will have 4 elements (because 128 / 32 is 4).In your case the result is 4 equal numbers (4294967295, because 4294967295 is 0xFFFFFFFF in hex).This works well for a known number of bits (32), but I'd rather use a helper function (following the same logic as above):In action:
it's better to work with numbers instead of stirngeventually you can conver number to string hex representation
