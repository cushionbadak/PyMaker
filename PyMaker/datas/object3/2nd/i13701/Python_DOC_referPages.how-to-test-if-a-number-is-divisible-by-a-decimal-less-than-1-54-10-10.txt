I'm trying to test if a  i.e() is divisible by .   returns  and not , why is that and how can I get it to do what I want it to do?
You can use the  module to avoid the floating point precision problem:
The tried and true method here is to multiply your divisor and dividend by a power of 10. Effectively,  54.10 becomes 541 and 0.10 becomes 1. Then you can use standard modulo or ceiling and floor to achieve what you need.
