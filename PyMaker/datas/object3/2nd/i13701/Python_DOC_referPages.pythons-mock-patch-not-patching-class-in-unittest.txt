I'm getting confused by using Mock in my python unittests. I've made this simplified version of my problem:I have this dummy class and methods:Which is using this class:And then this test:I would expect that running this test would pass and that  statement, for debugging, would output something like . Instead it prints out  and I get:Why isn't  being patched?
OK, fourth time through I think I understood the 'Where to patch' section of the Mock docs.So, instead of:I should use:Because we're testing the code in  where  has been imported already. So at that point  is availably globally(?) within .
