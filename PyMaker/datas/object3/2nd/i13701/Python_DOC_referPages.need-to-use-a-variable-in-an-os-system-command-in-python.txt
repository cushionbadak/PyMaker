I am new to python and I need to use a variable in the  command, here's my code so farthen i want to use the varable  in an  command so I was thinking something like I don't want answers for that specific command I just want to know in general but if you are going to use an example use shutdown
then i want to use the varable s in an os.systemUse  function.
You can use  to execute the particular command, in which case you can join the two strings either by using the  operator, string formatting (), string substitution or some other method.However, consider the case when the user enters the command  or some other malicious command.  Instead of using  you might want to take a look at subprocessIf you use subprocess you might find the following example handy:
 takes a string as the argument, so you can use anything that modifies a string. For example, string formatting:
Use subprocess.check_call, pass a list of args and you can add the variable wherever you like:
Passing place-holder "%s string alongside os.system" should work.os.system() will execute the command in shell.
The plus sign joins two stringsNo quotes are used around .  That way you get the value the user entered and not just a literal "s".
