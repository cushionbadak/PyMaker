I have an import statement and it has periods.Is it equivalent to?
Dots denote namespaces. Usually that means the code is organised into packages, and the easiest way to create such packages is by using directories with  files in them.There are esoteric ways to make such a statement work without directories, using custom loaders for example, but 99.9% of cases where you come across such a statement you probably have directories yes.For your example, you would expect there to be a  directory, containing an  directory, in which either lives a  file that contains the  name, or there is a  directory and  is eiter a name available in the  module in that directory, or a  module file.See the original packages specification.
No, app is a submodule of app, which is itself a submodule of xyz
