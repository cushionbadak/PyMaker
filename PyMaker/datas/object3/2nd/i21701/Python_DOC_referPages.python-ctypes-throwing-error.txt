so far I've gotten a DLL that wasn't meant for python to work with it, and types return: I just can't pass it arguments because I'm doing it wrong and I don't quite understand the documentation on how I'm supposed to do things. Basically, the function in the DLL I'm testing is named "iptouint". It takes a c_char_p and returns a c_double.Here is my code:
try simply indicating ctypes the argtypes it takes and the ones it returns:Although, consider these points:1) if, as the name indicates, this converts an IPv4 value s ina  string to an Unsigned Int, the return type os not "double" as you say - it would be ctypes.c_uint32 2) Your example value is not a valit IPv4 address, and cannot be converted to a 32 bit integer (neither does it makes sense as a "double" - i.e. a 64 bit floating point number) - it is simply invalid3) You don't need that if you are just trying to have an unsigned 32bit value for an ipv4 address in Python. There are quite a few, very readable, easier, and multiplatform ways to do that with pure python. For example:update:In Python 3.x there is the ipaddress module -https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html - which is also available as  a pip install for Python 2.x - it can handle this always in the correct way, and works fine with IPv6 as well.
