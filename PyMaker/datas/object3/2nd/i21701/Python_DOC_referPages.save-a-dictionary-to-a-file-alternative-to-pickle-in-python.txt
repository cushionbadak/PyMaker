Answered I ended up going with pickle at the end anywayOk so with some advice on another question I asked I was told to use pickle to save a dictionary to a file. The dictionary that I was trying to save to the file was When pickle saved it to the file... this was the formatCan you please give me an alternative way to save the string to the file?This is the format that I would like it to save inmembers = {'Starspy' : 'SHSN4N', 'Test' : 'Test1'} Complete Code:

The YAML format (via pyyaml) might be a good option for you:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamlhttp://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyYAML
Although, unlike , this won't be as pretty, will be run together,  at least makes a dictionary savable in a simple way for quick tasks:
You asked Ill give it a shot. How do I specify what file to dump it to/load it from?Apart from writing to a string, the  module provides a -method, which writes to a file:There is a  method for reading, too.
While I'd suggest , if you want an alternative, you can use .With , if you had used , the dictionary would have been written to  as a pickled dictionary instead of with clear text.You can get  here: https://github.com/uqfoundation/klepto is probably a better choice for pickling then  itself, as  can serialize almost anything in python.   also can use .You can get  here: https://github.com/uqfoundation/dill
