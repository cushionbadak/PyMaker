Given a URL like the following, how can I parse the value of the query parameters? For example, in this case I want the value of .I am using Django in my environment; is there a method on the  object that could help me?I tried using  but it is not returning the value  as I had hoped.
Python 2:Python 3:

I'm shocked this solution isn't on here already. Use: This will "get" the variable from the "GET" dictionary, and return the 'variable_name' value if it exists, or a None object if it doesn't exist.
for Python > 3.4
I know this is a bit late but since I found myself on here today, I thought that this might be a useful answer for others.With parse_qsl(), "Data are returned as a list of name, value pairs."
There is a new library called furl. I find this library to be most pythonic for doing url algebra. To install:Code:
The url you are referring is a query type and I see that the request object supports a method called arguments to get the query arguments. You may also want try  directly to get your value from the object..
Hope this helps
The urlparse module provides everything you need:urlparse.parse_qs()
There's not need to do any of that. Only withNotice that I'm not specifying the method (GET, POST, etc). This is well documented and this is an exampleThe fact that you use Django templates doesn't mean the handler is processed by Django as well
In pure Python:

There is a nice library w3lib.url
Btw, I was having issues using parse_qs() and getting empty value parameters and learned that you have to pass a second optional parameter 'keep_blank_values' to return a list of the parameters in a query string that contain no values. It defaults to false. Some crappy written APIs require parameters to be present even if they contain no values
