In the Flickr API docs, you need to find the MD5 sum of a string to generate the  value.How does one go about generating an MD5 sum from a string? Flickr's example:string: MD5 sum: 
For Python 2.x, use python's hashlibOutput: 
You can do the following:Python 2.xPython 3.xHowever in this case you're probably better off using this helpful Python module for interacting with the Flickr API:http://stuvel.eu/flickrapi... which will deal with the authentication for you.Official documentation of hashlib
Have you tried using the MD5 implementation in hashlib? Note that hashing algorithms typically act on binary data rather than text data, so you may want to be careful about which character encoding is used to convert from text to binary data before hashing.The result of a hash is also binary data - it looks like Flickr's example has then been converted into text using hex encoding. Use the  function in hashlib to get this.
