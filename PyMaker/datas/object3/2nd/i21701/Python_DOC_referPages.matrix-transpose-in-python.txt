I am trying to create a matrix transpose function for python but I can't seem to make it work.Say I have and I want my function to come up withSo in other words, if I were to print this 2D array as columns and rows I would like the rows to turn into columns and columns into rows.I made this so far but it doesn't work
Python 2:Python 3:
the list generator creates a new 2d array with list items instead of tuples.
If your rows are not equal you can also use :Edit: In Python 3 the functionality of  changed,  can be used instead:  Source: Whatâ€™s New In Python 3.0
Much easier with numpy:
The problem with your original code was that you initialized  at every element, rather than just once per row:This works, though there are more Pythonic ways to accomplish the same things, including @J.F.'s  application.
To complete J.F. Sebastian's answer, if you have a list of lists with different lengths, check out this great post from ActiveState. In short:The built-in function zip does a similar job, but truncates the result  to the length of the shortest list, so some elements from the original  data may be lost afterwards. To handle list of lists with different lengths, use:
The "best" answer has already been submitted, but I thought I would add that you can use nested list comprehensions, as seen in the Python Tutorial.  Here is how you could get a transposed array:
This one will preserve rectangular shape, so that subsequent transposes will get the right result:





``This function will return the transpose
