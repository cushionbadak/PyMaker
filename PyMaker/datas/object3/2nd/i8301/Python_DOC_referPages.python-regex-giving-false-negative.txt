I am trying to regex match phone numbers and I have come up with the following code:  This should match numbers such as:121421421411214-444-4444214.333.3333  However, this will not match to ANY of the above examples. I have tested this on a few different regex validators and they are all successful on their. I'm assuming the python regex engine is different, but after searching around I cannot find the difference. Any suggestions?
Follow your code, made couple of small changes:All three test cases passed.
Try this regex:Most likely you do not want to allow mixed separator types, e.g. if a number uses no separator then it must use no separator everywhere (and the same for dot and hyphen).  In this case, we can use an alternation to cover the three types of patterns.Demo here:Regex101
