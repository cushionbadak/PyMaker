I'm trying to learn some advanced decorator usage. Specifically, I'm trying to  to monkey patch a class's method via a decorator within a function.This is a basic example to illustrate what I'm trying to do. I have a function  that does some stuff; and within that function there's an instance of a class. That instance I would like to monkey patch. I'm trying either trying to do a 1 to 1 replacement with  to  or, monkey patch 's  method to 's  method. When I run the code above, I get the following:I would like to find some way augment the 's  method so that we get the following output:There's a  module within the  library, however, it's not clear to be how I could leverage that for my use case. I'm fairly married to the idea of not passing an argument into the decorator or an extra argument into the  function as many of the examples of the mock library show. I also notice that the moto library is accomplishing something similar to what I'm trying to do. I tried digging into the source code, but it seems fairly complex for what I'm trying to do. 
How about updating the global variables dict of the function?
