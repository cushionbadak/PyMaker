I stepped into a feature of python very dangerous to my style of programming. I wondered what pattern would be best to resolve these conflicts. The follwoing example should give a good insightTo my surprise the last print statement returned  and not . While I was baffled at first, I think I now understand what happens. By 'updating' the  I am not only changing the attribute of object  but also the parameter of the class.My solution would be to never specify the default parameter as a list, dict or similar (unless this feature is wanted) and always use None instead, i.e.But is there a more elegant way to tackle this 'problem'?
Your solution is correct. This behaviour occurs with any mutable object, such as lists for example. So you should always use None (or a non mutable object) as a default parameter.https://docs.python.org/3.6/reference/datamodel.html
