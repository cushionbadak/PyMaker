Natural Text
Even when run in a seperate thread my UI hangs while a large file is being loaded into a Text widget. Is it just because the application is under heavy load or is there a way I can keep the UI functional while this is happening. Im loading several text files in different widgets so the hang up is longer than desired. Tested on several machines with plenty of resources.

In order to invoke  in a separate thread with positional/keyword arguments, use the  and  arguments to  like so:... which would invoke  in the thread.
