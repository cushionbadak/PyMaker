I am trying to write a script and part of it has to check if a URL is available or not. The problem is that when I get a reply back 200,404, etc the program works fine and I can handle the reply but when the URL is not reachable, the program goes into the error below.This is part of the code:Error:Is there a workaround to this?If I can set the script to print a line like URL not available and exists will be great.
Just catch the exception. The Errors and Exceptions section of the  documentation indicates you should be able to catch the  exception here:Quick demo with a non-existing hostname:
