sample code what i am talking aboutis there a way in python 3 to have real virtual method without this really bad name "virtual__getX" i need clear names "__getX"if i remove virtual from name the result isis there better way to write real virtual methods like in "normal language" like delphi   
You can't have a virtual function named . Attributes starting with a double underscore are considered private, and python internally applies name-mangling to them.You can, however, rename  to  and it'll work as you expect.
