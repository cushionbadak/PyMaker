I have three Python dictionaries like so:I want to create functions to get the newest or oldest values from these dictionaries based on the  value.  I imagine I would need to put all of these dicts in a list:An function might work like so:
You could use  to parse the dates, then after that you just compare them until you've found the newest date.Now doing  (given your data) would output:Note that if there's multiple instances of the newest date. Then the last instance will be selected. If you instead what the first instance, then use  instead.
You can use max and min built-in function.
