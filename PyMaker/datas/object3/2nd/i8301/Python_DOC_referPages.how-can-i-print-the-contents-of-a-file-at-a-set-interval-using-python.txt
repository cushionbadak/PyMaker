Natural Text
I have a file that resembles the following:I want to print the lines of this file with a 2 second delay between lines. How can this be done? Thank you in advance.Edit: This is the code I've decided to use based on the help I've received. Thank you.
If you have file with data - you can easily real lines from itand then you can print every line with 2 seconds (or what you want) interval
I hope this was the answer you were looking for.

 makes the interpreter wait for n seconds. note that you may have to  if you print very short text; the output is buffered and may not write to the console at every  statement.this is for python2in python3 you can do this:also make sure the interpreter finds your file when using a relative path. more on this here.
