I am trying to execute post-failure operations; so I can gather info on the state of the system only if it fail.So far, I did not find a solution that works. I did try to add a try-except and this works; but then the output of my test run is "success", which is totally wrong.Since the exception is caught, I assume that the unit test class won't be involved in reporting the error, and this end up with the test not failing.How do I "escalate" the failure at the same time to both the except section and the Unit test class?
You can re-raise the exception once you caught and recorded it:Note that you may and should be more specific about the error you are catching - in this case, you are looking for catching the  exception instead of the generic .
