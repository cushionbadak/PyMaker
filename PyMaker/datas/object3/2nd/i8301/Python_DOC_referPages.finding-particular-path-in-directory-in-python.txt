How could I find the path of the directory which contains a date like 20170423 ? meaning, it could be any date, but i want to have that specific path until i get a folder that contains a date.. There may be several sub-directories along the way that contain that pattern, but that's a special case, where i would need to give more precision, like the content of the folder to select the proper one. give it a shot if you d like for the special case, but for the case where i know that only one folder along the way contains that pattern, the way i start is :This gives me all the paths from the start folder, to the end. Now, i would like to return the paths that have the date pattern in them, and in particular one, that has let's say whose int(folder_name) is < datetime.datetime.today() I could come up with a rough solution, but SO has people with very good skills at coming up with succint elegant solutions, so there it is.. any idea? thanks!for example, for the path start= C:/ this would return C:\Users\abc\def\ghi\20170412I was thinking something like this could work:
Assuming the date  is a file named accordingly.Then you could use :If only a single file exists  then the above would output:You can of course change the if statement to fit whether you want to check  or anything else.Warning: If you do  then this is most likely gonna take a looong time to finish. Because it is going to run through every single directory on the C drive.You can equally change Thus if  is actually a directory, then the above would output the same as before:I was hoping for something more succinctYou could still pack it into a list comprehension if that's what you call more brief.
