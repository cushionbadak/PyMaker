So basically, I have 10-50 additional parameter configurations that I want to potentially send into the script via  - and I don't want to configure them all in the python script.It's only me running the script, so there is no security issue. Is there any way I could call my script withwithout having set up any of the  as arguments in my script? Or anything else with the same effect -- the  analogue of functions?
Where are your configuration parameters defined ?  If your program has a list of such parameters, you can always use a loop to  add all parameters.There is no way to auto-parse unknown options, because there is no way whether you want 0, 1 or many arguments associated with an unknown option.  However you can delay parsing of unknown options using .
