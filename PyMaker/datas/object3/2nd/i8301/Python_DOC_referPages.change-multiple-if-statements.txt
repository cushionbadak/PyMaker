You have three options:store method names, then use  to turn the name back into a reference to the method:I note that at this point this becomes a simple lower-casing exercise, perhaps with a set test to ensure you can't call arbitrary methods:Store the bound methods in the dictionary each time:Use  objects; these take a string method name and can be called with an object to call the method on:
Use  to get the attribute from the user object. And you wouldn't need the  any longer:Note that the dictionary values should be strings, since the methods are bounded to the  object and you can't call them as you would unbounded functions.Apparently, you can do without the dict:
