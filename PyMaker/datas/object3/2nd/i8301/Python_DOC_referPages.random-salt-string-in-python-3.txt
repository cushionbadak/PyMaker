I'm trying to migrate the following to Python 3.Here's a traceback of the failure in Python 3.What's the right way, in Python 3, to generate a salt of length N that's compatible with hashlib functions?EDIT: Working version using accepted answer:
You can use  to turn a string object into bytes.But you shouldn't.The  module doesn't produce cryptographically secure random numbers. That leaves a vulnerability in your code. If you're using Python 3.6, the  module is better.If not,  is also documented to be "unpredictable enough for cryptographic applications".
