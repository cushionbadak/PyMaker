I can't figure out why the print statement from  won't display and instead I get 'None' returned. If I include  in my return statement in my wrapper  I get an error saying tuple object not callable. What is wrong with this example?
You're never calling the wrapped  in your . Add a call, for example:would now produce (since  implicitly returns ):If I include  in my return statement in my wrapper  I get an error saying tuple object not callable. The error must've come from you doing something like:Remember that decorating is (roughly) equivalent to just doing:Your  decorator now returned a tuple  instead of a wrapper function, so when you try to call , you're actually trying to "call" the tuple that has been assigned to .As a good measure you should learn how to use , which is a convenience function for invoking , which updates the wrapper function to look like func:Without it you'd get:and with wraps:It copies over other useful attributes as well, such as .
