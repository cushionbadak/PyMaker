It then passes the equivalent of  (no spaces!) to the  process.Different shells can treat whitespace differently. Most let you escape whitespace by using quotes or backslashes. So the following fails just as much in a shell as it does in Python:With , unless you set , you are not passing the arguments through the shell, you pass this straight to the  process that is started. So you have to deliver those arguments the way  expects them to be delivered, with no spaces before the  for options.If you need to split out commands and arguments in roughly the same way the shell does, use the  module:
