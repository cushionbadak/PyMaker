Hello I am having a problem which I guess is really simple. I have the following class:and I get the error:  How can I solve this problem?
First:  is a static method of class.In your code  is a result of function . Probably You need a function:
The problem is you're calling  at the creation time of the model class, when the fields have yet to take any value.You can solve this by making  a  so  does not get called at the creation of the model class, when the fields have no value:You can then access  like a regular model field:Pro-Tip: you can use integer division  in your calculation and avoid calling :  
This error means the type of objects you're trying to multiply (*) are different objects, you cannot multiply  with . You mixed  object with  object. You can make  appears in multiplication expressions by defining  operator overloading method in your class so when an instance of  appears with multiplication expression Python automatically overloads  method. In python 2.X  gets called when different types of objects appear in such expressions in order to coerce them to a common type. Though, the use of  isn't recommended. Some classes that may be used in mathematical operations use  to return an integer representing their values when needed:
