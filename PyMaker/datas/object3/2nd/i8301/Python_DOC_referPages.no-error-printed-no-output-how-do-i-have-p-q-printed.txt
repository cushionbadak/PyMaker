This is what I have written so far. How do I arrange or amend my code so I get '['p','q']' printed? As of now, nothing prints to the console nor any error shows up telling me what I have done wrong.
You have an infinite loop in the , because you have only , without the assignment.It should be: .Also, you can use slicing for this:
You need to increment  variable like this:New value of  should be assigned to . 
You can directly slice  . Refer more on lists.
Seems like what you are trying to do is simply this.which outputs Python array indexes start at  therefore to output  we would need to say  and to get  would be .Since it is an array you can get the data from the first index  then stop just before the 3 index . would output what you want aswell.
In regards to your code I would suggest this edit:You can slice a list like so:prints:or from the end:prints:or to reverse a list:prints:or to slice in reverse:prints:again reverse, although a bit unnecessary:prints:or to get elements not at the start:prints:
