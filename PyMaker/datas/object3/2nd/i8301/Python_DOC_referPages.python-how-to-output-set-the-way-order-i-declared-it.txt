I am new to python and things are little why's and how's. Just got to know "SETS" in python and I seem can't print it out the same order as I declare it.my code:output:I tried the sorted() method but it gives me the alphabetically order and that's not what I want. I want it to print the same order as I declare it. How can I do that? Any help will be much appreciated thanks.
Don't use a set -- use a list (or tuple if you will never change the values or length), which retains the ordering.
