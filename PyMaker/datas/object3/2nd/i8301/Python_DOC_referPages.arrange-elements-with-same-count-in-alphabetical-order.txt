Python Collection  method returns the top n elements with their counts. However, if the counts for two elements is the same, how can I return the result sorted by alphabetical order?For example: for a string like: , for the "2-most common" elements, I want the result to be for specified :and NOT:Notice that although  and  have the same frequency,  comes before  in the resultant list since it comes before  in alphabetical order.How can I achieve that?
There are two issues here:Include duplicates when considering top n most common values excluding duplicates.For any duplicates, order alphabetically.None of the solutions thus far address the first issue. You can use a heap queue with the   recipe (also available in 3rd party libraries such as ) to calculate the nth largest count.Then use  with a custom key.
I would first sort your output array in alphabetical order and than sort again by most occurrences which will keep the alphabetical order:Output:
I would go for:This sorts count descending (as they are already, which should be more performant) and then sorts by name ascending in each equal count group
This is one of the problems I got in the interview exam and failed to do it. Came home slept for a while and solution came in my mind.  
if you need to get slice:
