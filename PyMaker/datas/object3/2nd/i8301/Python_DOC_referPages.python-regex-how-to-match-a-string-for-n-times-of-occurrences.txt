I want to match the line that contains word 100.00% for 3 occurrences.e.g So line 1 and 3 should all be matched.However, my following regex seems only to match the case that has 100.00% repeated for 3 times. (Only match line 3)I wonder how should I do to match line 1 as well?Thanks everybody!
an alternative that requires a simpler regular expression is to find all substrings that match  and test if the count == 3.example
Halemur Ali's answer is much cleaner than this one which I leave only for completeness.The notation  is merely a shortcut, you can always replace it by expanding the repeated sequence. To match line where the sequence  appears exactly 3 times, you can use:This uses negative-lookaheads.It can be read this way: start of the line any character (zero or more), until a  sequence the  sequence followed by any character (zero or more) until a  sequence repeated 3 times end of lineConsider taking a look at python's documentation of the  module.Note: brackets are not necessary to match a single character.
 should also do the trick, and is readable, concise, and (I think) performant.
