This question already has an answer here:How do I create a variable number of variables?                    16 answers                I have a list of commands that I want to iterate over so I've put those commands into a list. However, I want to also use that list as strings to name some files. How do I convert variable names to strings?I want fileName to be "itemIDScore.txt" but itemIDScore in queryList is a SQL query that I'll use elsewhere. I need to name files after the name of the query.Thanks!
I don't think you may get name of the variable as string from the variable object. But instead, you may create the list of string of your variables as:Then you may access the value of variable from the variable name string using the  function as:As the  document say:Return a dictionary representing the current global symbol table. This is always the dictionary of the current module (inside a function or method, this is the module where it is defined, not the module from which it is called).
As far as I know, there is no easy way to do that, but you could simply use a dict with what currently are variable names as keys, e.g.:This would also preserve your desired semantics without making the code less readable.
I think you would have an easier time storing the names explicitly, then evaluating them to get their values. For example, consider something like:
You can use the in-built str() function.
