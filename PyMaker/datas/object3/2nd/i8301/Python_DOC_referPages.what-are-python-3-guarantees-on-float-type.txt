For example, is it guaranteed that float in Python 3 is the 64-bit IEEE-754 binary floating-point type?
Python docs describe this in a passing mention:almost all platforms map Python floats to IEEE-754 “double  precision”.So, no, it's not a language guarantee but it does seem like CPython will use it everywhere it's available.Rejected PEP 754 describes in its rejection notice:Several ideas of this PEP were implemented for Python 2.6.  float('inf') and repr(float('inf')) are now guaranteed to work on  every supported platform with IEEE 754 semantics.
