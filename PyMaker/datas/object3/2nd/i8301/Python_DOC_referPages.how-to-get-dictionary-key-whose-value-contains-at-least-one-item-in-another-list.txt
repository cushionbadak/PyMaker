I have written a simple script the scope of which is:Now I need to find all the keys of the dictionary which have at least one of the list entries in the valuesExample: 19 is in Joeys values, so Joey is the winner.How I did it: (no programmer at all)But this is very time consuming as it iterates over basically everything in the database. May I ask for a help optimizing this? Thanks!
I would use a list comprehension and the builtin  which shortcircuits once a shared item is found. Turning your list into a set reduces the complexity of the membership lookup from  to :Be careful to not assign builtins as the names for your objects (e.g. ) to avoid making the builtin unusable later on in your code.
Don't use the name ,  is the name of a library function. will stop iterating through  as soon as it "sees" a shared value, saving some time.
You could also use set intersection to check if any of the elements in the dictionary value tuples have anything in common with your "list" entries:
