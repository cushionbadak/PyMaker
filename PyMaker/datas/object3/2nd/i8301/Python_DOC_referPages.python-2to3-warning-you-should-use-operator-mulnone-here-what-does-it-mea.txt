I am using 2to3 to convert a script. The only warning I get is:Line 716 of the original script is:I don't get where shall I use . The reference documentation of  (link to docs) shows that I can pass  without any problem. So, what shall I do?
2to3 is just getting confused about which  you mean.  It thinks you're using  in Python 2:instead of .  That's not a great guess on its part, to be honest, because  takes 2 arguments, but that's what it's guessing.  You can see the transformation listed in the docs.You can avoid the warning by using the fully-qualified  or just ignore it.
