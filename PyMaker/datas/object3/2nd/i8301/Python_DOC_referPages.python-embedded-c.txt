I have read few tutorial on python embedded c++. I had refer back to python object.https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/function.htmlPython script:C++ ScriptI had use PyRun_SimpleString() to do before, it can work. But, it cannot pass the variable to C++. The result I want is it can store the string to the variable at C++. Example after C++ execute the python script, python function return "1234". And "1234" is store at C++ variable (data2)Please, help me solve this problem. This is my first time python embedding c++, and have some guide please. Again, if can please provide me solution on ***Doing Some Stuff TO GET data from test() function in python script and store in variable data2Thanks very much.... Appreciate 
If I understand correctly, you want your C++ code to call your Python test() function and get the string result of that function back so the C++ code can do something with it.  If so, I think something like this would do the trick for you:
