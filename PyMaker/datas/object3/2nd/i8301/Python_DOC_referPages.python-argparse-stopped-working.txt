I had a perfectly fine and working piece of code, which used argparse. I've been using it for months for work without any issue. Below is an excrept.However, I ran the code today with the following arguments (which i have been doing all along):and the console output tells meI do not understand why this has stopped working. To troubleshoot, i added 2 input commands, but the code never reaches Could someone please advise me on a possible reason for this to happen. The version of python is 3.4.1, and has not been updated between the last time i ran this code and now.Thank you very much
Since  is present on all the calls to , my conclusion is that eithersomebody else has changed your program, orthis is the first time you have tried to run it without providing those argumentsI do, however, find it odd that running your program with the  option gives the following output:I'm puzzled as to why the message implies that required arguments are optional.
