In python3  will generate an extra blank line. Could someone make a brief explanation about this? Thanks in advance.
In the documentation for  it is stated that:All non-keyword arguments are converted to strings like  does and written to the stream, separated by  and followed by .The default value for  is , so Python first prints the supplied  and then  which equals  too; that's why you see two blank lines.Change the default value if you don't want that:Note that this also applies to Python 2.x's  statement, it also writes  at the end. You can change the behavior there by appending a comma character.
