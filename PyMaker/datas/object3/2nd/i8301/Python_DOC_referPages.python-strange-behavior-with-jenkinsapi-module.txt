I am trying to use python to interact with jenkins.Initially when I tried to  , I got the below ERROR.Then I installed .This resulted in successful import of  I was able to do a lot of work and then logged out of python CLI. I then logged back in and tried to  and then got the ERROR.All of a sudden, its giving me an  error. I have not installed any packages or modified anything. What could have gone wrong ?
The problem at hand is that when you were able to import , your working directory was ; after log out and log in, your working directory is . In latter case, Python is unable to find module in the same directory and fails.If you do  and then open Python shell,  should work.As a side note, you might want to learn about Pythons virtual environments (see this StackOverflow question for pointers) and installing packages through pip.
