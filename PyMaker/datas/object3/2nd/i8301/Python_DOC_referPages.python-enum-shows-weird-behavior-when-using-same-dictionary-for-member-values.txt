I don't understand why this Enum doesn't have all the members I defined, when I assign a dict as each member's value:The output is:â€¦ but I expected something like:Why aren't all the members shown?
Enum enforces unique values for the members. Member definitions with the same value as other definitions will be treated as aliases.Demonstration:The defined names do all exist, however they are all mapped to the same member.Have a look at the source code if you are interested:Further, it seems to me that you want to exploit the Enum class to modify the value (the dictionary) during run-time. This is strongly discouraged and also very unintuitive for other people reading/using your code. An enum is expected to be made of constants.
As @MichaelHoff noted, the behavior of  is to consider names with the same values to be aliases1.You can get around this by using the 2 library:Output is now:To reinforce what Michael said:   members are meant to be constants -- you shouldn't use non-constant values unless you really know what you are doing.A better example of using :1 See this answer for the standard  usage.2 Disclosure:  I am the author of the Python stdlib , the  backport, and the Advanced Enumeration () library.
