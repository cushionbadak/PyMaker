I'm starting with python and pandas and matplotlib. I'm working with data with over million entries. I'm trying to change the date format. In CSV file date format is 23-JUN-11. I will like to use dates in future to plot amount of donation for each candidate. How to convert the date format to a readable format for pandas?Here is the link to cut file 149 entriesMy code:First candidateData sliceTrying to convert to new date formatHere is the error message
