I'll try to keep this short. I'm working on a small program, and it has an unknown number of arguments being passed into it. The function should return the bitwise 'and' of all arguments that are input. What would be the best way to deal with it? So far this is what I have:Apologies if any of this is unclear at all or if there's something obvious I'm missing; I'm still trying to do my best to learn how to program.
You may use  to receive unknown number of parameters in function and then use the args with  to find the BITWISE AND using as:Note: In older versions of Python,  is available as built-in function.
 calls the  expression () on all pairs in the list and thereby reduces them till only one result is left.
