new to python, i found that subprocess's check_output runs nicely on Windows but it seems to only run cmds that are in windows PATH env variable.  i can execute the following fine:and ipconfig output is displayed fine.if i try run a specific command not in the path and try absolute path i get errors.Is there no way to use an absolute path reference for check_output? i was not finding any..i even tried changing to that directory..but i get the following error
Popen offers a 'cwd' argument, that will execute in the defined directory:Using check_output:
Please read about the documentation of .You can examine the output by catching this exception in a  block and using the exception instance's  attribute.In this way you can examine the failed command's exit status and output.  I don't know what triggered the exact error, but it's unlikely a result of using the absolute path.
