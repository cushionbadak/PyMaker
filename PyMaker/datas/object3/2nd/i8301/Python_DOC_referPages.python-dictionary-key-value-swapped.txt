I'm learning how to use a dictionary in python. However, it seems like when I print my dictionary, some items in my dictionary are swapped. Eg. [key,value],[value,key],[value,key],[key,value]. Is there something I'm missing?
WhyYou are using sets instead of dictionaries.  You must divide the two items by a  not a  .  Sets don't enforce order so the elements will be periodically swapped with this implementation.New Code
