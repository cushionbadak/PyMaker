Natural Text
I need to rename filenames in a folder containing many text files.The renaming should follow the sequence of numbers for every file.It should be like as follows:the above files are in a folder named my code is like this my problem is the files after renaming are moving into the folder where the python code is written.but i need the renamed files in the same folder in which they are present before 
Great, so what have you tried?As a starting point, have a look at the -module, especially  and .EDIT:Your files are moved, because you replace the whole path with the number with . This renames  to be renamed to , which moves the file to the current directory as a side effect.Also I am not sure what you try to achieve with the htm(l)-replaces, since afterwards you replace everything with your number.Additionally, you don't need to build a copy of the list of txt-files and afterwards iterate over it, you can do it directly on the original file list.So this could probably work for you:Side note: the rename will fail when a file with the new file name already exists. You should probably handle that with .
