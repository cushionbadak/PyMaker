I have a python string like this: How do I get two parts?I used  and got something that is not optimal:I tried regex but can't figure it out. 
Why not add those  again Result: ['--jvm 100 ', '--cpu 200']
With regular expression, you can do it like this:

Assuming you're trying to get the values from all the arguments, you should use an argument parsing package to do this.https://docs.python.org/2/howto/argparse.htmlThey're already designed with all the parsing rules so all you'd have to do is focus on getting values out of them. In many cases, arg parsing tools will let you specify how values should be typed, so numbers will be converted to integers and  converted to booleans.The above is just an example, so you'll need to tune it to meet your needs.
