Is  equivalent to  in Python 3.5? Are there any differences between these two methods.
They produce the same result:However  will call the encoder at runtime, instead of at compile time.
A quick test in Python 3 shows that they are indeed equivalent:According to the official python documentation: Bytes literals are always prefixed with 'b' or 'B'; they produce an instance of the bytes type instead of the str type. They may only contain ASCII characters; bytes with a numeric value of 128 or greater must be expressed with escapes.Therefore, as long as all of the characters in the unicode string are ASCII, they will be treated the same. 
Yes and no. Yes, for your specific example, the two are equivalent in that they produce the same result.However, for generic usage, they have some subtle distinctions. For example, consider the different ways they treat attempting to encode non-ascii characters:
