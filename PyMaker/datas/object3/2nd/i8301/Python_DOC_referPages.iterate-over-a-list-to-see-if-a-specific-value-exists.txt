I have an array that I need to check for a specific value. If that value exists within the List, I need to be able to return that to a variable outside of the List. In this case, I'm looking to see if any of the values in the List are 'booked'. If all the values in the List are 'available' then availability should be 'available', but if one or more of the values are 'booked' then availability needs to be 'booked'
You don't need  here; you're working at the module level.You can simply use the built-in  with a ternary operator: checks that all the items in the list are , while the ternary returns a value for assignment depending on the truthiness of the  expression.
