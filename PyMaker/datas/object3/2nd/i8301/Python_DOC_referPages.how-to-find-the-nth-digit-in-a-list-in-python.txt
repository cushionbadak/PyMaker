My problem this time is that I need to find the nth digit in a list previously created. Say my list was:How would I code my program to get a certain (th) value from the list (say the user was asked 'Which number letter would you like from 0-7?' and the user inputted '5', the program would find the 5th component in the list and print that (the program would then print 'The 5th component in the list is e))?
Lists work in an index form. So index[0] of a list is the first item. So to find the nth item in a list, your code would look something like this.Hopefully this helps. This doesn't account for errors that might occur when the user is typing in e.g. if they type in a word.
You can just print the value of the array which points to the value contained in index  If you want to add user interface you can do: 
Arrays index start from 0 so data[0] would be 'a' and data[5] would be 'f'
