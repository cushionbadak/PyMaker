I want to create a function in python that as input takes a list with an unspecified amount of strings whose length is also not standard or the same with each other. The input would be like this:The first element of this list represents all the possible numbers that could be the first digit of a number, the second element the possible numbers that could be the second digit and so on. As output, I want to have a list with all the possible numbers that could be generated this way. Here is an example:Is there an algorithm for this? I am not completely new to python but this problem has me at a loss. Thanks for any help.
itertools.product takes  a number of iterables as parameters, and yields their cartesian product.As your iterables (your strings) are in a list, we use the *input syntax to unpack the elements of the list to separate positional parameters.
