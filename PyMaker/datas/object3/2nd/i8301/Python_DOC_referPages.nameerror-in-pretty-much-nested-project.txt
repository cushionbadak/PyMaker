I'm having serious trouble sorting out scoping error in my project.My project looks something like this:There is this mainfile wich contains the process and creates the gui with tkinterThen I have a "motherOfAllLlibs" where other libs get the functions from.And here is one of many libs which use the methods from moalibs.pyMy problem is, that the execution of interfaceAndProcess.pyw throws an NameError on the line where lib1 calls the function parseSomething(lookForStringX) saying "name 'line' is not defined".Why can't  see the var ?When I put  in the file  everthing is working fine.I'm sorry for this question to be pretty specific but I'm searching and trying for for more than two hours now.Been playing with  inside the methods, been defining  inside interfaceAndProcess.pyw, nothing...Any suggestions?Edit:Ok, I understood that what I have tried can't work as I expected. How would I achieve this without passing the variable as an argument? 
For starters, the  keyword isn't doing anything for a variable already in the top-level namespace (as is  in this case). This Stack Overflow question discusses why.The reason you're getting a NameError is because  imports the namespace of , not vice-versa. You made  global, in , but  doesn't import . To see what I mean, you can ask each module to tell you its current namespace contents by using the  function. You'll find that lib1.py is fully aware of all of moalibs.py's identifiers, but moalibs.py is not aware of lib1.py's identifiers.
