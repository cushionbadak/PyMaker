Newbie to python here. I'm in  need of adding back end and front ends servers to the haproxy.cfg file and do a graceful reload via a python script. Could some of you point me in the right direction. If you include comments in the code it will immensely help me to understand faster. Below is a sample block that I want to send in to the cfg, possibly based on raw_input([arg])Some notes- x.x.x.x signifies an ip and yyyy a port. Please help! Many thanks in advance.
