I am new to python and I am finding it really difficult to understand the whole concept of logging in Python. I am currently working on this web-scraping project using python 3. I have used BeautifulSoup4 to help me:The code I've written below:Do you know how should I start? Where do I begin and what code am I supposed to write in order to create my log file? I am really confused, somebody please helpppppp me!!!!!!!thank you!!
If you're dead-set on building a web scraper yourself okay, but take a look at https://scrapy.org/ which handles almost all the nasty bits of dealing with requests, retries, crawling sites in general, etc.Logging in scrapy is handled by the built in  module in python. https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/logging.htmlIf you do want to build it yourself, instead of using  use the  module directly. Docs at https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html and a handy collection of cookbook examples is at https://docs.python.org/3.6/howto/logging-cookbook.html#logging-cookbook
The cookbook gives you lots of great information. There are many choices, but the minimum is very easy. I've updated your code with a basic log implementation. Run your code then look at  in your current working directory. You can fancify by implementing the examples in the cookbook.
