Natural Text
I have a programs which outputs the data into a CSV file. These files contain 2 delimiters, these are , and "" for text. The text also contains commas.How can I work with these 2 delimiters?My current code gives me list index out of range. If the CSV file is needed I can provide it.Current code:The CSV File im working with: http://www.pastebin.com/bUbDC419It seems to have problems with handling the second line. If i append the rows to a list the first row seems to be ok but the second row seems to take it as whole thing and not seperating the commas anymore. I guess it has something to do with the "enters"
I don't think you should need to define a custom dialect, unless I'm missing something.The official documentation shows you can provide  as a keyword to the  method. The example from the documentation modified for your code: is a list of strings for each item in the row with  quotes removed.The issue with the index out of range suggests that one of the  cannot be accessed.
OK, I think I understand what kind of file you are reading... let's say the content of your CSV file looks like thisHere is the code that will allow you to read it line by line, text in quotes will be taken out as single array element, but it will not split it. The parameter that you need is this quoting=csv.QUOTE_ALLThe printed output will look like thisPS solution is based on the latest official documentation, see here https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html
how about a quick solution like this a quick fix, that would split a row in csv like a,"b,c",d as strings a,b,c,d
