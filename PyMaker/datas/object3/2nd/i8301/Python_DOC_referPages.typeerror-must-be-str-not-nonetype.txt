I'm writing my first "real" project, a web crawler, and I don't know how to fix this error.  Here's my codeHere's the error
As noted by @Shiping, your code is not indented properly ... I corrected it below.Also...  is not returning a string in one of the cases.For purposes of evaluating what was happening, I added several lines of code...between several of your existing lines AND removed the offending line (for the time being).The result of my additions was this (truncated for brevity):NOTE: that the first anchor does NOT have an href attribute and thus  can't return a value, so returns To prevent the error, a possible solution would be to add a conditional OR a try/except expression to your code. I'll demo a conditional expression.
The first "a" link on the wikipedia page isTherefore, link.get("href") will return None, as there is no href.To fix this, check for None first:
Not all anchors ( elements) need to have a  attribute (see https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp):In HTML5, the  tag is always a hyperlink, but if it has no href attribute, it is only a placeholder for a hyperlink.Actually you already got the Exception and Python is great at handling exceptions so why not catch the exception? This style is called "Easier to ask for forgiveness than permission." (EAFP) and is actually encouraged:Also the  and  lines can be omitted. The  instruction is already sufficient here.
