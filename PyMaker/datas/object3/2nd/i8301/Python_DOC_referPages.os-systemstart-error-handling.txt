I am asking for an input for a file name using the os library and when the open button is pressed it will open the file that is typed in, this works but if the user enters a file that doesn't exist it will throw a windows error and the following will be displayed in the shell?Is there a way to handle this without the Windows error? Like using a try and except statement.Thanks
Instead of using , you might want to use the  module.You can call the  to check if the file exists, or you can raise an  as:Or,Take a look at the documentation for the  module here.
Aside from suspending errors from your platform, I will seek a platform independent solution. You can use to check if a directory or a file exists, if it exists you pass the command to  to open the file: I wouldn't recommend using , you're really making the security of your application brittle this way.
