I'm trying to scrape data from an API like this:b is a string object of the xml:However, when I'm using xml the xml etree module to parse this string as an xml object, I'm getting errors like the object is not indexable and the object is not iterable. What exactly is the output of this code?EDIT: The errors are coming up when I'm trying to iterate through the children of d like so:The error here is "TypeError: 'ElementTree' object is not iterable"How can I access the children in this string xml to get specific values from it?
