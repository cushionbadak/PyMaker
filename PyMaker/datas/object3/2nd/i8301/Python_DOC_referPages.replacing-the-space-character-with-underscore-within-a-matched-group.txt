I have a string that looks something like this:I would like to use Python regex to remove spaces in the column names after 'end) AS ' character. The result should become something like thisI am able to match those parts that I am interested using regex in Python [example here] But I would like to know how to elegantly (e.g., one liner or in a Pythonic way) substitute space characters in groups that matches.
You need a  with a lambda expression as the replacement argument:See the Python demoNote that I replaced your  with a more efficient , any zero or more chars other than . Now, the whole regex matches: - Group 1:  - Group 2: any zero or more chars other than Then, with , the contents of the first  capturing group is copied back to the result unchanged, and the second group contents are modified with . Certainly, you may run another regex on it if there may be any whitespace, .
Another solution inspired by @Wiktor.Here we use the lookahead and lookbehind feature of regex to only match the substring we want to alter. The regex will match any sequence of word characters  and spaces preceded by , and followed by . The main difference is that the match will only contain a single group. 
Use the  function.
