In the For loop belowHow may I rewrite this without using range & len or any other inbuilt function? PS: str_data was used as instance variable of type list in init earlier.
If you're allowed to use join() then you could do:This is of course assuming  would result in the same as .To result in exactly the same as your loop it would actually have to be:
New Answer: (no builtin functions)Old Answer :asterisk and double asterisk can be used within list, tuple, set and dictionary, * will unpack list/tuple and ** will unpack dictionary.Another method using join:OutputFor the given question:Since return keyword returns only one argument we can't unpack the list and we have to use function
You mean like this ?
For your consideration.
The previous answer is perfectly fine (if you omit builtins), but here's a closer version to what you did:Please note that I change the way you set your output, as I think in order to get the result you want. Like you asked it does not use any builtin and it works just fine.
You could use highlevel functions likemap applies the function to add a space to each string in  and  adds each of those to the starting string.But of course these are built-in functions, it's just a really clean solution.
