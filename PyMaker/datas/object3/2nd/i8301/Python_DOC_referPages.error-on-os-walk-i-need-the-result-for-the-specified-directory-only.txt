Here is a demo what works for me and what doesn't:
The thing is that  returns a generator. So doing:Might or might not work.First let's consider this:This is essentially the same as assigning the generator returned by  to a name and continuously calling  on that until a  is raised.Now if we go back to the other example:Then the above is the same as doing:If the generator yields 3 or more values then that won't fail. If it however yields less than 3 values then it will fail, since there's less than 3 values to unpack.So if the generator returned by  only yields a single value.Then the above will result in the following error:ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 3, got 1)If it's because you only need the first value, then go ahead and directly call . However be sure to catch any potential .Lastly. Unless it's because you're utilizing  and  as an easy way to get the directories and files at a given path. Then you might not need  and can instead just use  or .
If I understand your question correctly what you want is not  which outputs the list of files/directories in every subdirectory of  but  which lists all entries inside  itself.Example from the docs linked above:
