I was coding a small program, and when I run it I get a None. Here goes an example:After the fourth print I get a None, and this with every print that asks for an input.Here I get another None before the autocaesarchipher() function runs.I've been looking to another code that works well, but I haven't seen the problem yet.Thanks :)
 takes an arguement and prints it out before taking the input.The none is what you are seeing after the  function fires off. In python if your functions don't return anything and is done it returns None by default. For example:outputs:To fix your code just do:
 will print a message for you. Don't pass the actual  function to it.The  function's return value is where the  is coming from.
The  inside your  function is returning . Hope this helps! 
Consider this example:is kind of equivalent to:So if you call  This will perform the action of the inner function, but will also output its return value,  in this caseGenerally, if you place a function call inside another function call you get , if the function does not return anything. For example,  outputs .So does  or . Be careful with that.
