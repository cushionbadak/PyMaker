I am making a currency converter. How do I get python to accept both integer and float?This is how I did it:Simple example of how I did it:These two don't work.
I'm really hoping I'm not completely misunderstanding the question but here I go.It looks like you just want to make sure the value passed in can be operated upon like a float, regardless of whether the input is  or  for example, correct? If that's the case, then just cast the input as a float before operating on it. Here's your modified code:(I made a few changes as well for the sake of neatness, I hope you don't mind <3)
this is how you could check the given string and accept  or  (and also cast to it;  will be an  or a ):but in your case just using float might do the trick (as also string representations of integers can be converted to floats: ):if  is  you got something that could not be converted to a .
Use the isinstance function, which is built inAlso, you should refrain from using reserved keywords for variable names. The keyword  is a reserved keyword in PythonFinally, there is one other error I noticed:Should beLastly, to clean up the if statements you could theoretically use the list (if you have more currencies in the future, this might be better.
 doesn't make sense.   gives us a string.   (and ) is a function.  A string never equals a function. returns a  object.   produces an error, because it isn't a valid integer string format.If the user might give either '12' or '12.23', it is safer to use  to convert it to a number.  The result will be a float.  For many calculations you don't need to worry whether it is a float or integer.  The math is the same.You can convert between int and floats if needed:You can also do  testsBut you probably don't need to do any those.
