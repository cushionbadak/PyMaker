Given a string:and a word:I want to modify s in the following way:In other words, I want to replace any occurrence of  no matter of lowercase or uppercase letters in it, by itself preceded by  and followed by .I already know that my question is pretty similar to this question:Match string in python regardless of upper and lower case differencesThough, it remains slightly different.At the moment my solution is pretty dirty and does not work properly:
It's pretty straight forward even without a regex.edit: using a list comprehension instead of a generator comprehension is faster, soshould be preferred. Read this question and the answer by Raymond Hettinger in particular for the reason.
Use a regular expression:The patter  will match every  that proceeds by a space or the start of the string () and followed by a comma and replaces it with the first captured group surrounded with your expected characters. Note that  in the first group makes it a non-captured group so the  will refer to . Also we are using  flag which is the ignore case flag.If you also want to keep the spaces just use a captured-group for the first group:Also note that if you want to pass multiple regex as the replacing pattern you can compile the first regex using  and pass the other patterns within a loop:As a more flexible way to deal with  you can also pass a function as the replacer, and so more operations on your captured strings. For example if you want to lower case the matched strings:
