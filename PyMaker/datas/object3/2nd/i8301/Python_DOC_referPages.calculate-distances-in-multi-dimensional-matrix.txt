I wrote this code to calculate the distance. But getting error of .In the iterations,  should be:
The value of  is 2, and FOR count since 0, so, ask for the 3rd element in the array, you must do  
sqrt gives that error when you try to use it with a negative number. sqrt(-16) gives that error because the result is a complex number.
As @not_a_robot mentioned in their comment, the exponentiation operator in Python is  not  as it is in (many) other programming languages. You can fix your by simply replacing them.As I mentioned in a comment, it would be better to use  for this as it will give you the same results more quickly and is easier to read (and write):
