In Python, I can see that the keyword  can be effectively used to check for sub-string like: Is there anyway to do the reversed version of , like having a (assuming) keyword  to indicate ? This is for the flow of writing code like:Personally, the (assuming) above code is more readable than using :
In fact, there is a  method that works much like you described:There is also a contains function without the underscores:
You could use  method which Return -1 on failure:Example:
The proposed contain keyword doesn't add any capability to the language.  Perhaps you find it more readable, but the in operator exists in other languages.  Also, note that "contain" is a verb that does not read so well when it's not properly conjugated.Consider applying your reversal principle to other contexts, such as assignment: to be more readable, we should compute the value on the left, and then give the destination on the right.
