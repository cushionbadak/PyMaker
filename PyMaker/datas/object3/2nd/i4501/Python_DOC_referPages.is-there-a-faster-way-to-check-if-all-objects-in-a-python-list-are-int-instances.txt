I'd like to verify that all objects contained in a given list are instances of  (or some other class, or set of classes).For example, I can do this:Is there a faster way than iterating over the list?  Do I need to extend the list class to contain a set of each added class or something?
You can combine all() with isinstance() like this
Let me try again. My initial answer was concise but, alas, WRONG. On the same sort of theme it occurred to me to substitute a construction involving . Correct result. Perhaps this would achieve the required results faster?Accordingly I timed the two approaches:with the following output:Not only is the approach based on  not faster it takes twice as long. Undaunted (or pig headed if you like) I thought that there might be some sort of setup time that explains the performance of 'my' approach. So I tried a much bigger list.with the following results:Once again, the approach using  and  is much slower.(I'm going to try to forget that I wrote this.)Concisely:In Python, a list can contain items of any type.
