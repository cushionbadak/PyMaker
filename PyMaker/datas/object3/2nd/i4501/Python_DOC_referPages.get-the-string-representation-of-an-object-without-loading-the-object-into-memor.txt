Natural Text
Is there a way to get the string representation of an object on disk without loading the object into memory? I thought of calling  on the file object returned from calling  on the object but that returns the class/mode of the file object per documentation. I'd like to return the string representation of  (i.e. ) without actually loading  into memory.Do share another workaround you may have used to accomplish a similar purpose. Thanks.MacOSPython 3.6.4
If you serialize your object as JSON rather than binary .pickle, you can manipulate or filter the text directly without deserializing it.  See How to make a class JSON serializable for some nice examples (particularly the jsonpickle and .toJSON answers).
I wrote an lazy pickle loader many years ago here. You could pickle a  and then just deserialize that first tuple.
