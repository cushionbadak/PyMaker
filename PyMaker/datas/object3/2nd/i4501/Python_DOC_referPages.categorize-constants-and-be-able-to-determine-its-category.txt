I have some constants (they are something like Error codes).The numbers are 'randomly' assign and don't matter (what matter is that it is unique). I then have a dictionary that associates the constant with an error message (see below)As you see, the constants can be put into categories: error, incorrect and warning.Lets say a function  one of the constant. How can I determine the 'category' of the constant just from the unique constant number?My aim is to be able to do something like this:So if the output from function  was 3, then it would print out:
Create a mapping for the category:And use it when creating your error message. You could also mapp each Errorcode to another Constant "CategoryType" in a dict - similar to what you do with your error messages, but I would probably do it inside a function, not a dict-lookup.Advantage for dicts (Dict-Code taken from comment by @BlackJack) using timeit:Output:Result: Dict-Lookup is 3 times as performant .... looking up all codes, once each, 1 million times takes not quite  for dict and  for functional lookup.So if your main task is looking up this string 9 million times as fast as possible, you shave off 2s doing so by using a dictionary ...
