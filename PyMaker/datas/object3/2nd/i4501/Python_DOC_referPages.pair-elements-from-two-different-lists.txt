I have two lists:and I want to pair items in the format any string same number, like so:I´ve tried  but I couldn´t get what I need:Any suggestions how to get ?
You can use  with :Output:Edit: pairing by trailing number:Output:
You can use a list comprehension with a ternary statement for this:However, for clarity and performance, I would consider separating numeric and string data.
You can try dict approach:output:
GivenCodeDetailsA flat, sorted list is grouped by the numbers of each string and yields grouped ults according to the predicate.  Note, if strings start with a single letter, the predicate should work for any digit, , , , etc.  If you are willing, you might also consider a trailing number regex as seen in @Ajax1234's answer.As you discovered,  pads  to shorter sub-groups by default.See Alsothis post for more ideas on padding iterablesthis post on how to use this post on natural sorting for a more robust predicate
