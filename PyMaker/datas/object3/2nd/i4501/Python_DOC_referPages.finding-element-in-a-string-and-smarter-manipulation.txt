Natural Text
I have a list of charactersI have some words.I know that the characters in the list can appear only once or in linear order(or at most on small set can appear in the bigger one).I would like to split my words by putting the elements in a in the middle, an the rest on the left or on the right (and put a "=" if there is nothing) so If a bigger set of characters which contains I know that the combinations can be at most of length 4.So I have divided the possible combinations depending on the length:For each c, starting with the greater For simplicity, let's say I start with c3 in this case and not with length 4. I have to do this with a lot of data.Is there a way to simplify the code ?
You can do something similar using a regular expression: matches the characters 's' or 'a' repeated between 1 and 4 times.To split a given string at this pattern, use . The use of capturing parentheses in the pattern leads to the pattern itself being included in the result.
Use regex ?However, note that this won't handle the case when there is no match on the elements in a
I would do a regular expression to simplify the matching.This doesn't allow the characters in the first or last group, so not all string will match correctly (and throw an exception). You can allow them if you want. Feel free to modify the regular expression to better match what you want it to do.Also you only need to run the  once, not for every string you are trying to match.
