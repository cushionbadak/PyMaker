Natural Text
I'm creating a small python app that formats a file's name to a set of rules. I'm having problems finding a way of applying a list of general formatting functions to the same string. I want to apply one function, then another, then another.I've managed to find a way that works, but I feel that it's very clumsy.Here I have a list of lists that includes one function and a dictionary of the kwargs. (All of these functions have a "text" parameter that is not included in the dictionary).I then pass it into the  function. It loops over the list of functions and applies it to the "text" variable. As you can see, the variable changes every time  is called.Is there a more elegant way of doing this? I, for example, do not like that I have to know that the function is in position [0] and the dictionary is in [1].
Instead of storing  lists, you can use  to create callables with the arguments already baked in:Now your  function can be simplified to this:
