I'm trying to scrape the info from CBSsports.com golf tournament results but using beautiful soup returns only one of four table rows  from the first of two  children of the . Inspecting in google chrome returns:Screenshot of chrome inspectWhile beautiful soup returns:I've tried both the  and the  to make the soup and tried both  and  to open the connection to the site but all result in the same. Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?The final desired output, I would like to be able to pull most of the data from the table and put into a pandas dataframe but I should be able to figure that out once i can access each of the table data points.
On the page you scrape,  doesn't contain any rows until javascript running in your browser renders them. Neither standalone  nor  does that for you. I recommend you this package requests-html created by the author of very popular requests.Now the table contains rows, we can get them with the code below:As you can see we successfully found the rows:There were several rows that you are probably not interested in such as: title, highlight, label and adRow. That's why I used  selector to filter them. It targets all  with ids that starts with  (e.g. id of the first row containing data is ). You can read more about substring matching attribute selectors or about CSS selectors in general here.
If you view source of the page then you will find that table with  does not contain actual rows with player data but are rendered using javascript. or  is used to perform HTTP Requests so javascript rendering is not performed by these (your browser does that for you).To fetch the data you have to use some framework which renders data.You can checkout Splash.Using scrapy with splash is also an option.
