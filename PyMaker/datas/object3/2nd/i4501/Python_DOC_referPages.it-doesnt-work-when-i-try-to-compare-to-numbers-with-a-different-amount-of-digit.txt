I have some code that lets someone input two numbers, which it then assigns to variables. Then later it compares the numbers given. .This works fine until the two numbers have a different amount of digits. and . It will read 111 as 11 and think that 12 is higher. How do I fix this?
You have strings, not ints. The string  comes before  for the same reason "aaa" would come before "ab" in the dictionary if those were words; strings are ordered lexicographically.Make ints with .
I can only guess that this is the solution (including a [mcve] would help):This works because "input()" returns a "str" in python 3.x (that's what I think you're using). Read more about it here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input
