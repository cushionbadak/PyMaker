Natural Text
From the Python documentation:An object of an immutable sequence type cannot change once it is  created. (If the object contains references to other objects, these  other objects may be mutable and may be changed; however, the  collection of objects directly referenced by an immutable object  cannot change.)While the first part of the original quote is understandable, I don't quite get the last sentence. How can I understand the phrase: "directly referenced by an immutable object"?
Probably the best way to explain this will be an example. is a tuple -- an immutable sequence. However, the objects it contains are lists, which are mutable.It's possible to modify the mutable objects in the collection:However, it isn't possible to change which objects exist in , because it's immutable. The first and second elements of  will always refer to the same list, and there's no way to change that.
It means that an immutable  can reference a mutable object, e.g. a , which can be changed, while the tuple itself is unchanged.
