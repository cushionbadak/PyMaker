Natural Text
I am trying to collect file one and file two and output both file one and file two to one text file. However, the return of my code into the text file is limited to the text of file one. How do I output  for both file one and file two? I imagine there must be a way for the computer to read these as independent requests, so that it simply performs one command after the other with file two listed below file one in the text file.
Change both lines with  to  and it should work. The reason is because when you open a file with the  mode it clears the whole thing and then writes to it. With the  mode, it just appends new text to the end. There was also the  that I added because all of the characters are not ASCII.
