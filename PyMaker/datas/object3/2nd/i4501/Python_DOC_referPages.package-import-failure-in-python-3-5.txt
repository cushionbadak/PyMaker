 is a built-in module. Don't name your local packages the same as a built-in module.
While @ErikCederstrand's answer is correct and probably sufficient for you, I was curious as to why it failed so I went digging through cpython's source. So for any future visitors, here's what I found.The function where it's failing is here: https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.4/Lib/importlib/_bootstrap.py#L2207On line 2209, it checks to see if the parent module has been loaded:Since it has loaded the builtin  module, it continues on like normal. After the  returns false, it goes on to assign parent module which again is set to "io":The next lines are what cause the failure, and it's because builtin modules ( anyway) don't have a __path__ instance variable. The exception you see raised here are ultimately what you're seeing when you run it:If you change your module name like Erik says, then step through this whole process, you can see the call to get parent_module.__path__ works like it's supposed to and everything's happy.So, tldr: you've tricked the import system into thinking it's already loaded your custom module, but when it goes to try and use it like a custom module it fails because it's actually the builtin .EDIT: It looks like  is set here after it goes through a normal import process in :
