I want to convert this '2018-03-15T05:13:24.000-0400' datetime format to the epoch time format. While converting I am getting the time format error. Plz help me with this issue.Here is my python Code:Expecting output:Thanks :)
First, your  format has to actually match the string you pass it. Let's break it down:, 4-digit year: , literal hyphen: , 2-digit month: , literal hyphen: , 2-digit day: , ISO-style date/time separator:  (not a space as in your format), 2-digit hour: , literal colon: , 2-digit minute: , literal colon: , 2-digit second: , literal dot: , 3-digit millisecond, which you can parse as a 3-digit microsecond and fix later: , 5-char UTC offset, Next, since for some reason using the  module instead of , and using the  type which doesn't support sub-second times, and then truncating to  anyway, even though you apparently want milliseconds, that  microsecond value is going to end up ignored, so you don't even have to fix it up.So just put this string together, and you're done.
