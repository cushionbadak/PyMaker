I'm having trouble figuring out how to randomly generate strings.I currently work with  before creating a set of s before . Beyond that I am stuck.What I want the code to do is select strings from two lists and then create a new string.For example  and then it would get "bannana flavour" and "milk" and create "bannana flavoured milk".This would pick from a larger pool to generate the string but I'm clueless as to how generate semi-random strings.I don't know if this is achievable but the idea is to generate an item from the options in a list and then place it in another list.If this isn't possible, or isn't possible without a large amount of non user friendly code, I would like to know as, while it is unfavourable, I do have the alternative of using a  and then list out all the possible combinations 
Random has methods to get 1 or more things from a list, with/without duplicates:random.choice(iterable) : draws 1 from listrandom.choices(iterable,k=number) : draws number things from the list, with duplicatesrandom.sample(iterable,k=number) : draws number things from the list, no duplicatesTo get all combinations between two lists you do not need any randomness, you can use a list comprehension to get all possibilities. If you have two lists of dozends of options it is not wise to generate all combinations, just draw one from each list and return that single combination as result - needs less space to store it.Output:
