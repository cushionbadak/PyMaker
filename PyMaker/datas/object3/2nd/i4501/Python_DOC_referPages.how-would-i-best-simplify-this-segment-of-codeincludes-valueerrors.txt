Disclaimer: noob here. I am currently studying Python in college, and code not only at school, but for fun. I am currently writing a planet generating code (which I fully wrote in smallbasic language) and working it into Python language. I am running into a slight problem, due to the inexperience I have with Python, but this may be an easy one for you guys. Please tell me how exactly I can improve this segment of code so it works in the simplest way possible. Also, I want to point out that I want the user to enter a number between 1 and 12 planets to generate. Also, if the user just presses , enters a number outside the 1-12 number range, or enters anything other than a number, I'm wanting the program to just pick a random number. The code below works how I want it too, but it just looks sloppy and overkill...
First of all, I don't think it's working the way you expect it to because  is comparing an  to a  of strings. So that condition will always be  (so your code will always generate a random value).You need to convert  into a  of ints, then use the  operation to check if the  value is part of the . Like this:Second, to avoid repetition, you could place the randomizer code in a method.  Like this:  Lastly, the  for the  is already "simple" enough as it follows the EAFP [1][2] pattern. It will clearly try to convert the input value to an , then you can just easily handle the error if that fails.
