Natural Text
I'm working on a simple CLI script that's not unlike this toy example,Helper Function,  - run tests on  using settings from CSV config file.Function,  - opens file and returns  result. Calls Function,  - takes a directory and runs Execution is naturally like this: Call #3, then #2 & #1 run for as many files in directory.I'm sure it's not a best practice to load CSV config file for each call. It only needs to be loaded once. What's the simplest and most direct way to load configuration settings and make them available to all functions where they are required? Also, using only the standard library.PS.I'm feeling like a total NOOB on this one, but every idea I have just seems too complicated. I'm really just looking for an idiom which I can use when I mock up my idea, before practical requirements necessitate the need for full-function solutions such as  module.
For your example (unless the CSV file is huge) it won't make a difference in performance. However it isn't best practice to load the CSV every time, so use the  module option. it's actually quite versitile There is a good article on it here :) https://hackernoon.com/4-ways-to-manage-the-configuration-in-python-4623049e841b
