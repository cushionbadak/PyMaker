I can create a timezone specific  object like thisResult isIt looks like that  is represented by two values/attributes: A timedelta and a string. But how can I access them?I would like to do something like thisI need this informations to be able to (de)serialize the datetime to and from JSON.I don't want to use third-party packages for such solutions.
 in this case is an instance of the  class:The  class is a subclass of , each instance of which represents a timezone defined by a fixed offset from UTC.You can use the  and  methods to access the delta and name. For  instances the argument each of these take is ignored, but normally you'd pass in the  instance they are attached to:You'd usually call these on the  instance, which has the same methods (but which take no arguments) and these will then handle passing in the right argument to the methods on the contained  attribute. Demo:The  subclass is just one implementation of a  time zone, 3rd-party libraries like pytz offer their own, and the  and  return values may well vary for timezones with historical information attached.
You're asking about datetime.tzinfo, which is an abstract base class, as documented here.datetime comes with an implementation of the tzinfo abstract base class called datetime.timezone, which is documented here.Just below that last link are the docs on timezone.utcoffset and timezone.utcname, which are ways to access the properties you asked about on the tzinfo if it is a timezone. However, this is not the only implementation of that abstract class. If you are using the pytz timezone, for example, then you'll need to read the docs on that instead.
