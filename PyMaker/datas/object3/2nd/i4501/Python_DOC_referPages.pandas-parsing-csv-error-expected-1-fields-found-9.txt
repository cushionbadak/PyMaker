Looks like you need . You can skip all the comments. Ex:
In addition to the above answer, if you got problem only with row 13th, you may skip it . 
I just ran the following code using the csv data you provided and it ran without issues. I ran the following belowWith that being said, there could be a few issues. Firstly, you could set the delimiter to sniffing  to let pandas figure out what the delimiter is. You could also set  So it would look like:There could be an encoding issue. You could try setting encoding to some of these values to see if the error exists https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings
