I recently came across this way of slicing a list in Python. I've never seen this one before, so I would like to understand this clearly. I have a list  and if I slice it using the boolean value  it returns  and if I slice using  it returns , as given belowI would like to know what happens here and what is this method called as? 
The datamodel hook here is the  magic method:The value returned by on obj's  is used when accessing with subscripting, allowing arbitrary objects to be used with slices:This is somewhat independent of the fact that  is a subclass of !  You may achieve the same with any object.Whether  is resolved for  subclasses depends on implementation detail.CPython 3.7.1:PyPy 5.0.1:PyPy behaves correctly according to the Python datamodel.  Looks like CPython is taking a shortcut / performance optimization.
In Python,  class is derived from of Hence  and  will give an output So on a list  returns 2nd element of the list i.e.
