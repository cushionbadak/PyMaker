This question already has an answer here:Does Python support short-circuiting?                    3 answers                python and / or operators return value [duplicate]                    4 answers                So, I was playing with the interpreter, and typed in the following:Initially I thought that it has to do with False and True values, because:But that doesn't seem related, because False is always 0, and it seems from the trials above that it isn't the biggest value that is being outputted.I can't see the pattern here honestly, and couldn't find anything in the documentation (honestly, I didn't really know how to effectively look for it). So, how does work in Python? 
From the Python documentation:The expression  first evaluates ; if  is false, its  value is returned; otherwise,  is evaluated and the resulting value  is returned.Which is exactly what your experiment shows happening. All of your  values are true, so the  value is returned.https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#and
It's for every item in Python, it's not dependent on the integer.1 is True, so it will return 2
