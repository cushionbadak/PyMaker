I hope you're doing great! I would really appreciate if you help me with this problem of mine. I wrote this code that creates dictionary based on user's input, then updates it, sorts by keys and values, finds if the item is in the dictionary, counts the number of unique values and, finally, saves the original dictionary to the .txt file. The code itself works fine, but I wanted to present it as a menu so that user could choose what he/she would want to do next, but when I tried to just call the functions from the menu it didn't work and now I have no idea how to do it properly. Could you explain how I can do that? Thanks in advance!
1) Add a menu function, I only did the first three so that you can get the idea (you can do the rest of them), for example.2) add  as your first statement in 3) at the end of every function add a call to 4) If you set it up correctly then the only call you'll need in  is . You'll be able to delete all of the other function calls since at the end of every function you'll be calling .
