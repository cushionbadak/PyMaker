I am computing the TF-IDF but for IDF part I faced some errors. Would you please guide me? What is the errorTypeError: get expected at least 1 arguments, got 0
As you can see by the traceback, the problem is in the line 4, which isYour  variable is of type , and in documentation we see:get(key[, default])  The method expects you to specify a key to get. Actually, it's hard to suggest any default key because dictionaries don't have ordering.You are trying to get a dictionary with similar keys as  which is the first document, but you don't need to. A common way to add a key  to a python dict would be just :But when you attempt to increase unexisting key, you get a . To avoid this, you should use  to get 0 when there is no key yet.Another option is to catch a  when you trying to increase the key.So, the elegant solution would be to addin the appropriate place and get rid of initialization line (line 4).After I answered your question, I should mention some code style issues:try to switch to , if you use python frequently: ;separate binary operators (e.g. , , ...) by spaces;put a space after comma: ;use  instead of : some people could have thought it's a setYour code will become more readable by python community if you follow that rules. See PEP8 if you are interested in other issues.Cheers! 
When you're using the method get from dictionary, you have to pass some argument( the index , or key value. ).Probably you meant to write without the get maybe? Without the structure of docList dictionary we can't help.
