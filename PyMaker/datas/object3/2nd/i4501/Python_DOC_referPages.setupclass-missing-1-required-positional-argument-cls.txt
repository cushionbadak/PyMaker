I tried to use  method for the first time in my life and wrote:and got: What does it mean and how to satisfy it?
You need to put a  decorator before .The  docs are here and  docs here.What happens is that in suite.py line 163 the  gets called on the class (not an instance) as a simple function (as opposed to a bound method). There is no argument passed silently to , hence the error message. By adding the  decorator, you are saying that when  is called, the first argument is the class  itself.
