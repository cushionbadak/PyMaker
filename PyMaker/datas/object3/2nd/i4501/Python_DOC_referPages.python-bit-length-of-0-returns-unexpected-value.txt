Why does the bit length of 0 return 0 and not 1?2 in binary is 0x10 which represents two bits, doesn't zero in binary still techincally take up 1 bit since its representation in hex is 0x0?
The Python documentation statesMore precisely, if x is nonzero, then x.bit_length() is the unique  positive integer k such that 2**(k-1) <= abs(x) < 2**k. Equivalently,  when abs(x) is small enough to have a correctly rounded logarithm,  then k = 1 + int(log(abs(x), 2)).  If x is zero, then x.bit_length()  returns 0.https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#int.bit_length
Please read documentation on https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.htmlIt is explained.That's how the function works. if you send it 0, it'll output 0If x is zero, then x.bit_length() returns 0.
