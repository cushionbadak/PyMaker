When I do , i get above error and I am unsure where the error is happening. I saw some post regarding this issue but i find mainly in  where the function was passed but in my case I have used  attribute instead of some datetime related function. However, I have used lambda function in the class method as follow. I am not clear on this issue, So i have posted for understanding the cause. Is above code creating that issue? If it is the cause, what should be done instead? I don't know where exactly this issue lies in the models so here is the detail of  in gist because the code is a bit huge . It is not reached to booking models so I am only putting the code of package app and here it ishttps://gist.github.com/SanskarSans/51d2f287309a97163e680cc38abd3e06UPDATEIn my Package models, I have used the custom field and in that field there was the use of lambda instead of callable function and that was creating an issue. Due to the long file of models, I did not paste it here, I apologize for that.Here what I had done
I assume you are using the pickle module for serialization.You cannot pickle the class in which  is defined.  That method sets  to a lambda function, and those are on the list of things that cannot be pickled (see 12.1.4 in https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html).The class method cannot be a problem since it only defines one local variable, , which immediately goes out of scope and gets deleted.  In fact that method, as you presented it here, does nothing at all.
An example replacing the  with a function.Borken version:Working version:
