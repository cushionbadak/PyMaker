I am trying to use elements in a list for class instances.  I'm not sure if I'm using the right terminology since I'm new to python, but here's an example in code:I am trying to use the list to do something like this:This doesn't seem to work because list[0] is a string.  Is there a work around?  Thanks in advance.
In your list you create 3 strings:Then you create an object of the type numbers:This new object is not part of your list. So when you access  you get back the string You need to create the objects before adding them to the list, then create the list.The part you were confusing is the string  and the object reference for  variable are not the same thing. The latter is an object, and it has the letter attribute. The former is just a string.
You really don't want to do what you're asking for. Ned Batchelder has a great explanation of why. I have a not as great one.But if you've read those, and you're convinced you actually do have one of those rare cases where it really is the right thing to do, the way to look up a global variable by name is to use the  function to get the global namespace as a dictionary, then look it up there:Notice that you could do this a lot more easily, and a lot more readably, if you just created and used a dictionary in the first place:And, besides being more readable and more explicit, it's also more powerful, because you can build any dict you want, not just whatever  has. You can even build the dict and the numbers together in one fell swoop:
Like this?And the result is below.
