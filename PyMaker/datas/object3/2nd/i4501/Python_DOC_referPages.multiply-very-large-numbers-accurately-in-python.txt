I am trying to multiply very large floats by very large integers in Python and am noticing small inaccuracies.For example:The answer I am getting is 46374212988031352 but I know the answer should be 46374212988031350. When I change variable "a" to an integer, the multiplication is performed correctly. However, since "a" comes from a division (and might not be a whole number), I can't simply convert it to an integer.
If you use  you can handle larger numbers accurately, at the cost of some efficiency:Output:Some timings:
The reason that  is incorrect is due to how Python and other languages perform floating point math.To circumvent this issue, you can use the  and  modules included in the standard library:
