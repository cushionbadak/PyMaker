I have a program that has multiple methods. I would like to measure how long it takes for each method to run when they are called. For exampleis there an easy way to do it.
I find the following piece of re-usable code handy when testing functions.You can use it to decorate any function and then it will print the original function's name and execution time every time you run it.Something like this:Code output:[I got the idea from here.]
Here's a code timing setup I wrote for myself, I use python 2.7
If you're running code from a separate file,  is the way to go. For example,If you're testing code in the shell, there's an even easier way: the  module. It has two main functions:  and . The former is simply a timer, the latter returns a list of times for different trials. https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html?highlight=timeit#module-timeitJust make sure to pass  as the  argument if you're using imported functions!
