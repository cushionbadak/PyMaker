When I import  in python:The following three debug lines get printed:I know this is rather intended than an error, but I'd like to suppress this output. I have read the file  and figured out that the lines get printed when following line is executed:So I have read  too, which isn't even a big file (102 lines), but I still can't see why the debug lines get printed.I've executed every single line (including docstrings and comments) of the file in the python console and couldn't reproduce it.Can somebody explain this to me? I assume that this is something internal and is only possible because I installed it with pip but actually I have no clue what's going on here.
The output is generated by the  module, which simply uses the standard Python  module.The module adds a logger to output to the console, unless the  environment variable has been set:From that point on, logged messages are printed out to your console.It is not the  module that triggers all this; when importing a module inside a package, Python will always make sure that the package itself is loaded first. Thus  will trigger an import of  itself if not already loaded.It is  that outputs the first log message:but the  object that is also configured (unless  is set in the environment) runs extra code when first used and inserts  before the  message is handled. Finally,  executes  to output the Python version info.
