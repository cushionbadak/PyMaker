I am working in a Ubuntu system. How does os.path.exists() resolve the below path to True.I know its a basic question, but does Python consider './' as escape sequence here.
This isn't a Python issue, you are using a valid path on any POSIX system. is the current directory.  and  are one and the same path. Compare this to , a reference to the parent directory. is seen as a single  separator.So  is the same as  is the same as . In Python or in your shell.If you need to compare paths, you'd want to normalise the path, with :For cross-platform applications, you can use the  variable if you need the correct string for the 'current directory' for the current platform.
