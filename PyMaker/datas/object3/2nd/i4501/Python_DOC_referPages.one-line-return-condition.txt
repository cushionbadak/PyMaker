that's my code:pop2 works fine:pop1 doesn't:What am I missing? Is it about the pop() function or the one-line condition?
If we analyse the following return statement:we see that when the length of the dictionary is less than , the dictionary is just returned. This is not the case here, so we are interested when  is .In this case,  is returned. From the documentation, we see that the  method will:If key is in the dictionary, remove it and return its value...so  will return the value of  which is .This leads to an error when you call  on it since  is an integer.This is made clear by the error:TypeError: object of type 'int' has no len()Why does  work?Well this function does not use a ternary which decides whether the value or the whole dictionary is returned, instead we always return  - the dictionary.This means that  can always be called and it works as expected.
when u do: will return 5 so making your statement  --> 5 is not String , so you will get an error.
