How do you get the very next list within a nested list in python?I have a few lists:The above code is doing what I want, i.e. printing the list instances in  when it contains one of the numbers in . However, I also want it to print the immediate next value in  also.For example the second-to-last value in  contains  (a value thats in ) so I want it to not only print  (as the code does at the moment)but the very next list also (and only the next)Thank is advance for any help here. Please note that  is a verrrrry long list and so I'm looking to make things fairly efficient if possible, although its not crucial in the context of this work. I'm probably missing something very simple but cant find examples of anyone doing this without using specific indexes in very small lists.
You can use Ex:Output:
I would eliminate the loop over  and loop over  instead. Using  in this loop allows us to access the next element by index, in the case that we want to print it:If  is very long, you should consider defining it as a  instead, because sets have faster membership tests than lists:
