Python3: I'm trying to allow a user a given amount of time to enter a response into an input, but after a given amount of time if they haven't entered anything, I want to abort the input and assign a default value to the variable that is storing the input, or otherwise feed default values into the input statement after the given time period.  I've tried this:  from a different stack overflow post, but the problem is that the interpreter still prompts the user for input even after the final line is executed and  is printed, and this won't work for what I'm trying to do (essentially, a command line game that needs to keep going when the player isn't giving it input but update when it does receive input).What is the best way to do this? I know python doesn't really have a timeout function or something like that, but is there any way to achieve this via system commands or a module?
There are several plausible approaches (some of which are probably Unix-specific):Read the input in a  that can be ed after the timeout.  (Many functions, including , accept a  parameter to automate this.)Use  or similar to send your own process a signal (and install a  handler that throws an exception).Have another thread  the descriptor being read after the timeout; this sounds drastic but is generally said to work, so long as you don’t accidentally  a file on the closed descriptor before restoring it with .Read the input with lower-level facilities like non-blocking  and —which will unfortunately disable nice things like .In any case, you have to decide what to do with incomplete but non-empty input entered before the timeout.  The terminal driver will likely transfer it invisibly to the next input prompt by default.
