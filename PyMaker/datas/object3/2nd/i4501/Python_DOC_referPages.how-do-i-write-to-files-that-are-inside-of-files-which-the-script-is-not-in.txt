Natural Text
I need to figure out how to fix this code:It needs to be able to write to the text document "Test.txt" in the folder named "Folder"
First your path should be relative:if you want to write to a file you need  instead of  in the open functionRead:Write:Using  will replace all the current content of the file. If you want to append to the file instead, you should use .
 should be in .That means either  in Windows or  in *nixYou can also use relative paths if the path you want is nearby (shares a directory, etc.)For example: if the script is in  and you want to save in , you can do Also make sure that the folder exists, else, it will cause an error as well.Anyway, as you go further in python, it is recommended that you check out the os module as it can help you a lot with file paths and other things
