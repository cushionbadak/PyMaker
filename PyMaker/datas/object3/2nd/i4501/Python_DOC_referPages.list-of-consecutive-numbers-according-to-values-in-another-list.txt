My target is to get a list of consecutive numbers, repeated accordingly with the initial list values. Lets say I have: And I want to get:...I'm totally new with Python, sorry for this -probably- very first steps question. Tried many searchs but the results didn't match with my needs, unfortunately. Thank you very much in advance.
The newbie-friendly solution is to use two loops:If you prefer one-liners for whatever reason, you can combine  and  to get
IMO, this is a more maintainable functional solution:Note that this is all lazy (on python3) so everything will "happen" only when you actually call .
Here is another way using  and 
You can use :Output:
My solution
Another easy way:
This is possible via , if you wish to remove the need for nested logic.  is part of the standard library.For improving your understanding of Python, I recommend you see @Ajax1234's solution for some nested list comprehensions.Note: you can replace  with  or  if you use . The former may be preferable as it is lazy.
Very simple solution using  and 
You can try this approach:Just for fun I tried with lambda :lambda result is in nested list.
