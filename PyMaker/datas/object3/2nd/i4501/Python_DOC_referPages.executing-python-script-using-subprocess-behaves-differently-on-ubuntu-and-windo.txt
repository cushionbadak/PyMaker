Could you help to check what's going on with subprocess, it performs differently on different machines with same Python version, but one is on Ubuntu docker and one is on Windows.Ubuntu dockerI use subprocess to execute an external Python script with parameter , actually it opens a new process for me without executing the specified script, so I have to remove the parameter  and then everything works as expected.You can see from the screenshot below, I need to  after executing the first subprocess, and ran the second subprocess without .WindowsIn Windows,  works same as I execute subprocess in Ubuntu without  parameter.
Quoting https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#popen-constructor:On POSIX with shell=True, the shell defaults to /bin/sh. If args is a  string, the string specifies the command to execute through the shell.  This means that the string must be formatted exactly as it would be  when typed at the shell prompt. This includes, for example, quoting or  backslash escaping filenames with spaces in them. If args is a  sequence, the first item specifies the command string, and any  additional items will be treated as additional arguments to the shell  itself.(emphasis mine)That means, in your first example with  you are actually only starting an interactive Python session and not passing the script to the interpreter.Further:The only time you need to specify shell=True on Windows is when the  command you wish to execute is built into the shell (e.g. dir or  copy). You do not need shell=True to run a batch file or console-based  executable.Conclusion: Whenever possible, pass the arguments as a list (as you did), but do not use .
