I'm trying to learn how to make GUI with tkinter in Python and I'm getting an error that my callback function is undefined. Basically I want a grid of white squares and when you click on the square it will become red.
There are multiple problems in your code. is an instance method, so it must be referenced as .You're overwriting  in each iteration of your loop, so in the end it references the last button you created. This isn't useful and can be removed.The clean way to solve this is to rewrite the  method to take a button as an argument:And then give each button's  function a reference to the button itself. This can be done with :This makes it so that the button's click event handler receives the button as an argument. With these two changes, everything works as intended.
You need to use .However, that does not solve all the problems. The other problem is that you are creating a 2D grid of buttons but are storing only the last of them in your class.The linestores only one button. You end up storing a handle to the last . The other s that you created in previous steps are lost to your class.Here's my suggestion (not verified):
