I have a list of strings that print out just fine using a normal loop:I thought it should be pretty simple to use a lambda to reduce the loop syntax, and kickstart my learning of lambdas in Python (I'm pretty new to Python).Given that the syntax for  is  I tried:But this does not print anything out (it also does not produce an error). I've done some searching through material online but everything I have found to date is based on Python 2, namely mentioning that with Python 2 this isn't possible but that it should be in Python 3, without explicitly mentioning how so.What am I doing wrong?
In python 3,  returns an iterator:This iterator is lazy, which means that it won't do anything until you iterate over it. Once you do iterate over it, you get the values of your list printed:What this also means is that  isn't the right tool for the job.  creates an iterator, so it should only be used if you're planning to iterate over that iterator. It shouldn't be used for side effects, like printing values. See also When should I use  instead of a for loop.
I wouldn't recommend using  here, as you don't really care about the iterator.  If you want to simplify the basic "for loop", you could instead use :Or if you have a non-string list:
