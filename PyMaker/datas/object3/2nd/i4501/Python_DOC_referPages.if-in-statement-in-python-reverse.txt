How can I check if any of the strings in an array exists in another string?Like:That code doesn't work, it's just to show what I want to achieve.
You can use :Similarly to check if all the strings from the list are found, use  instead of .
 is by far the best approach if all you want is  or , but if you want to know specifically which string/strings match, you can use a couple things.If you want the first match (with  as a default):If you want to get all matches (including duplicates):If you want to get all non-duplicate matches (disregarding order):If you want to get all non-duplicate matches in the right order:
You should be careful if the strings in  or  gets longer. The straightforward solutions take O(S*(A^2)), where  is the length of  and A is the sum of the lenghts of all strings in . For a faster solution, look at Aho-Corasick algorithm for string matching, which runs in linear time O(S+A).
Just to add some diversity with :or if your list is too long - 
You need to iterate on the elements of a.

jbernadas already mentioned the Aho-Corasick-Algorithm in order to reduce complexity.Here is one way to use it in Python:Download aho_corasick.py from herePut it in the same directory as your main Python file and name it Try the alrorithm with the following code:Note that the search is case-sensitive
It depends on the  context suppose if you want to check single literal like(any single word a,e,w,..etc) in is enoughif you want to check any of the character among the original_word:make use of if you want all the input you want in that  original_word,make use of allsimple

I would use this kind of function for speed:

Just some more info on how to get all list elements availlable in String
A surprisingly fast approach is to use :This works if  does not contain any multiple-character values (in which case use  as listed above). If so, it's simpler to specify  as a string: .
