I am trying to write a program to take a string; find and remove vowel in string, change capital letter to small letter and added "." before each letter. Here's the code:When I run this, I get:b.c.bBut the desired result is:.b.c.bWhy isn't  added before the first letter, and how can I fix it?
Instead of removing in place, use a list comprehension to create a new list:Output:Also, changing  from a  to a  improves the overall lookup time.
more simply
will not add "." before each letter, but will result like you are getting. if you want "." in starting also you can add extra "."
If you just neeed to print it, you can add the  on the fly when printing it like this:This will not create a string though as  does not return the printed string. The other answers cover how to get the string already. I would still go for a list comprehension to create the partial list:The  will unpack the list, the  before will add an empty string before it. By declaring a  print will seperate each thing it prints by a Output:
Basically the last line does the trick, it converts input to lower case, check character by character if it's a vowel, finally joins the list to output a string. additional  is added at the beginning of the string.
You can also use regular expressions to do that.Code:I formatted the result using a Python 3.6+ feature called Literal String Interpolation. I encourage you to find out more about it.Output: is a pattern that matches one of the vowels within the square brackets.You can read more about regular expressions here and use this site to test if they match the string.
