I want to set the name of a class to one of the variables within the class so that when I print classes I get their names, I've tried setting  but it did not work.this is my classI create a list of objects then try print theminstead of SNMPData object at 0x.... is it possible to print instead?
Each class has a  and  function which takes a single argument, , representing the object itself. The  function returns the true string representation of the object and the  function is used for  which is used for printing.You can do the same for  if you want to observe this behaviour for printing.
You are looking to define  which should return a printable representation of the object. The official definition of repr(object):Return a string containing a printable representation of an object.  For many types, this function makes an attempt to return a string that  would yield an object with the same value when passed to eval(),  otherwise the representation is a string enclosed in angle brackets  that contains the name of the type of the object together with  additional information often including the name and address of the  object. A class can control what this function returns for its  instances by defining a repr() method.bottom line is that the output from  is meant to be readable by human ** whereas the output from ** is meant to be read by the Python interpreter.  so when you give the string to the interpreter, it should recreate the object. Also If an object doesn't have a  method then  is used instead.
You are able to change a text representation of your custom object by overriding  and  methods:
Define  and .The former is the "official" string representation. The latter is what is returned when you cast the object to a .
