Say I have this Python codeFor  this prints:But I don't understand why it's .The issue is with this line:What is the order of execution? The two options I see are:1:2:But neither gives me the correct result when I try it manually.What am I missing?
None of the two options you shared actually describe the working of:Above code assigns  with the value of . And  with the older value of  (i.e. in  the older value of ). You may consider it as an equivalent of:Example: Dual variable assignment in one line:Equivalent Explicit Logic:
The order of operations in  is that the tuple  is constructed, and then that tuple is assigned to the variables .  In other words, the right side of the assignment is entirely evaluated before the left side.(Actually, starting with Python 2.6, no tuple is actually constructed in cases like this with up to 3 variables - a more efficient series of bytecode operations gets substituted.  But this is, by design, not a change that has any observable differences.)
It's python standard way to swap two variables, Here is a working example to clear your doubt,Python evaluates expressions from left to right. Notice that while    evaluating an assignment, the right-hand side is evaluated before the    left-hand side.http://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#evaluation-orderoutput:For more info , read this tutorial
