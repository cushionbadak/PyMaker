I'm trying just to create a simple line of code but I can not seem to figure out how to print a string and a variable at the same time. If someone could plz help me that would be great.
Three ways:All result in . Personally, I Prefer the  way, and there are lots of options you can use with it. See the docs for more information. For more information on the use of the  formatter, see the section Old String Formatting Operations, but also note that they say it is obsolete, and they recommend the  method.
