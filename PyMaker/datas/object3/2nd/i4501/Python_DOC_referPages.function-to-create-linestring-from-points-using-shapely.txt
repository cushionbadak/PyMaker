I have a list of points:I am trying to write a function that will  check that this list contains point objects and return then a LineString, so far:I am only able to return the else message from createLineGeom(points). Not sure if my problem is with the type() function or my first return statement, I am very much a beginner writing functions.Thanks!Update after J_H answerStill returns no value from
Use  to learn the type of the object.You probably want to use isinstance() when deciding if it's a Point. Better yet, plunge ahead and try to use the argument. If it's not of a suitable type you will get a helpful stacktrace explaining the trouble.
Thanks @J_H for pointing me in the right direction with isinstance(). I am not sure if my solution is the most efficient option, but it works!
