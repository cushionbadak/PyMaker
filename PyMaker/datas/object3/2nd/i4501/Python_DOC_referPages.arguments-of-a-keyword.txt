Say I have a user-defined keyword with some arguments:No in a python context, I have a dictionary of arguments and want to use it to call the keyword:This approach fails because robot expects arguments as a list (either named or ordered correctly). I cannot simply pass all arguments as a list here, because robot will not ignore arguments that are not declared in the keyword.What I need to do is toLookup the keywordIterate over its argumentsCreate the argument list from the dictionaryIs that possible with the python API?
