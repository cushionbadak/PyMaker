Hopefully I can make this somewhat clear. I have to create a server and client in python that sends HTTP GET request to each other. Now I created a basic server/client program and now my goal is to send the server a HTTP GET request(from an html file I have saved) and the server to display the content.Example Server would display something likeDate:Content Length:content Type:As of now when I run the client and type GET / filename.html HTTP/1.1\n\r the server does not display. When I type that exact command in just a Linux shell it displays perfectly. How can I do this in a client and server. Hopefully this makes sense. Here is my client and server.I want to type something like this to my server and display its contentGET / google.com HTTP/1.1\r\n
The error message is so straightforward, just read it to fix the code that doesn't work.Add :And more clear is to use  instead of . You can read about the differences between these two here: Difference between __str__ and __repr__ in Python.
