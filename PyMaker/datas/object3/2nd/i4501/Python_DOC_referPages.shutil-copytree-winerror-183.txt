I am trying to copy an entire directory to a newly created directory. When running this, it does everything correctly and to what I can see actually does copy everything from the source folder. However, it will still return [WinError 183] - Cannot create a file that already exists despite the fact that the file does not exist. Not sure what I'm doing wrong.EDIT: After checking it is copying everything over before the error hits -- every file, every folder, so not sure what is going wrong
Use this, shutil not work.
