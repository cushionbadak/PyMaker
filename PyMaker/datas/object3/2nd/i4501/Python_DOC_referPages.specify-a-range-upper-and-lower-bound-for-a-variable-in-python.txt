Is there a way to specify bounds for a float variable in Python? For example, when I import data, I would like to either check if it within certain range such that . Further, if possible, I would like assign a specific value to such variable if the imported value is outside of these bounds (or even missing). I can perhaps do the first part if the variable was a float. returns 5, while  returns 13.Any ideas on how to do this for a float variable?

A solution could look like this:Output
You can define a class and override its Then while importing your data you can do
