So I have a string which is a function likeand I am trying to run this in another function likebut it gives me the error:Traceback (most recent call last):  File "C:/Users/Admin/Desktop/heh.py", line 11, in   otherfn(code)  File "C:/Users/Admin/Desktop/heh.py", line 9, in otherfn  return y  NameError: name 'y' is not definedit works fine outside the function likeit finds y just fine but not sure why it is bugging out when it is in the function.How can I fix this? Is it something to do with globals() and locals()? Using Python 3.6 btw.
There are several problems with your code. First of all, you have an indentation problem - the  gets 'defined' inside the  function, after the  so it never actually gets the chance to get onto the stack. You need to redefine your  to :But that's just the tip of the iceberg. The greater issue is that  cannot modify the local scope of a function. This is due the fact that Python doesn't use a  for lookup of variables in the local scope so all changes from the  do not get reflected back to the stack to enable lookup. This causes a weird issue where  seemingly changes the  dictionary, but Python still throws a :This is an intended behavior, as explained in the issue4831, and further pontificated in the official docs:Note: The default locals act as described for function  below: modifications to the default locals dictionary should not be attempted. Pass an explicit locals dictionary if you need to see effects of the code on locals after function  returns. But if you have to reflect the changes you can just do a post-exec local scope update:
