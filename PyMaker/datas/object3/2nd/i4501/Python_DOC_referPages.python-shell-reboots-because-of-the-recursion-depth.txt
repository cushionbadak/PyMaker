I attempted to make my own breadth-first sudoku-solving program using recursion in python. For now the code runs up untill the 5th line of the easy sudoku I use as an example. Obviously I tried to enlarge the recursiondepth, but now instead of crashing, the kernel or shell reboots with the larger sys.setrecursion value. Mabye there is a mistake in my code, or python simply doesn't allow this type of recursion. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! P.S.: I realise I could've done things more efficiently and some things are not necessary, but I just want to resolve the recursion problem and then I will smoothen things out. Again: Thank you!Here is the code:
You can use the  module:https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.setrecursionlimitNote:"This should be done with care, because a too-high limit can lead to a crash."
