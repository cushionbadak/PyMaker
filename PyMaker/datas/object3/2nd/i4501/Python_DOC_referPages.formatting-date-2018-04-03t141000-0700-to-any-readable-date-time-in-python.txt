Natural Text
2018-04-03T14:10:00-07:00 is there a built in python method? Or something in Django? I am only used to working with javascript/node and I can't figure this out
I didn't see any specific single function to handle that format, but tweaking the text a little and using a custom format will get you what you need.Hope it helps!
You might want to give Arrow a try.For Django you can use it with django-arrow-field for easier access.
Please try the code below:Output'03-04-2018 14:10:000000'You can pass the specific format you want out of the date.for reference please go to this document:Strftime options
