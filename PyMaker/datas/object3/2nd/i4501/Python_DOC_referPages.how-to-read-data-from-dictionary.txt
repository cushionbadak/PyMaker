I have been making a Python game and need some help. I want to be able to have a user craft a item (I have made this) and some items to take longer. I am not sure how to get the number of seconds to wait from an array.Example Dictionary:Any idea how I could read the number from the dictionary above and input it into a time.sleep() function?
To get a value form a dictionary, you use the format:In your case, the dictionaryName is TimeToCraft and the key is 'missile' or 'otherThing'.You would then put the value retrieved from the dictionary into time.sleep() :
