I am able to run a background function using  with the start method . For some reason, I need this child process to start a new environment when running. So I set the start method to  via  and run the job via  I get the following error:However, I do not use pickle for anything within the function that I am calling. What could I be doing wrong? Is there a general rule of thumb that I should have followed when running processes in  mode?FYI: I am on a machine with Ubuntu 16.04
Is there a general rule of thumb...Yes. You ran into this documented restriction:https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.htmlThere are a few extra restriction which donâ€™t apply to the fork start method.More picklabilityEnsure that all arguments to Process.init() are picklable. Also, if you subclass Process then make sure that instances will be picklable when the Process.start method is called.You are running on ubuntu, so  is probably the right answer. If there is a requirement you need to address which  is incompatible with, then you will want to clearly document the details as the first part of choosing an improved solution.
