Desperately need help. I am a beginner to Python and have tried for days (and nights) to do this with no success. Have large xml file which has elements (ie. accounts) that has subelements (ie. attributes) with variable sub-sub-elements (ie. attributeValue). Since the sub-sub-element is variable I don't know how to get it to drill down as far as it needs to pickup everything and put it into .csv.So per account, there could be many  records.  I want a row with the account id, followed by the attribute name, then attribute value.  One account could have many rows if they have many attributes.Any help you can provide is much appreciated! :) Would like csv to look like this:
I have found xmltodict to be a really simple way to get through xml parsing if xml etree isn't helping.So what your code may look like:You will obviously have to map based on the nesting of your xml and access the 'attrs' you want, but it should be quite straight forward through the dict structure. Hope this helps!
