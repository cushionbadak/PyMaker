I'm creating a Money class, and I'd like to pass the object directly to the string format() function and get the money representation with 2 decimals and the currency symbol.What method should I override to print with the string format function? Overriding str and repr did not work.
You can give your class a  method; in this case just call overridden version:From the linked documentation:Called by the  built-in function, and by extension, evaluation of formatted string literals and the  method, to produce a “formatted” string representation of an object. The  argument is a string that contains a description of the formatting options desired. The interpretation of the  argument is up to the type implementing , however most classes will either delegate formatting to one of the built-in types, or use a similar formatting option syntax.You'll want to drop your  and  implementations now, or at least not add another  on top of the one  now adds (which  will trigger).Demo:
