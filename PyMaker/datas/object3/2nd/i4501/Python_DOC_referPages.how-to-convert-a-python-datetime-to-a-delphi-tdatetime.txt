I need to convert   into the Delphi TDateTime value , on Python versions < 3.2.I triedbut  works only if the python version is 3.2 and above.Delphi  values are expressed as a double floating point value counting days since midnight 1899-12-30.
The Delphi value is the number of days since a specific epoch, 1899-12-30. Construct a  from the value as the  argument and add the epoch to go from Delphi to Python, and to go the other way, produce a delta between the Python datetime and the epoch, and divide the result by a  value (Python 3.2 / Python 2.7 and newer) or just add up the  and  components and divide by the number of seconds in a day for older Python versions:This just uses an adjusted version of the equivalency documented for  to get the exact number of days as a floating point number.Demo:
