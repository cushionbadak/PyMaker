You're trying to use a shell backtick, around a shell pipeline, in that  command. But you're trying to do it without . You can't do that.You can build a  command line and run that with , but that's usually a bad idea.The   docs on Replacing Older Functions with the  Module show how you can do the same things in Python that you were using the shell for. That's a better idea, but a bit of work.But the simplest thing to do is just not call any of this stuff.You don't need the  to find the PID of the process, because you ed the process, so it's just .And you don't need the  either, because you still have that  object around, so you can just call , , or  on it.
