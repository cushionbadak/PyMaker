I made a checkbar in Tkinter with many items but I want the user can only choose the equal or less than a certain number of items. This is my current code:
The checkbar needs attributes for the maximum and current number of buttons checked.  You then need a command that is called each time a checkbutton is clicked.  The command is called without arguments after the variable is changed.If possible, code should be posted without dependency on as external file.  In this case, just pass a list of strings.  (I copied before Aran-Fey's edit.)You should add a label as to the max number that can be checked.Added note: When the Python IntVar is passed as the Checkbutton variable, it is replaced by a _tkinter.Tcl_Obj that does not have the .get and .set methods.  So the command needs a reference to the IntVar instance as chk['variable'].get does not work.
This can be done by disabling all unchecked CheckButtons when the maximum number of CheckButtons is checked. Disabling the CheckButtons improves the user-friendlyness, because it gives the user a visual clue that no more buttons can be checked. If we didn't disable the CheckButtons, the user might be confused why nothing happens when he tries to click a CheckButton.For the implementation of this feature, we have to connect a callback function to each CheckButton. The callback functions counts how many buttons are checked, and disables or enables the other buttons accordingly.The first thing we have to do is to rewrite the  method. The  needs a new parameter how many Checkbuttons can be checked at the same time. We also have to connect the callback function to each CheckButton. I used  to bind the checkbutton's variable to the callback function.Now all that's left is to implement the callback function. It simply needs to count how many checkbuttons are checked, and enable or disable them accordingly:(The  parameter comes from the  we used earlier.)The complete code:
I personally would use a single list of lists.I can assign the  and the corresponding  to a list inside of a list.This will allow me to check each index for the IntVar() status and lock or unlock the checkbuttons accordingly.Take a look at the below code and let me know if you have any questions.
