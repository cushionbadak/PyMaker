I'm currently getting an error from cv2 resize which is indicating that there is nothing in the file. It works fine on windows but I'm struggling to work out what needs to be done (apart from a change in the path name) for it to work on linux.
The problem is the final path you're building:where  is your base directory and  the image filename.
