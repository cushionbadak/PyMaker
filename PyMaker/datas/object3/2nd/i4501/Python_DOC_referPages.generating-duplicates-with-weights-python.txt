This question already has an answer here:A weighted version of random.choice                    20 answers                I have the following list:I need to generate a list of 15000 values in the list above, with frequency of each of them being 10%,20%,30%,40%. Can somebody show me how to do it?
Probably the easiest way is to use  function of numpy.random.Built-in  does the same thing but it is not available <3.6.
You can use random.random(), and assign indexes based on the range of the random number.In the above, I've relied on the order of the elements within your list to generate indexes, such that for 0 to 0.1 it is the first (10%), 0.1 to 0.3 its the second (0.3 - 0.1 will cover 20%), and so on.
