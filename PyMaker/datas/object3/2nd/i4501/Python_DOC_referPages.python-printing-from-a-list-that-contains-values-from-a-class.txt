I'm trying to print out the values of the variable called Deck that is a list of values that use a class:But whenever i try to print: It gives me:
The printed version of your class can be overridden in a custom  method:Result:
When the  function is asked to print an object, that output is text. So, if the object is not itself text,  needs some text representation of that object.You can either do that explicitly – for example, by some explicit function call to get a text string – or implicitly, with the magic methods for text representation.An example of the explicit option:See the Python documentation for text formatting.An example of defining string-representation methods for a class:See the Python documentation for the magic  and  text-representation methods.
Try using a , which has a repr for humans:
