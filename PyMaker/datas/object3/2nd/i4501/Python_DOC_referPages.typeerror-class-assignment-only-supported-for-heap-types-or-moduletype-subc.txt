I'm trying to copy functions from an arbitrary 'base' class into my new object.  However, I'm getting the following error with this sample code. The above gets this error on the call to .The statement works if I type it into the prompt after defining the above.
The problem here is that all objects in python have a  attribute that stores the type of the object:Since calling a class is how you create an instance of that class, they're considered callables and pass the  test:And when your code tries to assign something to the  attribute the TypeError you've observed is thrown:So you need to be more specific about which attributes should be copied.You could filter out attributes with double underscores:Or you could filter out classes:Or you could only allow functions by comparing to :
Your instance object has many attributes that shouldn't be reassigned, and most of them pass the  test:You should restrict most of them. You could simply check for  but I'm not sure what you want to do with  and friends. Perhaps check for underbars after a whitelist?
Turns out that  is callable and that there are many other callables as well. I just want the functions so the following does the job:
