I love receiving a text message every morning from Chase Bank containing the balance of my checking account. I dove into my personal account settings to see if I could schedule a message to be sent to me with the other account balances on my account, only to realize that checking was the only account this was possible with.Using a library called mintapi (https://github.com/mrooney/mintapi), I was able to scrape the account data living in my Mint account. The goal is to send a text message through Twillio with the balance of every single account in my Mint account every single morning.Running the command above in your terminal returns the following object for each financial account I have in Mint:What I would like to do is capture the output from the bash script above, and store it as JSON data in a python variable. Edit: Since asking the question, I have discovered the subprocess library. Now, my return value is: 
Oh! It took me a while before I finally understood the question, whoops.Twilio have API documentation for sending a message and even a Python library with example code. The two links should be enough to help you with this, good luck.EDITTry using  (https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.getoutput)You could then (probably) combine this with ast.literal_eval() as suchThen  would end up being the data you need :)
