I have 5 arrays I want to repeat 600 times and then make into one big arrayI do this for all my arrays A, B, C, D and E. E is shorter then the other arrays. When I try to combine then the error is:This is because Lat3E is a combination of 600 arrays. It looks like this:How do I make this long 600 array into 1 long array to make the error go away?Thanks in advance.
You can concatenate multiple lists of arrays like this: takes a sequence as input, so a list or a tuple will do. If you have multiple lists, you need to convert them to a single list, for example with  (or you could also do , or use , ...) and then pass it to the function.If all the original arrays are the same sizeAnother way of solving the same problem with NumPy only could be this:
Instead of  you can use  function.
