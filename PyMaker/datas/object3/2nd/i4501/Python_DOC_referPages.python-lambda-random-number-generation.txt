I have a string where I want to output random ints of differing size using Python's built-in format function.IE:  "{one_digit}:{two_digit}:{one_digit}"Yields:  "3:27:9"I'm trying:but this always outputs... Which is as expected since the numbers are evaluated before hand.  I'd like them to all be random, though.  I tried using a lambda function but only got this:But that only yields
First off:  is the wrong tool for the job, because it doesn't allow you to generate a different value for each replacement.The correct solution is therefore to implement your own replacement function. We'll replace the  and  format specifiers with something more suitable:  and , respectively.Now we can use regex to substitute all of these markers with random numbers. Regex is handy because  accepts a replacement function, which we can use to generate a new random number every time:
How about this?The first two params(-10** i, 10**i) are low and upper bound meanwhile size=10 is the amount of numbers).Example output: Explanation:It seems you are looking to join random numbers with . This can simply be done using , e.g.  which would return .
What about This?EDIT : meeting requirements.sample:print (b)      31:107:715:76:2602:99021:357311:7593756971:1:
