I am trying to perform some replacements in a file:This question recommends the following procedure:I am not allowed to comment there, but when I run this piece of code I get an error saying:This kind of error I have remedied previously by adding .The problem is that  does not allow for an encoding argument.Question: How to get rid of this error?The above solution, if it would work and provided that the speed is comparable to the following method, would please me most. It seems to be doing inplace replacements as it should be done.I have tried also:which is relatively fast, but very greedy when it comes to memory.For UNIX users, I need something which does the following thing:This turns out to be rather slow.
Generally, with  you can specify the encoding that you want passing a  as  parameter:However, that does not work with . In this case, you can treat the file as a binary and decode/encode the strings by yourself. For reading, this can be done just specifying , which will give you  instead of  lines. For writing it's a bit more complicated, because  always uses , or converts the given input to , so passing bytes will not work as expected. You can, however, write binary data to  directly, and this will work:
