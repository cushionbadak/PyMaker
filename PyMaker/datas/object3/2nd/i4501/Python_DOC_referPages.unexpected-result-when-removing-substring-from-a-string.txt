I tried:Why did the  get removed from ?Similarly, I had another issue:Why does python insist on removing 's from my strings? How I can properly remove  from my strings?
If you read the docs for  you will see that:The chars argument is a string specifying the set of characters to be removed.So all the characters in  () are stripped just from the beginning and end.What you want is  to replace all occurrences of  with nothing:
From Python documentation:https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#string.stripCurrently, it tries to strip all the characters which you mentioned ('.', 'm', 'a', 'i'...)You can use string.replace instead.
You are using the wrong function.  removes characters from the beginning and end of the string. By default spaces, but you can give a list of characters to remove.You should use instead:Or:
The argument to the strip function, in this case,  is not a string, it's a set of individual characters.That's removing all leading and trailing characters that are in that list.We'd get the same result if we passed in the argument  .
