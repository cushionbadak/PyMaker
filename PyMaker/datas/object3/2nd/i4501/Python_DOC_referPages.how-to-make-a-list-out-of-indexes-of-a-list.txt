I started a project where I turn a string into a list, and in the list I turn each index into another list. However, I ran into a problem. My code is below:When I try to turn each index of the  into another list, it doesn't work. What I want is for the output of the final print of  to look like this: Is there a way I can do this similar to my original method? Also, why does my original method not do what I want it to do? Thank you in advance.
Is there a way I can do this similar to my original method?Yes; two ways about this would be to use  or a list comprehension.Also, why does my original method not do what I want it to do?The problem lines are here:As you can read more about in this question, assinging to  within the loop does not affect the elements of  themselves.  To be specific,  creates a new variable  at each turn of the loop, the last of which will still exist after the loop terminates.  In short, it is good practice to avoid trying to modify the container () over which you're looping.
