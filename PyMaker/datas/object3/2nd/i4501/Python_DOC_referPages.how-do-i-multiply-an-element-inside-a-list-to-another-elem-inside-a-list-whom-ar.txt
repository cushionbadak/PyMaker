What do I do after this? I want to multiply the elem in a if it's the same as the elem in b then check if the answer is in answer.
There's a fantastic function in python called  that's a bit easier to understand then a list comprehension.What  does is allow you to iterate over all three lists at the same time, take a look at the following example:Notes:This assumes that   and  are all the same lengthIt doesn't check that  is anywhere in , only that it's at the exact same index as the  &  multiplied.
Try using "zip" like this:Then you can compare that result list against the answer list you provided. A good way would be to do a truthy comparison like so, again using zip:if you merely want to check if each answer exists anywhere in the answer list, use "in" instead:
One way to achieve what you are looking for is:This approach does not consider the order or the index of the elements.If you also need to consider the position of the elements in  and  and intend to only compare elements with the same index then you can use:Using the generator expression you can compare the elements in  with the elements in . Since they have to be equal you can use  to get the result of their multiplication. The results can be filtered using the python  which returns only elements which are in the  array.
I would keep it simple and use something like this:Output would be:
If you are happy using a 3rd party library,  is convenient for this task.Relevant: Why NumPy instead of Python lists?
Given:Another approach is using :Or, instead of list comprehension for element-wise equality testing, using :Or, simply falling back on the  operator for a numpy array and a same-sized list (-> element-wise comparison):
