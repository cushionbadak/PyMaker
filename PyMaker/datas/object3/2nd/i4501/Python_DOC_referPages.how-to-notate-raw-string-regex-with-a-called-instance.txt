I know how Python use "r" as the raw string notation in regular expression:What exactly is a “raw string regex” and how can you use it?re - Regular expression operationsHowever, I'd like to apply that in a while loop like:The problem is that  can contain literal "(" and that's where  blows up with error: missing ), unterminated subpattern at position 2.Apparently I can do neither  nor . I've tried  but it gives me the same error too. What options do I have now?
Raw strings aren't a different data type - they are just an alternative way to write certain strings, making it less complex to express literal string values in your program code. Since regular expressions often contain backslashes, raw strings are frequently used as it avoids the need to write  for each backslash.If you want to match arbitrary text fragments then you probably shouldn't be using regular expressions at all. I'd take a look at the  string method, since that just does a character-for-character comparison and is therefore much faster. And there's also the equivalent of , should you need it, using the  keyword.You might be interested in this article by a regular expression devotee. Regular expressions are indeed great, but they shouldn't be the first tool you reach for in string matching problems.If it became necessary for some reason to use regexen than you 'd be interested in the  method,, which will quote special characters so they are interpreted as standard characters rather than having their standard regex meaning.
