Let's say I have a list like this:The first number is the user_id, the second is the tv_program_code, and the third is the season_id. My questionHow can I find out the program_code with more than 1 season subscribed, and then print the user_id and the tv_program_code?  For example:Or do you have any suggestion of which data structure I should apply?
One method is to use .The idea is to count the number of series per (user, program) combination using a dictionary.Then filter for count greater than 1 via a dictionary comprehension.Note on Counter versus defaultdict(int) is twice as slow as , see benchmarking below. You can switch easily to  if performance matters and none of these features are relevant to you:Missing  keys don't get added automatically when querying.You can add / subtract  objects. offers additional methods, e.g. , .Benchmarking on Python 3.6.2.
There are many ways to do this task first using detaultdict :output:Second using itertools groupby :output:Third approachAt last you can also try manual approach instead of using any import :output:
