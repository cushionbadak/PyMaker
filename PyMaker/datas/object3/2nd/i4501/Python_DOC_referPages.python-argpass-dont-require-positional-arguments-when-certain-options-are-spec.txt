Positional parameters with  or  are required, meaning that  gives an error if the parameter is not specified at least once. However, no error is given if the user calls the program with the  option, regardless of whether the positional parameters were specified.How can I implement custom options like  that do not require positional parameters to be set, while still requiring positional parameters for all other options?For example, if let's say my program has the following (or similar) usage text:How can I implement the following behaviour:calling  with no options and no positionals is an errorcalling  with  and no positionals is an errorcalling  with only positionals is allowedcalling  with  or  is allowed regardless of whatever else is specifiedMy codeThis meets all requirements except the last one, namely  still requires the positional parameter to be specified.Does  have a built-in way to say that  is not required iff  is specified, or must this behaviour be implemented manually?
Manual methodsSet  or  for the positional parameter (i.e. make it optional), and then add the following lines immediately after :Or add these lines, courtesy of this answer:This simply prints the help message if no options or positional parameters were specified. This behaviour is consistent with many command line programs, e.g. .Of course, making  optional will affect the usage message:If you really don't want this to happen you can override the usage method like this:
