You can use  for this problem. is only useful for incrementing integer counters, and even then only with hashable objects. This isn't what you are looking to do here.As an aside, this also presents a more direct solution to your first problem:
That cannot be done with a Counter, for multiple reasons:Integers are hashable, dicts are not.  only works with hashable values.All the grouped integers are the same, but the dicts are not. Only the "value" key of the dicts you're grouping is the same. Even if  worked with dicts, it would only keep 1 dict per group and discard the rest.The solution here is to use a  instead of a :
