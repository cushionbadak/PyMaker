I know this question has been asked a lot on here. When I run this code I get the above error: I tried coding the file(maybe not correctly though). I also tried rewriting my code in multiple ways but none of the solutions that I found helped. And I did try writing out the path to random_walk.py but that oddly didn't help.  matplotlib is installed in Python 3.5 and 2.7. I am using Raspbian on a Rasp Pi 3 and the IDE is Geany. I should mention that this file and random_walk.py are in the same folder. (I've also tried the code without the * at from random_walk import and used the class name from the file and still got the same error)
A python package should contain an  file, so you can import things around. Something like:Refer to:https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages
