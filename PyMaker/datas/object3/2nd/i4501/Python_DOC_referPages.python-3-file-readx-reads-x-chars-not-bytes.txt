Natural Text
According to documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html?highlight=io#io.RawIOBase.read),  should return me up to x bytes from file. When I call  on a UTF-8 text file, however, it returns me unicode symbols (including those which occupy 2-4 bytes).In Python 2.7, however, everything seems to be ok.So the question is - is that a bug, or do i miss something here?
This should work
