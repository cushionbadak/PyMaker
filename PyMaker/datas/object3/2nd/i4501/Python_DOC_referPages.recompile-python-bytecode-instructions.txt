Suppose I have a  function:I can disassemble it as one usually does, with :But I want to destruct the code object associated with the  function into a sequence of instructions, and then compile these back.With the help of , I can get a sequence of s that represents the code object:Is there a straightforward way to compile these  objects into the original code object?For instance, I'm looking for a  function that would take a sequence of instructions and output an utable code object:
The sequence of  objects from  is not enough to reconstruct a code object. A code object isn't just a sequence of instructions; it includes plenty of other data, like the argument count, the size of the evaluation stack, flags indicating various properties, etc. Most of these things are (briefly) described in a table in the  module docs, but there's even some "scratch space" not accessible through ordinary means. objects would be enough to recover a lot of a code object's information, but not all. With some dangerous assumptions, you might be able to get something that usually works, but it'd be better to keep more of the information from the original code object in the first place.In any case, there's no straightforward way.
