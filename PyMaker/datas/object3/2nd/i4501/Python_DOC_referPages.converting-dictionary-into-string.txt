Read your dictionary as key/value pairs () and then just format them in a string you like:The order, tho, cannot be guaranteed for a , use  if order is important.
One way is to iterate via  and use multiple  calls.If you need items ordered by key, use .
This joins all the keys into a large string containing replacement fields that we then format passing the dict values as args. There wasn't a trailing replacement field so we concatenate the last value in the dictionary to our large string.
