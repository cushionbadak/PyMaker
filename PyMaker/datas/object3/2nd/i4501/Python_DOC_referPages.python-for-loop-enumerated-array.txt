why does it not print anything? I put the print hello part to see if it iterates through the second for loop.
 is an iterator. Iterators can only be used once; after that, they're empty.The easy (and idiomatic) solution is to just make a new  iterator for each loop:If you need to use an iterator more than once, you can save it to a list, and then reuse the list. Just change this line… to this:In this case, there's no reason to do that. You'd just be wasting memory building the list. (As for speed, it's probably a little faster for very small lists, but slower for very big ones—but it probably doesn't matter either way for your code.) But there are cases where it's useful, so it's worth knowing how to do.
