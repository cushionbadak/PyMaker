The function  doesn't work here as I need to provide  and  as separate parameters. The reason why I want to do is that I am accessing images through their paths and doing some stuff on them and when saving them I need to create another directory (in this case ) and the next directories after that (in this case ) should remain the same ( together with the name of corresponding image). Note that images may have different names and extensionsIf something is not clear by my side please ask, I will try to clear up
