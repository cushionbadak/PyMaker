This question already has an answer here:Python: zip-like function that pads to longest length?                    4 answers                I have two lists:And I want to iterate over them. What I want to obtain is something similar to this:I have thought of using the  function but it doesn't seem to work with different length lists as by using the following code:I get this: So the number 7 is missing. I wonder how could I adapt the code or ifthere is any other option I am missing to iterate in parallel when the lists are of different lengths?
