I, like many python programmers find the command line arguments for python described here very useful. specifically "-i" which keeps the python interpreter running after a program finishes for a stack trace.  How can I use these with an exe file compiled with py2exe?  Not to be confused with regular argument parsing in an exe file. If you came looking for that, find it here.My first thought was to try:but that didn't work.it should be noted that does in fact work for me.what I am looking for is the .exe equivalent of Failing to find an implementation that works for all of the python command line options, what could I do just to make the "-i" argument work?  it is the most important to have as an option in my executable.
I did not find anything on the py2exe wiki about passing arguments like  (to enter interactive mode after execution).One might be able to discover information about the argument handling in the py2exe source files.Update: It indeed looks like py2exe does not handle any command line options like the normal interpreter does, instead it just passes them to the script. But it does handle the respective environment variable, which can be used as shown below.However, as a workaround, you could try to set the  Environment variable:If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying the -i option.E.g. run  before running the program.But, probably even better, this can be done from within the Python script:This variable can also be modified by Python code using os.environ to force inspect mode on program termination.Here's a little test script for os.environ (also os.putenv):The behaviour is a little weird: there does not seem to be a difference, and it seems to only last until you exit the interactive mode:The contents of  are:But it seems to work either way (double check the documentation for yourself to ensure you are not corrupting your environment variables), so you could even implement an  argument for yourself like:which runs as followsTrying with py2exe and Python 3.4.3 (newer versions are apparently not supported and you get an IndexError):setup.py:Get py2exeRun py2exe    Test Does not seem to have changed the environment variables permanently:Also works with single exe:
