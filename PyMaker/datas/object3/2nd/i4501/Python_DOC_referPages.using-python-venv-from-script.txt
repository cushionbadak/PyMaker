After creating the virtual environment, If you have a shell script which calls:How does it know where the virtualenv's site-packages folder is without source activating into the virtualenv (thus changing the path)?
This magic happens with .  Note: If a virtual environment is in effect, this value will be changed in  to point to the virtual environment. The value for the Python installation will still be available, via .The  module is imported (from system path!) at interpreter startup, and the site-packages dirs are appended to  with the .  You can verify this for yourself by executing the python REPL with the  flag to disable importing the site module.  You'll find that packages installed in the virtualenv are no longer visible by import statements (assuming they aren't already installed in system site-packages).Your next question is probably "But how does site itself know if we're in a venv or not?" and the answer is heuristic:A virtual environment is a directory tree which contains Python executable files and other files which indicate that it is a virtual environment.If a file named "pyvenv.cfg" exists one directory above , and  are set to that directory.  Implemented here.
Python looks through the values in  for site-packages and these values are automatically set when you execute  or  by the  package.  Which, is imported during initialization (unless suppressed via the  flag) You can refer to the  package documentation for more details about how exactly this is done.
