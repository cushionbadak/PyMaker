I have been doing a school project recently which which is about a school maths quiz. I successfully done two of the three tasks of my project. However the third task is seeming quite difficult.I'm currently trying to store the last three scores of that student. However I can't quite get it to work. I did have a look at this thread: Displaying only the highest of a person's 3 most recent scores, saved in a .txt file. However I am having an error in my code for the for:Which gives me an error saying that it's not readable. So unfortunately I couldn't get that code to work.So what I'm trying to do is score the last three scores of the student. Then if there is more then 3, then I want to delete the least recent score.This is my code:Sorry for the inefficient method, but it's just the way I like to think. And thanks for your time.So I took that from the link mentioned above. My aim is to try and only get three scores, and not above 3.
Implement a queue - https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.dequeNow user scores is a dict with key as name, and values as a deque object with just 3 scores. You need to iterate through them, cast the queue to list and join the elements to write them to file. 
As you seem to know, there are different modes you can (2/3) a file in. If you use  or , you can't read from the file. You can add a , to allow reading, too, though:Also, I'm not sure what version of Python you're using, but  is a built-in type and function in Python 2, so you shouldn't use it as a variable name if that's the version you're using.
