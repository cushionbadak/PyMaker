I have the following code:What I want is for each of the IFs to start with a clear self.deployJobs but I can't seem to figure out the logic.
the problem is it's clearing after each part of the  loopAn  statement is not a loop.  The indented code blocks within it (technically, "suites" within it) are not executed sequentially.  Zero or one of those suites will be executed per iteration of the loop, never more than one.I want the list to contain everything in the , then when it moves to the  to be empty againOnce an  or  condition is determined to be true, the suite following that  or  is executed, and then the entire -- structure is done.  Execution of the  suite will never "move to the ".The Python Language Reference describes the behavior of  statements clearly.What I want is for each of the s to start with a clear Assuming you mean each you want each of the  statements suites to start with a clear , then you should put your  line immediately before your  statement... which you've already done.So I'm afraid on this point I have to join the numerous other posters who can't figure out what you want this code to do.  I can suggest, however, that ending suites with  is probably not helping you at all.
