This question already has an answer here:Get request body as string in Django                    2 answers                For some reason I cannot figure out why Django isn't handling my  content correctly.It is being sent in  format, and looking at the  tab in Dev Tools shows this as the request payload:which is exactly how I want it to be sent to my API.In Django I have a view that accepts this request as a parameter and just for my testing purposes, should print  to the console. Of course, nothing is being printed out, but when I print  I get this:so I know that I do have a body being sent.I've tried using  to no avail either. Printing  after setting that variable also returns nothing.
In Python 3.0 to Python 3.5.x,  will only accept a unicode string, so you must decode  (which is a byte string) before passing it to .In Python 3.6,  accepts bytes or bytearrays. Therefore you shouldn't need to decode  (assuming it's encoded in UTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32).
