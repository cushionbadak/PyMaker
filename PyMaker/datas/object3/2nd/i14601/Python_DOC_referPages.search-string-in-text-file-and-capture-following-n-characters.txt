Natural Text
I'm using  and  to write the output of a  from Backendless (BaaS).What's written to the output file is a long single line of data, separated by commas. Here's a small portion of it.The value I need from this output file is the 37-character string following "objectID":". I've read many similar questions but haven't been able to find a solution to this specific one. I've tried something like:which returns nothing. Please correct me if I'm using  incorrectly. I'm very new to this. Also, is there a way to achieve the same result without saving it to the text file first and instead performing the  with  and ?I'm using Python 3.4. Thank you.EDIT/SOLUTION:
Your data looks pretty much like JSON, so maybe you can use Python's  module:If you want to stay on the text level, the right tool for this job are regular expressions. Look into Python's  module.
