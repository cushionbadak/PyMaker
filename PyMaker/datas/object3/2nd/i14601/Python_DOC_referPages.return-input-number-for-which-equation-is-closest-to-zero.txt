I'm trying to input a range of values to an equation, and then return the input value for which the equation is closest to zero.  Currently I have:Of course, this function will always print a number pretty close to , but simply prints the last value in the loop.I am really struggling to find a way to to return the  value that results in the lowest value of .  I feel like I am pretty close but am missing some key knowledge of loops. 
First: just have your function to calculate your value for you, given the input -Second: you can use a list comprehension (technically a generator expression, here) to generate your values, and pass that to the builtin  function -
You could just add another variable that keeps track of the associated best input:EDIT:This doesn't check decimal numbers, range returns a list of integers. You could do something like this:Check a graph of your function, the minimum values are near 0 or 15.
Instead of starting with a huge  value, you could store the first  value during the first iteration of the loop. Then use that  to compare for the following iterations:
