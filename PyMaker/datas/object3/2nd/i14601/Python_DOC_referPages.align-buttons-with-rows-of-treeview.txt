I'm trying to make a interface like this:I want to stick to using tkinter.One of my ideas is to use a Treeview for the left table. But I struggle to make the buttons on the right side to align with the rows of the table.I tried to put an empty frame on top of the buttons, but can't seem to make it work.Here's my code:One idea I had would be to get the size of the button and make the height of the rows in the table match the size of the button, but I could not find how to get that information from the buttons.Another attempt I made was kind of a table with just frames and buttons. But the buttons always used a bit more vertical space than the frames and I could not keep them aligned.How do I keep the buttons aligned with rows of the treeview?
This gets them all in line:Gives:The item height is found by . However, the buttons will not move when scrolled, and the header height is guessed. A more bulletproof solution would be to use , but that will means that you will not have buttons, but clickable list items.
