I have a list L and want to return a list of n items from it, at random.Right now I am relying on itertools.combinations and then picking one at random, but I have to wait a while until the list looks like something that isn't stuck with a lot of items near the start of the list, so it's not really "random."
use random.sample to sample K items from a list of population n.
Sample output[6, 4, 3, 2, 5]
