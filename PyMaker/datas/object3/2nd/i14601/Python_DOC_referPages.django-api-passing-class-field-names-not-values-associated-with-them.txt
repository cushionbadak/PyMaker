So I'm making an API in a Django app and I have a class NodeID that follows the pattern:A simplified version of what I return in my view function is this:When I view the result of my API in a browser, it shows the value of 'eigenvector' to be NodeID.EIGENVECTOR as opposed to the integer 0.This makes it such that my front end can't handle it (it has no idea what NodeID is, obviously). How can I make it so that the call receives the value of NodeID.EIGENVECTOR instead of the variable?
This has to do with Python's implementation of , which uses a custom metaclass that modifies access to its class properties:https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#functional-apiAccessing only the value works like this:So returning it from your simplified example would be like:Update: if using Python 3.4 and targeting an output as , Python's own  natively expands the values into the serialized representation.
