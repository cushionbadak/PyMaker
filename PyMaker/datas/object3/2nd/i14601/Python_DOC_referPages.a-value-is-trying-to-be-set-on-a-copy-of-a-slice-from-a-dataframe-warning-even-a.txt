I am getting a warning "Although as suggested in document I am using df.loc  ?
The common reason for the warning message "A value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame": A slice over another slice!For example:"""For the above codes, you may get such a message since dfC is a slice of dfA while dfA is a slice of dfB. Aka, dfC is a slice over another slice dfA and both are linked to dfB. Under such situation, it does not work whether you use .copy() or deepcopy or other similar ways:-("""Solution:Hopefully the above explanation helps:-)
I ran into this problem earlier today, this problem is related to the way Python passes 'object references' around between functions/assigning variables etc. Unlike in say, R, in python assigning an existing dataframe to a new variable doesn't make a copy, so any operations on the 'new' dataframe is still a reference to the original underlying data.The way to get around this is to make a deep copy (see docs) whenever you're trying to return a copy of something. See:Here's a bit more on this topic that might explain the way Python does it better.
