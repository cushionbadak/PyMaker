Natural Text
For example, in the middle of screen instead of beginning? Sample output would be like:
Python 3 offers , and you can use  to center using spaces:If you’re not using Python 3, use  instead.As @br1ckb0t mentions, this isn’t available conveniently in Python 2. Rather than using a less convenient way, though, I’d suggest switching to Python 3 instead.
If this is a terminal window, do exactly what you did. If you want consistency, you can try use tab tokens () to keep everything in line. Otherwise, follow Hurkyl's answer about using the  module.
The same way you did it by hand: add extra spaces.If you mean to actually know something about the geometry of the display, you'll have to appeal to a library for such things. e.g. the  module.The curses module provides an interface to the curses library, the de-facto standard for portable advanced terminal handling.
See @minitech's answer for a good way to do this on Python 3, but on Python 2, this can be done with  (at least on OS X):
This way you can print leading spaces:
You could use  to put text in the middle. For example: 
I'd create a helper function:
A version of get_termial_size that should work for python2, tested but not  extensively on ubuntu:
