When I run the program I get everything up to  outputted as it should be, but the .mafft that should be created by  is coming back empty. Edit: I forgot to ask the actual question. What am I doing wrong here? Is it some syntax I am unaware of?
It has nothing to do with using  instead of .The problem is that you are not closing the  file before running the program.  Move the closes to before the  call:The input file to  () is empty because the buffers have not been flushed, you are "suffering from buffering".I would consider what everyone has said about using , but after you get this working!  Only change one thing at a time!
