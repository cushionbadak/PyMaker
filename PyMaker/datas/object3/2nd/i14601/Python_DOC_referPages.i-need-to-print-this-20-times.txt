So basically I have my code here which prints a random Shakespearean insult through 3 lists. To submit this code, I have to print 20 insults and I know there is a faster way than writing the final print statement 20 times. This is probably remedial but I can't remember how to do it. Here's my code thanks guys:


Simple while looptho' it'll print 20 different lines!
