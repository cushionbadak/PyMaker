I am trying to apply  to save data onto disk. But when calling , I got an errorIs this a hard limitation to use ? ( for python2)
Not anymore in Python 3.4 which has PEP 3154 and Pickle 4.0https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3154/But you need to say you want to use version 4 of the protocol:https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html
Yes, this is a hard-coded limit; from  function:The protocol uses 4 bytes to write the size of the object to disk, which means you can only track sizes of up to 232 == 4GB.If you can break up the  object into multiple objects, each smaller than 4GB, you can still save the data to a pickle, of course.
There is a great answers above for why pickle doesn't work.But it still doesn't work for Python 2.7, which is a problemif you are are still at Python 2.7 and want to support largefiles, especially NumPy (NumPy arrays over 4G fail).You can use OC serialization, which has been updated to work for data over4Gig.   There is a Python C Extension module available from:http://www.picklingtools.com/DownloadsTake a look at the Documentation:http://www.picklingtools.com/html/faq.html#python-c-extension-modules-new-as-of-picklingtools-1-6-0-and-1-3-3But, here's a quick summary:  there's ocdumps and ocloads, very much likepickle's dumps and loads::The OC Serialization is 1.5-2x faster and also works with C++ (if you are mixing langauges).  It works with all built-in types, but not classes(partly because it is cross-language and it's hard to build C++ classesfrom Python).
