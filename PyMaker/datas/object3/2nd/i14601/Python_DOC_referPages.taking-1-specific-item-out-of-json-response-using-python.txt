I am trying to get "id" number and use it in program afterwards. Response is .json if that mattersThis is part of response where "id" is. And this is what i have so far:Id changes every time.I have made part that makes id and that uses id, i need to connect those two without typing it manually.Sadly i'm not programmer so i'm looking for complete solution if possible. I've done some research but could not figure it out. Update 1As suggested in Gord's answer I use and now I get the errorUpdate 2 I've removed the error by But it shows my player id instead of a job id. Update 3print(response.getheaders()) as per request
Consider a simplified example where your line of codehas retrieved the response from the server and saved it as an HTTPResponse object, and when you  the response you see a JSON string like thisYou can use Python's built-in JSON decoder to convert that into a Dictionary object named Now you can extract the  value by referring to the Dictionary entry whose key is 'id'If you run the same code tomorrow and the  object that is returned containsthen the same set of steps will extract the new value for UpdateIf your actual JSON data contains nested elements then you may need to use several "key" values to identify the item you want. For example if the "id" you want to retrieve is actuallyi.e., the JSON looks likethen you will need to use
If I understand you correctly, you have a JSON response and you want to extract the value of a field named "id". From your question it appears that you are unfamiliar with JSON syntax. Please consult W3schools' JSON syntax manual and/or the documentation for Python's JSON library if this is the case.The above code prints the value of the field "id" in the object "msg".
