I have a pretty standard Django test case setup (I think)manage.pywsgi.pytest_stuff.pyHere's what happens when I execute tests:Is this (tests run from the project's root directory, but not from elsewhere) expected behavior? Is there a way to change things so that it will work (I want to execute my tests from a pre-commit hook in a different directory)?I tried adding  from this answer, but it didn't help. I also tried moving the  line from wsgi.py to manage.py, but that didn't help either.Any other ideas out there I can try?
Late in answering this question. But hope this helps someone:From Django documentation:You can also provide a path to a directory to discover tests below that directory:References:https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/testing/overview/#running-testshttps://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#test-discovery
Based on the comments from @dizballanze and feedback from review of the code, I wound up doing this:I'm still curious as to whether it's possible to run the tests without cding into the root directory of the project, though.
