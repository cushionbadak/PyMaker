This question already has an answer here:Python regex string matching?                    2 answers                I am trying to check if my string contains some regular expression.The strange thing is is, that while  would find the regex and will replace it,  does not return any results...Here is my usage:re.match(): - trying to match the pattern  - nothing is returnedre.sub(): - Successfully replacing the same pattern  by " hello"How can I match the pattern  without substituting it?
