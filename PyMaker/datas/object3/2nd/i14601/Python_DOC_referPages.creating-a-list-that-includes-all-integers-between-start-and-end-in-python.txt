If I have two integer (start, end), for example, then I want to create a list that includes all integers from 3 to 8 (also includes 3 and 8)How can I get that?
Python 3: use  as the generator, and  to complete:For Python 2, take note of range vs xrange and that you'd need a call to  if you go the route of , which acts the same as  in Python 3.
You can use built-in range function for it:In python 2.xIn python 3.x you have to call  function on range to get list as  by itself returns generator object.
