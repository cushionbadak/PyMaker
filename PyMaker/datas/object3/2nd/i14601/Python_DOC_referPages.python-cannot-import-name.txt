I have 3 files lcdtest.py, lcd.py and alarmfunctionr.py. I am trying to control the attached lcd display on my raspberry pi with the lcdtest.py script. The import from alarmfunctionsr seem to work ok but i get an cannot import name error when i try the same for the lcd script.lcd.py:alarmfunctionsr.py:

(And, even if you could, you can't call them that way; you need a  object to call its methods.)I suspect you need to read a basic tutorial on classes, like the Classes chapter in the official tutorial.Meanwhile, I think the code you want is:(Also note the  in the last line. You need those parentheses to call a function or method; without them, you're just referring to the function or method itself, as a value, which has no more effect than just writing  on a line by itself.)
