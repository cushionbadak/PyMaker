I am not sure why I am getting this .  is in the documentation.https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html?highlight=queue#queue.QueueI am using it in a function like so:error:Line 5 is :
A kinda standard cross py2-py3 compatible version:
Another way to avoid version problems is:
for ImportError: No module named 'Queue' in Python3, just replace the sentence "import Queue" with "import queue as Queue".
Replace  with If your env isn't set up correctly then  may not work. If  gives the same error then try running  in your shell as a sanity check.If you don't get a sensible output from  then you have odd installation of python 3 and I suggest installing it using your package manager (, ,  or whatever you prefer - this will probably fix the  issue).
