I have a list of tkinter entry fields generated dynamically. I need to grab the contents of each field while knowing what it's referring to. I have tried adding something like  but as expected it wont work like that and is really quite a stupid design practice to attempt so I'm thinking it needs to be in the form of an array but can't seem to figure out how to do that with an Entry.I've simplifed the code to the minimal required to see what I'm trying to do. The problem seems to be either with where I put the items in a table or try and parse them (problem are 1 & 2). I'm very new to python and can't figure out how to do this.
