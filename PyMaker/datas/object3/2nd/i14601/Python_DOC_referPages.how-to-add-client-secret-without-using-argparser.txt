I want to test Google Genomics. I have a project and I can run main.py from the getting started with the api. But this files hides under the hood of oauth2client how credentials are generated:Can somebody explain me what does the code? How could I convert that into something without argparse? I tried with other solutions of google-api documentation but the main point is that I don't understand what is being done, so I can't understand what I should do. (I also don't fully understand OAuth2client)This answer suggest that argparse is mandatory. But this other way using google-api-python-client don't use it...
If you want you can use an API key instead, which is more practical when implementing servers - though you would not want to share it with anyone.  Below are two great links that describe how the Oauth2 protocol works in providing access to Google's APIs:https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2WebServerHope it helps,Paul
The purpose of argparse is to parse command line options.  If you plan on taking arguments at the command line, it's much easier with argparse than without.If you want to hard-code the arguments (or retrieve them in some other manner), you can just rip out all the  lines, and replace the  variable with the appropriate values (e.g. for the client secrets filename).
