So in my pygame game, I have created a list of objects to make things like updating them all and collision checking easier. So when I'm collision checking, I have to check if the current object is the same as the object we are collision checking with. Here is my current code:(All objects in the list/array are a child to the su)
Apart from  way in previous answer, I think you can use . https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#isinstanceOperator  can be used for object checking such as  if a and b are same objects. Remember  checks only objects and not their values. Or, I havenot seen anyone do this, I guess  would work as well when you need to check if two objects are same.
Simple, yet powerful =>  
You can check to see the type of a variable using the  function. So your code would read as below:This would check to see if  is of type . You can replace this with inbuilt types such as , , ,  etc. or it can be custom types/objects you have declared.It is important to note that it will only check the object type and not the object's values. So it will not see if two objects hold identical values.It is also a bit tricky when we come to inheritance, so there are more examples in this answer Determine the type of an object?Also take note from the comments to this answer, as if you are using Python 2.x and not inheriting from  when declaring custom Classes this solution may not work.If you want to know if two instances of a class hold the same value you will have to implement the  function/method into the class definition. See SO answer Is there a way to check if two object contain the same values in each of their variables in python? for more details.
