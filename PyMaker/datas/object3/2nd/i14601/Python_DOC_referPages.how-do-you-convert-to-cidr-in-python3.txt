I have an ip address 1.2.3.4 with a subnet mask 255.255.255.0I want to convert this to cidr notation1.2.3.4/24How do I do this in Python3?
Use the  module in the standard library.An address plus a netmask is either a network or an interface, not an address. Given that you've got some of the host bits set (it's 1.2.3.4, not 1.2.3.0), either you've got an interface, or you've got a non-canonical name for a network; I'll assume it's an interface, so use :Or, if you want to make sure it's explicitly IPv4 not IPv6:Or you can compose it out of an address and a network, instead of out of a combined string. It depends on what format you have this information in and what makes sense to you.To get the CIDR format, use the  accessor:You can also do all kinds of other nifty thingsâ€”extract the address () as , or the network () as , or enumerate all the addresses on the network by treating  as a sequence, etc.
You can use the IPy library to do this. If you scroll down to the documentation you can see the string conversions it can do. The one we're after is
