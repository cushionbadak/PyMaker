So, I have a basic layout that is created with the following code (written here for brevity):Which I had hoped would add the  to the grid.

Here is the output of the  statement (again, cut to show pertinent portion):As you can see, there is a named  child that was added in code not shown. However, the  named widget doesn't appear to be added. Why does  not add it as expected?
It seems like creating a  actually creates a  wrapping the actual  widget together with a , and the  you assign to the  is not assigned to the , but to the wrapped .Thus,  does indeed not contain a child with name , but the . The  widget can then be found among the children of that .So if you want to get a reference to the  widget you have to get if from the , but instead it might be much easier to just bind it to  when you create it, i.e.This is indeed the same object as the one you would get from the 's children:Output:
