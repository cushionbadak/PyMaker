Natural Text
I have two text files. One text file is "numbers.txt". It contains 10 digit phone numbers, one on each line. The second file "users" contains data about several accounts. I only want to find info on the accounts listed in numbers.txtSo, for each number in numbers.txt search users file for said number. If found return that line of text and the following line of text (or return all text until next empty line would also work).numbers.txt looks like:users file looks like:Result I'm looking for:I'm stuck / stumped as to how to approach it. What I have so far:
Read the numbers into a setLook at the first ten characters of each line in . If that string is in , save two lines to a container ()
The code is not optimal therefore have to read users_data numbers.txt lines times:
I just suggest you might can sort the data first, then we can loop for number in numbers. can find the number in the users_data.
This is written in Python 3 to get the behavior of  that I wanted. Just change  to  to use the name of the file of your nums file and same with the user file part. This should be obvious:Prints:Comments:It is not obvious if the  file is formatted like that. Adjust the regex accordinglyOnly works if the numbers in  are uniqueRecords in  without a corresponding number in  are gathered in the dict
