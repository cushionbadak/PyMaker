for example,1 < 3 therefore [3,?,?]2 = 2 therefore [3,2,?]6 > 4 therefore [3,2,6]I have recently started python and don't know how to use a loop that checks two lists at once.
You can use a list comprehension to make a new list.You can use  to iterate through both lists at once.You can use  to give you the greater of two items.This gives:
You can use the  built-in function here:which will create a list on Python 2 and an iterator (a map object) on Python 3 - if you do need a list, on Python 3 wrap the  with :Example:How this works is that the  function takes 1 function as an argument, followed by 1 to n iterables; the iterables are iterated over simultaneously and their values are passed as arguments to the given function; whatever is returned from the function ( in this case) is yielded from the  into the result value.
