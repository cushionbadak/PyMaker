I wrote this python script to web scrap data and to print the output to a separate file. The 'refID.txt' file has a list of IDs and for each ID, data has to be extracted from a site. The output will be printed to the 'output.txt' file.Here is my code;My problem is, for the output to be printed in the 'output.txt' file, the code has to be run twice. If the script is run once, no output will be printed. But if the code is run for the second time, the output will be printed. How can I print the output when the code is run only once?  
Try using and then the code you'd like to run on the open file. This will close it automatically. See https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open
If you are going to be working with files you should always remember to close your files to make sure the data is being read and written correctly and also to make sure that your resources are freed up.Instead of writing f.close() and reference file.close(), I opened both files with the  statement. This is the best practice when working with files as it will automatically close the file when it goes out of scope. See here to get more information on with statements.
