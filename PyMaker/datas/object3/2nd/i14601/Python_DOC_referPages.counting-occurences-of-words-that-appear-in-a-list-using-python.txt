Natural Text
I have appended excel sheet values to a list using xlrd. I called the list a_master. I have a text file with words that I want to count the occurrences of that appear in this list (I called this file dictionary and theirs 1 word per line). Here is the code:For some reason though, the count comes back with zero for every count word that exists in the text file. If I write out the count for one of these words myself: It counts the occurrences no problem.I have also tried in order to see if it is seeing the words in the dictionary.txt file correctly and it is. 
Lines read from the file is terminated by newline character. There may also be white space at the end. It is better to strip out any whitespace before doing a lookupNote Ideally, searching a list is linear and may not be optimal in most cases. I think collections.Counter is suitable for situation as you depicted. Re-interpret your list as a dictionary where the key is the item and the value is the occurrence by passing it through  as shown belowand you can re-write your code as
Use collections.Counter():Why is this question tagged xlrd by the way?
