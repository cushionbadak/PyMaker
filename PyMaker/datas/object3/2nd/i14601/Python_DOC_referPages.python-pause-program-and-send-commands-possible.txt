Is there a way to pause a Python program and be able to send commands from the prompt during the pause before resuming the code ?The only way I found to do a pause is to ask for a keyboard entry (like press enter for example) but you can't type commands while it's waiting for you to press enter. Is there a way to really pause the code? have access to all variables and possibly modify them in the prompt before resuming?
If you want to use this for debugging, check out , the Python debugger. You can start you script under , set a breakpoint on the line you want, and then run your script.You can then inspect your variables and call functions. Since Python 3.2, you can also use the  command inside  to get a regular Python shell at the current execution point!You can also include the following line directly in your program to stop at that line end drop into pdb:Then you won't even have to use  on the commandline.
