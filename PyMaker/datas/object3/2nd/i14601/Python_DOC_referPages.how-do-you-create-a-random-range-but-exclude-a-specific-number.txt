I have the following code:I want the loop to repeat until  equals anything but zero. However, I get zero all the time. What am I doing wrong?
Answering the question in the title, not the real problem (which was answered by Daniel Roseman):How do you create a random range, but exclude a specific number?Using :
.You are comparing against a string, but  gives you an integer.
Well you check against a string to break the loop. So use:instead of:A memory efficient way to generate from  to  but not including a value  is:This way, in the first step we'll generate a random int between  and  or between  and . In the second case we increment by one and we get a random number between  and . It's easy to see that each number between  and  has the same probability.
Your code fails because you're comparing an integer to a string. There are other problems with your code:You have an  statement inside a loop.There's no telling how many times your loop will run.Here is a loop-free way to randomly generate a non-zero integer from -5 to +5, inclusive.This code is guaranteed to call  exactly twice.
As an alternative method, just pick one random element from the array, [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].  Guaranteed to work with just one call.
