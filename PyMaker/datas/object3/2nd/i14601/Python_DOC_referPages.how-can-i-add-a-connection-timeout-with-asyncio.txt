I want to connect to a list of a lot of different sites very fast. Im using asyncio to do this in an asynchronous manner and now want toadd a timeout for when connections should be ignored if they take too long to respond. How do I implement this?(On a sidenote: Has somebody an idea how to optimize this?)
You can wrap the call to  in , which allows you to specify a timeout:Note that when  is raised, the  coroutine is also cancelled. If you don't want it to be cancelled (though I think you do want it to be cancelled in this case), you have wrap the call in .
