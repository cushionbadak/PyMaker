I read already this What is the best way to call a Python script from another Python script?In my case I don't want to call another python script in a python script, but I want to call for example the ssylze.py with the specific options like consider in https://code.google.com/p/sslyze/wiki/QuickStartSo I have script test1.py and in that script I would like to use how I do that?
Not sure if I've unscrambled the code from your comment ok and whether this is what you are trying to do. As I don't know what sslyze.py is doing I haven't tested it. However your problem might be due to not waiting for each subprocess to terminate:
You can use the argparse module:Running the above snippet (asd.py) with  will print "www.target1.com". Hope this provides enough of an example to be helpful.
