Im using a binary tree described in this bookproblem solving with algorithms and data structuresThere is already a preorder traversal method defined as follows.I just want to add a return value of the list of nodes visited. So I can do something likeIm having trouble returning a list from a recursive method. The recursion stops as soon as it hits the 'return' I've tried variations usingOrAny ideas?
Are you sure you want  and not simply  when you print?Otherwise, a solution with  (Python 3.3+):Or with simple :Note that using  or  transforms the function into a generator function; in particular, if you want an actual list (for indexing, slicing, or displaying for instance), you'll need to explicitly create it: .If you have a varying number of children, it's easy to adapt:
You have to actually return a value from the recursive function (currently, it's just printing values). And you should build the list as you go, and maybe clean the code up a bit - something like this:
You can add second argument to  function, something like
You can simply return a concatenated list for each recursive call, which combines the current key, the left subtree and the right subtree:For an n-ary tree:
