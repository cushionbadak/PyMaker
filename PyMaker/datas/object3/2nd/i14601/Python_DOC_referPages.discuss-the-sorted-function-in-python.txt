I know the sorted() function in Python can operate on a number list or dictionaries, and it returns a list of sorted number or keys. For example:Then we can obtain the re-arranged sorted number list as [0,1,2,2,3,4,6,8]My question is that: does sorted() function have any other functionality? I hope you guys could give me some simple examples. :)
Python's  takes in any iterable (, , ), e.g.,Also, it can optionally take in a , which means you can sort by some characteristic. For example, you could sort a string alphabetically or lexicographically:A cool feature of sorting using a given  means you can also provide a  expression, so, as in the following example, you can sort by the length of a dictionary value (list):This also works with tuples:Note that when sorting nested s or s (or other iterables), it will sort first by the first inner index and then by the subsequent inner indices.You can also specify how you want to sort a class:You can also use  to get an object's attribute to dictate what you want to sort on:Furthermore, with , you can have a function that combines multiple keys, e.g.,Next, you can specify whether or not you want a reverse sort: also works with lists of multiple types (only in Python 2):Note: sorting among multiple types does not work in Python 3. You'll get a .Lastly and for historical reasons, Python's  allows for a , or comparison function. For example:It should be noted, too, that Python's  uses Timsort as its sorting algorithm, which is a stable sort. This means that if there are multiple of the same element (or field), the original order will be preserved.Sources:https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#sortedhttps://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.htmlhttps://wiki.python.org/moin/HowTo/Sortinghttp://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/06/python-sorted/http://www.peterbe.com/plog/sorting-mixed-type-lists-in-python-3
