The Python  module contains many handy ABCs for checking various features of objects, but one that doesn't appear to belong is . No standard collection is callable, and  doesn't provide any reasoning or even mention the Callable ABC, so why is it in this package instead of somewhere else?Context:I'm writing a Python->Java compiler for fun, and I just wanted to see if there was any reasoning behind the decision so I could list that reasoning in my code.
The module originates from PEP-3119 which proposes:Specific ABCs for containers and iterators, to be added to the collections module.But since then, it evolved to be something more. And now a module description does not mention containters and iterators explictly. It says:This module provides abstract base classes that can be used to test whether a class provides a particular interface; for example, whether it is hashable or whether it is a mapping.I believe it is a  submodule just because it was a part of it in the past:New in version 3.3: Formerly, this module was part of the collections module.
