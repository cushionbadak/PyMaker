This question already has an answer here:Split Strings into words with multiple word boundary delimiters                    29 answers                I have already triedhow can i write code that can take in either string and get rid of both colons and hyphens? Is there a better way besides splitting the same string twice?
To split on more than one delimiter, you can use  and a character set:Demo:Note however that  is also used to specify a range of characters in a character set.  For example,  will match all uppercase letters.  To avoid this behavior, you can put the  at the start of the set as I did above. For more information on Regex syntax, see Regular Expression Syntax in the docs.
You can replace one by the other then split the entire string:
