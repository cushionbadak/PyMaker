I am trying to convert a url like  into directories from the current directory.So I get a folder named , inside that  and finally inside that the file saved as I've tried using  but it keeps appending  to the start of it.
You can use  to create the directory tree, but that will fail if the final directory already exists. So you can test if it exists before attempting to create the directory tree, or use . In Python 3 you can supply an  parameter to over-ride this behaviour, see the Python docs of os.makedirs for further info.If your system doesn't support directory names containing periods you can translate them to another character, eg , like this:(just insert this after the  line).And as jwilner mentions in the comments, it's more efficient to usethan  if you don't need the base component of the file name (in this example ).
