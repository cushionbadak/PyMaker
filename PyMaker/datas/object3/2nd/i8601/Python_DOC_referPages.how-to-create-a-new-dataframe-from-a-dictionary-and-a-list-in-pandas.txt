So, I have a dictionary like: I am trying to create a DataFrame like:So, basically, for each element in list, generate all the possible column entries.How can I do this with Pandas?
If I understand correctly, you can just use  directly.With your current input size, this approach seems reasonable enough. However, if you intend to perform this operation on a much much larger dataset, you'll want to use a NumPy solution like piRSquared's. 
using  timing with given data with much bigger data 
Shorter ways to do this butSubstitute your lists/dictionary calls in the appropriate places and you should be good
