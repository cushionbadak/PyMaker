This question already has an answer here:How do I execute a program from Python? os.system fails due to spaces in path                    8 answers                Now Consider the following idea I'm declaring a  type to run the programSuch as :Now clearly the command run  doesn't work so what should I do to make it execute  incase it is selected and close the main program where we are choosing the number?
There are several ways to run external code. There is subprocess and  to run any other program on the disc, then there is  to run a code you have as a string or code object, then there is  that is kinda similar to  but accepts only a string and allows to supply globals and locals. Those are all builtins.But you probably don't really want to run external scripts as scripts. It creates all sorts of problems with correctly passing  to them, and making sure they get correct stdin/stdout and everything. Nine times out of ten you're better off creating a series of functions (perhaps in other files), importing them and calling those.
You should consider to learn about subprocesses: https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.htmlPopen option is one of the most useful ones for stuff like that.Note: Number 0 would open the same file you are using to call the new processes, just in case you ever need to "clone" your own program.Edit: Linux and windows will require you to do this differently, as:
