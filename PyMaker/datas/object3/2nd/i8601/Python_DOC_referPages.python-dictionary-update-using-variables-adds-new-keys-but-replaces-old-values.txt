I am trying to store information in dictionary that I want to access later. I am doing it dynamically using variables, where "badgeID" is a global counter that I am using as key and value is an array/list that I get from the user. The problem that when I try to add more than one K:V to the dictionary, it adds a key but replaces all the previously stored values(in this case it is an array/list) with the newest one. Any help would be really appreciated. Thanks 
The problem that when I try to add more than one K:V to the  dictionary, it adds a key but replaces all the previously stored  values(in this case it is an array/list) with the newest one.The technique to solve this problem is that every key, badgeNum, news a list of values rather than a single value.Another approach is to use collections.defaultdict() which takes a little more effort to set-up but makes it simpler (and a bit faster) to add new values:
Solved. It was a stupid mistake. I was trying to fill the array that was global and then was clearing the array every time I received input from user by using "del myarray[:]". I declared the array just for the function and it works.
