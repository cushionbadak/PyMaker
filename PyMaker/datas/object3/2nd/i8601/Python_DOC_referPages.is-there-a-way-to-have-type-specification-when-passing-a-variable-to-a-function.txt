In a language like C# I must specify the type of the objects that are passed into a given function. If I have a class like so: Then if I am in main I can call that function through another function by specifying the type of the variable that will be passed as an argument:though the example is not optimal, I make it just to show that I can access functions from the Thing class within a separate function by specifying that a Thing object will be passed to that function.Python does not have this level of type specification, thus I can see no way of achieving the same result. If I have a function which I defined in a class from a separate file, but I want to run it through a function where an object of that class type will be used to run that function, how can I access that class function in a separate function?
You can write your code in Python (lets use separate file also) like this:First.pySecond.pyNow the call site:Main.pySo I can't see what it is you think that Python cannot do.
