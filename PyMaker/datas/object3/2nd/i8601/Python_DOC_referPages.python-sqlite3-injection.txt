I was wondering in my program for python I have purposely made it so I can use injection in my program. If I try to use this  it does not work and enters it normally. If I am using  it comes up with where it says enter a name it is obviously a variable.and if I use I only want to know how to so I can try it out in my programs only and to prevent against it(I know you should use ?)
The VALUES clause needs a closing parenthesis, so you need to enter something like this:(The  starts a comment, to prevent the final  in the original SQL statement from being interpreted.)And Python's  executes only a single statement, so this kind of injection does not work. Your program would need to use  instead.(But if you have a SELECT, you can use this to suppress any following filter conditions, such as .)
