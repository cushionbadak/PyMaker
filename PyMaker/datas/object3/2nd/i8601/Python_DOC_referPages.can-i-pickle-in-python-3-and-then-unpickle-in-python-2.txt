The problem I'm trying to solve is the following: I have a graph that I would like to draw as a circular tree. This requires  and either  or , which are not available for Python 3.I'm considering the option of serialising the graph-object in python 3, and then de-serialising it in a python 2 environment where I could draw it. It's, however, unclear to me what the potential issues are with this type of approach since I cannot assume that the respective objects are similar in both environments.Apart from actually trying this out (I currently have no python 2 environment on my machine), is there any way to find out if this is possible? Or would it simply make more sense to follow a different route by either exporting to a different format (e.g. gephy), and perhaps even doing the drawing outside of python?
Yes, you can dump data in Python 3 to load it again in Python 2. You probably want to set , as well as use a protocol lower than 3. From the  documenation:If fix_imports is true and protocol is less than 3, pickle will try to map the new Python 3 names to the old module names used in Python 2, so that the pickle data stream is readable with Python 2.Protocol version 2 is supported in Python 2.3 - 2.7.However, consider some of the alternatives:There are three Graphviz packages that support Python 3: module supports Python 3.3 and up. has supported Python 3 since version 1.2.0, released July 2016. They project tests every commit on Python 3.5. has supported Python 3 since version 1.3, released September 2015. The project tests on 3.5 and 3.6.Use a different serialisation format. JSON should be able to handle a graph just fine.
