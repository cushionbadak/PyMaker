I have a list of letters, I want to see if these letters appear in a list of states. If they do appear, I want to know which letter appears and in which position it appears. I want to store it in a variable so I can then compare it to another string. Below is my example code:
You can use list comprehensions!List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. Common  applications are to make new lists where each element is the result of  some operations applied to each member of another sequence or  iterable, or to create a subsequence of those elements that satisfy a  certain condition.For every s in states, for every character, check if its present in your letters list. If found, then you can get the index and the character in a list without losing its order!If you break down the list comprehension, To make access of elements much easier, you can use dict comprehension!So when you wan to access for one state say 'florida'Hope it helps!
Try this: 
You could do something like this to get a list of all indices of the letter
You can use a lot of approaches :)After you use:You will receive something like:So you will receive something like you described in the description of this issue.Of course you can sort the lists of a particular dictionary key, if you want.
