Natural Text
So, currently I'm writing a "Member Database" program for a client. The program needs to be able to put all inputted info into a text file that can be read at any time. Currently, I'm working on a prototype-type thing, that currently is not indicative of the final product. After the user has finished inputting the information, it needs to be written and then return to the menu. Currently, it just won't write into the text file.
You never  the file. You could use auto-closing with the  statement:By the way: same with reading it: Put the reading in a  block.
When I run your code with a file named memberdatabase.txt in the same folder as the py script it has no issues saving the text to the file. You just have to make sure to close the file when you are done. This is what it should look like:This is the output I get in the file after adding two members:;I was able to have the file closed and then opened again and the text was still there. Hope this helps so you can implement it in your code now.
Use  when you want to force your program to write into thefile.Always use  when you are done with reading / writingyour file.
