I have tried the  library however my code stalls sometimes which also means the schedule code stalls.  is the script, it using Queues and Threads to request exchange data. One of the exchanges randomly throws an error and because the of threading (I think) the code goes into a state of limbo. I can't seem to fix the bug, but a dirty fix to the problem would be force run the script every x time (in my case I want 10 seconds) Any ideas ? 
Besides the obvious way (have a thread that with  containing  and ), you can use threading.Timer or the sched module.
