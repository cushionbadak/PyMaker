I have a function which can return a variable number of outputs. I would like to save this to a dictionary like so:Now while this thing does work, I was wondering if there is a more elegant way of doing it. Any ideas?
You can use the  function to add the indices in the dictionary:This gives you the exact same integer index to value mapping. However, just a list would give you the exact same index-to-value mapping:(if  already returns a  object, just remove the  call).
