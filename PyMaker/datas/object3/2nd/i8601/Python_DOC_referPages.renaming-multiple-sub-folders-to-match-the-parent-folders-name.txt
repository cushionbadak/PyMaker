I'm a python beginner but have some basic experience, and I need someone to please help me use the os module to rename sub folders based on their parent folder.  I've been searching for answers for the past week and have not had any success.  I'm assuming I need to use the os.walk method to do this.  Here is my folder structure:C:\data\test\C:\data\test\map1C:\data\test\map1\1617151C:\data\test\map2C:\data\test\map2\181719C:\data\test\map3C:\data\test\map3\182726C:\data\test\map4C:\data\test\map4\894932I need the results to look like this.C:\data\test\C:\data\test\map1C:\data\test\map1\map1C:\data\test\map2C:\data\test\map2\map2C:\data\test\map3C:\data\test\map3\map3C:\data\test\map4C:\data\test\map4\map4Can someone please help?
python 2.7:python 3+:Untested, but should do it.
You can get a list of all the files and it's respective folder location using this one liner:For the given folder structure it will return:You can now loop over this list and rename the files (https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.rename). You can get the parent folder's name by splitting the root string ().
