I ran such code in C++11:Then I checked the value of , it's not , but  was .However, when I ran: was not  anymore. I read the document of PyLong_FromLong, and found this:Seems that when building  between -5 and 256 will meet this problem. But I don't understand the reason.What's more, this problem doesn't appear in Python2. That's incredible!
You haven't initialized Python. Since these small objects are special-cased they are set up when Python is initialized.correctly prints (note that this will vary from run to run)If I comment out  and  then I get a segmentation fault, but if I don't try reading the value with  then I get a null pointer for .The documentation does tell you to initialize the interpreter.With respect to Python2 it has two integer types  and  with  handling the small values and so having the special-cased table. You'll probably see the same issue if you use  in Python2. Anything you do with Python before calling  is undefined though, so it could fail in different exciting ways.
