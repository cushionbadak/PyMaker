The question is to find the shortest distance to all buildings for a 0 valued point given a grid. You are only allowed to move up, down, left, and right. You can encounter the following values:0 - empty space1 - building2 - obstacleMy solution written in Python is below:My question is:How can I increase the efficiency of my solution? Right now I am exceeding a time limit on Leetcode on the following input but it is correct for all other test inputs:Note: Changing visited and targetsFound improves efficiency but is not sufficient to pass all test cases.Update:By changing the algorithm to search from each building instead of each zero point, I was able to improve the algorithm by 96% on certain large inputs and pass all test cases. The updated algorithm is below. Thanks to Nether for his suggestions.
Change your  variable to a set.The reason you use that variable is to look up if a cell has been visited and lookups in lists are slow O(N) time. Sets support fast lookup O(1) and as such should drastically improve your algorithm's performance.More information about what O(N) and O(1) mean: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4cd1O4zkGw&t=1s
