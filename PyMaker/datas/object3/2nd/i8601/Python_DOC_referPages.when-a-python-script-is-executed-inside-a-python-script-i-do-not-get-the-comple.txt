When a python script is executed inside a python script, I do not get the complete output. In my case:where capture.py will capture the packets and feeds this to capture.log.Capture.py will keep sending packets every 100 sec. I couldn't see the complete output in to the file. Only the initial captures are put to capture.log because capture.py doesn't capture any packets after some time. However, when I execute the same script via "python -u" in the bash prompt, it works.
