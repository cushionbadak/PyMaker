This question already has an answer here:Python nested functions variable scoping [duplicate]                    10 answers                I have a two nested python functions, which look like this:Trying to call  results in the following error:I thought adding the line  before  would help, except it didn't.Why is this happening? How do I get around this problem, other than passing t to  everytime I call it?
If using python 3, then using the nonlocal keyword would let the interpreter know to use the  function's scope for t:If using python 2, then you can't directly assign to the variable, or it will make the interpreter create a new variable t which will hide the outer variable. You could pass in a mutable collection and update the first item:
