I have a python module  which defines a decorator . I want to test the decorator. The decorator will receive a flask request header.The decorator is sth like this:I want to mock the flask request header using a  decorator.The test I wrote is sth like this:but I always get the following error:How should I do it right?
Mock the whole request object to avoid triggering the context lookup:and build up the mock from there:Since a missing token results in an  exception being raised, you should explicitly test for that. Note that the  attribute is not called anywhere, so  or  attributes don't apply here.I ignored  altogether; your decorator is not using  and your implementation is lacking a  method, so  tests wouldn't work on that. A plain dictionary suffices for the current code-under-test.Side note:  is a decorator factory, but it doesn't take any parameters. It'd be clearer if you didn't use a factory there at all. You should also use  to ensure that any metadata other decorators add are properly propagated:then use the decorator directly (so no call):
