I've been doing some work with bitwise operators, which usually begins by using bin() to convert integers. I've been getting an error at each try.The last line is where we get messed up.if bin() returns a string then what are these bitwise operators expecting?
The  unary bitwise operator require integer input. From the Unary arithmetic and bitwise operations section of the Expressions chapter of the Python reference documentation:The unary  (invert) operator yields the bitwise inversion of its integer argument. The bitwise inversion of  is defined as . It only applies to integral numbers.Bold emphasis mine.Applying  to  works just fine:The  function only returns a string object with the binary representation of a number. Think of this as a debugging tool, something that can quickly show you what bits are set and not set for an integer number. To actually manipulate bits, you still need an integer.
