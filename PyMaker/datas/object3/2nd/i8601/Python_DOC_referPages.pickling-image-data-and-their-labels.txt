I'm new to  in Python. I have images along with their labels. How can I pickle those?
Although I'm not sure this really qualifies as a valid SO question, my best advice would be to create a class to contain the image data and labels, then implement  and , as per the descriptions of each at python.org. In addition, assuming you are using a library for storing and manipulating the images, look into whether or not it supports pickling, because piggybacking on its implementation could save you a lot of hassle. Hope this helps!
