Natural Text
Basically I have a txt file thats an ouput from a fortran model. The output looks a little like this:Each step adds another set  like the above so eventually I have a txt file with 3000+ steps.So I want to recall all the temperatures at each step. I'm trying to write something to index all the points where 'Temp(K)' appears and then add 1 to that index to get the location of the actual temperature.My code looks like this: So obviously this isn't the most elegant way but I'm very much in the deep end with python. So how do I find the index of a list within list(main2) if the first value of that list=='Temp(K)'?Nb. I'm using np and matplot to plot the data after this.
Read the file into a list.Get the numbers of the lines that start a temperature (using a list comprehension because it is fast):Get the temperatures, again with a list comprehension.If desired, you could even combine this into one list comprehension:An example in IPython:
This can be done using python's enumerate() function.Here's an example of extracting the indexes. (And, just for fun, the temperatures Too!)
How about this:
