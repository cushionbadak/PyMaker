I need to loop through a list "A" of 100.000 elements. But I need to skip some of them, in particlular I want to skip the elements which are written into another list "B".What is the best way to do this?
You can use a filter:If you need to iterate on the elements, drop the  wrapping the filter:Alternatively, the same can be achieved with a list comprehension, which is essentially the same semantically:Keep in mind that in both those versions, you'll be performing a linear search on the elements of b.If that list is pretty long, this might get really slow.A more efficient method (as suggested in the comments) would be to make b a set rather than a list.This only requires the elements of b to be hashable.
