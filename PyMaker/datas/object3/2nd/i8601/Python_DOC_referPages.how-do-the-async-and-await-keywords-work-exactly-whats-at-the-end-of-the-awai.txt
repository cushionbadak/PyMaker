I have this code:What do I put in bar to get the 5 and the 6 out of ?I'm asking because the  library seems like a lot of magic. And I want to know exactly how the magic works.Maybe I want to write my own functions that call  or  and then inform some top level loop that I wrote that they're waiting for the file descriptor to become readable or writeable.And then, maybe I want that top level loop to be able to resume my read and write functions (and the whole intermediate chain between the top level loop and them) once those conditions become true.I already know how to use  more or less. I wrote this little demo program that computes squares after a delay but launches lots of those tasks that each append to a list after a random interval. It's kind of clumsily written, but it works.I want to know exactly what that program is doing under the hood. And in order to do that, I have to know how await on that sleep informs the top-level event loop that it wants to sleep (and be called again) for a bit and how the state of all the intermediate stack frames between the call to sleep and the top level event loop are frozen in place then reactivated when the delay is over.
Have you tried looking at the source for asyncio.sleep?Basically it uses loop.call_later to set a future, and then waits for the future. Not sure this entirely answers your questions, but it might help.
So, I understand a lot better how to make what I was trying to do work. This is how my code should've read:The basic answer is that the endpoint of this can be a normal generator decorated with . There are more ways of making this work, and this further modification of my code demonstrates them:As you can see, anything that defines an  method that returns an iterator can also be ed upon. What really happens is that the thing being ed upon is iterated over until it stops and then the  returns. The reason you do this is that the final thing at the end of the chain may encounter some kind of blocking condition. It can then report on that condition (or ask a callback to be set or something else) by ing or returning a value from the iterator (basically the same thing as ing). Then the top level loop can continue on to whatever other thing can be run.The nature of the whole chain of  calls is that when you then go back and ask for the next value from the iterator (call back into the blocked function telling it that maybe it isn't blocked now) the entire call stack is reactivated. This whole chain exists as a way to preserve the state of the call stack while the call is blocked. Basically a thread that voluntarily gives up control rather than having control wrested from it by a scheduler.The vision in my head of how  worked internally when I asked this question is apparently how something called curio works and is based on the end point routines ing some sort of indicator of what they're being blocked by and the top level loop that's running it all ( in my example) then putting that in some sort of general pool of conditions to look for so it can resume the routine as soon as the condition it's blocked by changes. In , something much more complex happens, and it uses objects with the  method (like  in my example) and some sort of callback mechanism to make it all work.Brett Cannon wrote a really good article that talks about how generators evolved into coroutines. It will go into far more detail than I can go into in a StackOverflow answer.One interesting tidbit I discovered is that when you do this:Both  and  become 'coroutines' and can be ed on. All the decorator does is flip a bit in . This is, of course, an implementation detail and should not be relied upon. I think this is something of a bug actually, and I may report it as such.
There is an example in the documentation, that looks almost exactly like what you are trying to do. It contains a sleep call (used instead of IO), so that the asyncio aspect makes sense.
Going through the code you have supplied above, an  that includes a  creates an Asynchronous Generator:To consume data from it, use :To consume a result from a simple coroutine such as  from a regular function, you will need to create an event loop and to use :
