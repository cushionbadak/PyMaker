Here is my code.  is like , then I assign it to  and pass it into the function (I remove some of the detail that are not necessary) and the list is now like. However, I think neither  nor 'mData' should be changed since all the changes happen inside the function, and the fact is not like that. Can anyone tell me why and improve that?Thank you in advance.
If I understand you correctly, you are getting dataSet to change when you don't expect it to change. If this is the problem, then this issue is occurring in this line:To rectify this, I would look into Python's copy and deepcopy. When you 'copy' a list this way, it doesn't actually make another copy, but rather references the original. For example:The easiest way to fix this is to use splice copying:    y = x[:]However, this won't solve your issue because you have lists within lists. What you would need (I think) is deepcopy from the copy module. Let me know if I helped!
