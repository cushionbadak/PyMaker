I am a beginner and I've tried searching online everywhere, but I'm not sure I'm searching the right terms.My CSV file looks this:https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B74bmJNIxxW-dWl0Y0dsV1E4bjA/view?usp=sharingI want to know how to use the CSV file to do something like this, Emaildriver.find_element_by_name('emailAddress').send_keys("johndoe@example.com")print "Successfully Entered Email..."   
There are lots of ways that you could do this. One would be to use the csv module.
It really helps to post the data here so that we see what the format really is and run code ourselves. So, I invented some sample dataemails.csvI can use the  module to read that.  reads each row into its own  that lets me reference cells by the name given in the header. Since I'll be looking up records by email name later, I'll read it into another  that will act as an index into the records. If the same user is in there multiple times, only the last one will be remembered.With the index in place, I can grab the row by email name.
