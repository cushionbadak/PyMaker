I have the following method:I use this values inside my query and then fetch data from DB using my query. How to set this values if the user doesn't specify them in UI? Currently, I set it to the current time, is it good idea/algorithm?
The Python 3 Documentation specifies what to do for default arguments. This is the example they provide:It also specifies:This function can be called in several ways:giving only the mandatory argument: ask_ok('Do you really want to quit?')giving one of the optional arguments: ask_ok('OK to overwrite the file?', 2)or even giving all arguments: ask_ok('OK to overwrite the file?', 2, 'Come on, only yes or no!')In your case, you'd want to do something like this:This will set  and  to  if no arguments are provided. It'll set  to None if exactly one argument is provided, and it'll use both as normal if both are provided. Note that the user could provide  here themself, which could be a feature. EDIT: It's important to note here as well that the default arguments are only evaluated once, when the function definition is reached. If you try to use something like  then these times will only be evaluated once (when the function is defined, not when it is called) which defeats the point. So don't accidentally fall into that trap.
