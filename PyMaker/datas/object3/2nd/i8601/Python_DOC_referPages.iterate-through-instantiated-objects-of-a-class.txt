Isit possible to loop through the objects of class person and extract the attributes?so for e.g. from below code after looping the output would be for each object as such Object mike, name-Mike, age-20Thanks
Python classes don't automatically track all their instances.  You can use a class attribute to track them yourself if you need to:Even better would be to have a separate object that tracked people.  The Person.people attribute here is a single global value for the process, which can limit the usability and testability of the class.
To loop the attributes of a given instance, I think you're looking for the builtin function :To loop through all instances of a given class is not possible, unless you add some code to maintain the list of instances yourself.  
if my understanding is right, you are asking about looping the class personthen it can be done like this.## answerI am mike my age is 20I am john my age is 20I am jack my age is 20
