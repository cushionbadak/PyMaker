Assume we have following inheritance chain:The problem: I would like to somehow define  in  so that it calls itself from .Normally I would just write:But this would call  from , which is exactly what I want to avoid. I want to call  from .
The simplest approach is to call the  method directly, passing  explicitly:If the goal is to skip to "whatever is after some known bad super class in the MRO" though, you can use  with explicit arguments to act as if it was called from the "bad super class" so it moves to "whatever comes next":
You can explicitly call a member of the superclass, simply passing  as the first argument:Complete example:This will execute  on the instance specified by , which is passed to  automatically when it is accessed through an instance.
