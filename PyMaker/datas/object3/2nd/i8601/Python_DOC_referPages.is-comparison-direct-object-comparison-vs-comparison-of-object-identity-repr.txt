So I am getting the following results: returns  (comparison between two objects) returns . (comparison between the representations of object identities)According to the python documentation:The ‘is‘ operator compares the identity of two objects; the id() function returns an integer representing its identity.Given case (1), object  has the same identity (memory address) as object ; but in case (2), the representations of their identities are not identical to each other.Why is that?
The  function returns an integer that represents the "identity" of an object so to speak. Although it is true that if two variables  and  refer to the same object,  succeed, and the result of  is equal to , that does not mean those integers themeselves are the same object.You thus should use:In Python, even s are objects, and although usually there is a cache such that small integers indeed refer to the same object, the following test will usually fail:
