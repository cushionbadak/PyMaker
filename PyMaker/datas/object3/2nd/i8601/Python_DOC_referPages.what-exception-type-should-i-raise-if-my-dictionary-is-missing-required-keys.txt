I am testing that  (dictionary), used in Django's , has some required keys. I will raise an exception if the required keys are missing. What exception type is best suited for this?Is there a better way to think about this?
For consistency with regular dicts, I would think a  would be appropriateRaised when a mapping (dictionary) key is not found in the set of existing keys.
