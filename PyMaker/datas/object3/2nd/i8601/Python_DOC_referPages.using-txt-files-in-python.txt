Natural Text
I have a txt file which I need to access through python. The data in the txt file displays a football league in CSV format. The CSV data covers the games played, won and lost, where this will calculate the teams points (2 points for a win, 0 for a loss). I have an idea on how to start this but not sure if I have started on the right foot.How do I calculate the total points for each team? And can I get the headings above the data from the txt file? (Team,Played, Won, Lost, Total) Any support would be appreciated.CSV Data:Code:
As mentioned in the comments you should look into the  module.However in your case since I assume you have just started learning python and the problem is relatively trivial we can do it by just reading the file line by line splitting on the delimiter .Output:Notice how I am only interested in the  and  since those are the only two actually required to calculate the amount of points per team in the problem ( is always  and  has no affect on the total points as it is multiplied by a scale factor of  in the total points calculation).
