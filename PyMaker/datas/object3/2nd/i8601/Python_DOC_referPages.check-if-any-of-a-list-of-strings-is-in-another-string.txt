In python, I'm trying to create a program which checks if 'numbers' are in a string, but I seem to get an error. Here's my code:Here's my error:I tried changing numbers into  which is basically removed the  but this didn't work either. Hope I can get an answer; thanks :)
Use built-in any() function:
In a nutshell, you need to check each digit individually.There are many ways to do this:For example, you could achieve this using a loop (left as an exercise), or by using setsor by making use of :(Note that both examples assume that you're testing for digits, and don't readily generalize to arbitrary substrings.)
Other possible way may be to iterate through each character and check if it is numeric using  method:If  then,  will store all the numbers in  i.e.  and  results in .
As NPE said, you have to check every single digit. The way i did this is with a simple for loop.Hope this helped :)
