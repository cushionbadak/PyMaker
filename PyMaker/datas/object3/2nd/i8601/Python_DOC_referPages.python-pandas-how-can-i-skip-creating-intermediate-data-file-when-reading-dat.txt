I have data files looks like this:So I first combine these files into , and do a little bit clean up And I later on read the final file in pandas I want to know, if it is possible to save combine files in directly in RAM instead in my hard disk? This can save me a lot of unnecessary space.Thanks! 
The  module lets you treat strings as files.Example from the docs:For your own code:pandas accepts both pathname strings and file handles as input.
