I'm new to python. Here's my file:contiguous.py:I try to execute:Why the error? What am I missing?
You don't have to declare a variable to use it in Python. You just instantiate. So you would want to write just  and nothing for . Furthermore, your loop syntax is incorrect. You should write .
Ok, your function in Python is:which is equivalent to:Which are both dangerous if  is : Python is pass by assignment, so if you try to make an array of empty lists, via , you will have a bad day.
There is no var keyword in python. Simply remove that.Variables are set with:Also, the way you set more than one variable per line in python is:Also, your loop looks wrong. It should be:
You don't need the keyword . To make  an array, just do:Variables in python don't have types, only objects do. The type of a variable at any given moment is the type of the object they refer at that moment. So the line above initializes  to an empty list, effectively making  a list too. Also, some other considerations about your code: you are trying to fill an array with a value. There's a much easier way to do it:In this case you don't even need to do , your whole function can be replaced by the line above.
In python, you don't need to say  to assign variables as there is no variable declaration in python. You just . You also should not say  after assigning to the variable, because  would be referencing a variable doesn't exist. Since you assign  later, you don't need to do that at all, actually. Also use .
