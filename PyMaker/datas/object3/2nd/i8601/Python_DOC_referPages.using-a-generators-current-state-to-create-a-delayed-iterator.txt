I would like to understand how to iterate through a generator based on a condition, and to return only the current state without calling next() when that condition is not met.For instance, given a repeating series of integers from 1 to n, how can I create an index starting at 0 that is frozen until a condition is met by the next value in the series? My attempt is:which returnsbut the output should behowever, an else condition in frozenIndex like current = start will always return the saved first generator value. 
You can do this sort of thing by sending data into the generator via its  method. Here's a (relatively) simple example.outputThe first call to  must pass  as the arg, otherwise you getSo we take care of that withand the first  statement in the generator. FWIW, a "naked"  yields , just like a naked  returns . Here's a more complicated generator which can be passed any iterable.output
You can initialize a  with 0.0This should solve what you are trying to do but you cannot traverse forward and backward on yield.
