I want to return a comparison function from a lambda function and use it depending on the type of the input. Is there a way to do it?
There is a way to do it (in Python 3) without using a : . With this, you can create a single-dispatch generic function:A form of generic function dispatch where the implementation is chosen  based on the type of a single argument.[Emphasis mine]It adds overloaded implementations to the function which are called depending on the  of the first argument, and fortunately, your  function takes only one argument.And you can still add more candidate functions for other Python types to overload . 
The problem encountered was that I returned the actual lambda function instead of the defined one.
You could alternatively replace lambda with a higher order function and do the same.
