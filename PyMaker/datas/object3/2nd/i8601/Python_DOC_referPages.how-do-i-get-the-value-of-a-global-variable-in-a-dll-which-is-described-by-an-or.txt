I am accessing a dll from Python using the ctypes library. The functions in the dll are accessible by ordinal, rather than name. I can inspect the dll using Dependency Walker and relate the ordinals to function names. There is a global error number variable in the dll which I wish to access. Dependency Walker shows that it has an ordinal value of 13.There seems to be no way of accessing a global variable by ordinal using ctypes.If the global variable were named then it seems I would be able to do something like:error_value = c_int.in_dll(my_dll_handle, "my_error_value")(https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#accessing-values-exported-from-dlls)Any ideas as to how I access the global variable given only an ordinal?
I didn't see anything explicit in the documentation, other than the syntax for functions accessed by ordinal.  Through experimentation, the following worked:Test code:.DEF file exporting by ordinal:Python code:
