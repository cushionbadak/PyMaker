I am testing out my module using the  library. This includes plotting some graphs using the  library. The issue at the moment is that the testing pauses every time a graph is plotted, and it only resumes after I close the graph. How can I avoid this?
I will model my answer after the simple example code from the matplotlib tutorial: http://matplotlib.org/users/pyplot_tutorial.htmlLet's assume we have the following module,  to be tested:The calls to  can be patched as follows:As you can see, you should patch the calls to . You can find more about patching and mocking in the docs: https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html. Usually the section about where to patch is really useful: https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#where-to-patchFinally there are similar question already on the site: How to run nosetests without showing of my matplotlib's graph?
Don't call  if this is done in the tests. Also the documentation suggests using an experimental  keyword argument to the  function.
Just for completeness, I ran into a similar issue, but to fix it I had to mock out calls to  instead. I realize this isn't exactly what was asked, but this took me a while to figure out after coming across this thread, so I wanted to post it here.If, for instance, your  looked like this:then, at least in my case (running unit tests on a terminal that has no X11 forwarding and errors out when it tries to open a plot), I needed the following in  to run my test:
