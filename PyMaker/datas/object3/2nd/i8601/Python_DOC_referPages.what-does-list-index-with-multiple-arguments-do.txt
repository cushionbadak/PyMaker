I was looking for a way to find the nth occurrence in a list when I found this post :I can't say for certain that this is the fastest way, but I imagine it'd be >pretty good:The answer is i. : list of Booleans here : number of occurrences : element searchedAlthough I understand the general behaviour of this code, what does  do exactly? Precisely, what is the role of the second parameter here? I couldn't find any example with multiple parameters on .Edit: I'm working with Python 2.7
Return zero-based index in the list of the first item whose value is x. Raises a ValueError if there is no such item.The optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in the slice notation and are used to limit the search to a particular subsequence of the list. The returned index is computed relative to the beginning of the full sequence rather than the start argument.Visit this documentation link for more info36
As can be found in the documentation for Python 3.6, the second parameter is used to indicate a starting index.The example used in the documentation shows the difference between using the second parameter and omitting it:A third parameter is also available, indicating an end index.
The second parameter limits the search to items at or after that position in the given list. There is also a 3rd parameter to avoid searching the list until it's end.From: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#common-sequence-operations
