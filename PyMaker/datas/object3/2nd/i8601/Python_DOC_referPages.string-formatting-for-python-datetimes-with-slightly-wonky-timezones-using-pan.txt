From the Pandas docs I was driven to the relevant Python datetime formatting docs which suggested that I should use a formatting string similar to .I used the formatting string as follows...This solution returned a the Dataframe but failed to parse the requested columns. I think this is because the timezone component of my data has an unexpected colon! For the example that I given the timezone is  and the  formatting string expects .Any thoughts on how to approach this?
You can cook up a function to convert your date string format.  Then it can be applied to the column to convert to datetimes.  This function can return timezone aware or naive timestamps.Code:Test Code:Test Results:Use :If you have access to  you can use their parsing code.  This is a replacement for the  above and it handles your date format just fine.You can also use the  naked in  as:I am not a huge fan of this style because it applies a fixed offset timezone, which means that it is not daylight savings aware.  I personally prefer either daylight savings aware or simply UTC.
