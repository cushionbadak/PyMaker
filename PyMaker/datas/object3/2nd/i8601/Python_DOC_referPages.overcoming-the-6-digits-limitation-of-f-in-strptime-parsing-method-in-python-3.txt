Seems like the strptime function of the datetime class is limited to 6 digits when it comes parsing fractional seconds with %f (https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior)Just wondering if there is a "decent" workaround other than writing myself regular expressions all the way just in order to achieve pretty much the same thing that is already implemented for one more  additional digit.Same has already been reported here: https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/issues/1610
If you have a fixed input format, you could just cut off the remaining bits:
