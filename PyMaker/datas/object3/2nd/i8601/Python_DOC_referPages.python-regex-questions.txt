Natural Text
I have a regular expression that gets some numbers after some textThe output I get is correct.  The string I am reading has something like I capture the , but when I output to the screen I get the following:Is there anyway to remove "['" and "']" from my output.  Thanks for any guidance.
 keeps reapplying  though the string and returns a list of the matches found. To get one, do the search yourself. Notice the case where nothing was matched.In your file example, if the file is large you may benefit from checking it line by line so that you don't put all of it in memory at once. We can use  to drop lines until the regex matches and using the first match object that comes back.
