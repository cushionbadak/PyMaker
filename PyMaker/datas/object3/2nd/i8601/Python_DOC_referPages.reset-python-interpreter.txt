Lots of things could be happening here, and you haven't provided much information about your setup, so all I can do is guess.The easiest answer in any situation like this is always the same:undo whatever changes you made;restore the configs that used to work.If you don't have backups, compare what you have now to some other machine (or login) that does work.Assuming you've tried all that...Arrow keys, command-completion, and history are typically provided by GNU Readline (but hardly always --- I gather Macs use something else, and I don't know if Windows can provide any of those features at all).Python configsSince Python 3.4, history in interactive mode was enabled by default:29.13.1. Readline configurationChanged in version 3.4:  Activation of  and history was made automatic.Make sure you haven't disabled that automatic history by aliasing Python to  or anything similar.Before that, a script would be named in the  environment variable, and that script would be executed by the interactive Python session before presenting the  prompt.The Python 3.3  docs gave an example:GNU Readline configsIt's possible GNU Readline is not enabled or is set to something bizarre.Like Python's, the GNU Readline config file is named by an environment variable, in this case .If that variable is not set, the default config file is  or, if that doesn't exist, .(Different Unix-like distributions could have changed those defaults.)The Readline history bindable commands you'd want to look for are  and .But if those are wrong, you'd probably notice it in more than just Python.Other optionsThe only other likely culprit is your window manager.I can't help there.Window managers are more likely to screw up help with things like , , and  than arrow keys, anyway.Anything more in-depth than the above is highly unlikely to be the cause.If you'd been fiddling with  or  (or any of the many other layers between a keystroke and its result inside a GUI terminal), you'd remember it.Again, the easiest solution is to identify and undo the changes you made, even if that means creating a new login so you have a blank slate to compare.
