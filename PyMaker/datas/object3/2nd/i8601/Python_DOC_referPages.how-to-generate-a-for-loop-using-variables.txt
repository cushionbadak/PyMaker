I started learning python recently and I want to become more knowledgable and flexible with using loops.My question is, let's say I created a list of names:and now I want to use either a  loop or a  loop (I don't know which one is the best, but from my novice experience, I feel a  loop would work better but I can't find a solution) to generate random number and make my loop generate that amount of names.This was my code but it doesn't work.and I only get one random name. What is missing/mistake here?Thanks in advance!
In your for loop you are replacing the variable  everytime the loops iterate. Instead maybe put them into a list. Note  will give you duplicate values if that's what you wish for. Now you will have a list of namesAlso you don't need a for loop to do what you want, you could use a list comprehension:Heck if you don't want to have duplicate values in new list, you can use sample which takes a collection to choose from and how many you want in the new list.
you are looking for :where the  parameter is the number of elements you want so select. will always select one single element only.
You are assigning always to the same variable so every time you iterate you overwrite the same variable and the result is the string from the last iteration. To acheive what you want you have to add the random name string to some kind of list or array inside the for loop
You are assigning the value to variable in loop "n" times and so when you print, the last assigned value is returned.What you need to do is store those random names something like this : For input as 3, this resulted in something like this :To get only the unique names inside the list, you can do something like this :This will result in something like this for 10 as input : 
I would use random libthen I would do dandom.randint(x,y) This way you wold return a random number from x to y. Then you could access your name list usingname_list[random.randint(0,len(name_list)] right, you have a random name, now you need to save the value in another listby doing variable=name_list[random...you can write the name in the var, but everytime you do it you wolud be overwritingso...v=[]v.append(name_list[random.randint(0,len(name_list)] right? any doubts feel free to ask
You need to put the print statement inside the for loop, so it prints every iterations
