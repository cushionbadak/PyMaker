On the server side I need it to take this data in and go through the array of objects and set a timer to have the same amount of duration as the “duration” property. I have an example script in Python to illustrate what I mean.When I execute this script I get timeout issues, but what I need the server to do is just send a response that it has received the request and is executing the script with desired JSON Object? I need this to go throughout the day is Im simply saying that this array could contain 100 elements with each at least 2 a min delay in between. would Heroku support this need or should I just build a server on Azure?
Heroku terminates requests after 30 seconds. But you can run a background task that updates a data store, then just check the data store on page load.Here's a minimal example for local testing using threading, dataset and sqlite. On heroku you'll have to replace the sqlite reference with a cloud data store like this postgres service. And straight-up SQLAlchemy is usually preferred over dataset.Visit 127.0.0.1:5000/tom and while  is running you get:Reloading after the  is finished you see:
