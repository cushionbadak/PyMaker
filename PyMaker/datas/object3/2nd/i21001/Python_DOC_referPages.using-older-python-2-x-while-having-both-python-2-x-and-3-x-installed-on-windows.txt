I'm new to python. I've installed both Python 3.2.2 for x64 and Python 2.7 for x86 on my 64-bit windows machine. I've got some python code that are coded for python 2.x versions. But every time I try to run them by double clicking it is interpreted by python 3.x.How do I force them to use python version 2.7, may be using some directives or using a BATCH script?
Going forward, the solution is to upgrade Python 3.2 to 3.3 or later and use the Python Launcher for Windows.At the top of each Python 3 program, include the following line:At the top of each Python 2 program, include the following line:The  part, called a shebang, indicates to Python Launcher which version of Python is desired. (It also indicates to UNIX that a program should be run with a particular interpreter instead of the shell.) The  part helps locate the Python interpreter on your  when you run a program on UNIX. If you don't plan on using anything but Windows, you can leave it out:
You could, e.g., associate the file extension  with Python 2.7 and rename the main file (assuming you regard Python 3.2 as your default version).
open a command line window, and use  (or whatever path your python 2.7 appears to be installed in).of course, you can put that line into a batch file and execute the batch.also, you can put a shortcut to  on your desktop and drop your script onto that shortcut every time you want to run it.
try editing  environment variable, use python 2.7 path and delete python 3.2.2
