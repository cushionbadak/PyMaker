I want to add a list of dicts together with python multiprocessing module.Here is a simplified version of my code:I get this error when running this script. How shall I resolve this? is the  in  function needed in this condition? or python will take care of it?I think what's  supposed to do is to map something from one list to another list, not dump all things in one list to a single object. So is there a more elegant way to do such things? 
The following should run cross-platform (i.e. on Windows, too) in both Python 2 and 3. It uses a process pool initializer to set the manager dict as a global in each child process. FYI:Using a lock is unnecessary with a manager dict. The number of processes in a  defaults to the CPU count. If you're not interested in the result, you can use  instead of .
