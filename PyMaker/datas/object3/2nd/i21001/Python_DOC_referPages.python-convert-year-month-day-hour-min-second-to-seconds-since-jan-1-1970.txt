I know how to do it in C and Java, but I don't know a quick way of converting year/month/day/hour/min/second to the # of seconds since the Jan 1 1970 epoch.Can someone help me?So far I've figured out how to create a  object but I can't seem to get the elapsed # seconds since the epoch.(edit: my question is the inverse of this other one: Python: Seconds since epoch to relative date)
Use  or  method to get time tuple and convert it to timestamp using There is a nice bug related to it http://bugs.python.org/issue2736, this is interesting read and anybody trying to convert to timestamp should read this. According to that thread correct way is
You can use  as a reference and get the total amount of seconds from a  object as follows:

These lines can return a float number representing seconds since epoch.
To convert a datetime object (broken-downtime time: year/month/day/hour/min/second) to  seconds since the Epoch (POSIX time):Note: POSIX Epoch is "00:00:00 GMT, January 1, 1970".If  has no timezone info then  method uses a local timezone.   method is introduced in Python 3.3; for code that works on older Python versions, see Converting datetime.date to UTC timestamp in Python.
