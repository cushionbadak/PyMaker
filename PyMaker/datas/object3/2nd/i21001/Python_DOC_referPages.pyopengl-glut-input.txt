After the window containing GLUT graphics appears, I would like to enter input in the terminal:Ideally I would like to integrate python cmd with GLUT's glutKeyboardFunc. My attempts failed (allows one or the other at once, not both. Also problems with whether the window or terminal had focus).Here is some example code, which displays a spinning teapot. Currently, pressing 'm' will invoke meteory goodness (stub), but being able to enter e.g. "meteor 500" would be preferable.I can collect characters into a global string using glutKeyboardFunc, giving the same functional effect, however the user would be typing blind. "print somestring," allows printing on the same line, however the comma means the output does not get displayed whilst typing. Also "print '\b'" (backspace) doesn't work universally...basically I don't want to have:to type out one commandRestriction of using:pyopenglGLUT(Though other answers are welcome for wayward future-people looking to solve a different problem)
And add a new class variable 'keyCache'.Then just use normal print flushing to write data to the same line.  The only hacky bit is that you have to write several blank spaces after the cached keystrokes, otherwise when you use backspace the deleted elements will still be on the screen.Another alternative would be a parallel keyboard thread just to handle keystrokes from the command line.  The big problem there is that glut doesn't provide a nice call back for when the window closes so you'd have to figure out an alternative way to kill your thread.
you should use the cmd [0] framework to build your interpreter, and launch cmd.cmdloop in a separate thread.0. http://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html
