I have a sample string I only want the value  and NOT  (which is inside another )How could I do it in easiest possible way in Python?Maybe by using RegEx (which I am not good at)?
How about:For me this prints:Note that the call to  finds the first match to the regular expression, so it doesn't find the  unless you repeat the search a second time.Edit: The regular expression here is a python raw string literal, which basically means the backslashes are not treated as special characters and are passed through to the  method unchanged. The parts of the regular expression are: matches a literal  character begins a new group is a character set matching any letter (capital or lower case), digit or underscore matches the preceding element (the character set) one or more times. ends the group matches a literal  characterEdit: As D K has pointed out, the regular expression could be simplified to:since the  is a special sequence which means the same thing as  depending on the  and  settings.
This should do the job:
You could use  to do this.Then we have:
courtesy: Regular expression to return text between parenthesis
You can also useif there are many occurrences that you would like to find. See also for more info:How can I find all matches to a regular expression in Python?
