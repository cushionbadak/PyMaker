I want to implement a HashMap in Python.  I want to ask a user for an input. depending on his input I am retrieving some information from the HashMap. If the user enters a key of the HashMap,  I would like to retrieve the corresponding value.How do I implement this functionality in Python?
Python dictionary is a built-in type that supports key-value pairs.as well as using the dict keyword:or:
All you wanted (at the time the question was originally asked) was a hint. Here's a hint: In Python, you can use dictionaries.
It's built-in for Python. See dictionaries.Based on your example:You could then access it like so:Also worth mentioning: it can use any non-mutable data type as a key. That is, it can use a tuple, boolean, or string as a key.
And to retrieve values:OrThat's using number as keys, put quotes around the numbers to use strings as keys.
Hash maps are built-in in Python, they're called dictionaries:Usage:See the documentation for more information, e.g. built-in methods and so on. They're great, and very common in Python programs (unsurprisingly).
Here is the implementation of the Hash Map using pythonFor the simplicity hash map is of a fixed size 16.This can be changed easily.Rehashing is out of scope of this code.Output:

Python Counter is also a good option in this case:This returns a dict with the count of each element in the list:
