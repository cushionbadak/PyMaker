Many times I will use the Python interpreter to inspect variables and step through commands before I actually write to a file. However by the end I have around 30 commands in the interpreter, and have to copy/paste them into a file to run. Is there a way I can export/write the Python interpreter history into a file?For exampleAnd then I can open the  file and read:
IPython is extremely useful if you like using interactive sessions. For example for your usecase there is the save command, you just input save my_useful_session 10-20 23 to save input lines 10 to 20 and 23 to my_useful_session.py. (to help with this, every line is prefixed by its number)Look at the videos on the documentation page to get a quick overview of the features.::OR::There is a way to do it. Store the file in ~/.pystartupYou can also add this to get autocomplete for free:Please note that this will only work on *nix systems. As readline is only available in Unix platform.
If you are using Linux/Mac and have readline library, you could add the following to a file and export it in your  and you will have both completion and history.Export command:This will save your python console history at ~/.pythonhistory
The following is not my own work, but frankly I don't remember where I first got it... However: place the following file (on a GNU/Linux system) in your home folder (the name of the file should be ):You will then get all the goodies that come with bash shell (up and down arrows navigating the history, ctrl-r for reverse search, etc....).Your complete command history will be stored in a file located at: .I'm using this from ages and I never got a problem.HTH!
Python on Linux should have history support via readline library, see http://docs.python.org/tutorial/interactive.html
Much has changed over the last 8 years since this question was asked.It appears that since Python 3.4, history is automatically written to  as a plain text file.If you want to disable that or learn more, check outHow can I disable the new history feature in Python 3.4? - Unix & Linux Stack ExchangeReadline configuration - Site-specific configuration hook â€” Python 3.7.2 documentationAnd, of course, as noted by many others, IPython has great features for saving, searching and manipulating history.

In ipython shell:The command will print all the commands you have entered in the current python shell.The command will print all the commands logged in python shell upto some significant number of lines.Will write the logged commands along with the line number. you can remove the fixed width line numbers for the commands of interest using gvim.
