Well, the headline seems to me sufficient.I use some function that at some points print something in the console.As I can't modify them, I would like to know if there is a solution to not printing while using these functions.Thanks a lot !Nico
Yes, you can redirect :Just replace  with your actual function.EDIT: Now should work on windows aswell and makes use of  instead of a backup variable.
Constantinius' answer answer is ok, however there is no need to actually open null device. And BTW, if you want portable null device, there is . Actually, all you need is a class which will ignore whatever you write to it. So more portable version would be:.
Constantinius' solution will work on *nix, but this should work on any platform:
You could use a modified version of this answer to create a "null" output context to wrap the call the function in.That can be done by just passing  as the  argument to the  context manager function when it's used.
Another open would be to wrap your function in a decorator.
