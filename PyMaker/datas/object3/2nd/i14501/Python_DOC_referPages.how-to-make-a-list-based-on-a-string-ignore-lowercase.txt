Using these, I want to make a list:My main goal is to create a list of numbers starting from an integer  ( for example) corresponding to the letters in the string by ignoring the lowercase letters.Is there any solutions to do this with python? I will apply the solution to a large file consisting of lots of fields and rows.
You can use the  function to create a counter, the second argument is the starting value, letting you set it to  if you need that as a starting point.To test if a string is uppercase, use the  method.Combined together in a list comprehension with filter gives you:This numbers all characters in  starting at , but only includes those numbers in the output list where the character is uppercase; the numbers are converted to strings:
Martijn's answer indeed the best. I have tried to make use of  and  functions1. Do note that this is terribly slow compared to the List comprehension. Another  expression as Pochmann has mentioned below is . The difference between the two s is negligible. 1Any list comp can have an alternative using these functions
