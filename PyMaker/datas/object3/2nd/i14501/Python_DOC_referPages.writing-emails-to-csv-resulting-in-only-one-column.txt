I have this script I'm using that I got online and modified a bit. Basically what I want is to scrape all the emails in my inbox and save them to a CSV with Email, First Name, Last Name format. So far it is saving all that info into one column of CSV instead of three..Which prints out in such format:But in CSV it prints all that info into one column like this:But I need 3 columns instead..tried doing out.write(c.split(" ")) but that results in an error.
Is  what you're looking for?Although taking a look at the CSV module might be fun for you.
