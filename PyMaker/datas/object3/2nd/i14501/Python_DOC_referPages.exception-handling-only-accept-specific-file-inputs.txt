Natural Text
This is a bit above my pay grade, so I thought I would ask on here. My simple Python code prompts the user to enter the name of a file. However, it must be a specific type of file, or else I would like to throw an error. In this case, the files entered must be a text or CSV file, i.e. filename extensions must be  or I have no idea how to test for that. You begin with something likeand then use an if statement check whether the last four characters are  or . What is the standard way to do this?
If you want to keep asking until the user enters a filename with the correct extension using str.endswith:If you actually want to just verify the input and raise an error on bad input:You don't need a try/except to check the last four  characters are either  or  but just because the filename may end with the correct extension does not mean it is a valid file or won't cause an error when opening, you should worry about catching exceptions when and if you actually open the file.
Python has great resources for doing all sorts of path manipulations. This is a good time to go ahead and get familiar with them. See the documentation for os.path and specifically, for  which returns a pair (root, ext) so you can test the ext (extension) value.
