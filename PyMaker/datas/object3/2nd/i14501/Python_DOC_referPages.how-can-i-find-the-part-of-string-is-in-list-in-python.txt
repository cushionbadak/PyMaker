Let's say I have the following list From this I want to search  I have to use the following code But I want to search the string which contains  what do I have to do? I can use  loop and  statement combined. But is there any other way to do this process? 
You can use  + :Slightly more pythonic:A slightly more optimized version using a generator (if the first element is "apple", it won't check the rest of the lst):
Is more or less readable but does the same thing.you could even make it a one liner,
If you're just looking for something more concise, the exact same logic can be written with a comprehension (in this case, a generator expression)and the  function:If it isn't obvious why this does almost the same thing as your existing code:If you expand the comprehension to an explicit  statement, it looks like this:Then, the  function iterates over each thing that got ed until one of them is true, or until it gets to the end and they were all false.So, the only difference is that instead of printing  once for each time something was found, it just prints it once and then stops looking.If you want something more efficient, you'd need to change your data structure. But I doubt that's an issue when you've only got 4 things in .
