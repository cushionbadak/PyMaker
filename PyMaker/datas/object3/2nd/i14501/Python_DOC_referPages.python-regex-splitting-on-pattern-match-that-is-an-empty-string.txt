With the  module, it seems that I am unable to split on pattern matches that are empty strings:In other words, even if a match is found, if it's the empty string, even  cannot split the string.The docs for  seem to support my results.A "workaround" was easy enough to find for this particular case:But this is an error-prone way of doing it because then I have to beware of strings that already contain the substring that I'm splitting on:Is there any better way to split on an empty pattern match with the  module? Additionally, why does  not allow me to do this in the first place? I know it's possible with other split algorithms that work with regex; for example, I am able to do this with JavaScript's built-in .
It is unfortunate that the  requires a non-zero-width match, but it hasn't been to fixed yet, since quite a lot incorrect code depends on the current behaviour by using for example as the regex. Use of such patterns will now generate a  and those that never can split anything, throw a  from Python 3.5 onwards:The idea is that after a certain period of warnings, the behaviour can be changed so that your regular expression would work again.If you can't use the  module, you can write your own split function using :If you are sure that the matches are zero-width only, you can use the starts of the splits for easier code:
You can use  module here for this.orUse  .See demo
