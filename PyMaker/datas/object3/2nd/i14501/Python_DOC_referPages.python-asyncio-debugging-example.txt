I would like to enable Asyncio's un-yielded coroutine detection, but have not succeeded.This simple code implements the recommendations on:https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-dev.html#asyncio-loggerbut does not actually catch the un-yielded 'dummy' coroutine.I expected that the program would end with a warning about the coroutine 'dummy', created but not yielded from.Actually, results are:No hint of an abandoned coroutine.  What am I missing?
 performs check for  on module importing.Thus you need setup environment variable before very first asyncio import:
