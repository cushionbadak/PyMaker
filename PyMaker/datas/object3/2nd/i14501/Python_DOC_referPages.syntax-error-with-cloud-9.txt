I'm new to Cloud 9, and have made a script. I want the code to appear at the url https://python-william1835.c9.io and I receive the following message:when I run it. So I put it in the script (along with  of course). And when I run it again, it says:                                                              Can you tell me why it does this?
You get a  because the literal  is syntactically invalid. The message you're receiving is a bit misleading in this specific case. Additionally, the documentation page for  is unfortunately not as verbose as one would want.But, if you look at the source code for  you'll see that all arguments must be of type :Changing your calls to:Should work and you should have no problem using them.
