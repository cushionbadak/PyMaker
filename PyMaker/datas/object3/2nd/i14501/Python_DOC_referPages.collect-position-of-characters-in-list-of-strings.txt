If I have a list of strings and I want to gather the position of each character in the string, what would be the best way? For example, if I had a list:and I wanted to create something like:Is there a simple way? I'm creating multitudes of  loops and it seems convoluted.
You can use  from *:This creates an iterator of tuples of the characters at each position:Then uses  and  to convert the tuples back into strings. If the  syntax is unfamiliar, see What does ** (double star) and * (star) do for parameters?* If using Python 3.x, note that this function has been renamed to , as  now takes the iterator behaviour and  no longer exists - see e.g. What's New in Python 3.0.
