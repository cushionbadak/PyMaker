How to find native byteorder size value using python.https://docs.python.org/2/library/struct.html#byte-order-size-and-alignment
You obviously already know how to get the native byteorder, with .I suspect you're asking how to also get the native "64-bitness".As the  module docs explain, you can't use any of the information built into Python at compile time to determine this,* so you should use this runtime value:* The problem is "fat binaries" that can run as both 32-bit and 64-bit based on a command-line switch or similar. Whichever answer is compiled in will be wrong if you use the other switch.
