I have a list of objects(rectangles). Each object has 2 attributes(height and width). I would like to get all 'orientations'(not sure how to call it exactly) of this list, so all the 2^n(for a list of n rectangles) orientations in which height and width of the rectangles are (possibly) swapped. For a list of 3 objects this would look like this(the order is not important):My rectangle-class looks like this:Is there an easy way to do this?
Preparation:Solution:Output:
Here's some Python code that does what you want. It should easily run on Python 3 if you fix the print statement in the  function.output
