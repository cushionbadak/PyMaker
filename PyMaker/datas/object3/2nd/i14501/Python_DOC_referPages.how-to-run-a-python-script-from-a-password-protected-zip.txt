I know python modules/scripts can be run from within a zip archive, as outlined here: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0441/andhttps://blogs.gnome.org/jamesh/2012/05/21/python-zip-files/But my question is:Is it possible to password protect this archive or .pyz file and run it with another small python script that will send the password and then run the  ?Thanks!
I needed something like this for myself, so I made it. You need the module found here: https://github.com/Dakkaron/ArchiveImporterThen you can just use it like this:Works for both Python2 and Python3.The module can also be used from code:
The code that manages the import is inside the  module.Reading the archive is done in the function It supposes that the file is unencrypted by decompressing it (see here).So no, unfortunately it does not seem possible to use encrypted file directly from the command line. However you can imagine a wrapper that do this by using importlib (an example).
