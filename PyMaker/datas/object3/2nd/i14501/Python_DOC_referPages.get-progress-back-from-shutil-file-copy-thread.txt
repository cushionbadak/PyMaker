I've got an application from which a file is copied from  to :I wish to have the application query the progress of the copy every 5 seconds without locking up the application itself. Is this possible?My intention is to set this progress to a  to give the user feedback on the file copy.Can this be achieved when copying using a threaded shutil file copy?
 doesn't offer any options to track the progress, no. At most you could monitor the size of the destination file (using  functions on the target filename).The alternative would be to implement your own copy function. The implementation is really quite simple;  is basically a  plus  call;  in turn delegates the real work to  (links to the Python source code).Implementing your own  to include progress should be trivial; inject support for a callback function to report inform your program each time another block has copied:and compare the  size with the file size.
I combined Martijn Pieters answer with some progress bar code from this answer with modifications to work in PyCharm from this answer which gives me the following.  The function  was my goal.
No, it can't be done this way, because  doesn't have any means of providing progress.But you can write your own copy function (or even fork the code from --notice that it's one of the modules that includes a link to the source at the top, meaning it's meant to be as useful for sample code as for just using as-is). Your function can, e.g., take a progress callback function as an extra argument and calls it after each buffer (or each N buffers, or each N bytes, or each N seconds). Something like:Now, that callback is still going to be called in the background thread, not the main thread. With most GUI frameworks, that means it can't directly touch any GUI widgets. But most GUI frameworks have a way to post a message to the main thread's event loop from a background thread, so just make the callback do that. With Qt you do this with signals and slots, exactly the same way you do within the main thread; there's lots of great tutorials out there if you don't know how.Alternatively, you could do it the way you suggested: have the main thread signal the background thread (e.g., by posting on a  or triggering an  or ) and have your  function check for that signal every time through the loop and respond. But that seems both more complicated and less responsive.One more thing: Qt has its own threading library, and you may want to use it instead of Python's native one, because you can attach a slot directly to  object and make that your callback. I'm not sure, but Qt might even have its own file-copy-with-progress methods in there somewhere; they try to wrap up everything that might be at all different between platforms and vaguely related to GUIs.
In addition to Martijn Pieters excellent reply, if (like me, I'm an idiot) you need to figure out how to pass the actual callback into the  function, you can do it like this:
This might be a bit hacky but it works:
