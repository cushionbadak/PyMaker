I would like to know if there is a more efficient way to reference every index of every item/key in a list/dictionary. Here's a bigger sample dictionary.The indices 'i_all' are analogous to a hypothetical string 'atgccttcgcccctttct', joining the sorted 'raw_dict' keysI want to use an index of all characters to make substrings with variable lengths and variable start indices for keys in 'raw_dict'. However, I can't actually join all keys as a string since that may generate substrings which don't exist. 
I’m not sure what you are trying to do (e.g. it’s strange that you are never actually using the values of the initial dictionary), but here is how to produce a similar list using list comprehensions:If you actually want to get a dict, as in your example, then:(And I used a dict comprehension here.)
