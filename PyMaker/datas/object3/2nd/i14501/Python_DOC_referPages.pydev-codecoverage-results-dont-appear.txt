I have set up the codecoverage to run with pydev, but the results don't appear.Following this answer I found the .coverage file at ~/.metadata/.plugins/org.python.pydev.debug/coverage, and that works properly (gives the result when running coverage report there, gets empty when I do it from pydev, etc).Does somebody know where can I configure the path to get the results to the Eclipse plugin?
I just had the same problem and the solution was to install coverage from 3.x branch (i.e. ). There's a hint on PyDev coverage documentation page:... the integration is tested with version 3.4, so, this is the recommended version.Coverage v4 has default report file name and its format changed. Older file name was  and it contained binary 'ed output (according to this answer). Newer is in  and it contains JSON string prefixed with !coverage.py: This is a private format, don't read it directly! ;-)
