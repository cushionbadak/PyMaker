I am attempting to use  but it is not working for me:I am trying to check if all the names begin with , and even though I added  to ,  still returns . How do I fix this so that  returns  until  is removed?
You misunderstand how  works.  From the docs:Return  if all elements of the  are true (or if the   is empty).In your code, you are first collecting all names that start with  into a list and then passing this list to .  Doing this will always return  because non-empty strings evaluate to .Instead, you should write:This will pass an iterable of booleans to .  If all of them are , the function will return ; otherwise, it will return .As an added bonus, the result will now be computed lazily because we used a generator expression instead of a list comprehension.  With the list comprehension, the code needed to test all strings before determining a result.  The new code however will only check as many as necessary.

The reason why you were getting wrong result was because you are already creating a new list using list comprehension by applying the desired condition, So if we do a little breakdown then:So the correct way may be:
