From the ctypes documentation of python 2.x, we have:And from the ctypes documentation of python 3.x, we have:So in one case the argtypes for  requires a  as input, while in the second case it requires . How should I write my function to handle both python 2.x and python 3.x ?Typical scenario is:
Those types are equivalent. In C strings are arrays or pointers to the char type (each char represented by one byte). In python 3 the closest data type is . Strings in python 3 are encoded using UTF-8, so each char is not guaranteed to be exactly one byte. Whereas, in python 2 strings are typically encoded using Latin-1 (depends on your locale I believe) -- one char, one byte.To write code that works regardless of interpreter version you should just write . This creates a  object in python 2 and a  object in python 3. Conversely to guarantee a unicode string use . This creates a  object in python 2 and a  object in python 3.
