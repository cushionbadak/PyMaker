I have an enum in Python (backported  package to 2.7) that is meant to be of only integers:Let's say I receive a  in a C extension pointing to . I want the integer value associated with the . How do I get it most succinctly?
Looking at the source to the  backport, just like the  module in 3.4+, it's pure Python, and does nothing to expose a custom C API.So, you just use  and friends to access class attributes. In particular, if you have a , you need to get its  attribute, which will be an , which you can then .This is the same way things work in Python. If you try to use  where an  is expected, you should get a ; if you try to explicitly call , you will definitely get a . So, although I haven't tested it,  directly on the constant instead of its  should raise a  and return -1.If you want enumeration constants that act like subtypes of , then, as the  docs explain, you want . Usually, that isn't really what you want (as the docs explain), but if it is, of course it works. And you should be able to  and  an  value (although, again, I haven't tested).
