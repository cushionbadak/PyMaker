I am brand new to Python and looking to read in a CSV file with the below listed contents:This CSV file will be thousands of lines long and I would like to output all fields to a new CSV file and change the  and  fields to a human readable format. Any advice would be appreciated. Please note in this example there are 5 columns with 3 rows, the first row being the column headers.So go easy on me as this is the first python script I have ever written. But any advice, comments, best practices would be appreciated. 
As mentioned in the first comment to your question, the csv module will take care of the basic reading and writing of CSV files. Using the first example with your CSV file shows us that a  will convert each line from the file into a List of StringsSimilarly, a  will take a List of values and write it to a line in the output file.Easy.So, the really interesting parts of your question are:I) Fixing the first line (column headers)Notice that most of the column names in the first list have a leading space. We want to get rid of those because they could be problematic. If you have worked with other languages you might think about using a loop, e.g.However, in Python the preferred form is to use "List comprehension", II) Getting  into "a human readable format".It already is, really, but some dashes and colons will get it into ISO 8601 date format, so let's use the  method of a string object like thisto convert  from this ...... to this:III) Getting  into "a human readable format".I see from your updated question that these numbers are 18-digit Active Directory timestamps (in scientific notation) so you're absolutely right that we can use  to convert themwill convert  from this ...... to this:
