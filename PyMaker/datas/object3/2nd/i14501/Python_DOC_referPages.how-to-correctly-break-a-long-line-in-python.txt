Natural Text
How would I go about breaking the following line? The PEP8 guideline doesn't make it very clear to me.
One would typically do something like:This takes advantage of the fact that adjacent strings () are concatenated to shorten the long line of text; everything else is split on commas.
Or also:
There's not much point in using a dictionary literal as the right-hand argument of the . It takes up a lot of space without really enhancing the readability of your code.The  function is useful here:If you can, switch to using the  method:
The way you'd probably see this broken up the most often is using implicit line joining, similar to this:Implicit line joining means that:Expressions in parentheses, square brackets or curly braces can be split  over more than one physical line without using backslashes.The problem with explicit joining using the  character is that an extra character (like a space) at the end of the physical line after the  will cause an error, like so:This doesn't happen with implicit joining:
