Natural Text
Here is my code. I'm not exactly sure if I need a counter for this to work. The answer should be .
Correcting your codeThe line  is wrong. It has to be . This is because you need to check if that particular character is present in the list of vowels. Apart from that you need to  (in python3) to print the output as  all in one line.The final program will be likeAnd the output will beOther ways includeUsing  a stringAs simple as it looks, the statement  checks if  is present in the string . A list comprehensionThis list comprehension will return a list that will contain the characters only if the character is in  A generator expressionThis gen exp will return a generator than will return the characters only if the character is in Regular ExpressionsYou can use  to discover only the vowels in your string. The codewill return a list of vowels found in the string i.e. . So now we can use  and then use  and For this technique you will need to store a map which matches each of the non vowels to a  type. For this you can use . The code to make the map is this will return the mapping. Do store it in a variable (here  for map)This will remove all the non  characters from the string. Using You can use  along with . But remember to  first! and now use . Using As mentioned by J.F.Sebastian in the comments below, you can create a bytearray of lower case consonants by usingUsing this we can translate the word ,which will return . This can easily be converted to  by using  i.e. . Using  returns an bytes object and is the immutable version of . (It is Python 3 specific)Using this we can translate the word ,which will return . This can easily be converted to  by using  i.e. . Timing comparisonPython 3The timings in sorted orderAs you can see the final method using  is the fastest. Python 3.5The timings in sorted order
You can try pythonic way like this,Function;
 tests for equality. You are looking to see if any of the characters exist in the string that are in your list 'vowels'. To do that, you can simply use  such as below.Additionally, I see you have a 'vowels_found' variable but are not utilizing it. Below one example how you can solve this:Your output would then be:
