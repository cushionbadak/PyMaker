I am trying to install Beautiful Soup 4 in Python 3.4. I installed it from the command line, (got the invalid syntax error because I had not converted it), ran the  conversion script to  and now I get a new invalid syntax error.Any ideas?
BeautifulSoup 4 does not need manual converting to run on Python 3. You are trying to run code only compatible with Python 2 instead; it appears you failed to correctly convert the codebase.From the BeautifulSoup 4 homepage:Beautiful Soup 4 works on both Python 2 (2.6+) and Python 3.The line now throwing the exception should read:The codebase does use Python 2 syntax, but the  installer converts this for you to compatible Python 3 syntax. Make sure to install the project with :or using the  version bundled with Python 3.4:or using :If you downloaded just the tarball, at the very least runto have the installer correctly convert the codebase for you; the converted code is copied into your Python setup. You can discard the downloaded source directory after running the command, see How installation works.Alternatively, run:and copy across the  directory. Again, do not use the original source directory as it is left untouched.
