I have a file that looks like this:Output file should look like:My code is quite complicated. It works, but it's very inefficient. Can this be done more efficiently:main part of the code:My function findv(var) is called each time a line in input file starts with varx and then searches through the file multiple times until it finds fields that correspond to varx_val1 and varx_val2. EDIT: I need to preserve the order of the input file, so var1 has to appear first in the output file, then var2, then var3 etc.
Use a dictionary, with the keys being your labels and a list to store your values.  This way, you only have to loop over your file once.Here is a version that includes the below comments:
I have written a python program that iterates over the file only once, reads all the important data into a dict, and then writes the dict into the output file.Update: modified according to comments
