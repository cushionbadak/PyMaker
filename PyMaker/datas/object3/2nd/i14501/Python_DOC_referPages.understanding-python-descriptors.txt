I am trying to understand descriptors better.I don't understand why in the foo method the descriptors  method doesn't get called.As far as I understand descriptors the  method always get called when I access the objects attribute via dot operator or when I use .According to the Python documentation:
 is an attribute on the instance, not on the class. The descriptor protocol only applies to attributes retrieved from a class.From the Descriptor HOWTO:For objects, the machinery is in  which transforms  into . and in the Implementing Descriptors section of the Python Data Model:The following methods only apply when an instance of the class containing the method (a so-called descriptor class) appears in an owner class (the descriptor must be in either the ownerâ€™s class dictionary or in the class dictionary for one of its parents). Your  cannot be found in the class dict;  does not exist; it is found in  instead. Here  is the instance and the owner class is , and  does not appear in the owner class dictionary.
