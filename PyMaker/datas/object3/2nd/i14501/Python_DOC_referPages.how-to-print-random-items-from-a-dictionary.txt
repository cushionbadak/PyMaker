Natural Text
everyone. I'm trying to complete a basic assignment. The program should allow a user to type in a phrase. If the phrase contains the word "happy" or "sad", that word should then be randomly replaced by a synonym (stored in a dictionary). The new phrase should then be printed out. What am I doing wrong? Every time I try to run it, the program crashes. This is the error I get: Here is what I have so far:
The reason for your error is that  is a string, and strings are immutable. On top of that, strings are sequences, not mappings; you can index them or slice them (e.g., ), but you can't use them like dictionaries.If you want to create a new string, replacing the substring  with another word, use the  method.And there's no reason to check first; if  isn't found,  wil do nothing.So:While we're at it, instead of explicitly looking up each key, you may want to loop over the dictionary and apply all the synonyms:Finally, notice that this code will replace all instances of  with the same replacement. Which I think your intended code was also trying to do. If you want to replace each of them with a separately randomly-chosen synonym, that's a bit more complicated. You could loop over  until it returns , but a neat trick might make it simpler:  the string around each instance of , substitute in a different synonym for each split part, then  them all back together. Like this:
Generate a random number from . Then, access that index of the list. To get the length of a list, just do .
