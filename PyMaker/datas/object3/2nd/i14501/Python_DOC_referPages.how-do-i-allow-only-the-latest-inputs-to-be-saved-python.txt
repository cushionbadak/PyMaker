Natural Text
How do I implement a simple code that will only save the student's latest 3 scores? If the test is repeated later, the old score should be replaced.Thank you.This is the code that asks the user the questions and saves the results in the txt. files.
A much better solution would be to store the data in a different format that made everything easy. For example, if you used a  database that mapped each username to a  of answers, the whole thing would be this simple:But if you can't change the data format, and you need to just append new lines to the end of a human-readable text file, then the only want to find out if there are already 3 answers is to read through every line in the file to see how many are already there. For example:And if there were 3 past answers, you have to rewrite the file, skipping line #i. This is the really fun part; text files aren't random-access-editable, so the best you can do is either read it all into memory and write it back out, or copy it all to a temporary file and move it over the original. Like this:That part is untested. And it requires Python 3.3+; if you have an earlier version and are on Mac or Linux you can just use  instead of , but if you're on Windows… you need to do some research, because it's ugly and no fun.And now, you can finally just append the new answer, as you're already doing.
