I'm having a problem with Travis on every commit. My tests work on local but on Travis I get this error:Here is the code where that line is:I have no idea about what is the problem because as I've said, all test are working in local. Here is my .travis.yml file:Any idea?
The  syntax in Python 3 is only supported in Python 3.3 and up.The  prefix is only there to support polyglot Python code (supporting both 2 and 3), and can be safely removed if you don't need to support Python 2.If you need to support both Python 2 and 3.2, you'll have to use a different approach. You could use a  import to make all string literals in Python 2 produce  string objects; this applies per module:The strings will be treated as Unicode in both Python 2 and 3.Or you could create your own polyglot function:and use that on all your Unicode strings:or you can use the  library to produce that bridge for you:You may want to read the Python Porting HOWTO.
