I'd like to pass some command line arguments to a python script run via  command, but importing the gdb module in python removes the argv attribute from sys. How do I access arg1 and arg2 within my python script shown in my example?Command line execution:a.py:Error raised:Versions:GNU gdb (GDB) 7.2Python 2.6.6Edit:The end target I'll be debugging is a C executable that is already running, so I'll be attaching to it later in the script, so  is not correct either since the  part prints a gdb error: ...
This is a possibility:argv.py:Invocation:Then you could wrap that in the following script:
It's not totally clear to me what you are trying to do.An invocation of the form:Tells gdb to use  as the program to be debugged, with  as the initial command-line arguments for the  command.  You can inspect these inside gdb with .So, your command is saying "I want to debug the  executable, passing it some arguments".However, later you say you plan to  to some already-running executable.So, I think you're probably trying to script gdb in Python -- not debug the  executable.The good news is, this is possible, just not the way you've written it.  Instead you have a couple choices:Make a  file holding your script and tell gdb to  it, e.g., with  (which you've already done...)Use  to invoke some Python explicitly, like .
