Let's say we have three lists:I would like to sort those lists in one  loop, so do something like:where  would be , then , then , so at the end my lists would be like this:Is there a way to do this?Note - this is just an example, the problem I'm dealing with is kinda harder, but I wanted to make a simple example of what I need.--edit--What if I would like to make some custom sorting here?I know that, for example, I can make custom sorting this way:    myList = sorted(myList, key= lambda val: val/2)but I'm using , not  here.Can I use custom sorting in ?Asking cause given answers (thx btw ;) ) are using ...
You're close. What you want is:The first problem in your code is that you were using  as the loop variable, but  inside the loop. Those aren't the same. So, whatever you had previously assigned to  earlier in the module or interactive session, you were just sorting that over and over again, without affecting , , and .The second problem is that the  method sorts the list in-place and returns , so you don't want to do anything with that return value. It's harmless to overwrite the  variable with , but it's certainly confusing to the reader, so don't do it.Since you've edited the question into something different:What if I would like to make some custom sorting here? I know that, for example, I can make custom sorting this way: myList = sorted(myList, key= lambda val: val/2) … Can I use custom sorting in sort?Look at the docs for  and . Both of them take a  argument, and both document it the same way. If you can't guess from that whether they actually work the same way, it would take a couple seconds to test it for yourself:
Don't name your variables with a number, or a letter. Put all lists in another list. Then you can operate on theses objects in for-loops:
On a side note, do not use the reserved word  when looping through them
