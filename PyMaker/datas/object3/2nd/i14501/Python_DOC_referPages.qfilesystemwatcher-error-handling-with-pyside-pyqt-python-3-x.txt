My program utilises Qt's  function to monitor a network directory (not on the local machine itself) for changes, and then run a script when a change is found. This function performs as required for the most part. The program is designed to run 24/7, which has raised some issues using this particular function.The error which is causing issues is as follows:The functionality I'd like to implement is as follows:Build in error handling surrounding network availability for If the network becomes unavailable and the error is raised, go to Run  for handling the unavailable networkGiven that the  function is established in the initialisation of the program, I'm not sure how to go about error handling. Here's the basic outline of my current code:Is there a way to explicitly establish error handling for the  error? Any input would be greatly appreciated!
As per ekhumoro's comments above, I've managed to solve this question using both the qInstallMsgHandler and sys.excepthook functions.My solution addresses Qt and Python/system-related errors separately, but handles them in the same way. The error is logged in a .log file, emailed to the system administrator and the software is restarted. Thanks for guiding me in the right direction ekhumoro!
