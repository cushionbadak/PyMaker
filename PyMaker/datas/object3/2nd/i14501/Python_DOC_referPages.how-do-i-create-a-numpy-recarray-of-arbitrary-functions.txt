I am creating a  as follows:How would I do this if instead of   and  referred to arbitrary functions?
The  dtype can contain any Python object, including functions.For example:The extra set of square brackets around the tuple of functions was added in order to force the array to be one-dimensional, which allows you to index the first row in order to access the functions it contains.It's a bit more awkward to access the functions if you allow the array to be 0-dimensional, but it's still possible, as user2357112 pointed out in the comments below:There were a couple of other syntax issues in your example that I've fixed here. Your  argument should contain a separate  tuple for each field, rather than a single long tuple.  is a method of an ndarray, not a standalone function.I do have to ask why you want to do this, though. A simple  seems like a much more appropriate data structure.
From the clarification in the comments, this doesn't sound like a job for a recarray. In Python 3, you'd want ; in Python 2, you could implement it yourself pretty easily:
