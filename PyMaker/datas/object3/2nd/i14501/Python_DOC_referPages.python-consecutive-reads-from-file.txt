I have a Python script that is reading from a file.The first command counts the lines. The second one prints the second line although the second one is not working.When I write it like this it works but I don't see why I would have to close the file and reopen it to get it to work. Is there some kind of functionality that I am misusing?
A file object is an iterator. Once you've gone through all the lines, the iterator is exhausted, and further reads will do nothing.To avoid closing and reopening the file, you can use  to rewind to the start:
What you are after is :Example: (based on your code)This will reset the file pointer back to it's starting position.: Change the stream position to the  given byte offset. offset is interpreted relative to the position  indicated by whence. Values for whence are:SEEK_SET or 0 – start of the stream (the default); offset should be  zero or positive SEEK_CUR or 1 – current stream position; offset may  be negative SEEK_END or 2 – end of the stream; offset is usually  negative Return the new absolute position.New in version 2.7: The SEEK_* constantsUpdate: A better way of counting the no. of lines in a file iteratively and only caring about the 2nd line:
Since xreadlines() keeps a pointer to the last line it sent you, when you do it basically remembers the index of the last line it gave you.when you close the file and then open it, it create a new iterator, and it again points to line 0.
