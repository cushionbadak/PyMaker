I have the fallowing problem, Im supposed to get user input in the form of  (hh:mm:ss) or (mm:ss) or (ss). Now i need check the fallowing parameters: If I'm getting only seconds then there is no limit.If I'm getting  then the seconds are limited to 0..59 and minutes are unlimited.If I'm getting  then both seconds and minutes are limited to 0..59 while hours are unlimited.Then return a TimeDelta object.The naive way is to write multiply  statements to check all this. But im looking for a smoother way.
How about using regular expression here:Example:The regular expression part by part:: beginning of string: 1-n digits, captured as group 1 optional part: is a non-capturing group matches literal  an optional digit 0-5, followed by a digit, captured as group 2there is a second non-capturing group in the first: that optionally matches second  followed byan optional digit 0-5 followed by a digit; and capturing the digits into group 3and finally  matches the end of the string. Strictly,  at the beginning is not necessary as  anchors the match at the beginning; however the  is necessary, as otherwise the match is not anchored at the end of the string! (Python 3.4 added the  to fix this.)The  will be a tuple of 3 items; the non-matching groups will be returned as .
