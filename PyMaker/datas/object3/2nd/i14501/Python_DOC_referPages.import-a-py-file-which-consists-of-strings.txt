I would advise you to use a name other than 'string' as that is already the name of system library in Python. Try the following:my_strings.pymain.pyIf you wanted to just import specific strings, you could do this in main.pyHope that helps!
normally you wouldorEDIT see comment - there are issues with this, though for some modules such as tkinter it is the recommended way. (If you are simply moving some of your code into a subsidiary file for tidiness then doing this isn't an unreasonable approach)i.e. without the .pythis is a bad name for a file and a variable though.
