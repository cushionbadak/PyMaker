I'm writing this script that downloads an HTML document from http://example.com/ and attempts to parse it as an XML by using:However, I keep getting a  error, supposedly at line 1, column 2781, so I donwloaded the file manually (Ctrl+S on my browser) and checked it, but such position indicates a place in the middle of a string, and not even near the EOF, but there were a few lines before the actual 2781nth character so that might've messed up my calculation of the exact position. However, I tried to download and actually write the response to a file to parse it later by:And I'm still getting the same  error at the same column, but this time I opened the downloaded html and the only stuff near column 2781 is this:And the exact 2781nth column marks the first "h" in , so what could be wrong here? am I missing something?Edit:I've been looking more into it and tried to parse the XML using another parser, this time minidom, but I'm still getting the exact same error at the exact same line, what could be the problem here? this also happens even though I've downloaded the file by several different ways (urllib, curl, wget, even Ctrl+Save on the browser) and the result is the same.Edit 2:This is what I've tried so far:This is an example xml I just got from the API doc, and saved it to text.html:And I tried:And it works, then:And it also works, but:Doesn't, also tried:And it doesn't work too, what could be the problem? as far as I can tell the document doesn't have mismatching tags, but perhaps it's too large? it's only 95.2 KB.
You can use  to parse this page. Like this:OUTPUT:You can download bs4 from this link.
Based on the urllib and ElementTree documentation, this code snippet seemed to work without error for your sample URL.If you don't want to read the response into a variable before parsing it with ElementTree, this also works:
