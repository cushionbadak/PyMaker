I am building an interactive shell using Python 3 and the cmd module.  I have already written simple unit tests using py.test to test the individual functions, such as the do_* functions.  I'd like to create more comprehensive tests that actually interact with the shell itself by simulating a user's input.  For example, how could I test the following simulated session:
You can   or input stream passed to cmd to inject user input but I find more simple and flexible test  it by   API method and trust how  read input. In this way you cannot care how  do the dirty work and test directly by users command: I use  both by console and socket and this I cannot care where the stream come from.Moreover I use  to test even  (and occasionally ) methods and make my test less coupled to the code. Follow a simple example of how I use it.  and  are helper methods to build a  instance and take the last output lines respectively.Take care that  return  if your cli should terminate,  otherwise.
Use python mock library to simulate user input. Here you will find similar problems with examples 1, 2.
