I have the following code stored as a string variable in Python. How can I use regex, along with , to parse out the five 9-digit numbers (all starting with "305...") under "attributeLookup" lookup in the below code?
Here is a way to do it. First parse your string to get the json object (everything inside the most outer braces). Then decode the json object using the json module and access what you need.
You can just use the built in json library to parse it. I've assumed you've got rid of the Javascript already:
Don't know why you want to use regex. Do you also take your car to visit your neighbour?
in the findall you want to select the digits 0 to 9 over 9 characters like this. This still would be better using the json module rather than storing as a string.I really useful tester for python regex can be found here http://pythex.org/
