I have a class  that has an  method that works as followsHowever, if I change some dataand check again...The changing data has affected the original addition method. I've tried using .copy() to create copies of the variables we're adding, and use those- however I haven't had any luck...This just outright doesn't workI'm not sure how to make this work with copies
The problem here is that your  method is presumably just making a new list with the same dicts. When you copy a collection whose elements are themselves mutable collections, they don't get copied.If you want to copy "all the way down", use the  function. For example, you can change your own  method to call . (And probably your  method as well.)For example, maybe something like this:Meanwhile, your  method doesn't make any sense. You create  and  lists, but then you try to append to  and  lists, and then you try to use  as if it were a  instance instead of a list. If you've got a  method, it may be simpler to first define , and then define  in terms of it:
