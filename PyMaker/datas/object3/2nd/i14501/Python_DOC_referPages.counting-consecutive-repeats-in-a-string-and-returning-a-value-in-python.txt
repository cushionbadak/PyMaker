Asked my friend to give me an assignment for me to practice. It is:If a user enters a string  the program will return    and vice versa.This what I tried so far:I have "cleaned" the code so it removes white spaces and keeps it in low capHere is where I am stuck - the logics. I was thinking to go the through the string one index at a time and compare the next on to the other. Is this the wright way to go about it? And I'm not even sure about the loop construction.
 is a good choice for such task but about the rest you can use  to sort the items of  then use a list comprehension to create the desire list then concatenate with  :
I'd do it with regular expressions. Have a look at those.Spoiler:Prints:Your "and vice versa" sentence sounds like the program needs to detect itself whether to encode or to decode, so here's that (proof of correctness left as an exercise :-)
