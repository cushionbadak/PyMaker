Natural Text
I have a tab delimited text file with each record having 10 columns as follows:P.S: The last column has text enclosed in "". And my 1st column is NOT unique.I would like to convert this text file into a csv file such that I only pick the data from the 1st, 2nd, 8th, 9th and 10th columns of the record. In addition, all the data should be enclosed in "".For example, the above record should be converted to the following line in the output csv file:

Thanks for the catch!
