I have been trying to figure out a simple way to replace the integers within a string with x's in python. I was able to get something ok by doing the following:This actually yields something like the following:My question is: is there any way of getting the result in a simpler manner without relying on error/exception handling?
Yes, using regex and the  module:The string  tells Python to search for all digits in the string. The second argument is what you want to replace all matches with, and the third argument is your input. ( stands for "substitute")
You can use the  function and list comprehension, like thisThe  function will return  if all the characters in it are numeric digits. So, if it is a digit, then we use  otherwise we use the actual character itself.You can actually use generator expression instead of list comprehension to do the same, like thisThe only difference is generators are lazy evaluated, unlike the list comprehension which builds the entire list. The generator will give values only on demand. Read more about them here.But in this particular case, with , the list is built anyway.If you are going to do this kind of replacement often, then you might want to know about  and .The  builds a dictionary with the character codes of values in the first string and the corresponding character in the second string. So, when we use the  with the , whenever it finds a character in the , it will simply replace it with the corresponding value.
change  to (or regular expressions, regex / re )

If you don't know advance data process method, you can invoke  module to filter num string.Although I know my anwser is not the best solution, I want to offer different methods help people solve problems.
