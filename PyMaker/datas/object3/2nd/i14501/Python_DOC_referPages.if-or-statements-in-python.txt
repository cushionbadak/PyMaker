This question already has an answer here:How to test multiple variables against a value?                    21 answers                output is however if I put in output is same with:why?I thought  was supposed to be either one?but if individually inputed both are false but with  it becomes true?or that's the wrong way to write an should it be written like this?
is equivalent toWhat you want is:The first test is successful, because  returns  and the string  is truthy*. The following tests fail, because  is a list with 1 string, and the  operator tests for list containment here, instead of string containment.*the  part would not get tested here, because the if short-circuits. Has nothing to do with your problem though
OK, we have several different problems here.That means this:So yes, you need to change it to this:But that still doesn't do what you want, because  is a list.  You're asking whether  is an element of that list.  But  isn't an element of the list.  The only element of the list is the string , which is not the same as .  You want to check against the string itself, not the list.
How about you send your condition to the interactive prompt (run python or ipython if you have it) to see what it returns?You probably want to test the string, not a single item list:
