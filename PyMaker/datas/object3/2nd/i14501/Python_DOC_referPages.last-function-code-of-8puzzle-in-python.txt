I have this code in Python. Swap_blank_tile function creates a new matrix from old matrix. I want to put a value to "liste" from my first matrix. Therefore I used matrix2 in "swap_blank_tile" function, but "matrix" also is affected from "swap_blank_tile" function but i do not want it. Only matrix2 must be affected from this function. I can not solve why matrix is also affected from this function.
In your code when: and  are still references to the same object, so if you change one you'll change the other. You'll probably want to create a deepcopy.
What data type is ?Possibly it is a list of lists, in which case you need to make a complete copy of matrix. Use :The reason for this is that  does not make a copy of , it simply binds the name  to the same object. Therefore any change made to the object is visible from both variables.  will descend into the object and make a copy of any nested objects resulting in 2 independent objects.
