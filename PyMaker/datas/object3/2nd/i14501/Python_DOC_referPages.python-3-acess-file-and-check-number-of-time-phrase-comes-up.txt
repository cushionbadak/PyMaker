I'm trying to check a TSV of results and want to see how many times F and S come up (for failure or success) however I'm not sure how to doing this counting, or how to having it search the fileI've come across something that is sort of what I'm looking for: Python Program how to count number of times the letter c shows upBut it isn't perfect and I'm not sure how to make it search the file.
Assuming that the count result applies to the whole file you can use a :This has the advantage of allowing you to obtain counts of any character (not just "S" and "F") with one pass of the file.You could also just use  for a specific character (or a string), but if you need counts more than one character you'll find a  more convenient and probably faster too.
You need to pass the file contents to your  function. This opens and reads the file into . For this example, I'm assuming your file is relatively small. Then  is passed into  as the first parameter, instead of a hardcoded string ( in your example).One note about your code, you are missing a closing parenthesis in your  statement. I've added that in my example above.
