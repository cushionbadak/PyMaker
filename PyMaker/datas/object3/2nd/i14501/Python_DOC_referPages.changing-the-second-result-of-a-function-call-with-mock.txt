What's the best way of changing the behavior in side_effect or return_value to properly get the behavior I want? I think side_effect is what I want, but I'm not sure what the best way is to mock the responses.
The simpler and cleaner way to do it is create  object by  and replace  reference. You can also use  to check  calls by something like:You can do the same work by build and configure  before and then pass it as  parameter (the second  argument) but by this way you have 2 downsideMore code to write  Lose the ability to use  options in Autospeccing is a very powerful feature of  framework that prevent a lot of silly bug both in test and code.
Actually turns out it was as simple as:
