I would like to get the current time in Python and assign them into variables like , , , , . How can this be done in Python 2.7?
The  module is your friend:You don't need separate variables, the attributes on the returned  object have all you need.
The  answer above is much cleaner, but you can do it with the original python  module:Output:
Here's a one-liner that comes in just under the 80 char line max.
By unpacking  of datetime object, you should get what you want:
For python 3 

Let's see how to get and print day,month,year in python from current time:result:
Three libraries for accessing and manipulating dates and times, namely datetime, arrow and pendulum, all make these items available in namedtuples whose elements are accessible either by name or index. Moreover, the items are accessible in precisely the same way. (I suppose if I were more intelligent I wouldn't be surprised.)
You can use gmtimeNote: A time stamp can be passed to gmtime, default is current time as returned by time()See struct_time
This is an older question, but I came up with a solution I thought others might like.timetuple() can be zipped with another array, which creates labeled tuples. Cast that to a dictionary and the resultant product can be consumed with .This has a little more overhead than some of the other solutions on here, but I've found it's so nice to be able to access named values for clartiy's sake in the code.
you can use datetime module to get current Date and Time in Python 2.7Output :
