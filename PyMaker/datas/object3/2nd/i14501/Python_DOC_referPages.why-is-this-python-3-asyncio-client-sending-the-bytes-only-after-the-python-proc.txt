Why is my client timing out at code line:instead of getting a message back?The server piece only registers it got a message from this client after the client times out and I actually issue a  to kill the Python interpreterclient.py
The problem is likely that you're calling  on the server-side (and also on the client-side), which will block until an  is sent from the server. But presumably you're not doing that - you're just sending some bytes over and keeping the connection open.Instead, you need either to call  and make sure to append  to your mess payloads, call  with some size to limit the number of bytes you wait for, or call  after writing your message payload, assuming you don't plan to use the  anymore. Using  or  are probably your safest options. Here's a complete example demonstrating using :client.pyserver.pyAnd here are the changes to use :client.pyserver.py
