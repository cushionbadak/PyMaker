I'm having a problem with my program, where it shows no error but suddenly stops running, pauses for a minute, then stops.For example, the program stops after producing:There is no error message produced whatsoever.The goal of the code is to print out a list of data, containing 7 pieces of information (such as Zip Code, State) about the specific ID Number.If the ID Number entered is not in my list of ID numbers (AKA new_match_list), then the "chunks" will remain blank (hence, len(chunks) will be 0), and the user will be forced to re-enter the ID number until it matches the one on my (new_match_list).If the ID number does match, it should fill out (chunks) and print out the specific part ([x]) of (chunks) related to the ID.What can I do to fix this error?Edit: I've tried different ways to fix this error, such as substituting:withbut nothing has worked. As always the program just stops without giving me an error
Your question is a little unclear, but I suspect that when control reaches  you want  to have the value it had when  was . If so, you need to put a  statement as the last line of that  block, i.e., after the  line. And, as Paul Cornelius mentioned, you need to change the variable in that list comprehension so that  doesn't get clobbered.However, there's a better way to find the first matching entry in a list: use its .index() method. You will need to put this inside a  block; alternatively, use the  operator to test that the ID is in the list before attempting to fetch its index.
