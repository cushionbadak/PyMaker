I have created a custom descriptor for configuration options that can be used to create classes like this:The real instances contain a lot more properties. The problem is that I would like to have an  that allows me to initialise any properties I want upon construction, like this:Since in practice there are many more properties, this becomes hard to maintain, and since the pattern here is very regular, I am wondering if there is a way to automatically provide this functionality.My first draft was this class:This does what I want, but in some cases even more, since it also initialises attributes that are not configuration properties, which might cause problems with other base classes. I don't know how to fix that.  does not yield , but rather the type of the current value.Also, it treats all   as configuration properties to be initialised. Some of them might be arguments for other base class constructors though, so I'd need to be able to distinguish that.So, is there a way to provide this functionality in a generic way and safe way?
Simply use :On the other hand, to automate this process even further, one can introduce a mapping configuration parameter -> type and create and fill the properties dynamically:
