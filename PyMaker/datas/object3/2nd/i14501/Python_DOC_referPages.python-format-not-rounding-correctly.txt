This question already has an answer here:Is floating point math broken?                    28 answers                I have these two lists:And then, using this for loop, I iterate through each percent and calculate the discounted price.This all works fine, except for one issue: some of the values calculated are not rounded properly. For instance, 14.95 - (0.1 * 14.95) = 13.455, which should be rounded to 13.46 by .format(). However, the value printed is 13.45.Is there something I am doing wrong, or is it a problem with the method, format, itself?
Here's your problem:No, in IEEE doubles,  is . Which rounds down to  correctly.Here's the obligatory link to What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic.If you want  to actually be exactly 14.95, rather than the closest binary fraction to 14.95, you may want to use  instead of . Of course  is just as inexact, but the closest decimal fraction to 14.95 obviously really is 14.95. :)
