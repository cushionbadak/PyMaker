Suppose I have a module package containing the following files. An empty file  and some non-trivial files:One located in Another located in There is also a third file:  with the following codeWhen I run the latter file, everything goes fine. However, if I try to execute the file  containingI get the import error . How to resolve this issue?
First, I suspect you forgot to metion you have a (possibly empty) file  which makes  a package. Otherwise,  wouldn't work.The second case differs from the first in so far as you are in a package. From inside a package, you wouldn't do , but . The equivalent to the latter is described here where you either add  as a parameter or (but I am not sure about that) you put  into the string and set  to  (if it isn't the default nevertheless, that's not clear from the documentation).Additionally, you have to provide at least , so the right line isI have found this solution here.
In your case, you should import your  from . Use  argument:
Assuming, you're using Python 3, that's just because this version dropped the support for implicit relative imports. With Python 2 it would be working just fine.So either you'd need to use relative imports in , which would result in erroneous call to it, or add your package to the path. A little dirty, but working hack would be:Maybe you can achieve a cleaner implementation with the  module.
