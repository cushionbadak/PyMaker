The normal dot match all of characters except line break. If I want to match all of characters include line break, I can use [\s\S](just an example) to get the right result. But how about some cases like " match all of the characters except ';' "?  or " match all of the characters except 'A' and 'b' and 'c' "? how can I custom a dot with a * to match what I want?
To get dot to match a linebreak as well, use  as an option. For example:This changes all dots in your expression, though. Alternatively, you could use (|) to only match "\n" in some cases:Here we use ?: in order to keep from making a group. Each  will match a dot or a newline.For the other things, you generally use "[]" or "[^]" to match only a set of things, or anything but a set of things. So for anything but ';', use "[^;]", and for all characters except A, b, and c, use "[^Abc]", while to only match those three, use "[Abc]". There are also all sorts of shorthand things, like \s for whitespace, and \S for non-whitespace. Looking through the  documentation is really helpful here.
The Python regex module and some other regex flavor support sets operations in character classes beyond simple negation.For example, in Python regex (but not in re in the standard library):The character class  would usually find all ascii lower case letters. In this case, not including any between  because they were subtracted.The sense of that can be negated as well:Or, no vowels:
