I am a Java programmer struggling to learn Python, and almost certainly about to ask a duplicate question.  In my Python code, I need to create an object that basically holds a list.  When an object is instantiated, the list is to be empty.  Later in the code, I want to add items:When I run the above code, I get this error message:So it looks like the object is successfully created, but when I call , the list is not defined.  Is that because the myList created in  goes out of scope once the object constructor is completed?  I get the same error message when I move the  command to the top of the class definition:So how do I create an empty list which is available after the object is created?I should also add that I am writing on Python 2.7.  My company likes this version, so I'm stuck with it.  Don't ask.Thanks
In your  function  is just local variable. Use  in order to make it as a class member. Of course access it in function addSomething() by using self as well: . Also you need to change signature of method addSomething from  to 
In Python, there is difference between  and . That is, by the time your code hits  it is already "constructed". Only then you can add new "fields" to an instance, like for example  in .What  goes, you may named it  but it is the instance in fact. So you should write  instead.
