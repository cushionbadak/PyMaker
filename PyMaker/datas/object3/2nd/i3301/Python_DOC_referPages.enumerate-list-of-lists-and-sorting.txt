I am following a tutorial online, and having trouble understanding what the code does.Here, questions_int is a list of lists containing numbers in the following format:The goal is to sort by the questions by its length to reduce amount of padding time during training the data for sequence 2 sequence model. But I don't understand how the code works and how it helps sorting by length.
Okay, so let's take this line by line. iterates from 1 to max_line_length.  This means  will first be equal to , then when the loop finishes  will be equal to , etc. until max_line_length` (20 in this case) makes i equal to a tuple of (index, element), meaning that  will be the length of the ith question.  As  increases in value from one, the shortest questions and answers will gradually be added to the lists, hence the  calls within the 2nd for loopThe line  will append the question at the current index where .  Remember that i is a tuple of 2 elements, and the first is the index of the current question.  So  is the question that has length .Similarly,  is the answer corresponding to that question.  So whenever we find a slightly longer question using the  condition, the list  gets longer by 1 with the new answer, and  does as wellPlease ask a follow up question wherever you are confused
