I’m very fond of the idea of using type annotations in Python. I know how to do such like in this simple example:But I have no clue of how to do so when my function is going to return a lambda:This example generates an error, and I wonder what’s the keyword I’m supposed to use for this return type. Perhaps this doesn’t seem so useful but I want to keep my code consistently annotated and being unable to do so with these type of functions is really bothering me.Thanks in advance.
