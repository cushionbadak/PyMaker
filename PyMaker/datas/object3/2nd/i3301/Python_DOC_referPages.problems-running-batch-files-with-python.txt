I am rather new to Python and have been trying to run a .cmd file with it, but it won't run it from the correct location. My file Run_setup.cmd, is setting up another a different software with a bunch of related files and so I have sequestered them to their own folder for my sanity.Currently I can get the .cmd file to run from the same location as my source code. I know I am messing up the file path for it with cwd=r'%s' based on what the documentation says, but I don't get how.If cwd is not None, the function changes the working directory to cwd before executing the child. cwd can be a str and path-like object. In particular, the function looks for executable (or for the first item in args) relative to cwd if the executable path is a relative path.I currently have it using cwd=r' C:\LargeFolder\Files\CorrectFolder' based off this post, and it seems that it works for any file path, but I can't seem to get it to work for me.What am I missing here, and furthermore what is the purpose of using cwd=r' ' ?
this one works for me:
the parameter is . The  part only needs to exist in the definition of your string, to have a raw string and make python ignore special sequences using backslashes.Since your string comes from , you don't need it.
Your error is due to not escaping your \.You need to escape your "\" where you're adding in your subfolder and then you should be good to go.should be
