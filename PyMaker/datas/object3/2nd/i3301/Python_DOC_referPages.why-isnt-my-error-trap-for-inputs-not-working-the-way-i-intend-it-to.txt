Why isn't this error trap working well? I wanted to make it where if someone types a word or a number over 1, it error traps and repeats the question until you type in the correct corresponding input. Any suggestions??    
You should test the length of the input with an  statement instead of a  loop. You can also use  to test if a string consists of just either '0' or '1' characters. And you can make  and  a tuple of variable names and iterate through the same code to ask for their values with the same logic, and assign the value either as a global variable or as values of a dict.
I would suggest putting your code in functions to help split things up into smaller pieces and use a regex to test to see if there are characters other than 1 or 0. Here is a suggestion based on the code you provided (The code here is for Python3+):
