Which way is more fitting python style:orWhen should we proces our data? When we collect it or when we do something with it? Of course one can make a statement it depends on what we do more, adding or reading. But if we would have to make rule of the thumb, what it would be?IMHO I lean towards second way because it guarantess correct order without depening on some external state.
None of those solutions is more nor less pythonic than the other, and both have pros and cons, depending on your typical use case. And both have a couple issues...the first solution is highly inefficient if you add thousands of data in a rowthe second keeps on sorting a list that is, most of the time, already sorted. Given Python's builtin sort algorithm behaviour this should not be a huge issue but that's still a few function calls and they don't come for free.and in both cases,  being exposed as a public attribute breaks encapsulation and make the whole question moot since anyone can either add to  without sorting it after or read from  without sorting it before...So the very first thing to do is actually to make  private. Then you want to keep track of wether  needs sorting:Now you have a properly encapsulated implementation that only sorts when necessary...
When should we process our data? When we collect it or when we do  something with it?It depends.If collection of the data is more intensive than processing it, then you should sort your data just before it is processed and vise versa.Why?Suppose that you are appending 1000 elements/s to  array but you only call  10 times in a minute. If you sort your data upon collection, you will be wasting too much CPU resource and time.
