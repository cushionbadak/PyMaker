I have such code for running simple server on Python 3. I know that I can just use something like this , however I want to understand how it works and set limits for serving files extensions.I try to use , but looks like that doesn't work.<>
 is a builtin function. You're trying to join that function to the string , hence the error.The reason you're presumably confused is that you tried to hide  with a string, here:But when you put that inside a  definition, that doesn't create a global variable that hides the builtin, it creates a class attribute. To access a class attribute from within a method of that class, you have to do the same thing you do with a normal instance attribute:The only differences between class attributes and instance attributes are that:All of your instances share the same  attribute instead of each having their own copy.You can access it as  or  instead of just as .To avoid this kind of confusion, it's a good idea to avoid reusing the names of any of the builtin functions. While it's legal to do so, it often leads to mistakes just like this one, and makes it harder to debug those mistakes.Also, given that  is a constant across the entire program, just like  and  are, and isn't all that closely tied to the  type, maybe you just wanted a global constant, like , instead of a class attribute.
