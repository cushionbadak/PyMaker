Any guidance is appreciated. I'm very new to programming. Problem(s): Runtime error of 'str is not callable.' And, likely semantic error. Specifics: "if len(s) <= 70:TypeError: 'str' object is not callable"Intended results: I'm trying to write a function that takes a string and then prints that string so that the last letter of the string is in column 70 of the display.What I've tried: Run code in PEP8 and it doesn't return any syntax errors. Removed original line which assigned str to s.  The code in Python 3:
If I understand your requirements, you want to put enough spaces in front of the string so its last character is in column 70. You do not need to iterate over the string. This will achieve what you need. Note there is no point putting  within the function, because you cannot call the function with a string argument.
the simplest way is:
Simply replace the len variable With something else. len is a Python keyword sir its reserved and not meant to be use as a variable 
'len' is a Python reserved keyword, you don't use keywords as variable names. The correctionprint(right_justify)
