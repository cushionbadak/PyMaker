I'm trying to learn how to work with Unicode in python.Let's say I have a file  containing Unicode characters:I want to make a python script that prints out all the unique characters in the file. This is what I have:This doesn't print the Unicode characters properly:What is the correct way to do this, so that the characters print properly?
Your data is encoded, most likely as utf-8.  Utf-8 uses more than one byte to encode non-ascii characters, such as .  Iterating over a string encoded as utf-8 yields the individual bytes that make up the string, rather than the characters that you are expecting.So printing individual bytes doesn't work as expected.But decoding the string to unicode, then printing does.To make your code work as you expect, you need to decode the string you read from the file.  Change to
This depends on the version of Python you are using:1. For the python 2, there was no native support for Unicode characters, so it was necessary to leave explicit, with a header such as:2. For python 3 The support is native, as it says here. So the  encoding already has native support.
