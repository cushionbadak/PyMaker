I'm new to python, and I can't figure out any strategy or existing  module that would solve this problem.  I would like to make a simple  program that would return if a given day in the future would be a day  off or not based on the following schedule (actual schedule for this  week of July 2018):
This produces a list of weekly schedules. Each weekly schedule is a list starting from Monday and going through Sunday. The choice of monday through sunday is just to align with Python's order of day of week in the datetime and calendar modules.The key here is using the  operator (), rather than  to determine which week's schedule we should use. Because we use  we can make our 2 week rotation a 3 or 4 week rotation by simply adding an entry to , and the calendar will still work.Storing the day of week as an integer and the on/off as a boolean affords us a lot of flexibility in how we later organize this information for display. We can print schedules easily using the calendar module:To change the first weekday per week in our display, we just pass a different day of the week to , (e.g. ).This doesn't factor in the actual date, but I'm happy to add that if it's useful.
