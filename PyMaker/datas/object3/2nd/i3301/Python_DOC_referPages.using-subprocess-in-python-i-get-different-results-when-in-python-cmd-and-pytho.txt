I hope the title makes sense. To give specifics:I am using csvtotable (https://github.com/vividvilla/csvtotable) to generate HTML tables from CSVs. I have installed via pip and am able to run a command line command:to generate a HTML page. All good so far.I wanted to do this from within a Python script I had already written so I heard that subprocess was the way to do this. I looked up how to do it and understood that it can be done using the following:So I tested this via the command line first by doingfrom the command line and then runningSuccess! It worked. Fantastic.However, when I try to do this from IDLE, it just returns a 1.  I have checked the directory thinking that maybe the csv was missing from there, but it still doesn't work.Am I misunderstanding how subprocess works?
Solved by finding a way to call the function without subprocess. I think the issue may have related to default arguments not being set when it is executed through python and hence why below I have had to specify so many arguments.Code:Note that the argument names had to be changed where they had a  in the name. I just changed any instance e.g.  to  in convert.py
