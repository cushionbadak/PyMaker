No. You would have to subclass one of the json module classes  and override the method that creates the object, to do it yourself. And it is also not worth the trouble. json arrays really map to lists in python - they have order, and can allow duplicates - a set can't correctly represent a json array. Therefore it is not the job of a json decoder to provide a set.Converting is the best you can do. You could create a function and call it when you need:
