I have a list of mixed tuples:How to unpack it separately into two lists or tuples, one with strings and one with integers?
If list schema is maintained as Using python's  you can easily unpack list of tuples, without any particular regard to types:The unpacked lists are:Notes on the  operatorThe  operator is called Unpacking Argument Lists, it passes the single elements of the list as argument. Suppose you have a list with 3 elements  ad a function with 3 parameters : you can use  to call .If list schema is shuffledSolution using sorting, tuple by tupleUsing  we can first sort the tuples and then execute the zip:This way the list is first sorted as:And afterwards running the zip we obtain the same result:Solution using groupbySolutions speed comparison on example listRunning timeit on the example list we get:Tuple sorting:GroupbySolutions speed comparison on large listRunning timeit on the a large list such as:Tuple sorting:GroupbyConclusionsEven though on small list the first method seems to be the faster one, on larger list the groupby method appears faster.

you can convert it into dictionary and work as normal {'Adam': 1985, 'Karen': 1990, 'anna': 1986}
