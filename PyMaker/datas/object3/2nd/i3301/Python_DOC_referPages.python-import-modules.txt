i'am learning python and i have an issue with importing modules/packages Well , i'm trying to make a package that contains some modules but the the thing is: the *.py files are depending on each others here is the code of the main .py file when i run it i get here is the Package architecture :and finally the altitude.py file :and thank you guys :) 
i find out wat's wrong , i must put an import as it is a package with inkstand of thx anyways :)
Imports are absolute by default. So,  is looking for a top-level module named , and that's not what you want.But when you're trying to import another module in the same package, you usually don't want an absolute import, you want an import relative to the current package:If you do want an absolute import, you need to specify the top-level package (or, for more deeply-nested modules, the whole path) to import it from:Or, of course, you can do this:â€¦ but then you'll have to also change your code to call  instead of just .This is all explained under Modules in the official tutorial, but it's kind of scattered around all over the chapter. (Most of it is in Intra-package References, but you wouldn't find that, or maybe even understand it, without reading half the rest of the chapter first.)You might find it more useful to read PEP 328, the language change proposal that added the current relative import syntax, which gives a lot of background on the design, and on when and why you'd want to use absolute vs. relative imports.
