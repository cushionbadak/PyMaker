I have this method in my class called "interaction":that ivokes a thread with User and Pass as parameters.Then I have the class called "ThreadBrowser" with this "run" method:but it turns out that I'm certainly struggling sending the arguments to the thread function because it gives an execution error:Any idea how to solve this ?
The  constructor argument can't provide additional arguments to . It provides the arguments to target, which you aren't specifying. Specifically:the default implementation of  invokes , where  and  are provided by the constructor, and default to empty tuple and dict respectively.by implementing  you opted out of Python invoking  automatically. It is then up to your code to store the state that your  will pick up. The idiomatic option is to store it in the constructor, much like your  method does now.For example:The  can then be constructed naturally as  and started with  as before.
Run takes 2 arguments user, pass
