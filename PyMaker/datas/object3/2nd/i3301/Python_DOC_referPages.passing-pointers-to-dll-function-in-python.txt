I am given the DLL which has required functions to communicate with the development board.I have LabVIEW equivalent function prototype which looks something like this:And the same prototype also looks like this for Visual Basic:I am trying to access this function with python instead of LabVIEW because of a lot of issues.Last three parameters to be passed to the function needs to be an address to an array of 255 elements.I have no clue how to pass pointers in function in python!!I wrote the following shortcode to access this function in python:After executing this code I get following error message:Any help will be appreciated!!Thanks a lot!
As [Python]: ctypes - A foreign function library for Python states, there are a few things to do, out of which the most important is setting  and  for the function object. SO is full of similar questions (I answered to several of them).Anyway, I prepared a dummy example (don't mind the error proneness), it's just for illustrating the mechanism.code.c:code.py:Output:@EDIT0:Modified answer to be as close as possible to the real scenario, and also to address questions in the commentsTo make it clear, a ctypes array can be accessed as any other Python sequence
