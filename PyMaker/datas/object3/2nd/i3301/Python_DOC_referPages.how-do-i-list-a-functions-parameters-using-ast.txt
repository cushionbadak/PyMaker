I'm using the ast module to parse docstrings in a Python module to turn our docs into read the docs format. I'm using the following to get the function names and docstrings into a list of dicts which the rest of my code works well with. I'm looking for something to get the parameters of the function as well:I'm looking for what I can use to fill in the function's parameters into the dict. Thanks!
The Abstract Grammar section of the  documentation tells you where to find the parameter definitions in a  node:In the parameters is a sequence of  entries; the names become attributes on the node. The types are further covered in the documentation (with several 'builtin' types listed at the top, which are reflected as Python strings and integers). Types with  after them are sequences (lists), a question mark means they can be set to .So each  node has , , ,  and  attributes. The  attribute is a new node, of type , also documented:so  is a list of arguments, each an  object, etc. is documented aswhere  is a built-in type, so just a string here.You probably want to look at the  function, which will give you a quick overview of an AST node:From there you can then explore and further 'dump' information to get to the actual data you need:The defaults are attached to the last names in the  or  sequences ( for ,  for ); a list of N defaults attached to the last N names in  or . Any catch-all names ( and  in my example) are listed separately.
