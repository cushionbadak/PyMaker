I have a defined function to interpolate a dependent variable y(x) from an independent variable x. (Known values are shown in the function below.) Instead of executing it for a single value x0, I wish to execute it for an entire array [512x512] (or even [512x512x133]) of values. Is there a more elegant method than looping through each row via nested  loops? I am about to rewrite this function adding nested  loops, but first I will read more of the Python Tutorial; currently on section 4.6, "Defining Functions".
numpy has a builtin function for this :It's easier to see in a plot if we change the data a little:
