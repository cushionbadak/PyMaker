I'm looking for a simple way to detect a keypress inside a loop without importing something like pygame, something along the lines ofI'm aware of this Keypress detection thread, but unfortunately when I run the recommended code or try anything using keyboard.is_pressed(), I get(Pretty new to Python, so not sure what any of the above means)keyboard.is_pressed() is my ideal solution, but I'm completely open to other equally simple ones too.
This is an open issue with python 3.7 on the github. I just tested the code given in your link with Python 3.6.4 (anaconda 64 bit) and keyboard-0.13.2, and it worked as expected. Python 3.7 literally just came out, so there are bound to be a few bugs.
