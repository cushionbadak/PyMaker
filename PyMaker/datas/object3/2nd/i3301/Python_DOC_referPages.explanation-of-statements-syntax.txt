This question already has an answer here:Python for-in loop preceded by a variable                    4 answers                I'm new to Python, so I was hoping somebody could break down the following statement and explain the purpose of each part.Obviously  creates a list of substrings by separating the string into elements at each space.What confuses me is the  at the very beginning and the  statement at the very end.Is the very first  what will be returned ?Why must this statement be wrapped in a list?I've never seen a for loop and an if statement combined into one statement like this before, but it reminds me of a particular JS syntax:  or . However, in JS you can't combine them into a single statement (i.e. ).
This is called a list comprehension. You will find plenty of pages explaining how it works. Just ask you favorite search engine.
