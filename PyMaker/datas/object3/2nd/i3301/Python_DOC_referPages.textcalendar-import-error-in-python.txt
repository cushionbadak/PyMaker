I am working on a calendar (this is a school assignment) The assignment is,Given a month and the day of the week thatâ€™s the first of that month entered as arugments on the command line, write a program that prints a calendar for the month. So, if I want to print Sept and it starts on Thursday, I would enter "python calendar.py 9 5" in the command line, and get a calendar that starts september on Thursday.Here's the code:The error I get is File "calendar.py", line 4, in < module>import calendarFile "/home/myname/calendar.py", line 5, in < module>import TextCalendarImportError: No module named TextCalendar Can someone tell me how to correct this? Thanks for any help!
Did you intend to import from calendar.py in your home folder rather than the standard library calendar.py?  If not, try renaming or removing your custom calendar.py.
