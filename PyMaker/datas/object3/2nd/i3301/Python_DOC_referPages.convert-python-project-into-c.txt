I am new to python but have experience in C.I have a python 3 project including a  file and some other  files in another folder like this:inside main.py:inside first  __init__.py:inside second  __init__.py:I want to convert this project into a C project to increase its performance, in this project a lot of Libraries like , ,  and  are used. I tried  and I know how to get  from , but for the other files and how to convert and use child class methods and is there a way to convert the whole project with one ?(I don't understand a lot from its docs)the main purpose is to run in C and get better performance so if there is alternate way please help in it.thanks.================================  Edit  ===================================I want to use  methods in  and functions in  in the  and problem is how to use other  files in sub-folders and generate  code using . I was able to convert single python file  but don't know how to add, import or ... other files in my .thanks again.
I believe the answer is no -- you are not going to be able to do a simple conversion to C for the whole project. At least, not in a way that is likely to give you better performance. Also, the libraries you have listed are mostly implemented in C already, so the calls to those libraries are generally fast.Have you profiled the code? I think you would have more luck if you can identify where the bottle-necks are rather than attempt a total conversion.
