I know there must be a better method with less lines of code, how would you go about reversing the numbers in "some_numbers?"
Since your list size is fixed, using a  loop going backwards also makes sense here:Or as a list comprehension:Both of which give:Note: More pythonic solutions would be to use  or slicing 
@Tomas Farias is correct, you can use the  built-in, as below:Note: @coldspeed is correct that's not a string that's called a list, so i renamed itEdit:try this:
I'm assuming you are doing this as an exercise in writing a reverse function, or it's homework, in which case using  is not the point.An alternative using indexes:
Just to compile the answers: That is not a string, it is a list (a string is a word like "hey").You can do , and now the list is reversed. Or, if you don't want to overwrite the list, call .Or you can get . The numbers in the brackets (called splices) tell Python how to look at the list. The first number, which since we didn't include defaults to the start of the list, tells Python where to start. The second number, which defaults to , tells Python where to stop. And the third number (-1) tells Python how to move from one number to the next, in our case, backwards by 1.If you wanted the list in reversed sorted order, then you should do . Again, if you don't want to change the list and just want a copy, call .
