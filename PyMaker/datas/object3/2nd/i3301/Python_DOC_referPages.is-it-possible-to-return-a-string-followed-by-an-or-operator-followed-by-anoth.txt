So lets say I have thisSo hopefully when I call the function or_maker(Sentence)it returns to meIs this possible in Python? 
The pythonic way of sayingisOr even slightly better as @UltraInstinct has suggestedBoth would return the first non-empty value
You can do this with an explicit loop:If you want to preserve the short-circuit semantics of :You can also turn this into a call to , or a recursive function instead of a loop (either of which could be written as an ugly one-liner, if that’s important to you), but both of those are probably less Pythonic.But the best way to do it is probably to use :However, note that  returns True if any of the values are truthy (for strings, this means non-empty), False otherwise, while a chain of s will return the first truthy value if any are truthy, or the last falsely value if none are. So, if you want the actual string values, this doesn’t do the same thing.

what you are looking for is the join() functionwhich returns a single string "surprise or welcome or one"Or if you want it with the quotation marks:
