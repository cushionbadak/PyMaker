I am trying to copy a word file from an existing folder and copying it to a new output folder. In this output folder, I have again created different folders as per the user id and inside this the word file should be placed for every user. However, while copying this, I am facing an issue as the id folder is interpreted as a file. The output file picture is attached here:I am using the  module for this and the code which I wrote is:
that's expected. If the destination folder exists, then  appends the basename of your file and copies the file into the destination folder.Copies the file src to the file or directory dst. src and dst should be strings. If dst specifies a directory, the file will be copied into dst using the base filename from src. If it doesn't, then  assumes that you want to copy and change the name (the unix  commands works exactly the same).A workaround would be to create the directory beforehand/ensure it's here:(it's also better to use proper path handling functions from  and raw strings for litteral windows paths)
