I am trying to parse a string in this format "2018 - 07 - 07 04 - AM"to pandas datetime using strftime format. However, It seems to me the format doesn't recognize the difference between  and . Here is what I tried:Notice how the  and  are different in the above two strings, yet the same timeStamp is returned. Pandas version: 0.23.3 Python version: 3.5.4
Since you're parsing a 12-hour time format, you will need  instead of , otherwise the  specifier has no effect.This behaviour is documented in the docs:When used with the  function, the  directive only affects  the output hour field if the  directive is used to parse the hour.
