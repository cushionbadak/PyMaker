I have the following code:where  and  are lists.I need help with understanding above code. Also, how can we write above code in a simpler way?
Your function takes 2 iterables and counts the number of times, by index, the number from one iterable is greater than the other. It then does the same operation with lists in the opposite order.It's far easier to show an example:sum with bool because 1 < 4, 2 < 5, 3 > 1, 1 < 5. because 4 > 1, 5 > 2, 1 < 3, 5 > 1.Note that  with an iterable of Boolean values consider  as  and  as . This is natural because  is implemented as a subclass of . The bold values above are considered  and therefore a count of such instances will be the result of a  over those values.list comprehensionA list comprehension is easier to comprehend:generator expressionIn fact, since  returns a lazy iterator,  more closely resembles a generator expression, which should perform better than the  variant:You can then iterate the generator expression:Or exhaust the generator via a function such as :
