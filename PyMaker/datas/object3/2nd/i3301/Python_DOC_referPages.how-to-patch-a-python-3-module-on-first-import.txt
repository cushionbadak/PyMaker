Let's say I want to dynamically patch  to make windows stay on top. If I'm certain that following code really uses Tkinter, then I can  before rest of the code and perform necessary updates.But how to set up the module patching on-demand, ie. only when the rest of the code really imports the module?I know about  and , but I'm hoping there is something simpler. I don't want to change the finding or loading mechanics, I just want to get hold of the imported module object before it is passed to the importing module. I don't need to support Python versions older than 3.5.
I chose wrapping :This function is invoked by the import statement. It can be replaced  (by importing the builtins module and assigning to  ) in order to change semantics of the import  statement
