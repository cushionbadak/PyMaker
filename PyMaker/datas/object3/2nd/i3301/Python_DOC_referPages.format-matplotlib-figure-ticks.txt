I am using matplotlib together with tkinter to display graphs. I am trying to change the format of my y-axis ticks to fit the need of the graph. Here is what I have tried.However this formats the ticks to an integer with commas in the thousands marks. Shown here. How would I format this so the y-axis ticks began with a $ and ended with a decimal. Thank you.

The  labels the field, the  class allows two fields in the format string:  for the value and  for the position.The last line in your code would become:If you want more or less decimal places just change the number .  If you wanted to keep the thousands separators add a comma after the colon: .
