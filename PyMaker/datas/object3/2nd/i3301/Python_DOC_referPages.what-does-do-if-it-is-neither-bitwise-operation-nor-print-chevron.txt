Is there anyone who could help figure out what the double greater-than symbol (i.e.  in line 10 and  in line 13) means in the following python scripts? The code is copied from here and runs in python 3.  The  symbol here is not bitwise operator. Python's bitwise operation, say , requires  to be an integer. It is clear that the code here () is not shifting  right by  bits. Although similar questions were asked before (see here and here), their answers mostly pointed to the so-called "print chevron" in python 2, where the  redirects the to-be-printed messages to the file-like object specified right after the . They do not apply to my question because here is not a case of print statement.  To trace the  in the code above, I revised the script in line 10 as  (namely replace  with ) and ran the code again. It raised an AttributeError as follows:With the traceback info, though, I still could not find the answer. I would be very thankful if anyone could help figure out what the  does in the code. 
 calls 's  method. That method can do whatever it wants; it doesn't have to be a binary shift operation.Reading the owlready2 documentation reveals that  is a fancy way of creating an .
Aran-Fey has answered the question in brief. Below is just to save time for those who don't want to download and parse the source codes of owlready2 but still want to trace how it works in the actual codes.   is an object created on the basis of another object , as defined in /owlready2/entity.py. calls  [explained].It is not  but its base object  that has a  method, which reads in the entity.py:   is equivalent to , which is in fact not doing a binary arithmetic operation but returns/creates either a DataProperty or an ObjectProperty, depending on the type of Range.
