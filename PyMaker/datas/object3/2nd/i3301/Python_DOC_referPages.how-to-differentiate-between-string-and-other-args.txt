I am trying to parse arguments in python code sent from slack... what does this mean is when someone types a command in slack I want to differentiate based on string and other args.for eg in slack if I use !command inc-number some string and then sometimes!command inc-number word how could I differentiate both===============================================================================
If you're testing if args[1] is a string use 
It is pretty difficult to differentiate a word from a string, mainly because  a  IS a .If we take as an example for a  the string  and an example for a  the string , we may define a  as a set of one or more characters not containing a space, and a  as a set of words separed by a space.Starting by this assumption, our  is a  if contains at least one space (we should also verify that it contains at least 2 characters...), else it's a  if it contains at least 1 character, else is something wrong:
Slack will always return the complete user input as one big string. So you need to implement a parse to transform that string into arguments in accordance with your syntax design.They are many ways to approach this. I usually use a syntax where a space is used as delimiter to identify each argument plus  can be used to encapsulate a longer sentence with multiple words as one argument.I guess your best approach would be to use existing parsers. e.g. shlex to parse the input from Slack. See also this answer for examples on how shlex works.
