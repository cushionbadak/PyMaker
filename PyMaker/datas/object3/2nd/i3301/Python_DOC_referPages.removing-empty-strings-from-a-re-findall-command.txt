You can use  and  to remove empty strings from your output:Or using :
It is stated in the doc that empty match are included.If one or more groups are present in the pattern, return a list of groups; this will be a list of tuples if the pattern has more than one group. Empty matches are included in the result.This means you will need to filter out empty compounds yourself. Use falsiness of the empty string for that.Also, avoid using capitalized variable names as those are generally reserved for class names.
