In this documentation , strftime appear 3 times. One implementation in "date" library, one in "datetime" library, and one in the "time" library.All descriptions of this function refer to the same part of the page about the behavior of this function.So when should we use time.strftime, date.strftime or datetime.strftime? Is their any difference in practice? Do we change only for clarity's sake.
I will quote from the documentation.Refer the code to understand better.time.strftime(format)Return a string representing the time, controlled by an explicit format string. For a complete list of formatting .datetime.strftime(format)Return a string representing the date and time, controlled by an explicit format string.date.strftime(format)Return a string representing the date, controlled by an explicit format string. Format codes referring to hours, minutes or seconds will see 0 values.
