I have a batch file which runs a Python script. This script simulates data that is printed 3 lines at a time every 5 seconds.

Is there a way for me to log these every 5 seconds to a single .txt file?Yes. Two and a half ways, in fact.First, you can modify the Python script to write to a text file instead of stdout:Or, if you want to be able to pass it a filename instead of hardcoding :Now your batch file would do this:Of course in both of these cases, you don't have to use the  argument to ; you could instead use  directly if you need more control over the file, or use the  module to magically do fancier logging (e.g., with automatic timestamps).Alternatively, you can leave the Python script alone, and instead modify the batch file to use shell redirection:
