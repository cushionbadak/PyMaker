I'm a beginner with Python. Currently I'm making a car reading tool just to build some programming skill. All works well.When I get a fault code from a control module from a car, I get a P-code. Like:P2348 and P21E2 (random P codes)I can retrieve these P codes, but I want to add a little more info to them. P codes can be linked to a fault description:P2348 - Misfire detected (random)I want my program to give the extended information, and not just the P code. There are thousands of P codes and I have them all with discription. But a thousand If statements would be bad coding. I could look the P code up in a textfile and get the complete string from it, but that's not really an option (unless it's possible in the code itself or compiled with the executable).What would be a neat way to do this? I have encountered this problem before when I took programming lessons. I used IF statements then (about 20) and I hated it.
Use a dictionary:then you can lookup a key in the dict, no  needed:You can write code to read a database in some format (csv, json, etc) and generate the dict, so you have the descriptions external to the program
