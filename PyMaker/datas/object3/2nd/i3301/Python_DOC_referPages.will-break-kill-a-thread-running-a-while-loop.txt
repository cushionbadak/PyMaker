I am asking this because I have seen multiple answers that may be the answer, but I can't be sure. So I'm asking it here in case someone else searches for it later.My code is a tkinter program. The gui runs in one class, whilst other clases can be run as threads. This is the code I use to set up a thread to prevent blocking the gui.So here is my question. If that break is encountered inside the class. Will it just stop the function, but leave the thread intact, or will using break end the thread as it's completed it's task?
In your code, if break is encountered, then run function will return, so the thread will complete it's task.
