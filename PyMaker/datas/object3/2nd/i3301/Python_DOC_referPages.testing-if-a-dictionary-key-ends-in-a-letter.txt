I have code written to add items, i'm adding an item like so:the  is the tool and the  is the durability and i need to find a way so if i'm adding and  already exists it adds a  instead. This has to work with other items as well
As user3483203 and ShadowRanger commented, it's probably a bad idea to use numbers in your key string as part of the data. Manipulating those numbers will be awkward, and there are better alternatives. For instance, rather than storing a single value for each numbered key, use simple keys and store a list. The index into the list will take the place of the number in the key.Here's how you could implement it:Add a new wooden sword with durability 10:Find how many bronze helmets we have:Find the first bronze helmet with a non-zero durability, and reduce it by 1:You could simplify some of this code by using a  instead of a regular dictionary, but if you learn how to use  and  it's not too hard to get by with the regular .
To ensure a key name is not taken yet, and add a number if it is, create the new name and test. Then increment the number if it is already in your list. Just repeat until none is found.In code:While this code does what you ask, you may want to look at other methods. A possible drawback is that there is no association between, say,  and  â€“ if 'all wooden shoes' need their price increased, you'd have to iterate over all possible names between  and , just in case these existed at some time.
From what I understand of the question, your keys have 2 parts: "Name" and "ID". The ID is just an integer that starts at 1, so you can initialize a counter for every name:And to add to the array:If you need to have an unknown amount of tools, I recommend looking at the re module: https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html.Or you could iterate over  to see if the entry exists.
You could write a function that determines if a character is a letter:Then when you are looking at a key in your dictionary, simply:
