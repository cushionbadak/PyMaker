Natural Text
I tried to put the  and  inside my coding, but it still said "can't multiply sequence by non-int of type "
The issue is that PV is a string and not a float.  is Python3 does not evaluate the input unlike in Python2.You need to convert it into a /:If you multiply a string with an int, it performs concatenation. That is why multiplying by float does not make sense.
