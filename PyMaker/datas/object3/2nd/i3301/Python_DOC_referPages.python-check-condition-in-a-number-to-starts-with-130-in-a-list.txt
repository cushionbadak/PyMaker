Lets see i have a condition :Here,the list could have multiple values  etc.So i want to check:How can i check for the numbers starting 130*?
You can check if a number is inside a range() if you have a continious range to cover. Do not convert to int multiple times, store your int value:  and use that.If you want to check against specific single values, use a set() if you have 4 or more values - it is faster that a list-lookup:Output:Take value from user and compare:Could be solved like so:It will print smth for 1301,1303,1305,1307,1309 (due to the ) .Other answer: Asking the user for input until they give a valid response
How about 
You can also use thisuse of this function you can find any list start with any number
