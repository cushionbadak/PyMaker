I have 7 columns in my dataset. A part of my script is taking the columns and processing it. For example the following is working on second columnI want it to process all 7 columns and writing each output as 'file$columnno.dat' Question 1: Is this a correct way to do it?Question 2: Now the output is just a list of numbers. But I want the output for each column as a file such as  etc. Is that  command. I didn't manage to fix it. It seems pretty standard and sorry if I am overwriting this question with existing ones. 
Looks like you need Ex:Using  to convert every element in list to float
Question 1Your solution will not work, because you can't iterate over the same line twice, unless you use  (see docs: Methods of File Objects) to start again from the first line. Instead, you can iterate each line and create a list of lists, with each sublist representing a row in your file.The  module makes the syntax easier, so you don't need to manually iterate, split strings or convert to . These can be handled by  in an efficient way:Question 2You can iterate over each index of your list of lists via . Then, within your loop, iterate over values in your column. The output will be 7 files each with a column from the original input file. Here's an example:
