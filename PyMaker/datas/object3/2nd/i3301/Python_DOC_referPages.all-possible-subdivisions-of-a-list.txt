I've just written a small recursive programme to generate all the possible subdivisions of a list:I've brute forced this and it's taken me a long time to figure out.  I'm wondering what this is called, as I'm sure there is a name for it.In general I'm wondering how to learn this stuff from a mathematical point of view and whether there are good well known programming libraries that cover useful algorithms like this (I know of https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html )[Edit] the question that this is marked as duplicate of - get all possible partitions of a set- gets a different answer.It is looking for while a correct answer for me (in it's terminology) would be Also, the point of asking the question was to figure out what the terminology of this is; I'm calling it 'subdivisions'; that answer is calling it 'partitions'.  I'm looking for a good resource which enumerates all of these patterns, so that people don't go reinventing the wheel.
Finding all partitions of a list is equivalent to finding all sets of indices at which to slice the list.By example, given the list , we can represent the partition  by the list of indices . In particular, there is a one-to-one correspondence between such list of indices and partitions.This means, given a list  we can find the powerset of  and find each corresponding partition.CodeThis solution uses the  function from itertools recipes. Using generators is more efficient than using recursion.Example
Let me give some mathematical interpretation of this problem.Imagine: you have list . If you put some separators in it - like  - you'll divide it into sublists. All the possible separators are  (their count is , where  is a size of list). Let's call them (separators) , , . Then all the subdivisions of your list will be generated by all the combinations of set . There will be  of them: each element can be in combination or not. (All these combinations are called powerset).That can help you to list all the subdivisions without recursion: you just to iterate binary numbers from  to  inclusive ():Or equivalent variant using itertools.product instead of binary manipulations:Usage:
My solution: returns:
