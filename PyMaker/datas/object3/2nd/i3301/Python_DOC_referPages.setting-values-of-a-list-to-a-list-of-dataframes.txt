Scenario: I have 2 lists, one is a list of strings with names, the other is a list of dataframes with varied content. I am trying to put the values from the first list into the second.Data Example: List two is a list of dataframes with the following structure:My objective is to add the first element of list1 to all cells in the first column of the first dataframe of list2; then the second element of list2 to all cells of the first column of the second dataframe of list 2, and so on. The output would be something like:What I got so far was trying to establish a triple for loop, the first iterates over items of list1, the second over dataframes of list2 and the third over rows of each dataframe:This gives me an error, I believe because of the header column, which still counts as a normal row, not an index.Question: Is there a proper way to do this?
