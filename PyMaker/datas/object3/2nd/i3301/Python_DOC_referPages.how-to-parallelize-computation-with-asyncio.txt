I have a block of code which takes a long time to execute and is CPU intense. I want to run that block several times and want to use the full power of my CPU for that. Looking at  I understood that it is mainly for asynchronous communication, but is also a general tool for asynchronous tasks.In the following example the  is a placeholder for the code I want to run. In this example every co-routine is executed one after the other and the execution takes about 8 seconds.When I replace  with  it returns nearly immediately. With  it takes about 2 seconds.Is there a way to parallelize my code using this approach or should I use  or ? Would I need to put the  into a Thread?
Executors use multithreading to accomplish this (or mulitprocessing, if you prefer).  Asyncio is used to optimize code where you wait frequently for input, output operations to run. Sometimes that can be writing to files or loading websites.However, with cpu heavy operations (that don't just rely on waiting for IO), it's recommended to use something akin to threads, and, in my opinion,  provides a very nice wrapper for that and it is similar to Asyncio's wrapper.The reason why Asyncio.sleep would make your code run faster is because it starts the function and then starts checking coroutines. This doesn't simulate CPU-heavy operations.To change the following example from multiprocessing to multi-threading Simply change  to .Here is a multiprocessing example:This is a simplified version of the example provided in the documentation for executors.
