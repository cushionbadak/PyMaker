Natural Text
Suppose I have something like:which returns string in form:Now it's send as simple string (I get it as assertion from  function). How the heck can I now get normal UTF-8 form of starting word? If there is some better compression than  then I would be glad to hear.
If you want to encode and decode text, that's what the  and  methods are for:Also, notice that UTF-8 is already the default, so you can just do this:The only reason you need to specify arguments is:You need to use some other encoding instead of UTF-8,You need to specify a specific error handler, like  instead of , orYour code has to run in Python 3.0-3.1 (which almost nobody used).However, if you really want to, you can do what you were already doing; you just need to explicitly specify the encoding in the  call, just as you did in the  call:Calling  on a  object without an encoding, as you were doing, doesn't decode it, and doesn't raise an exception like calling  on a  without an encoding, because the main job of  is to give you a string representation of the objectâ€”and the best string representation of a  object is that .
I found it. The simplest way to convert string representation of bytes to bytes again is through the  statement:
