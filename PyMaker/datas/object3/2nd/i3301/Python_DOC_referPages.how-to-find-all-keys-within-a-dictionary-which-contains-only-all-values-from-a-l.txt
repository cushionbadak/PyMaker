i'am new in python. I Am currently working on a script that filters job applicants by which programing languages they use. I've a dictionary containing each candidate (keys) and her language (value). I want to find ONLY the keys within a dictionary whose values contains ALL items contained in a list. For example:Using this example what i want to get would be only the key 'lara', which is the only one containing all the values listed within list1. I've searched like mad for a solution to this problem but so far i've found nothing around and neither could make it work for myself. Any help will be welcome

Use sets instead of lists.
Use  method to find if the given set is subset of the lists
