Have some lightweight text search engine. It iterates through the .txt files in one folder, searches for selected term and displays the name of the file. All is based on the functionality of  library:The search is working good itself but I want as a final operation save the .txt files that were received in the result in another folder  For that I trying to use  but it seems that it is not working. What will be the right approach to do that?
 only merges strings to look like a path, and has nothing to do with saving data to a file. Refer to this example which uses the  moduleNote that creating  does not create anything in the file system.Regarding how to save files, you need to specify the mode as a second parameter, being  the mode for writing. Check the documentation for more info.Your code thus would look likeNote also that  exposes  and  methods, among others.
