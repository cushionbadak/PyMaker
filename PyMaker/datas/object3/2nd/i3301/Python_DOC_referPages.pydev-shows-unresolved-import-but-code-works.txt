I am using Pydev on Eclipse.This is my codePydev shows  for  this line. But when I run the code, it works (It prints  for few of the sites that are down). What could be wrong?
Please try adding  to the forced builtins to see if it fixes your problem.See http://www.pydev.org/manual_101_interpreter.html#PyDevInterpreterConfiguration-ForcedBuiltins for details on how to actually do that (and how that's used).
