Suppose I have a main dataframeI also have 3 dataframesWhat I want is to add value from each frame  to total in the  according to Crii.e. main_df will becomemain_df Of course I can do it using for loop, but at the end I want to apply the method to a large amount of data, say 50000 rows in each dataframe.Is there other ways to solve it?Thank you!
First you should align your numeric column names. In this case:Then you have a couple of options.concat + groupbyYou can concatenate and then perform a  with :    set_index + reduce / addAlternatively, you can create a list of dataframes indexed by your criteria columns. Then use  with  to sum these dataframes.
