Change the definition of the adding function (there is no need to use lambda notation here):And tell  that the initial value is a number, not a tuple, by providing the third optional parameter:The same solution with lambda:And one more solution that does not use :
If using reduce is not necessary, a much more elegant solution is

You can check if the first parameter () is a tuple:Output:
