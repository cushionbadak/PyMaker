I wrote a simple program to test if two words are anagrams(can be rearranged into another word). It seems to work at first, when I tested very different words, like "julio" and "cesar"(Those are my names) and it returned "false", but then I tested words with a difference of only one letter, like "julio" and "julis", but it returned "true". I would like to know what I did wrong. thanks in advance.Sorry for not being too specific in the title, I don't know how to get much more specific than thatPS: The code is written in python if that helps
Your biggest problem is here:As soon as any letter in  is found in , you're going to print out  and then , without checking the rest of the letters. So,  and  match because  is in . In fact,  and  also match because  is in .The right logic here is that the words are only anagrams if, after you've checked all of them, none of them failed. Since you're going to  on the first failure, you can just move that to the end of the loop—the only way you'll get past the loop is if you didn't .Also,  isn't defined anywhere. You probably wanted to use ?So, replace your loop with this:… or, better:However, this still isn't right. For example, consider what happens if there are duplicate letters?If you check  against , it's going to pass. After all,  isn't shorter than , and every letter in  is also in . To fix that, you need to replace the  check with a  check:But this still isn't right. What if you try  vs. ? They're the same length, and every letter in  is in , and yet they aren't anagrams.The only way around this is to make sure you only use each letter from  once.You could do that by removing one copy of  each time you use it:This now works. But it's pretty clunky. It would be a lot better if you used a better data structure, like a , that's designed for looking up values and decrementing counts:But once you're using a , you can make this even simpler:
