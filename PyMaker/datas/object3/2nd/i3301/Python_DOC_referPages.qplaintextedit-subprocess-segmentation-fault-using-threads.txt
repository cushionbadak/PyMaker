Segmentation Fault in subprocess.stdout while displaying on QPlainTextEditHi,I am starting a thread to the function shown and streaming its result to a QTextEdit object in the thread. The function sometimes crashes with a segmentation fault for unknown reasons. The make dccommand is a call to the design compiler synthesis tool. If I try to print thelinevariable instead of writing to the plainTextEdit Object the thread runs fine, displaying the result in the terminal window. Any help/advice is welcome......Thank You
You can't use QT things from a python thread. Your options:Send the data back from the thread to your main program, using a  or some other similar synchronization object. Then the main program adds the data to the text widget. Documentation here.Use a QThread, which is the QT equivalent of threads. Documentation here.
You cannot update the Qt GUI from another thread. Fortunately for us, Qt gave us signals, and PyQt gave us , just for this situation. There are a few ways to do it, but I prefer the following style.
Instead of using  you should use  which is GUI friendly so it is not necessary to use a new thread.
