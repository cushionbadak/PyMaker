I want my program to read 2 columns (the first and the second one) and add them to an array. They are dependent on eachother - so they need to be written alongside eachother, as in the first row (both columns) next to eachother, and then the second row and so on.I have managed to write the first column (containing the names) to the array, however have not managed to write the second column to the array.I attempted to append more than one row however it returns the error message 'only accepts one argument'.Any ideas how I can do this so i can reference the score for each name from the csv file

Say you had  as one of the entries in your csv file,  would return .EDITOP has requested (in the comments) for a more complete version of the code. Assuming OP's code already works, I'll modify that code so it works with a dictionary:
