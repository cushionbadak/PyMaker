The exception tells you exactly what went wrong. One of your node's s is an integer instead of  (which according to your type annotations is what  and  should be).The problem here is the .

If you want to check if your program is typed soundly, you need to run mypy on your codebase. It will complain for a few reasons: - because the  and  aren't sThe types of  and  need to be  since they can be  ()It also may be easier to see this if you constructed the tree using named args:Also look into typing.Generic so that you can leverage the type system more when getting  out of your  (and not having to do unsafe casts).
