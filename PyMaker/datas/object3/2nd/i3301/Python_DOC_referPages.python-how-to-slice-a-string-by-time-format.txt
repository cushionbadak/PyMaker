I have this string:And I want to split it by time format (,  and ) which can be different each time.So, I tried to convert it to a list in order to loop through:So, I get this list:I want to remove space and empty char (but it doesn't work as you can see), and get from all that list another list with another three items:First item: Second item: Third item: Of course there can be one, none or even more that three items, depending on the time "word" found in string.This is what I tried to do until now:Thank you in advance !
I am not sure if this is the best solution, but it gets the job done.Sample usage:The  block is just to ensure python2/3 compatibility. The  function is a recipe from the  module documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools-recipes).EditI was able to get rid of the  function by changing the regex a little and using . I hope it makes the code more legible.Usage is the same.
