The current regex matches  in  because  is not preceded with .To stop the pattern from matching inside a word, you may use a a word boundary,  and the fix might look like .Note that identifiers can be matched with , so your pattern can be enhanced likeNote that  or  will make  match ASCII only letters, digits and .See the regex demo.Details - a word boundary - no  + space allowed immediately to the left of the current location - Capturing group 1 (its value will be the result of  call):  - an ASCII letter or  - 1+ word chars - start of a non-capturing group matching a sequence of...  - a dot - an ASCII letter or  - 1+ word chars - ... zero or more times - a  char.
