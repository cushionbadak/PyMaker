I'm looking for something like:  in pythonHow to:   
 returns the first matching element in an array, given a predicate function, or  when there is no match.Python has the  function, which filters an iterable on a predicate, and , which produces the first element of an iterable or an optional default. Combining these give you the equivalent:where  is a callable that returns  when an element matches the search criteria. Demo:If you remove the second argument to , a  exception is raised when there is no matching element.
