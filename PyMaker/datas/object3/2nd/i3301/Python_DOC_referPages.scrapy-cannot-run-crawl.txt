I was running Scrapy on a very simple example code(shown below, from a tutorial website ) to test if it is set up correctly.The code I copied:When I ran the following commandthe following errors happenedI am not sure what's happening and seeking for help on setting up scrapy correctly.
See:https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/3143And:https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/3325And, finally:https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/966Long story short, this is a bug with Twisted for Python 3.7--not Scrapy at all. Scrapy is more of a framework than a stand-alone Python module. Scrapy itself imports a ton of modules that it uses--one of those being Twisted. So, bugs can happen with any number of modules it uses.You are running Python 3.7 which currently is the newest of the new. Not all modules will support Python 3.7 perfectly right away; hence this is the case with Twisted trying to use the new  keyword that is brand new to Python 3.7. See:https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.7.htmlI would recommend installing Python 3.6 for now; then  or  will only install the versions of modules that are more stable with Python 3.6.
Right now scrapy doesn't support Python 3.7 temporarily because  keyword is reserved in python 3.7 and scrapy's dependancy  has not yet resolved this issue.See scrapy issue regarding this: https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/3143Current fix for this is to install Twisted branch that has this fix:you can install the branch with 
another solution from the  side would be to disable the extension causing the error which is the  extension.Just update the following lines in :It is very likely that you are not going to use telnet for your spider, so this shouldn't complicate anything on your project.
