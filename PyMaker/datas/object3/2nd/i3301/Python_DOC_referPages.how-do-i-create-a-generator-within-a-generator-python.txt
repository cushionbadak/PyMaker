If I created a list:and tried to get every value  6 by using a generator:(btw this doesn't work ↑↑↑↑↑)How do I iterate through lists within a list using a generator? If this is not possible, what method can I use in place of this?I have looked here:python generator of generators?, but could not find an answer...
Using  from builtin module :Output:[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]What  does? According manual pages:Make an iterator that returns elements from the first iterable until  it is exhausted, then proceeds to the next iterable, until all of the  iterables are exhausted. Used for treating consecutive sequences as a  single sequence.
in that case, you don't need to create a generator of generator. Just create a double for loop in one generator (to flatten the list, then test for the element values):this double  comprehension syntax needs some using to, comprehensions are generally written "the other way round", but not in the case of loops, hence your confusion. A more general form would be:then to get the first matching element:(to get all the elements, of course you have to iterate on ,  provides the "next" values, like if you're iterating "manually" on your generator)  
to nest two fors in the same generator you must reverse the order
You can combine  and  to create an iterator matching your requirements
Use  to convert the iterator to a list
