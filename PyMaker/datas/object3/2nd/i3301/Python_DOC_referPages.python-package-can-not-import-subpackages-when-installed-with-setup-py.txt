I developed a python package which I want to use in another project. The package structure looks like the following example:The  File contains the -Class which relies on the files in  and  which are imported like The  files just import each python file in it's directory.For example the  of :The  File just imports the Bar Class and executes some methods of it.The file looks like the following:When I run the  file directly from the package it works like a charm.However when I install it in my other project with pip using the command:(I don't want to publish the package to PyPi yet and just want to include the development-version in my other project)and try to import it - I am getting the error: Do I need to export the sub_packages somehow?I use Python 3.6
instead of  use as in  of sub_pkg1 and sub_pkg2 you have already imported  and you are now free to directly import  from sub_pkg1 anywhere in your project.Read more about  and modules here: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html
