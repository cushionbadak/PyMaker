So I am wondering if there is a more "beautiful" way of doing this.Currently I have over a thousand lists  where each individual list looks something like this:Some of the lists contain other animals/strings, and don't have some of the above. It depends.I now wish to make an if statement that says:And this does exactly what it is supposed to. If it finds either "cat" or "cow" in the current list, nothing will get printed. But if it finds neither, a print statement will occur.My problem is that I have several "cow", "cat", and such that I needed to include in my if statement. And if I have 10, as an example, it will become kind of long and ugly to look at. So is there some way to just say: , where  would just be a list of strings that should have been included in the  statement?
You can convert your list to  and the use Ex:Edit as per comment
Perhaps something like this if you want any one of them to match?Returns FalseReturns TrueIf you want both to match, then:Returns FalseReturns True
