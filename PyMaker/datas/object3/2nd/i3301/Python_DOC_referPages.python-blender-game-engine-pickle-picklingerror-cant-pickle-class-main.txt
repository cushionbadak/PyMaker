When trying to run this in bge it raises that error      BUT when i run it with python IDLE there isn't a problem      and i manage to write the pickled class in the file      though i know classes usually can't be pickled      then i even manage to open the file, unpickle it and print      the class' attributes
As this works when run in blender and only fails in the game engine, I would assume that this relates to an optimisation made in the game engines python binding.Following the handling stateful objects example and adding a custom  also fails, indicating that the game engine probably implements custom  to only provide a minimal feature set.The solution would appear to be pickling the objects  directly, you would then also unpickle to the new instances .
