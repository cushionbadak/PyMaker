I'm extremely new to Python and programming in general, and I've been working at this particular issue for about four hours now.I am trying to convert a time (ex. 12:30) to something usable in an "if" statement.Here's what I've tried so far:When attempting to perform that, I get an invalid syntax error.When I attempt to convert the time to an integer , I get an error stating that the int() argument must be a stringThis is just a piece of the entire problem I am working on, but I think I can figure out the rest if I can just get a jumping off point with this issue.Although I don't believe I'm allowed to use datetime on this particular problem; anything would help.EDIT: Corrected int(time)
 is not a valid datatype. Convert it as integer to make it work (8:30 = 8 hours and 30 min = 8*60+30 min)To get it in seconds, like , do the same thing with  in the last line.Due to modulo properties, it's guaranteed that only one "real" time correspond to an hour converted as integer.For your problem, create a function  returning an int, and then compare user entry to  and 
Working with time manually is not trivial. I suggest that you use the  module that supports time conversion, comparison, etc.
You are using a colon where Python expects a number or variable name. In this statement: , you need to put the time values in quotes () since they are non-numerical. Then, however, you will run into the issue of comparing two non-numerical values with your  and  statements. Comparisons only work with actual values, and the colon makes the value into a string instead of an int or float. It would be a better idea to convert the time into an integer by stripping out the colon for comparisons and other manipulation, then you can add the colon back in as necessary. 
My take on the problem (without ):
