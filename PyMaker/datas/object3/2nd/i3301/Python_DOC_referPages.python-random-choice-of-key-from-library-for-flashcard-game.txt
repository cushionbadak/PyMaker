I'm fairly new to python and programming in general, and am trying to create some simple programs. I have decided to build a small flashcard program to aid in my study of русский, and have used a dictionary with english definitions as the key, and the русский equivalent as the value. The program runs but I am struggling to figure how I can randomise the word that gets called. I have tried random.choice(vocabulary) but with little success. I have also tried to turn the dictionary key/value pairs into lists but then struggle to call them using the format I have so far used.Is there a way to randomise the key that gets called using a variation on this script? Further, would a different object type be more useful for such a program? Thanks
 can:Return a random element from the non-empty sequence seq.The only problem is that you don't have a sequence here, you have a dictionary.But a dictionary is an iterable of its keys, so you can directly construct a tuple (or list, or most other kinds of sequences) of its keys:Or, since its items view is an iterable of key-value pairs:For a huge dictionary, this is a bit wasteful, because it copies the keys or items into a tuple just to pick one. But when you're talking about only 3 keys, or even 50000, that isn't going to be a problem, so keep it simple.
You can use the  module's  function: You can call this on a dictionary's  to get a random key in python2, or as abarnert says, change your items to a  (or the keys to a ) before using  in python3. 
prints:either: "to study (imperfective)" ,"to begin (imperfective)" or "to begin (perfective)"and: "изучать", "начинать" and "начать"
