working on a python project, I tried to separate source code and unit tests; here is the project structure:And here is the  file:Then, when I run command , it fails with the following output:The resulting  file looks fine:but it looks like the  is not starting from  folder to find modules to be packaged.Do I have to move  and  files into  folder?But then, what is this  argument for in  function?
You are one step away from a working solution. Addto the  arguments:More info on packages remapping can be found in Listing whole packages section.However, it looks like you made the  dir to a python package by placing an  in it. Was that intentional? Do you have import statements likeor similar, using  as package name? Then beware that the imports will fail once you install your built package because  is omitted when including sources on build. I see two ways:either remove , use  like described above to make  to the top level package, omit  in imports (should you get any errors, just remove  dir and recreate it with ), oruse  as top level package: don't use , look for packages in the project root dir ( without explicitly stating ).
