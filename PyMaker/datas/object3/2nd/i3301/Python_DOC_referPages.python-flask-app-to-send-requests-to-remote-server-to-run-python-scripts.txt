I'm writing a script to automate some command line commands in Python. At the moment I'm doing calls thus:However I need to run some commands on a remote machine. Manually, I would log in using ssh and then run the commands. How would I automate this in Python? I need to log in with a (known) password to the remote machine, so I can't just use , I'm wondering if there's a module I should be using?
I will refer you to paramikosee this question
Or you can just use commands.getstatusoutput:I used it extensively and it works great.In Python 2.6+, use .
Have you had a look at Fabric? It allows you to do all sorts of remote stuff over SSH using python.
I found paramiko to be a bit too low-level, and Fabric not especially well-suited to being used as a library, so I put together my own library called spur that uses paramiko to implement a slightly nicer interface:If you need to run inside a shell:
All have already stated (recommended) using paramiko and I am just sharing a python code (API one may say) that will allow you to execute multiple commands in one go.to execute commands on different node use : You will see one TODO, which I have kept to stop the execution if any of the commands fails to execute, I don't know how to do it. please share your knowledgeThank you!
I have used paramiko a bunch (nice) and pxssh (also nice).  I would recommend either.  They work a little differently but have a relatively large overlap in usage.
Have a look at , a wrapper we developed around  that provides type annotations and some minor gimmicks (reconnecting SFTP, md5 etc.): https://pypi.org/project/spurplus/
paramiko finally worked for me after adding additional line, which is really important one (line 3):Make sure that paramiko package is installed.Original source of the solution: Source
