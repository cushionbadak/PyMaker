I am currently learning Python and have come across a very strange problem (to me at least). When I type this code:in an IDLE edit window and run it using IDLE, it all works fine and I need to type my function in at the prompt in order for it to start.However, when I write the same code in VS Code and run it using the Run  Python file in Terminal option all I get is:I have also tried the Code Runner extension and that gives me a blank output page and no way to type in the function.For example: And the output that I expect should be:  (Because a vowel would be present in the word, therefore True)However, nothing happens. I am a beginner and I could not come up with an explanation or a solution to this problem. I apologize if a question like this has been asked but I have not come across a similar problem.
You are defining function  but VisualStudio doesn't know how to run it.Try adding this in your code:Here is manual page about the word .
