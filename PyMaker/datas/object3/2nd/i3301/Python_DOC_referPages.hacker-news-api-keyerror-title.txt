Just starting to learn python, and I am starting to learn the web-based side of it.Following the instructions I have, i keep getting a KeyError: 'title' on line 18. Now I see it as the request not returning a title so it gives an error, how would I write it up to give a generic description if there is no 'title'???Status Code: 200     401     Traceback (most recent call last):        File "C:\Users\Shit Head\Documents\Programming\Tutorial Files\hn_submissions.py", line 18, in <module>          'title': response_dict['title'],       KeyError: 'title'      [Finished in 1.2s]

If default is not given, it defaults to , so that this method never raises a .So, instead of this:… you do this:Under the covers, this is just a more convenient way to write something you could have done anyway. The following are all pretty much equivalent:This is worth knowing because Python only usually provides shortcuts like  for really common cases like looking things up in a dictionary. If you wanted to do the same thing with, say, a list that may be empty or have one item, or a file that might or might not exist, or a regular expression that might return a match with a group string or might return None, you'd need to do things the long way.
