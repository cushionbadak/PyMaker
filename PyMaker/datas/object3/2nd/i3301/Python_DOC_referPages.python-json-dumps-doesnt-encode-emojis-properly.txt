Why does json.dumps() encode emojis into unicode? See code and output below:{'key': 'hello ðŸ˜€'}'{"key": "hello \ud83d\ude00"}'I have tried  and some variants (...) but it didn't change the output much. Im working on Python 3.6.1
However, the ASCII variant is more portable, since you are almost guaranteed you won't have encoding problems. Docs
