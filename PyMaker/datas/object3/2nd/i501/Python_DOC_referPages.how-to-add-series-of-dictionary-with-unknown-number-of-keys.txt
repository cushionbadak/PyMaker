I have created following dictionary , consisting of  objects:I would like to perfrom . My problem is that I want to perfrom bit-wise addition for any possible number of keys in the dictionary. (I.e. it can be  or  or  etc.). In any case, the value for each key has the same length, and all the  are boolean.
There are many advantages to working with a  instead of a dictionary of  objects. Converting from the latter to the former is trivial:While the  constructor is pretty smart about parsing the input data, you could explicitly tell it you are initializing from a dictionary by using the  :Now you can apply  using the  method along any axis you want:The same goes for  using :
There is a simple one-line solution to your problem (if you want cumulative  operation over columns e.g. , ,  and so on):Using , if any value is , all coming after it will be  as well as it's the smallest value.Original dataframe:Cumulative :First column is , second is , third , last is .
