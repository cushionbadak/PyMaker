I would like to know how to remove specific words from a string in python without deleting them from other words they composed.For example if I want to remove 'is' from the following sentence:The .replace() function delete 'is' in 'isabelle' and in 'Paris':It gives me  But I want . Is there a way to delete only 'is'?I tried:  with a space each side of 'is' but in this case 'is' is not removed in the string Thank you
Use a regular expression instead of replacing an ordinary string. You can then use  in the regexp to match word boundaries.
