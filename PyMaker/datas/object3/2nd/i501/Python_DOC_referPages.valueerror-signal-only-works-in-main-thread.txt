This means that signals canâ€™t be used as a means of inter-thread communication. You can use the synchronization primitives from the threading module instead.Besides, only the main thread is allowed to set a new signal handler.I believe the  method is executed in its own thread since the message is received asynchronously.In short, don't use signals from threads. Use the synchronization primitives from the threading module instead. If you can't avoid using signals then receive the STOMP message synchronously on the main thread instead of using a .
