I am writing a program that calculates the factorial of a number, I am able to display the correct answer, however along with the answer I need the actual calculation to display, I am having trouble with that.  So for example, when the user enters 4, I need it to display as:I have been trying to figure out the right code, but do not know what to do.Here is the code I have so farnumber = int(input("Enter a number to take the factorial of: "))Right now, it displays the correct answer, however I need for it to include the equation as well as follows: 4! = 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 = 24
The simplest approach is to construct the string as you are iterating:Note that this method appends an unwanted 'x' after the last factor. This is removed by .Alternatively, you could append this one-line solution to the end of your code. It uses the join method of the string class to concatenate an array of strings:
As you loop through the numbers to be multiplied, you can append each number's character to a string containing the equation, e.g ans, and print it at last. At the end of the code, I omitted the last letter because I didn't want an extra 'x' to be displayed.
You can append each value to the list and then print the equation using the f-string:
