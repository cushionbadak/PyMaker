Natural Text
I am looking for a way to save the data that was typed into an  box on my Tkinter GUI and then immediately load that data back into the  box when the program is opened after it has been closed. I have done some research and found that the  module is the best way to do this kind of stuff. Here is my code so far:Essentially my code just saves the data into a  file after the save button is clicked. How would I load the same data so if I typed "test" and closed the program and then opened it it would still say "test"? This probably the code to load the data, but I do not know how to incorporate it here: 
First, the code you provided has a syntax error. It's  and not If you want to insert text in your Entry widget, you can use . It will insert the string in  at the end of what is written in your Entry widget. You can open the file, if it exists, and then, after you create your Entry widget you check if there is something to insert and then, if so, insert it.EDIT: As @martineau said, we should avoid open a file without closing it after an interaction. You could use something like the code below to read the file content and then insert it in your widget.
This could be done using  like this:I added a Clear and Load  along with similarly named functions to make things easier to use (and test).Note: A statement like the  you have in your code would result in  being assigned the value  because the  doesn't return anything. That caused no harm, but only because  wasn't ever referenced again, but in general you will need to call  (or ) in a separate statement just like you did for the  widget .
