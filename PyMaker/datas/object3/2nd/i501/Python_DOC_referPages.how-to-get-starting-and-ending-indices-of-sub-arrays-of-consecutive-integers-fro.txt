I'm new to programming, I have a numpy array as (the first column is the indices)I need to get starting and ending indices of sub-arrays of consecutive integers, such as 0 and 3, 4 and 6 etc. I tried to do it like thisIt doesn't work, any suggestions?
Here's a one-line solution using itertools:How does this work?we apply  over the sequence of indices , i.e.  will give the values where our chosen predicate function is false i.e. we want to see the indices where values are not consecutive. Hence we give it the function .We just need to tweak that so that it also evaluates to False at (i==0), hence we add the gating term: finally we wrap all this in  to convert the iterator back into a list
To get first element of an array use: , to get last element , where a is an array.
Here is one way. Note that I used Python lists to accumulate the desired indices and converted them to numpy arrays only at the end. I did this since numpy arrays are not designed to add new members--they work best with fixed sizes. There are more pythonic ways to do this, but I tried to keep with the knowledge that you showed in your question. One strange result of this code is that if  is an empty array,  becomes  and  becomes . My code works as expected for non-empty arrays.The result of that is
