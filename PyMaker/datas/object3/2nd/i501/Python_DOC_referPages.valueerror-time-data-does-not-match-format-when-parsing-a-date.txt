When I try to parse a string to a datetime, I do this (having imported datetime before):However, I receive this errorValueError: time data '22/01/2019 17:00' does not match format '%d/%m/%y %H:%M'anyone know why?
The  should be capitalized. This is referenced in the Python docs found hereThis works fine
You need to use a capital  for a 4 digit year (lowercase  is for a 2 digit year like ). So:strptime docs
The above is correct. However, to avoid these kind of errors you can use dateutil.parser, which can automatically guess the correct format string. You can install it by doing pip install python-dateutil
