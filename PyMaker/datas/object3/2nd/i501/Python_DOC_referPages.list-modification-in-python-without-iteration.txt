You can use strftime to help you format your datetime object and then append them in the list like you did at first.E.g.,will yield:More information about formatting see hereThis will only help you in converting the datetime object to string and will not filter out anything. Also, since Lists are Python's representation of arrays and fetching it's elements is not possible without iteration or indexing.
