I have a Python module that I call like thisAnd inside the  module, I need to query the command that was used to call the module. For example,  would return .I've seen several posts suggest  but  fails in multiple ways. returns the full path the  file. I need the raw command for debugging purposes and calling  is not the same as calling In my production use-case,  is returning  instead of the name or path of any Python module. I'm still in the middle of troubleshooting why this is happening but I've already made a case for why  isn't what I'm looking for anyway.Another popular solution is to use  to rebuild the command-line input but I can't use it because I don't control how the Python code is being called. The solution must be generic.Does anyone know how to get the raw command that is used to call a Python script from within the Python script? If possible, the solution should be compatible with Windows.
This won't be compatible with windows, but in GNU/Linux or Solaris (credit: tripleee) you should be able to use /proc/self/cmdline to see exactly how you were called :
I found something that may be helpful for Windows users: https://bytes.com/topic/python/answers/706727-get-complete-command-lineI'll paste the code again, here:The  solution worked for me. Another commenter pointed out that pywin32 also has its own flavor: I didn't test it but that may work better.
