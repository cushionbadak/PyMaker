I have different products, there are 4 different ways they can be presented.1/ABC123456ABC123456ABC123456/11/ABC123456/1In all of these cases I want to extract "ABC" and "123" from the product name. I know that I should be able to use reg exp for this, but I am not sure how to construct the pattern. Thank you for the help.
You can search for a group of 3 letters followed by 3 digits: import reOutput:search looks for the first location where the pattern matches, so you don't have to care about the  that could appear at the start of your reference.
