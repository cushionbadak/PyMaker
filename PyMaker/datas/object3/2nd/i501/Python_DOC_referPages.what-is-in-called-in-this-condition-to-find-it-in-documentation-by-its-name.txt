Natural Text
I want to check if some words are in a text file,but I need to make the search case-insensitive,so, I need to know how the "in" inside the if condition works, and see its documentation for an option like that.But I couldn't find it by searching google,I tried to search using terms like "conditional statements python"but still couldn't find it.the file:the output:
You can use  for case-insensitive search. You don't need to use  as a file pointer, by default, points to beginning of file when you open it. If you are bothered about exhausting the file pointer, read file contents to a variable, and use the variable in loop:
This is called the "contains" operator, a membership test operator. It doesn't really come with options; it simply checks if something is present in something else - but you can "normalize" these "somethings" e.g. by converting both to lower case (or upper case, or Unicode normalized case folded or whatever is suitable for your particular application) before checking for containment.Seeking back in the file repeatedly is extremely inefficient, though. You want to read the file into memory once:... or perhaps examine a line at a time:This will be more robust because you can handle arbitrarily large files, as long as every individual line will fit into memory.Notice how a  loop can have an  branch, by the by.As a usability improvement, the message you print should probably identify which search word was or wasn't found in each iteration.
