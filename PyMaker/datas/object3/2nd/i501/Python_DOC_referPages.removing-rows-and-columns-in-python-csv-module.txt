I promise I searched and read several pages of google before I came to make this post. Due diligence has been done I swear.I am trying to open a CSV file in python, read the file, make changes to it, and then write out a new file.I got this far:But I'm struggling to get any further. I want to remove certain columns, but I cannot comprehend how python will know the difference between a row and a column. For example, the columns are , etc. I only want . I tried but I kept getting the following error: IndexError: list index out of range[I would also like to replace blank cells with a *, but the column thing is the priority]Note that I cannot use PandasIf possible I would really appreciate if someone could not just tell me the code but explain it to me so I can figure it out further myself.TLDR: How can I remove empty rows from the CVS file and write only certain columns into the new file? INPUT:
I have tried to provide you an answer as close as possible than what you have done so far.  Prototype:explanations:Before the line  where you output the row in the output csv file. I have added the line  where I overwrite the content of the array  by an array containing only 3 cells, those cells are respectively taken from the , ,  columnsOn top of this, I have added a the if condition  to check that you have at least enough elements in your row to extract the columns until .input:output:
This line will not  and will write the line ignoring non existing values:This line will not  and will write the line replacing empty values with a star:This line will not  either but won't write the line:This line will not  either but won't write any line at all:
You can use a  and  to selectively modify and write specific columns using their header/column names.I'll use  to simulate the filesNote that the DictWriter  parameter needs to be set to  because there are extra keys/fields in the original.If the csv file does not have a header row, you have to specify the field names for the DictWriter.
