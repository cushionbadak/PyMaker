I have the following python file  which stores a bunch of constants:I'm trying to import all of the variables and add them to a list called . This is what I have so far but if I add a constant to  then I need to remember to add it to the  list:Is there a better approach here?
The solution would be to create the list in the  file. It would like as follows:Then you can simply import the list in your main file.
One approach would be to use the  module. If your  module contains:You can import those as a module:Due to the bloat of the "dunder" attributes (,  etc.), it can be useful to include the  attribute.
If the variables start with uppercase, you can do thisand you don't have to remember to add them to .
Somewhat similar to other responses, but no other modules are required.Note that here the import statement should be  and not .
