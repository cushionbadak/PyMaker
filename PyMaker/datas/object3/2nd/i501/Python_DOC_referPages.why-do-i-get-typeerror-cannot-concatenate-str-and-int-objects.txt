This question already has an answer here:How can I concatenate str and int objects?                    3 answers                When I enter my variable into the line I get the TypeError. I expect it to just take the input then multiply it by 7 and give the final number, but I just get the error. I barely understand str and int so an explanation of each would help too.
Convert the number to a string:As the error states, you cannot concatenate strings and ints:TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'int' objects?
