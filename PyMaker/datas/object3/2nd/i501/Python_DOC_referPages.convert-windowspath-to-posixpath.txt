I am using pathlib to manage my paths in my Python project using the  class.When I am using Linux, everything works fine. But on Windows, I have a little issue.At some point in my code, I have to write a JavaScript file which lists the references to several other files. These paths have to be written in POSIX format. But when I do  on Windows, The path is written in Windows format.Do you know a simple way to convert a  to a  with pathlib?
pathlib has an  method for this purpose:Apart from this, you can generally convert between Windows and POSIX paths by calling the appropriate constructor. The documentation states thatYou cannot instantiate a  when running on Unix, but you can instantiate . [or vice versa]So use the  class constructor:
Python  pathlib  if you want to manipulate Windows paths on a Unix machine (or vice versa) -  you cannot instantiate a WindowsPath when running on Unix, but you can instantiate .
