This question already has an answer here:Python glob multiple filetypes                    26 answers                I have a folder containing files in different types. I only need to deal with image files (jpg, png, jpeg, JPG, ...). For that, I use  to get only files with 'jpg', 'png', ... extensions.The problem is that I have to use  many times (as much as the image extensions number) to get all the images:  Is there a way to use  in a more optimized form (something like ) or is there a simpler function to use it instead of ?
