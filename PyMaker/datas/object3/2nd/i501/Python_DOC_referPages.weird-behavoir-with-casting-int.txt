This question already has an answer here:What's the difference between str.isdigit, isnumeric and isdecimal in python?                    4 answers                I am using Python 3.6.3 and I encounter a weird behavior from  and  with the following code: I understand the bug and I know that I can skip the error with . My question is that if  return true then the char\string should be cast without error or  should return false. Otherwise said  and  should be coherent.
This is exactly as documented: Return true if all characters in the string are digits  and there is at least one character, false otherwise. Digits include  decimal characters and digits that need special handling, such as the  compatibility superscript digits. This covers digits which cannot be  used to form numbers in base 10, like the Kharosthi numbers. Formally,  a digit is a character that has the property value Numeric_Type=Digit  or Numeric_Type=Decimal.
