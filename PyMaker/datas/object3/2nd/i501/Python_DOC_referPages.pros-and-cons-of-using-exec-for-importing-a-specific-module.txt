I would like to find out disadvantages of using  for imports. One of the files serves as interface towards real implementations of specific functionalities depending on chosen project (framework is intended to work on several projects). First use-case goes like this:This way I don't have to hard code anything except the variable  which is injected in the interface-module itself.This is the other way:This way I have to alter this interface-file each time new project is added to be supported.
If you need programmatic way to import modules, please use  or  (for really specific cases). Reasons — don't re-invent the wheel, there's way to do what you want without . If your  variable coming from outer world,  is a huge security issue.Wildcard imports considered bad practice — it makes harder to maintain your codebase afterwards.Oversimplified example of issues with  by executing arbitrary code:yes, your example is harder to forge, but problem stays — giving python arbitrary code to execute is overkill (with potential security gap), when you have tool built exactly for your purpose — programatically importing modules.
