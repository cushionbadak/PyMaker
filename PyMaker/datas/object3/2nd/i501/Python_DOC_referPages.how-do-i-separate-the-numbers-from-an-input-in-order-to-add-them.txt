I am trying to have the user input a series of numbers (separated by commas) to receive the total of them. I have tried (with no luck):If the user inputs 5.5,6,5.5 the expected output will be 17.
After you  the values by comma into a list, you need to convert them from strings to numbers.  You can do that withFor reference, see List Comprehensions in Python.(Also, you shouldn't use  as a variable name, since that's a function in Python.)
You're almost there.After splitting, the values will still be strings, so you have to map them to float.Output:Side note: Please don't name your variables  or , otherwise you will shadow the python built-ins!
You have to convert the inputs to float:
You have to convert to numbers before adding them together.For example, you could convert them all into s:
OUTPUT:
It's hard to know what went wrong w\o a sample of the error\output code.I think the issue is in getting the sum of list (very bad name btw) when it's a list of strings.please try the followingThis code will work when expecting integers, if you want floats then change the list comprehension.Try not to name objects with the same name of standard objects such as list,int,str,float etc...
