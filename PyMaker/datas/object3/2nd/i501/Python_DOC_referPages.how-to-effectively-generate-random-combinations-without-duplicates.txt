The issue is that the code sometimes creates a list with 3 numbers, or 4, or sometimes 5, it seems to be random.   I should also mention we are not allowed to be usin grandom.sample, or random.shuffle
Try using a while loop with a condition that checks for  the length of lisinstead of your for loop
The function  does what you want:
I know there are lots of answers already, but here's another way to do this:Hope it helps!
Use  if you are looking for method that works and is faster:Alternatively, you can use  with :
You don't want to add random, unique integers 5 times; you want to add random, unique integers until your list contains 5 elements. This'll do it:
So your problem:It won't add the same number twice. But since you use a  it will only repeat 5 times, regardless of if it added a unique number or not. You need to measure the length of the list, so it will always add 5 random, unique numbers to the list. You have the code mostly right, but all you need to do is replace: with: Make sure to delete the  though. It will cause an error if you don't.Here's the code:
