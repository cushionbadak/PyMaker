I have a list of numbers from which I have extracted common factors of all these numbers. For example, from list , I have produced .I have another list of integers,  and I wish to extract the numbers from  of which all elements of  are factors. So if , then I should end up with , as these are the numbers in  of which 2 and 4 are factors.However, I am struggling to figure out how to implement this step in a list comprehension, even in pseudocode. It should look something like this: . It's the if statement that I'm having trouble with because I believe it should contain a for loop, but I can't think of a concise way to write it.I have managed to do it the long way, using a nested for loop and it looks like this: is the list I am trying to produce by converting the above code into a list comprehension. How can I do that, if it is even possible?
It is what you are looking for:
It might be more efficient to calculate the least common multiple of the elements of  first, especially if  has more than 2 elements:
So basically, you need to have a function returning the factors from a list of numbers. This function would return a list. And then you simply need to find the intersection of both list. Since each factor is unique, I suggest to use a set implementation which will be more efficient. To resume, the code would look like:
