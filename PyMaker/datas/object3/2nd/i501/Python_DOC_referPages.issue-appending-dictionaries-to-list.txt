Natural Text
I'm trying to loop through a text file block by block (5 blocks) to capture the data in key value pairs (using dictionaries). However, only the last block gets appended to the list of dictionaries 5 timesI've tried moving the dictionary initialization inside the loop but it  doesn't workText File:I want to get the text in key-value pairs preferably in a list of dictionaries grouped by block
First we ignore the concept of grouping by blocks and try to get every valid line as a dictionary. We'll store this in a variable .This will give an output like this:Now we find out where the separators ( that is, lines without ":" ) are placed. We'll store this in a variable .This will give a string where "1" stands for a normal line and "0" stands for a separator.   Next we add "0" separators to our list of dictionaries according to the pattern stored in . We'll call this .Now we have something like this: So we can find the indices for the "0" strings and use them to split this list into a list of lists. We'll also use a filter to remove the "0" separator from the result.  So now  has our desired output, as we can see by running  :So here's all the code we have written:
