This question already has an answer here:How to I disable and re-enable console logging in Python?                    12 answers                I want my code to only log debug level messages when some variable is set to true. Is it possible? Here is my config for the logging module. Right now, I have to comment and uncomment at different places in my code to enable or disable the logging...It would be even better if this variable can be an integer, and when set, only logger with level same or higher will function... Is it possible?Thanks!
