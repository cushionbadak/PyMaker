I am most certainly a newbie when it comes to python. About 1 week into learning it and realize there are a lot of tools here I should be using. One of them is numpy.darray. However i am having difficuly applying it to my problem. I have the following array data structure: string -> value. That is I want something like a["string1"] = 4.5. I then need to associate this array to an object where "attr" -> a["string1"], so in the end I have the followingb["attr"] -> (a["string1"] -> 4.5)This way if I were to make a call like the followingb["attr"]["string1"] it will return 4.5In other words a 2D numpy array where I can use strings instead of integers to access my array. Or perhaps there is another better way to do this in python? 
You are looking for dictionaries. Please refer to Data Structures: 5.5. Dictionaries. Dictionaries allow you to not only store numeric values but also other data structures as lists, arrays, data frames or dictionaries itself.Your example:
As the other answer states, you most likely want a dictionary. However, just for your information, there exist NumPy-like structures that can be indexed by strings, namely those offered by Pandas,  and  (for more than two dimensions there is xarray). For example, using a  object:
