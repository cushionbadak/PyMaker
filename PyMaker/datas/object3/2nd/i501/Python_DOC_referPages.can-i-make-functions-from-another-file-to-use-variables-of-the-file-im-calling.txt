I'm learning opencv and to make it easy for me to not have to scroll through hundreds of lines of code, I've made two files named file1.py and file2.py.All the functions I want to use are in file1.py and I'm calling them from file2.py. Functions in file1.py are:There's a lot more code having same problem (which I'll explain in a moment) in file1.py which I omitted for sake of space.I know I can modify main() and pass img to it but the problem starts at draw_shape() which is associated with cv2.setMouseCallback and gets called automatically. So I can't just pass variables, like ix, drawing etc. which, when I was calling main() in file1.py itself, were global in that case, to draw_shape() myself.But now as I've made file2.py and I want to call main() from there, I'm not able to pass those variables anymore.The code in file2.py is as:Any suggestions how I could make main() and draw_shape() to use variables, I've declared by the same names as required by them, from file2.py (or if any other way to pass variables to them)?
Python packaging allows you to import files from another file using:However, the more pythonic way is to put it on the same file.You can read more on packages and modules in Python - here.
If this is how you’re structuring your code you will need to do the followingBut like hodiser said. Just put them in one file, you’d end up having hundreds if not thousands of files with just a paragraphs length of code in them.
