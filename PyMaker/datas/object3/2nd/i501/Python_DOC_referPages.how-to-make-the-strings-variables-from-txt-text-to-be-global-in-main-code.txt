But i have tried to do that, and I do get error with variable, when i did this:And tried to use here:I do get this in the terminal.My whole Code:My question would be how to use these functions as global, that I can use them without the defining?Password, Username, Ballance, Regtime, Role, Ban.
You are trying to declare global variables with the same name as your functions. This is why you get the output  - you are printing the function called .You need to rename the global variables to something else, or better yet, use a class to collect the functions as methods, with attributes instead of global variables. You could try something like the following:You would use this class like this:You can add the code to initialise the attributes in the  method (either with a default value like , or by prompting the user with ). Then as well as  methods, you can add methods to mutate the state, like this:It sounds like you would benefit a lot from a good tutorial on Python classes, or about object-oriented programming in general. You should make sure you understand what  and the  method do above.
