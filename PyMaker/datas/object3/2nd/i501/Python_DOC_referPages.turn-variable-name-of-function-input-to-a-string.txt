This question already has an answer here:Getting the name of a variable as a string                    15 answers                I want to make a function in Python that will print information about a variable given to it elegantly. If I did this for dictionaries, I might command and receiveBut I'm having difficulty finding any straightforward way of extracting the name that an input variable had in the system before it was given to a function.Some questions have come close to asking what I'm wondering about, but the answers on Variable name to string in Python either make use of not actually needing what I'm asking for or confess to being bad practice.
In Python, function objects have a  attribute. So you might try that.Below there is a solution that is very hacky but could work for things other than functions -- maybe it will be useful too?So, one idea (although it isn't smart about cases where variables have multiple names, and it also won't work on expressions that are not variables, and also it should not be thought of as "fast") is as follows:This accepts anything, not just functions, and looks through the global and local symbol tables to see if what you're looking for is there.Since you're also printing type info, you might like to check out the type builtin function, which will give you that info.
