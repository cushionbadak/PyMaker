I am trying to get python3 running on my EspressoBin single board computer (aarch64). I have built a linux distribution using Marvell's openembedded distribution and included .The problem is that python's search paths/environment variables are not being set. If I try to start python3, I get:If, however, I do:Then everything magically works.So the question is... where/how are these things normally being set? I tried comparing to Ubuntu, but for some reason those environment variables aren't even present at all! I checked the docs on sys.path and it says that  is populated from PYTHONPATH, "plus an installation-dependent default". So I'm guessing Ubuntu's "installation-dependent default" has the correct paths pre-populated?My current solution is to just add those two environment variables to , as well as  (for ssh connections), but this seems like a hacky workaround and I want to do it right.
The path  to python3.5 does not look default, "By default, the libraries are searched in   and  " sourceSo I guess that it could be related to that and if you could reinstall or modify it to be installed in  instead of  you wouldn't need to set those two environment variables.
Starting with Modules/getpath.c in Python source tree would not be a bad idea.Oh, and: there seems to be a version mismatch? Python is 3.6, yet you provide 3.5 modules to it?
