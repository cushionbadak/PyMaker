In python, I am unable to understand the operator precedence. The above expression returns {1,2,3,4}. However, I thought the operator | shall be executed before - but this doesn't seem like happening. When I apply parenthesis, it returns me the desired output, i.e. {1,3,4}So, my question is why is this happening and what is the operator (for set operators like -, |, &, ^, etc) precedence when applying set operations. 
python operator precedence rules give priority to  operator and then to bitwise  operator:Now we have a  with , overloaded with , and , oveloaded with :The question now became: why do the same rules of precedence apply?This is because python evaluates operator expressions applying the same rules precedence for all classes that overload the standard operators:gives:
