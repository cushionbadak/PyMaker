You will get a small json response back when you go to this site https://reqres.in/api/users/2I am saving the response in a variable(actual). I have also put the response in another variable(expected).Both responses are same. I am changing the values to test failed cases. The ultimate goal is to compare 2 and make sure they match.I have 2 functions, 1 compares keys and value of both dictionaries and the other function sorts the dictionaries.  Code below:Problem: The test passes when there is no difference.However if there is any difference the order goes crazy. Here is an example where I changed data to dat inside expected response:Expected data  but got dat  Expected id  but got last_name  Expected 2  but got WeaverShould the sort function be more specific rather than using sort_keys=True?By the way thought about **args but I don't think that is a good choice in this scenario.Thank You for your expert comment and time.
I advise to use unittest and avoid using so much nested for loopsAt this point, the will get you this :Now, you can easily make test in a class. 
Key order is not guaranteed in Python versions under 3.7; you should use collections.OrderedDict when you need to create an object that remembers key order.In Python 3.7 the insertion ordered is preserved, so your keys will always match.
