This question already has an answer here:Why doesn't calling a Python string method do anything unless you assign its output?                    2 answers                I'm using Python's NLP library - Spacy. I'm trying to replace noun chunks in an article. Noun chunks look like this: 'the most secure facial recognition'. I would like to replace them by something like this: 'the_most_secure_facial_recognition' (underlines instead of spaces)So I wrote this piece of code:When I run it, nothing is replaced in doc2. Am I doing something wrong?
 doesn't modify the existing string, but instead returns a new string.So this won't work:But this will:This is the relevant documentation:str.replace(old, new[, count])Return a copy of the string with all occurrences of substring old replaced by new. If the optional argument count is given, only the first count occurrences are replaced.https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.replace
