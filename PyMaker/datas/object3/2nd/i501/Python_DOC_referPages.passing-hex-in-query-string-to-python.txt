When you try to convert something into utf-8 there can be some problems because some bytes sequences aren't valid UTF-8 symbols. For example  throws and an error. When Python encodes/decodes some byte sequences you can specify what should happen when it hit some invalid sequence. The  by default use for this errors approach called . The  aproach just replace every byte in invalid sequence with  which is in bytes equivalent to . There is other way around and use aproach called  which map invalid bytes into valid UTF-8 symbols (U+DC80 to U+DCFF) and then in encoding to the bytes it can translate those symbols back to original bytes. Here is you code with this approach:Full documentation for encoding/decoding error handling is in Python documentation.
