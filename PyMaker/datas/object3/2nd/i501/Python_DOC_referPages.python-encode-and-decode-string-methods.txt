Learning Python, increasingly frustrated with it's documentation.For the following script:1) Where is the documentation for these encode() and decode() methods?2) I've tested for the data type of the variables using print(type(utf_string)) and realise that I am working with both strings and bytes.3) How do I approach finding out which class these methods belong to? I've tried searching Google for 'Python 3 string methods' and 'Python decode method' with no joy. I need to know an approach so I can find out the class the method belongs to, then easily find the documentation for this. Otherwise I don't really know how to use the method.
Your variable  is not a string, it is of type . That is what the  prefix means.  is a method of  objects and the default encoding is UTF-8 but you can specify other encodings.Your variable  is a string.  is a string method. The default encoding is UTF-8 but you can specify other encodings. Together these two methods, as you have discovered, enable back-and-forth translation between , which is  immutable like a string, but is a sequence of small integers, and strings, which represent Unicode codepoints. Both methods are documented at in the Python standard library docs.  The Python Standard Library has, in general, exemplary documentation, and that documentation should be your first port of call when you have a question like this.
Documentation for both can be found here. Search for 'bytes.decode' and 'str.encode'.Apparent from (1).You may use , e.g. , in python shell to see methods (and other things) available for the corresponding object type.
