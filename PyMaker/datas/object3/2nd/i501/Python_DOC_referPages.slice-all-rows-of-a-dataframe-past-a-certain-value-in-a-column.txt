I am trying to find a more pandorable way to get all rows of a DataFrame past a certain value in the a certain column (the  column in this case). I want to slice a DataFrame of GDP statistics to get all rows past the first quarter of 2000 (). Currently, I'm doing this by getting the index number of the value in the  column that equals  (see below). This seems way too convoluted and there must be an easier, simpler, more idiomatic way to achieve this. Any ideas?  Current Method:Output:Also, after the DataFrame has been sliced, the indices now start at 212. Is there a method to renumber the indices so they start at 0 or 1? 
The following is equivalent:
As pointed in the comments you can use the new awesome method query()  that  with pandas.eval method that  that uses only Python  expressions.
