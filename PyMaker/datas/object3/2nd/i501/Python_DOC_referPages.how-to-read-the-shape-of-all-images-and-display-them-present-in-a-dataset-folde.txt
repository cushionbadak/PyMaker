I am trying to train my image dataset on google colab. I have the dataset folder present in colab. When trying to read the images from the directory in colab, I am just able to read the file name of all the images. However, if I try extracting the shape of the images in an array, it gives different errors with different approaches. I have tried using os library and PIL.Image and even pickle, but I am still not able to sort or even guess what could be the issue. The errors which I am getting are:1) AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'read'  2) AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'seek'Both when using  function in a for loop and picking up the files from the resultant list of all files present in the path.3) FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '7119-220.jpg'This seems weird as it is looking out specifically for the same file each time I run the code. By using try and except for this  I don't get any output.Question: What's the mistake that I am not getting?This piece works for just counting the number of image files.This code works better if I specify a particular image file in the directory to be plotted, but not for all.
 yields a 3-tuple . Therefore, you should try to open  instead of :If you need a  with shape  and you want to stick to , you can do this:Pay attention that it requires all images to have the same .
