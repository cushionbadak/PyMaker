I am in the process of trying to port a  app to  to utilise . I don't think my current approach is working, as my entire function chain is written without async in mind - consider the following:If  and its whole chain of function calls are not declared as , am I actually getting any benefit from my route being declared as ?
To run a blocking synchronous function from asyncio, without blocking the main event loop, you can use  to run the blocking function in a  or ` (i.e. in its own thread or process).From within the async function you want to call it from:The first argument  is to tell it to use the default executor for the loop. Obviously  will still have to wait for  to complete, but while it is waiting, other async tasks will be able to run in event-loop.
