What is the typecode  of a dictionary?I don't know what to put at . Is there another way it can be done or is it not possible? I don't want a  of s, I want an  of them.

As the other comments have indicated, a dictionary of dictionaries would be your best bet. You would first define your individual dictionaries like the following:Then to define an array in which the keys are the indexes:Note: The indexes can match array notation, starting from 0, if you choose.Then, you may access dictionary elements as such (in example of printing every element):This is probably your best option if you do not want a list. However, if for some reason it really does need to be an array of dictionaries, then visit the link @meowgoesthedog posted.
