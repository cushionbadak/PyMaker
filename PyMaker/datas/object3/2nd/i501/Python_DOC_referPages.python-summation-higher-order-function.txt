I'm writing an iterative solution for summation, and it seems to give the correct answer. But I'm told by my tutor that it's giving the wrong result for . I went to google but I'm still unsure what exactly it means...  Here is the recursive code I wrote:This is the iterative version I wrote that gives the wrong results for  - Edit: accumulate_iter gives the wrong results when  is used for combinerHoping if someone could provide a solution for this iterative version of 
You  works fine when the combiner is commutative, but it gives different result when the combiner is non-commutative. That's because the recursive  combine elements from the back to the front, but the iterative version combine them from the front to the back.So what we need to do is to make  combine from behind, and following is a rewritten :
