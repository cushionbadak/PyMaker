So I'm using python secrets library so I can generate token, so I want to add it as a default like thisstrange thing it will generate 43 characters rather than 32, so can anyone help me understand why?Thanks
That  argument must point to a callable, not a function call with arguments (which are only evaluated once when Django starts). You need to write your own wrapper function and refer to that instead. For example:Refer to this answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/12654998/4082726Regarding the length: 's argument is the number of bytes, not characters. According to the documentation this means roughly 1.3 characters per byte, so 32 * 1.3 = ~42.
