Here is a  subclass which delegates its item getting to .The above works fine, although I was under the impression that I could directly assign  to .This raises the following:I believed this breaks because  is a class and not a function, but the message shows the  was raised from calling .At which point did the  protcol call  with a single argument?
A function can be used as a method because it has a  attribute. The class  doesn't have a  attribute:and so cannot be a method.When invoking an attribute with a  method, the  method is called and its return value is returned, rather than the value of the attribute itself. That is, , where the return value of  is an object that already has  passed to the function.(If you've ever wondered what the  and  decorators do, they return objects with different  methods.)
