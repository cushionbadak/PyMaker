I have a class with only class methods. Is it a Pythonic way of namespacing? If not, what is the best way to group similar kinds of methods?.
A class is meant to have instances, not to serve as namespace. If your class is never instantiated, it does not serve the intended purpose of Python's .If you want to namespace a group of methods which are related, create a new module, that is another  file, and import it.ExampleHere we create a module names  which contains some related methods. This module can then be imported in our  file.helpers.pymain.py
