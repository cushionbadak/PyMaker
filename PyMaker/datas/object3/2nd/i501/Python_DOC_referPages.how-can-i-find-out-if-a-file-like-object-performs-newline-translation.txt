Natural Text
I have a library that does some kind of binary search in a seekable open file that it receives as an argument.The file must have been opened with , otherwise  and  might not work properly if there's newline translation.The README of the library does make this thing clear, but still it's easy to miss. I missed it myself and I was wondering why things aren't working properly. I'd therefore like to make the library raise an error or at least a warning if it receives a file-like object that performs text translation. Is it possible to make this check?
I see two ways around this. One is Python 3.7's io.TextIOWrapper.reconfigure() (thanks @martineau!).The second one is to make some tests to see whether / work as expected. A simple but inefficient way to do it is this:It may be possible to do it more efficiently by reading character by character (with ) until past the first newline and playing with / to see whether results are consistent, but it's tricky and it wouldn't work in all cases (e.g. if the first newline is a lone  whereas other newlines are ).
