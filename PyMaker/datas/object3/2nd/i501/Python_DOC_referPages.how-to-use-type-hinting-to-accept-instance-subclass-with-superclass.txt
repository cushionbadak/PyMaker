I have a function that looks a bit like this. I want the function to accept any subclass of io.IOBase - in other words, any file-like object.When I view the object in IntelliJ, the JetBrains implementation of type-hinting rejects any input unless I provide exactly an instance of io.IOBase - but what if I want to pass in an instance of a sub-class of io.IOBase? Is there a way to change the type-hint to say that this is allowed?
If you annotate a function argument with the base class ( in your case) then you can also pass instances of any subtype of the base class – inheritance applies to annotation types as well.That said, you could use  as a generic type representing any I/O stream (and  and  for binary and text I/O streams respectively).
Quoting the PEP:Sometimes you want to talk about class objects, in particular class objects that inherit from a given class. This can be spelled as Type[C] where C is a class. To clarify: while C (when used as an annotation) refers to instances of class C , Type[C] refers to subclasses of C .Python doc: A variable annotated with C may accept a value of type C. In contrast, a variable annotated with Type[C] may accept values that are classes themselves – specifically, it will accept the class object of C. For example:Note that Type[C] is covariant:
