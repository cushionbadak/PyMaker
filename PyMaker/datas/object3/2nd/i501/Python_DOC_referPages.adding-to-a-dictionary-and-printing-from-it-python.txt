I'm currently needing some help creating a poll system, for example My current code is completely broken, As i'm not that strong with dictionary. Any pointers or tips please.Thanks in advance
Assuming you want you input to be strictly 'user:input' and you want to repeat this indefinitely depending how many votes you need to input, you will need a loop. Each time the user adds an entry you add it to a list. You can set a clause variable based on the input, for example, if the user types 'end' it breaks the loop.Once you have that you can populate a dictionary with another loop, similar to how you did it. As the input convention is strictly 'name:vote' you can split with the ':' character and add the respective values to the dictionary:My advice would be to think about ways you can design this in such a way that the input convention is not strictly 'name:vote', and maybe how you could make this program more robust to errors (of which there are many).
