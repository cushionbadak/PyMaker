I am doing the same problem listed here but in python 3 and not getting the exact expected results so my main formula is off. I tried few things but when I do it creates a ValueError math domain error depending if I use parenthesis are certain parts of the equation.I tried looking at the other thread that had same problem but no luck. Thanks in advance!!!This one. num_of_months = (-1/30) * (math.log(1 + ((balance/monnthly_payment)) * (1 - ((1 + daily_rate)**30)))            /math.log(1 + daily_rate));Months to Pay Off a Credit Card problem
the error and wrong calc was caused by your formula   APR should be :apr = int(math.ceil(float(input("What is the APR on the card (as a  percent)? "))))So if you input  and cast  and  it will return  referenceI splitted the calculation for a better overview :)Tipp: split your calc for overview and test with a fixed input of numbers before consider a user input.
