I'm looking for a way to create multiple lists from one large list.What I want to do is to filter out different digit groups (amounts of fruits sold each week) form a list. Each group of digits should be in a separate list when it hits '******' string that indicates where each group should end.So far I've got this:However, my code prints everything in one list like that:How can divide the output into separate lists so that each fruit group is printed in a separate "blocks" and all of them are part of a larger list?The result I'm looking for should look like this:So far I've tried this:But this returns the same list and I was expecting it to break the loop at the first  breakpoint. I am struggling to separate each part of the list after the  delimiter.I'd appreciate any help I can get.
The most pythonic way I can think of is to use itertools.groupby:OutputAs an alternative you could use a for loop:Output
If you want to use  loops, this will work, if it is guaranteed that the list will have the proper format.The printout from that is what you wanted:
Well, try this: What I am doing there is:Taking a temporary list to store the digits in it.Taking the final list and appending the existing list of digits toit.Once I find the list element which is not int, I empty the list sothat we can reuse it with next elements.
