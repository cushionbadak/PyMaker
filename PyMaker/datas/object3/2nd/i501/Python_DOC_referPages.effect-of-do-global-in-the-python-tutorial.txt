I was reading section 9.2.1 about namespace and scope when I came across the following piece of code.The documentation claims the following is the output:My question is the following: shouldn't the output of line 3 be  due to the use of the  keyword in in  function?
No, it is local to the function's scope by default unless you explicitly say otherwise. From the Python Programming FAQ:In Python, variables that are only referenced inside a function are implicitly global. If a variable is assigned a value anywhere within the function’s body, it’s assumed to be a local unless explicitly declared as global.Note that you can access the value of a global variable from any scope, and for that matter, you may access the value of any parent scope to the current scope, but unless you explicitly say you will modify it with the  keyword, its value cannot change.
The documentation is correct here - just try the code to make sure...You are right on one point: as  contains  it changes the value of a global variable . But what in printed in position 3 is the  variable in the  function, which has not been changed by .And the 4th print does show the content of the global  which was set in .
