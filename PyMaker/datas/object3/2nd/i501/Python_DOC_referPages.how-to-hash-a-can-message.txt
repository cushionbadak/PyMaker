I want to Hash a CAN message received from a vehicle. The following code written in Python is used to receive the CAN message() from the vehicle and print the received message ().I want to hash the CAN message present in function before sending the message using .Is this possible? If so how can it be done? 
I am not sure what the data type is for , the data you receive from the function .I am guessing that  is just a wrapper for the device, and  acts very similar to the function, read().So,  in your code might be interpreted as an array of bytes, or chars.Hashing is done to an array of bytes, regardless of the format of the  string.And, the result of the hashing does not depend on the input format or data type.Therefore, in your case, can be replaced with an actual function from a hashing library, such as "hashlib".
If you are interested in cryptographic hashing, you should take a look at hashlibWith it you should be able to hash the message and send the hash like thisIf you want to still send the original message besides the hash, you could make two calls to .
