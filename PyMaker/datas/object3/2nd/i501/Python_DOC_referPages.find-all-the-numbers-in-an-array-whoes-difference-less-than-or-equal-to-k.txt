I want to find two numbers  and  whose difference is less than or equal to , I need to store index of such numbers in array L (Left) R (Right) and return L & R Expected output:
You should use  to get all possible combinations, then test their differences and append if needed.Test:Though it's not your expected output, I feel like your expected output may have a few errors according to your logic.
An  solution that exploits the ordering in your example  (if it's not ordered, you can always pay  a second time to sort it, though preserving the original indices would likely make it not worth the complexity):This uses the  function to find the end point for each start point in  time, making the overall cost . It doesn't even need to directly test most values against , since  finds the end of the indices which meet the different criteria, and all values in between definitely meet it. Rather than building the  manually, I've made this a generator function that can be converted to the  and  values with  and unpacking:You could do it with s explicitly:but I kind of like the generator->zip->unpack approach for letting Python do most of the work. Either way, the theoretical cost of  is better than  (roughly ).
