I want to check if two strings contain "\n" or "\r" using just one if statement not two, and is there any way to do this or must I use a for loop?I tried tweaking the if statement in many ways but it seems like I just cant get it right, so must I use a for loop or two if statements?I expect abcd==^abedabcdhey man==^abedabcd=====^abedBut I just get empty strings which means that the if statement isn't working properly.
You could use any:This will be  if any of the 4 conditions , ,,  is `True - and is much more compact...
Your logic isn't doing what you intend and when you do match, you are returning an empty string.if "\n" or "\r" in line1 or line2:        return ""Try:if ("\n" or "\r") in (line1 or line2):    return f'{line1}\n=\n{line2}'
