could someone help me understand what the s[1] and s[0] are referring to in the code below? This code will generate a Fibonacci serie. And I am still trying to understand how accumulate() works. Does it return the first value (0,1) as it is, then uses the result from the first application of the lambda function as s[1] and another tuple (0,1) from the list generated by repeat() as s[0]? or s[0] and s[1] are assigned as 0 and 1 respectively? Thanks!
 is the way to get the value in index  of . Since tuples are indexable collections (they define ), you're getting the zero-index and one-index of that tuple (the first and second values, respectively).This might be better-understood in the no-longer-valid syntax:As you correctly intuited,  returns the infinite series   in this case is a function that has the signature:The docs probably show this most clearly, using  (aka )
Since  and  and , we can ignore them altogether and it ultimately boils down to just this:You can visualize it like this:as you can see  never gets used. In your code  is ,  is , and so  which is the first element in the tuple, and  is the 2nd element
