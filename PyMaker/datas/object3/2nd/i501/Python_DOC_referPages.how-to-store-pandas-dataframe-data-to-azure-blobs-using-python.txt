I want to store processed data in pandas dataframe to azure blobs in parquet file format. But before uploading to blobs, I have to store it as parquet file in local disk and then upload. I want to write pyarrow.table into pyarrow.parquet.NativeFile and upload it directly. Can anyone help me with this. Below code is working fine:########  SOme Data ProcessingNeed to create the file in memory(I/O file type object) and then upload it to blob.
You can either use io.BytesIO for this or alternatively Apache Arrow also provides its native implementation . The benefit of this is that this writes to the stream without the overhead of going through Python. Thus less copies are made and the GIL is released.
