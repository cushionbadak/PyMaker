I am needing a function that will increment by one every time it is called. I have used count but every time I do it resets the count back to the original value plus one count. I have seen lots of code but none of it works. Here is what I have nowI have done lots of looking into loops and iterations 
You can use .Stateful functionIf you absolutely want a stateful function instead of calling , you can wrap the  in a function.ClassAlternatively,  being a class, you can inherit from it to extend it's behaviour and make it a callable. Using a class should be your preferred approach since it allows instantiating multiple counters.
You need a closure. Define a function  which initializes a local variable, then defines and returns a function that increments that variable on each call.Now  will return a new value on each call:This is sort of the dual of a class. You have a function that "wraps" some data (closes over the variable), instead of a piece of data with an associated method. The class version; note the similarity to :An instance of this class now behaves like our previous closure.
You can use a generator here that increments value by one every time it's called using :If you look closely, this is equivalent to what  does.
if I got this right this should work:
