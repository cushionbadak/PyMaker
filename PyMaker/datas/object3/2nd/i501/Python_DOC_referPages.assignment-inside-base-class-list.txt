When reading the  module source I noticed following:Here, an assignment is inside the base class list.Later, it's checked in:Where exactly does  end up? Docs refer to it as "class keyword arguments" (https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.init_subclass), but I couldn't find any further info on this.
A class keyword argument is any kwyword argument that is passed in the class declaration. Only one such argument have a special treatment -  - this one dictates the callable that will be used to provide the metaclass.Any other keyword argument there is passed as is to the metaclass  and  methods, and to any superclass  method. These are not treated in a special way, and, above all, are not "base classes" - the methods mentioned before will receive these keyword arguments normally as any Python method: they may be declared in the method signature, or they may accept the  dictionary (which is the case).It is worth mentioning that passing such arguments with a proper  method in the superclasses that will "swallow" it, the class declaration will fail with a  due to the unrecognized argument to 's . In contrast, the default metaclass implementation of  and  on the  class will simply ignore any extra keywords passed.Thus:fails with: While:works with no problems. ( kwd will be passed )
