I am trying to create a random list of 1 million numbers ranging between 1-100. I have found how to create a single random number but not to create a list of them. In addition, I would prefer to use the numpy uniform function but the solution doesn't have to use this. 
For a big array, you'd better use numpy
Try this simpler one : 
The function will create an array for the given dimensions with values selected from the uniform distribution [0,1]. You can modify this to  to have the array with numbers ranging between 1-100.
This code will give 100 random elements to your empty list.
use this as simple as that...don't make your program more complex in code and in efficiency too..
