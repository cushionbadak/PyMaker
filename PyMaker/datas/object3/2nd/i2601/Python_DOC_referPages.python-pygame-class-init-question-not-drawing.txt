I'm learning OOP and I have a few questions.When the initiliazer is called, is the code automatically processed?Cause if that's the case, I don't understand why my game isn't drawing the rectangle i ask it to draw in the init part of the player class.I'm very new to OOP and as such I'm not sure of what I'm doing, to some extent.Here's my code:
You are constantly filling the screen with white in your mainloop. The  class only draws on . This means that the rect is drawn for a split second and then covered over by white.Your assumption about the code in  automatically being called is correct. These methods with double underscores are called by python in special cases, they are called magic methods. You can find a list of them here. You will need to call the new update method in the mainloop after you fill the screen.
