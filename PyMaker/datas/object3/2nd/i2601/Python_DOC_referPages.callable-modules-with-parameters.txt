Is it possible to make a module callable with parameters?I am trying to make a callable module on Python, following the question and its answers Callable modules, like so:foo.pythen I call it:but my objective is to pass a parameter in the callable module: Any ideas how can I accomplish that? 
There's nothing special about the class you created (it's not even a  subclass), so there's nothing special about its  method. If you want to call it with arguments, just add parameters to the  definition:And now, you can pass it an argument, exactly like any other callable object:And the output is:From the comments, you tried to do this:But, like all methods in Python,  wants  to come first. It doesn't care about the names (unless you call it with keyword arguments), just the order: the first parameter gets the receiver (the  in ), even if it you called that parameter , and the second parameter gets the first normal argument (the ), even if you called that parameter .So, you're passing the module  as the first parameter, , and you , so it returns .Which is why you got this:That isn't an error, that's the perfectly valid output that you get when you print out an instance of a class that doesn't define  or .
