I am learning python, and studying the dictionary concept.Trying to make a new dictionary with key and values but not able to understand why is it giving error...
Here is how you would correctly initialize a dictionary with your given keys.Here is how you would initialize an empty dictionary.The code you have just produces an invalid syntax error. It's unclear from your post which one you want. Also, good to note that you can also use, double quotes  or single quotes . As one of the comments pointed out, your non-ascii quotes could also cause an error.
Firstly, some syntax errors,try:Note the commas, and also the single pair of curly braces.Secondly, where did you get those quotes? Did you copy and paste them from some place like a website or pdf? They are non-ascii so python won't understand them. Try typing them yourself. Thanks to chepner for pointing that out in the comments.
The following code would work.    
In the first line, you created an empty dictionary and assigned it to “adict”.You need to separate each key-value pair with commas and make sure that your keys do not have quotation Mars. Only the values have quotation marks (if they are strings).
