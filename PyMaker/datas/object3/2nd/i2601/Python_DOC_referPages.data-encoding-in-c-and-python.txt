I'm encountering the following question. I've written some double-type data into binary files using C and now I want to read them using Python. When I used python functionIt gave me b'\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\xf8?\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x04@\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\n@\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x11@'So I tried to decode using , then it gave me decoding error. I suppose it was because I used the wrong encoding type. But I tried  and  and they did not work. Therefore my questions is 2-fold:How can i read an binary file without knowing the encoding type?Since i did not give an encoding type when writing the binary file in c, does c encode the data at all? If yes, what kind of encoding type would that be?FYI, the code i used to write binary file in the first place is
You need to convert the C types into Python types. Use  in the standard library here.The format string, in this case, is , meaning 4 doubles.  The difficulty comes when moving C types between different compilers and machines.Gives a tuple:
You can use python standard array module:Output:
If you are open to using numpy, use :You may find numpy arrays easier to manipulate than plain python types because of the huge ecosystem of code that's grown up around them.
