My program requires the usage of a hash table, and an sql database; currently I would like to put the hash table part of my program (add,get,delete etc) and database part of my program(same thing) into separate python files so that I can find and edit specific parts of my code easier, my hashing part relying on my database part as they work together. However my pycharm suggests that (when I import both python files separately) that my second database program will not be used.For examplemainProgram  hashProgramdatabaseProgramthe problem occurs (I assume) when my hashProgram wants to call my database program, though I dont know why that would be, because I have imported them both?Sorry if this doesnt make sense, but I dont really know how else to word it, thank you for any help :-)
... tip on how to split up my program into smaller more manageable python files This is a fairly basic technique, just go over a simple  tutorial for that like one in official documentation. ... when the main program is executed, (importing all of my side programs) hashKey is not "defined"Something like this setup should work:foo.pymain.py ... my hashing part relying on my database part as they work together.On a rare occasion when your modules import each other you can end up with a circular reference and need a smarter split of modules. I'm not sure it is your case, perhaps you just not using proper import syntax yet.
