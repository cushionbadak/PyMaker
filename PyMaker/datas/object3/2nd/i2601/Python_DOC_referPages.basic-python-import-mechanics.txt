I have the following directory tree: the content of testFoo is: from the  directory I run I get a I have two question: how to improt and run A.foo from TestA.testFoo and why is it so difficult to grasp the import logic in Python? Isn't there any debug trick to solve this kind of issues rapidly, I'm sorry I have to bother you with such basics questions?  
When your are executing a file an environment variable called python path is generated, python import work with this variable to find your file to import, this path is generated with the path of the file you are executing and it will search in the current directory and sub directories containing an  file, if you want to import from a directory on the same level you need to modify your python path or change the architecture of your project so the file executed is always on top level.you can include path to your python path like this :You can read more on import system : https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.htmlThe best way in my opinion is to not touch the python path and include your test directoy into the directory where tested files are:Then run the  command into your A or project directory, it will search into your current and sub directories for test and execute it.More on unittest here : https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html
Can you try this ?Create an empty file  in subdirectory . And add at the begin of main codeThen import as below :
Add the folder  to the system pythonpath first:and try the import again.
The recommended way in py3 may be like belowThe way of execute module  in python is a good way to replace relative referencesã€‚
You definitely cannot find A because python need look from ,  to find the module.And python will automatically add current  to  not  to . So if you add  in , you will see it only add  to the .Another word, the  did not be included in , then how python can find the module ?So you had to add the  folder to  by yourself, and, this just needed in , something like follows:
