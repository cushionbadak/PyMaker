Attempting to loop through a list of servers and connect to them with OpenSSL, retrieve SSL cert, and pull the server name, the date the cert expires, and calculate the number of days until cert expires. The code works fine printing to the terminal sessions but I am having trouble getting it to write to a text file for each server in this format:Server Name: Server01Day Cert Expires: 2020-03-16 23:59:59Days to expire: 564Can someone tell me how I can capture each variable in the For loop and write it to a text file? I have tried numerous attempts with variations of the f.write and can't seem to get it to work.  Complete code
Following on from Victor's comment about closing the file, to pass multiple variables to on write, you can use python 3's string interpolation. E.g: 
Don't forget to close your file through  otherwise the file will be empty. If you use the  keyword, the file will automatically close, as shown in this example code copied from The Python Tutorial 7.1 Reading and Writing Files:Also, the  method only takes 1 argument.
