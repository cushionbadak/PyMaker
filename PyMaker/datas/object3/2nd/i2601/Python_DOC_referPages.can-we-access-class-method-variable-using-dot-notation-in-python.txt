Below is the codeI am looking for something like this. Can I achieve this in pythonI know this is var variable in local to class. Is there someway by using global or something else to acheive this
I think this would work. The init(self) behave like a constructor in other languages. So in effect I am constructing a class in a class, to make your last line work properly. But like other suggested that is not the way Python is supposed to be used.
Forget about classes and consider functions in general.When you define a function, any variables within its scope are local and only accessible from within the execution of that function. Once execution has finished, that's it, they are gone. This is fundamental; the only way of getting data from a function is by ing it.Although it is a hack, you could return  (a dictionary of local variables), but this is terrible practice.
Accessing a variable from a class method is not possible, you have to set the variable at the class level like this:You could chain obj.test('Ada').var1 in the same line by returning self into your test method.
What you are looking for are the , usually defined as . Here an example of your code:but as suggested in other answers, you may want to take a step back and check what is the scope of python variables
If you return the object itself from the function and the variables are not local but instance variables it works.
