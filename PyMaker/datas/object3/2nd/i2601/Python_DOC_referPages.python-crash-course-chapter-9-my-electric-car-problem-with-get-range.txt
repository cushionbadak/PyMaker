I'm going through the book Python Crash Course and I'm stuck at the example given in the book. I even copy - pasted the script from the book and still got an error.File called car.pyNow, when I try to import the class by the following script (in file my_electric_car.py):Unfortunately I got an error:
Your battery has a initialized  of 60. What value  got if you do not change it to 70 or 85?(citation of your code)Change to:Sidenote:avoid using names that python already uses, this includes f.e. built-ins ( min, max, range, list, set, dict, ...) built-ins Link . You variable reassignes this name from the function to your values and you shadow them - hence can not use them anymore.
