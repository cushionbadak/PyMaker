I have a path that I have assigned to a string:However the 'llb' prefix can be different string for each computer and I need to assign it to an arbitrary value that will read whatever the user's computer has set for this specific directory such as:I cannot figure out what function or regex to use for this however.
You can use the dot  to mean 'any character':I escaped the dot at the end of the string. The  asterisk denotes 0 or more repetitions. I used a raw string literal:  so that I can write backslashes without having to escape them. If you need a certain number of characters use . Now you can use regex to match your paths
