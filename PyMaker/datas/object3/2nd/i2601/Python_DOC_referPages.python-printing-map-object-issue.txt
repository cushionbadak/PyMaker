map returns an iterator and you can consume an iterator only once.Example:Another example where I consume the first element and create a list with the rest
As per the answer from @newbie, this is happening because you are consuming the map iterator before you use it.

However, if you want to be able to continue using  as a list in your code, you need to amend Example 1 like so:Example 1 (amended):
It's because it return an generator so clearer example:Explanation:it's because to convert it into the list it basically loops trough than after you want to loop again it will think that still continuing but there are no more elementsso best thing to do is:
