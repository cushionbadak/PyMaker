When you ask a  for the  of a particular element it performs a linear search from the beginning to find the first matching element. This is slow. It's also error prone as identical nodes will be missed as only the first would be found.Instead of converting to a  you could  the . This will generate a sequence of indices and nodes.You can also convert  to a  if it isn't already, to make lookup more efficient:edit: alternatively, you can create  in one line using a list comprehension, so you don't need the index as there is an implicit one to one correlation with node position:
It depends on the networkx version you are using. More info here.networkx 1.xnetworkx 2.xAs you can see in networkx2.x you don't have a list but a NodeView.You can convert to a list with .
