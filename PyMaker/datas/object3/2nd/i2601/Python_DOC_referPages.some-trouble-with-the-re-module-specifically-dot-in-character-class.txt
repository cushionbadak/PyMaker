Let's say I have a stringand I want to run a -search on it...To my knowledge, I should be searching any character (including newline characters) until hitting a  in the string and grouping everything between the  and it.Why am I getting  as the result?
Inside a character class the dot matches a literal dot so your regex would match one or more times a dot or a whitespace character  in a capturing group.You could match not a  using a negated character class:Regex demoExplanation Match literally Capturing group Match not a  one or more times using a negated character class (including newlines) Close capturing group Match Demo
Because  doesn't match any character including newline -- in fact it matches any character except newline. See:https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.htmlYou have to use  mode.I'm not sure what your intention is with . It looks like "any character plus whitespace". But whitespace is a character, so you can just say "any character". I think this probably suffices:P.S.  is a built-in. Don't call variables .
