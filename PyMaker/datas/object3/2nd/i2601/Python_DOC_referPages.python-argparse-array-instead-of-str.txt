I'm running into issues when using argparse. With below code, I expected args.dir to be a string, but instead I got an array. How can I get a string? Can anyone help?
You indicated  and even though you provided the value 1, argparse built you a list (like an array but not exactly the same thing). This is actually helpful because you can guarantee that when you indicate , you will always get a list.Remove the  parameter and you will get a string rather than a list.
