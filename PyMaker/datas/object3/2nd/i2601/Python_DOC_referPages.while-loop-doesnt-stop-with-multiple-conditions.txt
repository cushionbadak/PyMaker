I tried to remove the second condition and it started to work for some reason. This is probably a dumb question but please be patient I'm a high school student.It is suppose to stop the loop when input is login or register. Output is suppose to be changing variable login_or_register = None to the answer.

Therefore you have created an infinite loop.A solution would be connecting the two conditions with an  or even better create a list with all allowed inputs and use an  to check if the user input is in that list. That will be more clear if you have more different options the user is allowed to enter.For example:You may also want to take a look at the python docs for  and 
 will always be True. You probably want to use a logical :
