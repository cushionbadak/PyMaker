Natural Text
I need to print the sorted list of integers, but it should be in a line and without the list square brackets and without any '\n' in the end...output should be like this:::  1 2 3 4 5and not like this :::: [1,2,3,4,5]
You can unpack the list to  using  which will automatically split by a spaceif you want a comma, use the  argument
Use Or
You can use join and list comprehensions for that.The only thing, items in a list should be strings, not integers
