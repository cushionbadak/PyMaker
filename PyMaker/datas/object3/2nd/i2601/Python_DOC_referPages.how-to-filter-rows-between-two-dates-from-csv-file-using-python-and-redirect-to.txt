I am newbie to Python. I have a CSV file with below data as an example. I wanted to skip rows between specific date range(2018-08-01 to 2018-08-28) and redirect output to a separate CSV file. Please note, a blank space in the header "LAST USE".Any idea would be greatly appreciated.
With Pandas, this is straightforward:You can also combine Boolean arrays to construct . For example:
dict reader documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.DictReaderStrptime documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behaviorBasically, we start by opening the CSV file as a set of python dictionaries - one for each row, then iterate over all the rows in the CSV.For each row, we convert the date/time string to an actual date/time object that python can then compare with your date range. If the value is within the range, we will write the entire row to a separate CSV file.
