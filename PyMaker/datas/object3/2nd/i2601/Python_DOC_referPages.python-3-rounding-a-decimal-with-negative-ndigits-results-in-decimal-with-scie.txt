I noticed a strange behaviour when using the  function with a negative rounding factor (the parameter ) and with the  module.I'm using  (specifically , but I don't know if the specific minor version matters for this case).With  it looks normal:With  the result is correct, but it changes to scientific notation when using a negative rounding factor:My quick fix was to add  to the result, which restores the notation back to "normal" (non-scientific):I don't think this classifies as a bug, because only the notation and not the actual value is affected, but it is strange to me nonetheless.Does anyone have an idea why I am seeing this behaviour? Do you know if it is intended or a minor bug?
This is normal and intended.  tracks significant digits, and the Decimal  is intended to preserve significant digits.  has two significant digits, while  has four.
