The problemI am making an e-commerce in Django and the user can pick multiple items before adding them to the cart, I'm using the timestamp as an object id in the user's cart when add to cart button clicked.When add to cart button clicked I have a dict of creating the cart object goes likethe timestamp serves as an unique id so i can give id to the rows of the cart if they need to be deleted, if so sends the id of the element of the cart in the back-end and deletes the same element from the user's cart object The timestamp is not unique... The process is too fast that the timestamp stays the same and it does not make different keys any advice to have a different timestamp would be appreciated .
the timestamp serves as an unique id so i can give id to the rows of the cart if they need to be deletedYou're barking up the wrong tree, trying to fix a problem in a solution not fit for the original problem; i.e. you have an XY problem.The simplest solution: use a  instead of a . The  will have unique keys by definition. The only issue with a  is that in a web scenario, you may be handling two parallel or outdated requests, and the index may refer to a different element by the time it reaches your server.So to use truly unique, unchanging ids, use the  module:There you go, guaranteed unique ids.
If you want your keys to be unique and somewhat time-based, just increment them manually:
How about using  moduleedit:Perhaps a better way to make it unique will be to add a unique element to the timestamp. One way could be to add a UUID to the mix. But I might be stretching it a bit. Just a suggestion.
