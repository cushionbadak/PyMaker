I the following list I want to do slicing such that my final result is [1,1.5,2,2.5,4.5,5] . I tried to access by indices but it gives me error.
You can't use a list of indexes to slice or index a list. You have to use a loopâ€”e.g., via a comprehension, or a function with an implicit loop in it like the one returned by :But you can do something like this with numpy arrays. You can't directly use the six indices (because that would mean multidimensional indexing), but you can use any array-like, such as a list, containing those six indices:This is explained in Index arrays in the basic indexing tutorial.
Python does not support irregular intervals. You must use a list comprehension.Also, do not use names such as  for your variables as this overshadows builtin functions.
Work the other way around; instead of selecting a non-contiguous range, remove the contiguous range you don't want. You just want to get the original  minus indices 4-6 (inclusive), so copy your , then  the indices you don't need:Alternatively, you could use  to retrieve the specific indices you listed, e.g.: of multiple values will output a , so if that bothers you, you'd have to convert back to , e.g.  (and note, the choice to change your variable name to  made it possible to access the  constructor, which would have been impossible if you named your variable ).
