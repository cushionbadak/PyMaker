Giving following code:How can I write a unittest to ensure  class is before  in superclass declaration of ?
Don't test it. Unless you're writing tests for a Python implementation itself. It's not the responsibility of your library's test suite to verify that the Python interpreter is working as designed.  appears before  in the declaration is self-evident when reading the code, and the fact that Python evaluates initializers left to right in a multiple inheritance is documented here. Note: I'm not saying this behaviour should not be tested, just that such tests needn't be duplicated by user code. It should be covered in the test suite of the implementation, e.g. here for CPython.
You can parse the output of , which returns the method resolution order and make sure that  comes before :However, I'm not sure that this is not an implementation detail and how much one can (or should) count on subclasses order. If your code depends on it, there may be something wrong in the design.
