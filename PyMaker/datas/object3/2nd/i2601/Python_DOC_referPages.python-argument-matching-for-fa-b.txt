for the function f defined as above, if I call  it prints 1, (2,3) as expected.However calling  causes an error:     TypeError: f() got multiple values for argument 'a'Any positional argument can also be supplied as an explicit keyword argument.There should be only one interpretation for  without ambiguity.
consider the example above both will call the same function in the same waynow if you specify a =1 then it has an ambiguity to whether to consider  since 2 is the first positional argument and  is an explicit keyword argument .
