Here is how I answered the question below. How would I solve this question better?**Define a procedure, stamps, which takes as its input a positive  integer in pence and returns the number of 5p, 2p and 1p stamps (p is  pence) required to make up that value. The return value should be a  tuple of three numbers(that is, your return statement should be  followed by the number of 5p, the number of 2p, and the number of 1p  stamps). Your answer should use as few total stamps as possible by  first using as many 5p stamps as possible, then 2 pence stamps and  finally 1p stamps as needed to make up the total. (No fair for USians  to just say use a "Forever" stamp and be done with it!)**Here is my solutionHere are the tests in the exercise
I would use modulo and remainder operations:Alternatively (didn't even know this) you can use builtin divmod:
To make this a bit more generic, a function that takes a tuple of stamp types:
