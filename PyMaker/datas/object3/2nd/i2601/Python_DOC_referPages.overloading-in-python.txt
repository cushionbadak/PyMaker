This question already has an answer here:How to properly overload the __add__ method?                    1 answer                This is showing me:What's the problem?  I am not getting it.
The purpose of overloading magic methods like  in python is to define custom functionality in your  method, but not to change it's basic purpose. The  method corresponds to the  operator, which is used as an operator between two variables. In other words  is basically saying . You defined your method as:So you're adding a third variable to the magic method therefore  is basically , which is why it's telling you that a parameter is missing. I would recommend changing this definition to: If you really want to overload your method, and then your  method will work as expected. If you really need a method to add three variables then define another method in the class, but overloading  typically isn't a good solution. 
The signature of  must be , not .  The left-hand argument to  is the  argument, and the right-hand argument is the other argument to .
