I am trying to implement aes encryption and decryption in python. When I execute code, it returns error. I have installed anaconda on my machine. I am running scripts in jupyter notebook.How to solve this ?
just update unpad to be  the main issue that ord() expects string of length one if you try to print value of s[-1] it prints 10 which not one char but s[-1:] printed value is b'\n' which is one charalso encode key to be bytes  and padto make sure all inputs are bytes
