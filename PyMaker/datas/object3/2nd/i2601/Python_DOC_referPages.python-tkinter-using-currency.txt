Natural Text
In Python 3.5.2, Tkinter, I'm creating a basic 'menu' system where one would order something from a menu and then a bill would be created at the bottom, based on the price of what they ordered. Here's the code so far:As you can see, once the button is clicked, a number is kept counted in the bottom, but without any currency sign (£ or $). Since I made , I can't edit the label to put a £ or $ sign infront of the cost. Is there any way to do this? Is it already defined in python? Thanks
You need to include the currency symbol into the setting of the label variable:To this effect, you could use an f string to format :  replace withWhere  is your currency symbol.Regarding your edit: you can use the  type to avoid float imprecision.
