Suppose I have the following method:If I call , I expect to get the following sequence of :Notice that hierarchy is based on the order on which I provided the arguments.To be honest, I have no idea how to approach this.Ideally, I would like a really simple and pythonic solution if there is such thing.Note: Solution needs to be compatible 
As for now, it is not clear by which general rule  does not appear in your output. Until precisions are added, this answer assumes it was simply forgotten.The desired output is close to being the powerset of your input. We only require that the first element be always present. Thus, we can adapt the  function from itertools recipes.Output
I think it's "the first length-1 keys of item should be continuous, the last key can be isolated." Codes as below:
You can use a recursive function:Output:
