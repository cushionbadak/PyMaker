How would you convert Python 2.7 to Python 3.6.5? Here, I am trying to query a set of NTP time servers and determine which one is the outlier. It is probably a few simple changes but I am unsure.. 
Here's a version of your code with minimal changes that runs correctly on Python 3.6. Apart from fixing the prints and that long integer literal, which I did automatically using 2to3, I also changed  to a  string.There are a few more things that can be done to take advantage of Python 3 features. Here's a more streamlined version. We don't need , since a Python 3 socket can be used directly in a  statement. And we don't need , as a Python 3  has a  method.
The  is not present in python3, that is the first thing you need to change.  Convert  to read more hereSecond, you should rewrite your  command in a  function.read more here
