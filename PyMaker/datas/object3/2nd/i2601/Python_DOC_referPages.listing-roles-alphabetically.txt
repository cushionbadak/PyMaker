Hi I'm trying to list roles alphabetically so far I'm able to list roles on my discord server bit I'm unsure how to list them in alphabetical order in .py I've searched everywhere without any success.Here is what I'm working with. If anyone could help me on how this works then It would be greatly appreciated.
It's all about hunting for what you need.You are looking to change something when you list the roles, so you should check under  function. Within there, we see that it iterates through all the roles inside .This is probably what you are looking to change. By sorting the list just before you iterate through them, you will be able to accomplish it as you need:If you adjust your code to the above, you'll basically be using the built-in  function to sort the list. By utilizing the  parameter, you can give the function the basis of the sorting, which would be the  attribute of the nested object.
