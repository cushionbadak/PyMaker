I'm a little confused over the difference between iterators and iterables. I've done a lot of reading and have got this much:Iterator: An object that has  in it’s class. You can call next() on it. All iterators are iterable.Iterable: An object that defines  or  in it's class. Something is iterable if it can build an iterator using iter(). Not all iterables are iterators.Is  an iterator? I know that  would be in Python2 right?I'm just checking because a course I'm doing says it is and I'm pretty sure it's just an iterable (not an iterator).Thanks for your help :)
No, it isn't. It is an iterable view of the items in the dict:It's  method returns a specialized iterator instance:
You can test this directly:
 returns a dict view, according to the docs:Answering your question,  is not an iterator. It is an iterable object which supports ,  and reflects changes made in the original dict:
Check it yourselves:This results in .On the other hand, you can always iterate through  as:Or:
