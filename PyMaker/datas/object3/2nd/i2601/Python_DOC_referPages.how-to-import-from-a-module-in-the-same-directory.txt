I'm attempting to make a Python3.6 package, but have run into ModuleNotFound errors when importing from within the package. The package has the following structure:The  file contains the following:And then within , I'm attempting to import from  with the following:The goal is to allow the following by client code:That last import is failing, and I'm not clear why. Any ideas? TIA.Not sure how relevant it is, but I'm testing this by running the following in the outer  directory:This returns the following traceback
From your traceback:That's not the same as the code you showed us here:The  is correctâ€”that's a relative path from within , so it will find  in .The  without the leading dot in your actual code is an absolute path, from any of the directories in . Since there is no file or directory named  in any of those directories, it fails.Meanwhile, your project directory structure doesn't seem to be the same thing you showed us either. Otherwise,  should not find the installed version. By default (and I don't think you've done anything to change it), the first entry in  "is the directory containing the script that was used to invoke the Python interpreter". Which, given the structure you posted here, means that  should find the  subdirectory in the same directory as , not the one in your venv's .
