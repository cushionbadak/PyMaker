Using the following code, I end up with one or more newlines between each and every line in my file when running the code on windows (in jupyter notebook on python3) but NOT when running on mac or Linux? I assume it's some kind of encoding issue? something to do with window's "" shenanigans? doing a ;str(page.content)/r/n` as expected but I'm not sure why it's chalk full of newlines to begin with?note: I have commented out a quick way to remove whitespace but it's a bit of a hack and not really what I'm after, i'm more looking for why the whitespace is being added to begin with.Result Sample:    
Looks like C14L nailed it. (how do I give you internet points as a comment, can only do that as an answer, right?)I switched over to  and it complainedValueError: binary mode doesn't take an encoding argumentso made that  which complainedTypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'so I switched up to  and voila, the output is as expected. now to test and see that it doesn't break anything running on mac/LinuxFinal functional code:
