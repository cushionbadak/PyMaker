I am coming from a C# background and Python's Asyncio library is confusing me.I have read the following 1 2, yet the use of asyncio remains unclear to me.I am trying to make a website scrapper in python that is asynchronous.
As the requests library is not asynchronous, you can use run_in_executor method, so it won't block the running thread. As the result, you can define  as a regular function and call it in the  function like this:The blocking function will run in a separate executor, while the control will be returned to the event loop.Or you can try to use async HTTP client library, like aiohttp.
Ok, I think I found a basic solution.I wrote a wrapper that that allows me to call the function asynchronously and store the result.
