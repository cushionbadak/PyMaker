This is my code:I first perform authentication using the  function. Then I make first get call to get the number of records to import, then I'm using threads to get the data (pages) using  function. when all threads finish I return the result. This works however there is a risk that the token will expire in the middle of the process.My Question:currently the code make authentication only once at the beginning then the  is passed and used with in the . How can I modify it to refresh the token if it expires ?
I would probably be optimistic and just try the request. If it fails, then re-authenticate and then retry the request:Or, as Klaus D. suggests, check current time and refresh the token if  has been reached.
