Notes:I am using Python v3.6I have read the documentation regarding Modules and PackagesI have read and gone through the Packaging project tutorialI have looked at the Sample Project (different from tutorial project)I have a simple package I want to makewhere  is justand my  file is just like the demoI have successful got it on pypi and pip installed it.I can  but unlike the tutorial whereworks,does not.The above linked Sample project doesn't exactly elaborate any more on the init.py file.So my question is as follows:suppose one had a package like that under the documentation for Modules and Packages:where the actual file structure is (following the packaging project tutorial)What goes in  (or ) so that I can import it and access the functions, submodules, and classes therein?Sorry for being an noob at python packaging.
