I have a dataset like this:The dataset contains about 1700 rows with daily data. I want to plot a boxplot so see the monthly values. Something like thisI need the months on the x-axes like JAN/FEB/MAR and so on.I canÂ´t find any working solutions where I can achieve this if I have a daily dataset. I think I have to do data preparation and group the values per month first?Or how can I program this in an easy and short way?
You can use  element and create the month column as follows:Use  and pass ,  and  as parameter. You will get the desired boxplot.The plot colors and other parameters are not set as OP's display plot.
Assuming that your DataFrame  contains the two columns "date" and "sum", we need to sort it on the "date" field to have the rows in the right order for the plot otherwise we could see the months in the wrong order. Then we need to create a support column containing the name of the month of each date. That's it, we are ready for the plot.Here the code:I hope it helps.
You can use the function strftime from datetime.Here is an example:Resulting Plot
