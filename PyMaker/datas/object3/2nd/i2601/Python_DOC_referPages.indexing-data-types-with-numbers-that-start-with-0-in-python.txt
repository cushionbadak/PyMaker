This question already has an answer here:Python cannot handle numbers string starting with 0. Why?                    2 answers                I have a function that will convert 3 numbers into a date.so if I run the function like this: conv(6,17,2016)the output will be:so far so good, but what if I give 06 for the month instead of 6 how can I get the same output like above? is there any way to use 06 and somehow turning it into 6 for indexing or I have to only give 6 and there is no way for doing that?
assuming you are aware that 06 will automatically raise a syntax error, that means you can only create a string such as . with that said, simple use to convert to  
This will be a little easier to digest:
I would suggest to use ,Or use .
cast your 06 to  - it will then be a normal 6. So you will print by using but as mentioned in the comments - just use  module instead :-)
You can convert tuple to  then use  to format it:
