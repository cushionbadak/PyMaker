If I have a python project that contains a  file I can run . This will install all of the requirements listed in the setup file and add the current project to my pip list: Will this by default add the  to the users PYTHONPATH, or do you have to do that manually, so you can import the code via  from any location on the system?
No,  does not alter the  and you don't need to either.  instead uses standard paths set by Python when you install the project. You don't need to make any changes, you already installed the package in a standard location when you ran .Projects installed with  use an egg link file and are added to a  file in a standard location. The location shown is listed in a  file (really just a piece of metadata to track packages) and the same path is added  to the  file in the same directory. Python automatically adds any paths listed in  files to the module search path on startup (this is handled by the  module).The same set of standard paths is also used to find the project again when you run ; that the command works shows that the project is already on the Python module search path, correctly installed.You can verify the paths by running . Because you installed the package with the  switch, the location  uses is shown there as the  path. Check that path to find the  and  files.
