I am designing an experiment with the Expyriment package. There is two boxes and I give them random colors but they must be different from each others. I use for loop and enumerate to loop through:2 problems emerged from here, the tuple I removed gone forever and I got a TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()I search for a way to temporarely remove an tuple for looping but cant find it. Also, when I tried using pop ,it didnt give me an error but it just prints int not tuple. Also, object that I pop is still gone forever.Full code>
You can create a new list inside of your for loop that excludes the current item for that iteration:Note that using  (or , which is equivalent in your OP) will return . Also note,  does not return anything. It modifies the existing list in-place. This is the reason you are receiving your  error.The code above outputs (for example):
If you want to randomly select a number of items from a collection without selecting the same thing multiple times, that's known as random sampling without replacement. Python's random module has a function specifically for this called .
