While the  module makes handling C-like structures containing scalar values very simple, I donâ€™t see how to sensibly handle structs which contain arrays.For example, if I have the following C struct:and want to unpack its values and use the same variables (, , , , , , , ) in Python, I run into the problem that  just gives me every value in a tuple individually.
