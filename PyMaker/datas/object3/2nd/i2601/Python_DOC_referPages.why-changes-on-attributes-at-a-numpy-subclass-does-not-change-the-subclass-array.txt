I'm having the following problem when I subclass a numpy arrayfor example:If I do operations with obj.x and obj['x'], one does not change the other. For example these operations will show different resultsorHow can I make that whenever I do an operation with one of them (obj.x or obj['x']), the other also changes?
Using  as the datatype tells numpy to create a structured array with fields named  and .Those are accessed using brackets, as you've shown.Now you've also added attributes (accessed using ) to your class.However, you've created new arrays for the attributes.To fix the attribute notation you need to have the  and  attributes point to the array fields by those names, rather than separate arrays.So changetoedit this fixes only the second test case in the question.  Assigning to  or  still assigns a new object as the attribute, rather than updating  or .To fix this it would be necessary to modify the  method of the class (see here)However, Numpy already has an array type to allow accessing fields as attributes.You can use it like thisSo congratulations! You've effectively re-implemented record arrays(well,  won't allow accessing fields names matching attributes or functions  has.  So names like  or  are out, while your code would allow these).It's always a good (and very frustrating) sign when you spend hours creating something numpy already has.
