I want to calculate cosine similarity for words in two dictionaries. The words are keys, arrays are values. In order to do this, I need to convert them to 2D array first, I did some research and found  I successfully converted it with a single value in dictionary, however, I don't know how to convert the whole dictionary's values by using for loops. The dataI triedbut received error: TypeError: unhashable type: 'numpy.ndarray'Some advice please? thank you in advanced!
