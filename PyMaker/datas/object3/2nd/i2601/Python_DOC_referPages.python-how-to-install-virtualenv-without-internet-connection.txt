I am filling in for someone while they are on vacation and I am new to python. I've been asked to install several packages in a virtual environment. The big catch is the server cannot be on a public net so I will be downloading the software on a different server and copying it to the server where the researcher will be working.I found another thread "Install Virtualenv without internet connectivity" at Install Virtualenv without internet connectivity, but that doesn't fit the situation I am in - it looks like they can start from a server on the net to complete their installs and want to share that virtualenv to other systems in a lab environment that may not have Internet connectivity.Another thread "python: How to create virtualenv without internet connection" at python: How to create virtualenv without internet connection, is similar but it looks like they already have virtualenv installed. I don't find virtualenv installed here.This Windows Server 2016 system is locked down where I cannot copy and paste the commands I ran to provide the information below, so forgive any typos in the hastily written message. I found the python version installed by:I have not been able to find an installer to download for virtualenv. Do I need to download the Python installer again, re-run it and select additional options? Thank you for any help you are able to provide.edited to add:Based on feedback, I changed the command (in an administrative command window) to and I have been able to make some progress.I have the ability to download gz, whl or other files and move them to this server to run them there, but this server cannot be put online to download the installers directly nor can it connect to a repo to download dependencies. I cannot set up the environment on a different machine that has connectivity and share it without violating the security requirements. Thank you for the link to the Python Package Offline Installation thread - I think I was so narrowly focused on the virtual environment that I missed that post.
You're using Python 3.6, which means  is included and  can be bootstrapped if necessary.  Creating a venv does not need internet access:Installing pip does not require internet access:Installing a package from a local file does not require internet access:Should you have more than one package to install (for example, if  has dependencies) you may specify a local directory as your  instead of the index defaulting to PyPI.A solution for people on older versions of Python is covered here.
