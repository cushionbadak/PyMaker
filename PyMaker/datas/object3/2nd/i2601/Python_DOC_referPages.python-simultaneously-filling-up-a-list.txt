So I am trying to write multiprocess code that will hopefully fill up a list based on some processes that are running. But it's not modifying the list at all.Now I know I can't access the same element and increment it from multiple threads because it will lead to race conditions. But what I have is code that accesses ONE index from ONE and only one process. So that for example, if I have a list with 4 elements, I run 4 processes, one process for each element. This, however, doesn't work. Even though I read that lists are supposedly thread-safe.I wrote a small program demonstrating my issue:
That's because global variables are not shared between processes. Use multiprocessing.Manager.list -Renamed your list from list to lis as list is python's inbuilt
