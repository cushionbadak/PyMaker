I've started to learn Python programming using Learn Python the Hard Way.  Exercise 3 has some math practice, for example:Normally, the output is  but when I run it on my Windows machine the output is . Why is this?For clarity, my code is:and the output is Python version:The issue is , can anyone guide me about that, please.Thanks
In Python3, the  statement of Python2 was changed to function: . So Python2 interprets this Python3 statements as calling the  statement with a tuple.Relevant documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html#print-is-a-function.
The difference is in the version of Python. If you're using Python 2.XX you don't need the brackets when you are calling the print function; however in Python 3.XX you must use print() with the brackets.If you want to solve your problem, you should change your Python version or just remove every brackets from the print function like this:
As others have identified, your  calls in Python 2 call a statement, whereas in Python 3, they call a function. The addition of brackets is necessary in Python 3 whereas they indicate a tuple in Python 2.In Python 2.6+, you can bring in the new behaviour of the print function from Python 3 by importing the print function from the  package:This provides the Python 3 behaviour and will allow your print statements to be executed with similar behaviour under both Python 2 and 3 interpreters. (Other Python 2-specific constructs may, of course, require separate treatment.)
