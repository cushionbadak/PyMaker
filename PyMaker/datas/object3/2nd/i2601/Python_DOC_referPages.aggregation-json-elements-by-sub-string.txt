I have the following structure:Each  combines from type and version (In  for example, a in the type and v1 is the version).How can i create a list of all the  which are not the 2 latest versions?In our case, The output would be:Any idea how to do that in Python? I've been thinking about counting sub-strings. For example: To use  as a delimiter, And count how many times i find the left side of the string (aa, b, c). Is this possible to implement such as thing in Python? Any better ideas?
Assuming your list  is pre-sorted, as in your example, you can use  and use list slicing:
The problem would be easier with a slightly different data format.You didn't write any code so I won't give you a complete answer:It outputs:You could now try to use  to group the versions by letter and remove every version but the last two ones for each group.
