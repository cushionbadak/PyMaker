I am trying to convert the following data structure;To the format below in python 3;
if your data looks like:You can do this:1 Step: use regular expressions to parse your data, because it is string. see more about reg-expOutput:2 Step: extract raw values and column names.Output:raws -columns - 3 Step: Now we can just create df.Output:Is it what you want?I hope it helps, I'm not sure about your input format.And don't forget import libraries! (I used pandas as pd, numpy as np, re).UPD: another way I have created log file like you have:Output:Then split by ' ' , drop '\n' and reshape:In reshape, first number is raws count in your future dataframe, second - count of columns and last - you don't need to change. It won't works if you don't have whitespace between info and '\n' in each raw. If you don't, I will change an example.Output:And then take raws and columns:Finally, create dataframe (and cat last symbol for columns):Output:If you have many log files, you can do that for each in for-loop, save each dataframe at array (example, array calls DF_array) and then use pd.concat to do one dataframe from array of dataframes. If you need I can add an example.UPD:I have created a dir with log files and then make array with all files from PATH:Then do for-loop like in last update:Output:
