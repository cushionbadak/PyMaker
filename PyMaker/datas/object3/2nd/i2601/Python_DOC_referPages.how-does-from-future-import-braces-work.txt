I've been fascinated by the  module - in particular, its ability to change the way statements are parsed in python. What's most interesting is how doing something like Enables you to use  (and not , like you would expect any other normal import to do).I have read What is __future__ in Python used for and how/when to use it, and how it works thoroughly and in particular came across a particular line:A future statement is a directive to the compiler that a particular  module should be compiled using syntax or semantics that will be  available in a specified future release of Python.I would love to know the intricacies of what exactly makes this possible. In particular, how something like Can enable true division on python2, whileCan enable the  syntax on python3 (what I find most funny is that you have to import a feature from "" for backward compatibility).Anyway, to summarise, I would like to know how the directive is understood and executed by the compiler when  or its artefacts are imported. 
 tells the parser to not treat  as a keyword (leaving it as a name instead). That way the compiler treats it as the function and not a statement.To track this, the  struct has a  field that holds a  object that tracks which future directives have been enabled. Various parts of the parser and compiler check the flags and alter behaviour.This is mostly handled in the  source file, which has a  function that checks for  AST objects with the module parameter set to , and sets flags based on what is found.For example, for the  'feature', the parser refuses  as syntax but accepts  instead:You can find the other examples by grepping for the  flags listed in .Note that there is a  Python module, but it is not directly involved in the parsing and compilation of code; it is merely there to give Python code easy access to metadata about directives (including bitfield values to pass to the  argument of the  function), nothing more.
