I want to specify an object which has a  property. This might either be a list of  objects, or an empty list. I'm looking for a schema something like the code below, except this returns the following error:I am using these templates to generate Python classes.
There is no annotation for an 'empty' list. Any empty list object will satisfy a  type hint, regardless of the specifics of what the list contents must be.So if an empty list is allowed, useThat allows for any list with 0 or more elements, so the empty list is included in that hint.If you instead meant to say that  values ( in JSON) are permitted next to  objects, then use a  annotation with :If you wanted to say that either , or a list of  objects is permitted (in JSON terms, a  or an array), then useYou could also use :to mean the same thing. I'd not use that inside the  hint, however; that reads as if you are saying that the type of the elements might be optional, making for a confusing type specification.
