Is there a way to get an object's init argument values in python 2.7? I'm able to get the defaults through getargspec but i would like to access passed in valuesReturns
 is treated no differently than any other function. So, like with any other function, its arguments are discarded once it returns -- unless you save them somewhere before that.The standard approach is to save what you need later in attributes of the instance:"Dataclasses" introduced in 3.7 streamline this process but require data annotations:is equivalent to:Though see Python decorator to automatically define __init__ variables why this streamlining is not very useful in practice.
You can store them as attributes.then just print them:if you want to see them all, you could take a look into its  attribute.
