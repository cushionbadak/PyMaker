Natural Text
I am writing a code and i am not getting the desired output.It would be great if anyone can help me by pointing out what i am doing wrong.My code is:Here according to me i am supposed to be getting the corrected_word but instead it is giving its length to be 0 ,i.e, it is just what i had defined it initially,i.e, empty string
Your problem is that your loop operates on  where you ment to use .Iterating by index over a string is not needed here, you could simply go for But this will get you out of bounds error if your text contains  as your index is now outside of   length. Also you do not handle non-existent mappings (f.e. space) for which find will return a value thats probably not correct.Fix of your code: Strings are immutables. by using  you are creating lots of throw-away  wich takes perfomance. Use a  instead and  afterwards to get the string. Better way to solve this task:What you try to code already has a solution using python - for replacing something, s are great as you mapp a key to a value. For strings there are even convenience functions that build the dict for you:Readup:str.translate()str.maketrans()If a character is not present in the lookup, it is used as is (space f.e.)Output:
