Can tuple with list as an element which can be modified at any stage be key in a dictionary?
Tuples are hashable, and therefore usable as dict keys, if and only if all of their elements are hashable.This is what you're intuitively expect, and it's easy to test:But if you want to know where it's documented, it's in the Immutable Sequence Types section of the Sequence Types â€” , ,  docs:The only operation that immutable sequence types generally implement that is not also implemented by mutable sequence types is support for the  built-in.This support allows immutable sequences, such as  instances, to be used as  keys and stored in  and  instances.Attempting to hash an immutable sequence that contains unhashable values will result in .
