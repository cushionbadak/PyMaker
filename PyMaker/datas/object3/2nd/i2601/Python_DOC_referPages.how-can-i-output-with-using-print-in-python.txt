Natural Text
Can I output the first sentence like the second one by using the  function?
yes, you just need to escape your single s by putting a backslash  before them - this is called string escaping and helps your  function to notice, that these characters should be displayed as plain text and not be interpreted like usual, "special" characters.
Or Just enclose in double quotes
No need for 
You can use  which for strings returns a representation of the literal you would use to create the string:There are other ways to do it, with or without backslash:But I think for using  is the clearest and more general way.
