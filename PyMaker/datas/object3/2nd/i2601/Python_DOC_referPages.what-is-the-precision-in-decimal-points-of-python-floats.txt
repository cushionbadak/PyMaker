I am trying to determine how precise python floats are when comparing to zero. Observe the following:I appears the threshold is 324 decimal points, at least with the implementation I am running (python 2.7, CPython). Is this documented anywhere? Is it implementation dependent? 
It is implementation-specific:numbers.Real (float)These represent machine-level double  precision floating point numbers. You are at the mercy of the  underlying machine architecture (and C or Java implementation) for the  accepted range and handling of overflow. Python does not support  single-precision floating point numbers; the savings in processor and  memory usage that are usually the reason for using these are dwarfed  by the overhead of using objects in Python, so there is no reason to  complicate the language with two kinds of floating point numbers.You can, however, query this information at run time:
