I'm looking for a clean way to use global variables in many files. So I want to write a parameters.py file where all my parameters will be stored.How can i achieve this ? I've heard about  or  but i don't understand how to use them. Can someone explain me how to build this logic and then how to use it to import a variable.I want to use the standards of Tensorflow if possible ...
You can simply build a  module where all variables defined in it are global:And then in the other scripts or modules of the same project, you can simply refer to these global variables with:
Another option is to use a configuration file with a well known format:jsonyamltomlThen you can bring in variables like so
Also you can use configparserparams.ini: main.py
