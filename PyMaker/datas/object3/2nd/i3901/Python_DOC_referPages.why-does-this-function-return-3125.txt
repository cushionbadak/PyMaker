Today I saw a function in a python textbook, the code is below:When I gave params to the  like below:The function returned me a 3125. I know 3125 may be came from (5*5)*(5*5)*5,but I don't understand how working is the params in the code. What the meaning of the expression ?
That's a concatenation of a tuple.
If you inspect the value of , you can see how it works: applied to a sequence returns that sequence appended to itself  times (see documentation).
Note that  expands to , aka is a tuple.  See the docs on tuples . Re : according to the docs,  returns x to the power y: In your script, you use the * in  to insert the two items in the  tuple as individual parameters into the function. You could have achieved the same by typing . Thus, 5^5, which equals 3125. A intuitive tutorial on tuples is here.
