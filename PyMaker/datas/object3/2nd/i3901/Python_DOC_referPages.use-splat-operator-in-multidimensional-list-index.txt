Say I have the listand I have an index that I want to use to access an element of this list.I want to use something like to mean , but this doesn't work and neither does . Is there a similar way to do this without having a chain of index calls?I would like a method to do this without using any libraries that must be imported.
You can use , which is part of the standard library:Or, you can write your own class that supports that kind of multi-dimensional indexing:Otherwise, this is not possible using just lists and without loops or other functions.
First of all  is equivalent to  which is equivalent to . Note the double parentheses. Any  implementation that wants to play nice with the Python data model always expects exactly one (explicit) argument.That's why unpacking values from  inside the  does not make much sense.  will give you a  and  gives you a  (because you are providing too many arguments).Standard Python lists expect integer arguments to , but  supports indexing with tuples (a numpy array still only takes exactly one argument for , but it's allowed to be a tuple).Demo:Of course, you can omit the parentheses, because is exactly equivalent.
