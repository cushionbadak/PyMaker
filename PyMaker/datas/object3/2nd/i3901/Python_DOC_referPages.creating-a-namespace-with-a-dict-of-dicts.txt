Currently I am using  to save a dict to a config file. I load this to turn it into a  then turn it into a  because I prefer dot notation to access the settings. To do this, I load it as in this example:However, as I am currently loading the  into a  it is not loading the sub dicts within the config file. So for example if I do:I get the error:I was wondering how I load all dicts into the namespace as name spaces so that I am able to use dot notation all the way down the dictionary.
It is not necessarily to recursively apply the transformation to the data returned by .  You can simply ask  to return  instances instead of dictionaries by providing an  method to the  call.  This method "will be called with the result of every JSON object decoded and its return value will be used in place of the given ." (from the docs).The simplest  might look like:For example, given the following input:We can do the following:
You'll have to recursively apply the  class to nested dictionaries; I prefer to use  for such cases:then use this as:Demo:
