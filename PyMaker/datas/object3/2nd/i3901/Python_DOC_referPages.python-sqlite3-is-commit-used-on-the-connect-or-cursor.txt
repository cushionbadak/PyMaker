I'm in the process of learning python and sqlite3 through a book named Practical Programming: 2nd Edition.Within the book itself, it has conflicting code.If this is the start of my code:To commit, would I use con.commit(), or cur.commit(). Or are there different times to use the different one?Here are pictures from the book:This shows con.commit()This shows cur.commit()I checked online at https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html and shows con.commit()Just wanna make sure whether the book has an error of using , or whether there is a special condition to use it.Thanks in advance
 and  are the same ... they are created object types ... in both cases they are otherwise named ... important is mainly  and not the naming that the programmer has specifiedThere are object types that use a different name (con and cur - as you asked) to calling the method. You can also use a different name in your code, for example:Please check again the webpage https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html . You forgot to copy these two lines from the webpage:And then continuing the code (just copied it):
I took unutbu's advice and tried it myself.Sample code:PyCharm Run:Error in textbook.  does not exist. Thanks unutbu and s3n0
I think if you're using a specified cursor to commit changes, in your case, it should be cur.connection.commit().You can always use connect to commit in the end of your code, whether it's named db, or con or conn.But when your code gets complicated, you'll have different function to do certain operation to the database, if you only use connection commit, when there is a bug, you gonna have a hard time to find which function failed. So you create specific cursor for specific operation, when that failed, the traceback message will show you which specific cursor when wrong.
