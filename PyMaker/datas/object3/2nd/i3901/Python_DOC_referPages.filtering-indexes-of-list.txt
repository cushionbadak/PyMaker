I have the following list of numbers:I want the indexes of those numbers which are multiple of n,  so I do:That's ok, but what happens when I add the variable m?   Why that code doesn't returns [1, 3, 5, 4, 6]?What is the mistake?And how to create the function that returns that list?
You can use a list comprehension in combination with  method. Also, you can apply extended iterable unpacking operator in order to pass parameters as many you need.Output
A more general and Pythonic approach that works for any number of variables is to use an  or  function that check the Truth value of the condition for all the arguments. If you want the index to belongs to an item that is divisible buy all the arguments you need  other wise you can use  that returns True right after it encounters a match.Demo:And with :
The issue is  returns an iterator from an iterable. Once it is exhausted, you may not use it again. Therefore, you can simply define a new  iterator:Note there are better ways you can implement your algorithm.
