I was wondering about classes and how I can access their values from the outside with either printing it or using the _str__ function. I came across this question:Python function not accessing class variableThen I did this test in Shell, but it didn't work as expected. I wonder why the other answer worked, but not this one.(edit)My question was answered by how to instantiate a class, not instance variables.
You had done a mistake while creating objects, please find below differences:What you have done:Explanation:when you are creating  for a class use **https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#class-objects
You define your variable inside init, which is only called when the class is instantiated. For a longer explanation, I'd refer you to the first answer on the question you linked.
