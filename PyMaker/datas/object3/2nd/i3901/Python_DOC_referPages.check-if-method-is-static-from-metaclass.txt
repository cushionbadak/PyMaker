Simmilar question (related with Python2: Python: check if method is static)Lets concider following class definition:In Python 3 there is no  anymore, everything is function, so the answer related to Python 2 will not work anymore.As I told, everything is function, so we can call , but of course we cannot call  (argument missmatch). But if we make an instance  and we call  Python passes to the function  the  as first argument. Calling  prevents from sending it or captures the  - so there have to be a way to test if this is staticmethod or not.So can we check in Python3 if a method was declared as  or not?

I needed this solution and wrote the following based on the answer from @root
For Python 3.2 or newer, use  to retrieve the attribute without invoking the descriptor protocol:Retrieve attributes without triggering dynamic lookup via the descriptor protocol,  or .Use  on the result:The function can handle both instances and classes, and will scan the full class hierarchy for you:
