I don't know where you've learnt how HTTP works but I'm pretty sure that you did not study the actual standard which you should do when implementing a protocol. Some notes about your implementation:Line ends should be  not . This is true for both responses from the server as requests from the client.You are assuming that the clients requests is never larger than 1024 bytes and that it can be read within a single . But, requests can have arbitrary length and there is no guarantee that you get all within a single  (TCP is a streaming protocol and not a message protocol).While it is kind of ok to simply close the TCP connection after the body it would be better to include the length of the body in the  header or use chunked transfer encoding.The type of the content should be given by using the  header, i.e.  for HTML and  for JPEG images. Without this browser might guess correctly or wrongly what the type might be or depending on the context might also insist on a proper content-type header.Apart from that, if you debug such problems it is helpful to find out what gets actually exchanged between client and server. It might be that you've checked this for yourself but you did not include such information into your question. Your only error description is "...I recive the call but cannot preset the png/JPEG in the page" and then a dump of your code.
httpServer.pyEnded up like: And the Get method like:
