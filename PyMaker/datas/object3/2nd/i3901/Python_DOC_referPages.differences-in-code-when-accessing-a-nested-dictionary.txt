VS SO I am doing this course on udemy and it requires me to do something like this:What is the difference in my code and Colt's solution
Let's build upon what you have done:In python, sequences are iterable with a for loop. When you don't need the index, don't count it:To simply generate a list out of another one, you may use a list comprehension:Since you iterate twice the same sequence we could also avoid the  by combining as we go:Now, let's fix the mistake in your output: you output each full name as a 2-tuple containing two strings (the first name and the last name). Let's format them into a full name instead:That version is pretty much the one that confuses you, but it uses a list comprehension instead of .[bonus] Since we use format, we could also use its rich syntax to access item's entries:
In both cases you will have to iterate through the  list in one way or another.The way you do it is by iterating once to get all the first names and then iterating again to get all the last names - then you put the first name and the corresponding last name in a tuple and return a list of tuples.The 2nd function iterates only once, and it does that using the map function. In the  function, there's a  function that will be applied for every item of the list. The  function takes a dictionary  from the list and puts first and last name in a string, separating them with a space: now equals to . This is repeated for every dictionary in the list where  is the first name and  is the last name. The map object is then converted to a list and returned.The key difference in the output, is that you are returning a list of tuples, and not a list of strings. To fix that problem, modify the end of your function from this:to this:
I would rather to do as follow:
