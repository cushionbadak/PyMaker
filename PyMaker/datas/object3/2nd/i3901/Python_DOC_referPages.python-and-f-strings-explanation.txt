I then assigned an integer to the name, and then the string with value .Formatting a string literal with another string literal is pretty meaningless. You'd normally use an actual variable, so you can vary the output produced:Also, that's not an  string. An  string literal starts with a  character. What you have here is a regular, run-of-the-mill string literal, and a call to the  method. The following is the equivalent expression using an f-string:See String with 'f' prefix in python-3.6 for more information on actual f-strings.
