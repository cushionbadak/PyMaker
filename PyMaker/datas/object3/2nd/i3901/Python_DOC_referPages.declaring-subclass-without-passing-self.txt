I have an abstract base class :and a subclass :The following code will cause a recursion error, but if I remove  from the , the call to  works.Question:I only discovered this error when I implemented the  In Python 3.x when calling the parent constructor from the child with no arguments, is passing , necessary?Suppose  now sets the , ,  this means in my subclass the constructor will look like this:notice,  isn't being passed in the  because to my knowledge, it can throw the variable assignments off. Is this assumption correct?
 is passed implicitly to the super call, so adding it explicitly sends it twice:That ends up calling , which is the same as .Later on, you have probably tried convert your instance to  (e.g. to print it), so this was called:That code tried to convert  to a string and  is  because of the previous error, so it continues in an endless recursion (until the recursion exception).Note that  takes two forms: with arguments and without arguments, so there are two correct ways to fix the code.The Python 3 way (without arguments):The old Python 2 way, which is more explicit:Both do the same, i.e. they give you the bound  method which already has the implicit .See also here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#super
