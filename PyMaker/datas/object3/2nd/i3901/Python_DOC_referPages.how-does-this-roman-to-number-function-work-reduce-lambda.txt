Natural Text
This function converts string roman numerals into integers by iterating from the right and adding to the symbol on the left unless it is greater, then it subtracts. What I don't understand is how  gets assigned to a index in the string. How does it bind to the iterator from  when it reduces?I know this is very un-Pythonic. I found this example in a book on interview questions in Python and want to understand why this works. 
 is - in simplified terms- a simple, anonymous function. You can break it up just like a function based on the colon:The string  and the dictionary  are available in a scope higher than the  and neither is assigned within the  statement, so the  has access to both. is a function that basically maps another callable across an iterable. As you can see in the docs,  applies the current result as the first argument to the given callable, and the current item as the second argument. A third argument can be supplied to reduce, which is the starting value; if not supplied, the first element in iterable will be used instead.So, as you can see, the current element of  (the iterable passed to ) is passed at each Step as the second argument () to the function passed to  (). The  function then uses the second argument () to index string
