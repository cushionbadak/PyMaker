I have a folder of JPEGs. They are all RGB. I want to convert them all to greyscale with scikit-image.I get the error message : What am I doing wrongly here ? 
Give this code a try:Notice that  is a list containing the full path name of all the image files found in  and its subdirectories (recursively). The complete list of image types being detected can be found at the documentation of the imghdr module.
It looks like you are not running the script in the directory the files are located.Either use the full file path for  or  into .
