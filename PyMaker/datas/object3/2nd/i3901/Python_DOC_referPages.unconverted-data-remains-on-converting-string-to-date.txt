A simple code as below always gives me an error complaining about The prints output 14/11/2016, str and 10What is wrong with this code and why does it complain about 16?
Quoting the documentation,  is "Year without century as a zero-padded decimal number.    00, 01, …, 99". This conversion requires exactly two characters. Thus your conversion eats  but leaves  unconverted.You want to use , "Year with century as a decimal number.  0001, 0002, …, 2013, 2014, …, 9998, 9999".
