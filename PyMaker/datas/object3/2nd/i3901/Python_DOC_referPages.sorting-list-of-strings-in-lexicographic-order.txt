This question already has an answer here:Sort list of strings ignoring upper/lower case                    3 answers                I want to print the words in lexicographic order. I thought  arranges the words in this way. I have also tried  which returns the same order. Or am I missing something with what lexicographic order really is?Code:Output:Desired Output:
This is because the ASCII value of upper-case letters is smaller than lower-case. If you want your sort to ignore case you can do this, for example:
You are missing something. In the standard, Unicode order (starting with the old ASCII order), all upper-case English letters come before all lower-case letters. You can see that in a table of Unicode characters.If you want to ignore the case while sorting, as it seems you do, just temporarily convert all the letters to upper-case or to lower-case during the sort. Python allows you to do that in the  function with the  parameter, as you can see in other answers here (finished before I finished this answer).
By default, python already sorts strings in lexicographical order, but uppercase letters are all sorted before lowercase letters. If you want to sort strings and ignore case, then you can do
You could ignore the case when sorting:
You have to iterate using the indexes to see the right order.Here is the code how you can do it.
