I need to split a tsv with 400000 rows into 4 csv files with 100000 rows. My sample code:I am getting this error:
You might try to use   with the  named parameter, so that Python knows which encoding to read.Without knowing this (looks like a Windows-CP1252 file according to the hex code, but I might be wrong) you're basically out of luck. On *nix oder MacOS you can use the  command that tries to make an educated guess of the encoding. Second, you should probably not try to read everything in a list with . For really large files this is a memory hog. Better stream-read thru the file by iterating as shown below.I'm sure you close the files after running, just added it to be sure. :-)If you are on a *nix'ish operating system (or MacOS) you might want to check out the  command that does exactly this (and more): How to split a large text file into smaller files with equal number of lines?
This is the answer for the question, Thank you all for the help.
