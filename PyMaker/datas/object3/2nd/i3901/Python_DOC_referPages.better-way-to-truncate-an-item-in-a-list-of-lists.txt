I have a long list of lists where the first element in a list is a long string and I need to truncate to a shorter string.I am currently iterating through the lists twice.  Once to shorted the first element and the second to format for output:Is there a way to just iterate through the list once and include a truncating step in the second iteration?  I want to change the list elements in place and not just truncate for output.
 is a list and you can update it without an extra indexing step or temporary variable
For loop is quite a slow process. You can truncated each row on a fly, by reformating .Something like this:It usually works much faster than for loop.
