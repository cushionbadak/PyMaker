Hi am I trying to add elements from an array to a JSON file I would like to have each element of the array to be on their own line I currently have this This code puts all the elements on 1 line but for some reason in the file there are always empty elements [] in the front
This is happening because you are opening the output files in append mode (the  flag as second arg to ), which means that anything written to the file will be appended to the current contents; and you are dumping the list to the file in each iteration of the  loop. (this is also why you have empty lists in the front - during the first few iterations  and/or  may still be an empty list). Try opening the file in write mode  and writing the json dump after the loop is finished. Something like this:Note that this will still output everything on a single line - you can use the  kwarg to  to pretty print it if that's what you want. (see the python docs for usage examples.) Also example below (ipython session - json.dumps outputs to stdout instead of a file):
