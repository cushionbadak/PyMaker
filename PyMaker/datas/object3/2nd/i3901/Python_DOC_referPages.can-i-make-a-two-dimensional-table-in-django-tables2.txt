Edited:Hi guys, I have been looking for a solution to my problem for some days without an answerI am trying to make a two-dimensional table with data obtained from the same model.The idea is to list the students in rows, the data in columns and the status in their respective cells, a two dimensional table.These are my table:graphically this is what I want to do:
I think I would do something like this:Filter the  queryset like desired, and pass it to your table.Implement a custom constructor for your table, doing something like this:Loop over the queryset, transforming it to a OrderedDict with the user id as key. For any new date you should add a new column to the instance, and add a key for that date to the OrderedDict.The new column can be a , or something specialized to suit your needs.The custom constructor should call the constructor of the parent class, passing the items of the OrderedDict as data and the date columns as .In code, it could look like this:You might want to sort the value you pass to , as the order retrieved from the database might not be the desired order for presentation.
