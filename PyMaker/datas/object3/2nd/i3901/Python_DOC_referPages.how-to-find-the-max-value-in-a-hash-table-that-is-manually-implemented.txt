Hi I'm new to Python and I implemented a hash table that counts the number of occurences of a letter in a word.For example the hash table currently stores this:I want to find the max value in the hash table, which is 2. I implemented an iterator so I can iterate through the hash table.  I managed to find the max value like this:EDIT: I implemented a hashtable class with the set item, get item functions.But is there a better way to do it without using a tempList and max built in function?
Your  object appears to be an iterable of key-value pairs.First, not that your four lines of code:… is equivalent to a one-liner comprehension:And it's trivial to turn this into a lazy iterator, instead of building a list in memory:And you can inline this directly in the  call:As a side note, notice that I used  instead of . You almost never want to compare to  with  or . The rule of thumb is:If you want any truthy value, use .If you want any non- value, use .If you want any non- value, while specifically allowing other classes to override  and compare as equal to , use .However, it's worth noting that if you want to build a custom hash table, you probably want it to act like a dict—or at least like a . Implementing the  interface is very easy, and it means your object can duck-type as a dict.And, if you do that, you can use the same code you'd use with a dict:
Assuming your class is the same as ,  you can simply use  this way:This will return  with your example. You may simplify it if you're not interested in knowing which key has the max value.We pass all items as  pairs, and use the  argument of  to tell it to compare items by value.
