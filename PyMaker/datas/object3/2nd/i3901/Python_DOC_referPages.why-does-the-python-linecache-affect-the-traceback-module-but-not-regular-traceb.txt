Consider the following Python program:I am dynamically defining a function that raises an exception and adding it to the . The output of the code isIf I then get a traceback from that function using the  module, the line of code from the function is shown (the  part of the first traceback). But if I just let the code raise an exception and get the regular traceback from the interpreter, it doesn't show the code. Why doesn't the regular interpreter traceback use the linecache? Is there a way to make the code appear in regular tracebacks? 
The default  uses a separate, C-level implementation of traceback printing, not the  module. (Perhaps this is so it still works even if the system is too borked to use .) The C implementation doesn't try to use . You can see the code it uses to retrieve source lines in .If you want tracebacks to use the  module's implementation, you could replace  with :
