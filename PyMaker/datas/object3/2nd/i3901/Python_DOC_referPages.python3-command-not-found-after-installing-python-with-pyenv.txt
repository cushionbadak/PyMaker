From the  documentation on managing versions:Locating the Python InstallationOnce pyenv has determined which  version of Python your application has specified, it passes the  command along to the corresponding Python installation.Each Python version is installed into its own directory under $(pyenv  root)/versions.For example, you might have these versions installed:$(pyenv root)/versions/2.7.8/ $(pyenv root)/versions/3.4.2/ $(pyenvroot)/versions/pypy-2.4.0/ As far as pyenv is concerned, version names  are simply the directories in $(pyenv root)/versions.
