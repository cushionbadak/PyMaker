I am unable to resolve value  Below works fine with time zone  :2017-01-12 14:12:06-05:00Does not work fine when time zone is  :2017-01-12 14:12:06-05:00
Time zone in format , i.e. with a colon, is not supported by the  module.But you can use  or :
The documentation for strptime, for the  format specifier:If I run your second example in my Python shell (Python 3.6.5), I get a ValueError:Based on that, offsets with  in are not valid. You can have to handle this yourself, or use another parsing library
