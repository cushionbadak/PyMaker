Here are two discrete objects:For any  object, is there inherently a way for that object to be aware of the attribute name that  assigned it?I know I could pass parameters to the  object, like , but that would be messy and tedious in my actual case so I'm just wondering if there's a non-manual way of doing the same thing.Thanks!
Yes, you can make the  class a descriptor, and then use  method to bind the name.  No special handling is needed in .  Called at the time the owning class owner is created. The descriptor has been assigned to name.This method is available in Python 3.6+.
