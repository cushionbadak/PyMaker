How can I automate 'csv' file reading, wherein I have to read files after every five minutes and apply some operations using Pandas. I don't want to manually read every file and name each one of it and then apply the functions (self defined) on those files. I'm a beginner in Programming. These are the functions I want to apply after reading the file. Thanks in advance!
Use the time module to sleep and perform your tasks at regular intervals (5 minutes in this case)Provide the folder/directory path and using the os.listdir(path) you can get the list of your file names.
