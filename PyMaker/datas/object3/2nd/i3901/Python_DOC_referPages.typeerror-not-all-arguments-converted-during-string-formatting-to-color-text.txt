I am trying to make a game on my own and this is my first one. In it I'm trying to add features as time goes on and one day I came up with an idea to add color to certain key words. This is what I have:Now when the code asks you what class you would like to be, I want the words "Warlock," "Titan," and "Hunter to show up in different colors. This is what I tried to do:It pulls up an error that says:I don't want to write "Fore.BLUE + "Warlock" + Style.RESET_ALL" everytime inside the quote, instead I want to have the system to call back to "Fore.BLUE + "Warlock" + Style.RESET_ALL" when I write Warlock. I think what I'm thinking should work but I'm executing it wrong...Do take note that I'm writing all of this in Repl.it online in python 3.6.1 Here is the link for the code in Repl.it: https://repl.it/@Woah_its_boobe/Error
This problem isn't because of Colorama. The problem here is that the  operator has higher precedence than , so Python is trying to add the name here:before it combines all those strings using . The simple solution is to wrap the entire string expression in parentheses:outputHowever, it would be easier to read if you don't add strings together manually, and use the  method instead of .output
Your problem is that string formatting can't jump past the  concatenation of strings.  It is solved by using:You have to attach the  right next to the  string.  I also removed a bunch of unnecessary parentheses and stuff.
