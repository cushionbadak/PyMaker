Is it possible to iterate the  object in Python with ? I made a simple function named  which return a unique hash. Now I decided to benchmark the loop and I get around 8 seconds for iterating to print 100,000 hashes. Can I run this in async to be able to minimize the time? I read the documentation of it but I am confused. I want to explore async and I want to begin with this problem.EDIT 1The  function is the main reason why the program was taking too long to run. I recreated the function below, with current time and random string from  (low collision) as values. I tried multithreading but instead of making the task to run as fast it's taking too slow. Any recommendation to refactor the code below is always welcomed.EDIT 2With the help of Jack Taylor and Stackoverflowers I can see the difference by using  over 1M iterations. I benchmark the code below.
It looks like you are probably better off with the sequential version. The conventional wisdom is that, in Python, with I/O-bound jobs (file reads/writes, networking) you can get a speed-up by using an event loop or multiple threads, and with CPU-bound jobs (like computing hashes) you can get a speed-up by using multiple processes.However, I took your version and rewrote it using  and a process pool, and instead of speeding it up it made it 10 times slower.Here's the code:With multiple processes there is some overhead involved with starting and stopping the different processes, and with inter-process communication, which is probably why the multi-process version is slower than the sequential version even though it is using all of the CPU cores.You could also try using clustering to split the work over multiple computers, and/or writing the algorithm in a lower-level language (Go strikes me as a good choice). But whether that would be worth your while, I don't know.
