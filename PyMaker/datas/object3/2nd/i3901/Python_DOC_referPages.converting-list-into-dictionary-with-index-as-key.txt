This question already has an answer here:One liner: creating a dictionary from list with indices as keys                    5 answers                Python Loop: List Index Out of Range                    4 answers                To convert a  into a  with key as the index of the element and values as the value in the list. i have tried to create it but was facing errors.below is my current codewhat is wrong in my code. i am a beginner in python.
Take for array  an example Try this simple code
Try using enumerate! It's nifty:what is wrong with your code is that you are taking two elements of a list (by subscripting them with the list[value] syntax) and setting them equal to each other.What you meant to do:What this does:Enumerating a sequence gives you a tuple where an integer is paired with the value of the sequence.Like in my list above, the enumerate(list) itself would be: Result: (0, 1)        (1, 2)        (2, 3)The k and v in the loop first for loop I wrote unpacks the tuples (k= the index 0 of the tuple, v = the second), and the predefined dict (d in my case) sets the enumerate value (d[k], the key) to the value k (the second value of the tuple after enumeration)Hope this makes sense!
the following code will work
