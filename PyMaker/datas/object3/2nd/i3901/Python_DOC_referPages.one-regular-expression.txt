My question is very simple.Can someone explain this python Regular Expression for me?And the negations_dic is here: I want to know what do the ( and ) and '|' mean .This is the command that use the regular expression above: And what is the use of  mean? Does it return the key-value pair in the ?
In regular expressions: means 'or' (so any one of the choices will do), and '( )' means a matching group.So,  will match any of the words , , or .But, the question seems to be more python than regular expression to me. will result in a matching group  which will match any of the elements in the list.
