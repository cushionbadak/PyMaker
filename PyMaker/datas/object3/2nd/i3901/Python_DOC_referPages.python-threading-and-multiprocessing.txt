This is my code:When i run this code, the result is:When i change the Thread into Process, the result is:Why the +5 for x doesn't work while the append for y works?And, why when i use Process both +5 and append don't work?
I suggest you to read tutorial before asking basic questions as it will save everyone's time including yours.In short, when you use , the main thread and launched thread share the same memory space but the  in function  is another internal  but not the same  outside. So you just change the internal  but not the  outside. Further, actually  is also an internal , but you are changing what it points to but not itself. You can confirm this by change  to  to see will the outside  change.And, when you use , the main thread and launched process hold totally separate memory space.
