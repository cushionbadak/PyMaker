I am having a weird issue. I am using Hmac to generate signature as follows:when I run it I get the following error:It is noteworthy that the timestamp should not be base 64 encoded and the message should be. Any idea?Update: Here is the documentation: help.disqus.com/developer/integrating-single-sign-on please look at The message body (Base64-encoded) and Timestamp (NOT Base-64 encoded). it specfically says timestamp should not be base 64 encoded and message should be. Also here is their sample code which they claim it should work: github.com/disqus/DISQUS-API-Recipes/blob/master/sso/python/â€¦ but I think this may only work in python 2.x
Your issue stems from the fact that you're trying to concatenate types that Python natively doesn't know how to concatenate - in your case  (),  () and an  ().You need to convert your data to a common type (string, for example) before attempting to natively concatenate them, or you can let  do that for you:Mind you, this is still naive converting, it just doesn't inconvenience you to  every argument you want to concatenate into a string. This could still fail, tho, if your  contains data that cannot be encoded as Unicode on Python 3.x.
I think the issue here is the the space character is a string, which can't be concatenated to the message which is bytes.  Getting rid of the space will give you a similar issue about concatenating bytes with an Integer.  You need to get all of this data to byes before concatenating it or else concatenate everything as strings and then encode it to bytes.
