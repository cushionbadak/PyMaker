As the Python Packaging Authority docs on Installing packages using pip explain, on Windows, you usually don't want to use  directly. It may not be on your , or it may be on your  but not match the same version as the  launcher.Usually, you want to use that  launcher for everything:If you're not using  for some reason, the answer is usually one of these:The official docs mention the  version first, and only mention  for when you're dealing with multiple Python versions. But you're probably better off always using , as the PyPA suggests. See PEP 397 for why the launcher is useful.)Of course if you want to do this from inside IPython instead of directly at the shell, prefix any of those with .As a side note: Notice that the same page pretty strongly recommends using  (or the builtin , but the documentation is all for ). You should consider doing so, but if you have a good reason not to, it's not mandatory or anything.
