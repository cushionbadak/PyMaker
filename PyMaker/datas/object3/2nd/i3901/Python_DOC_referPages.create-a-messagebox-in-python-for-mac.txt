Currently working through a free online class for Python from Cybrary (I'm coding in 3.6), but I use a Mac while the presenter uses Windows. So far, there have been very few differences if any.The current section deals with learning and using Ctypes however, and the "assignment" says to .The code used in the video as an example of creating a Message Box:My code:Running this gives the error:I don't believe I need to say that I get the same error trying to runI haven't been able to find any examples anywhere of people creating Message Boxes on Mac computers. Is it a Windows-specific function? If so, what would be the Mac equivalent of this?EDIT: Mark Setchell's solution is to have Python run terminal functions that accomplish  tasks, so instead of , use:
If you type this into a Terminal on any Mac, you'll get a dialog box:See here for further examples.So, just use a Python subprocess call to run that... subprocess documentation, or use .Nothing to install. No dependencies. You can also ask user for values, select files or directories and pick colours using the same technique. The dialog boxes are all native Mac ones - not some ugly imitation.
