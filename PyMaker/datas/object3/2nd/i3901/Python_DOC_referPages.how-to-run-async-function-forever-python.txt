How do I use asyncio and run the function forever. I know that there's  but how do I use  how do I call the async function?I'm not sure how to start the function.
 doesn't mean that an async function will magically run forever, it means that the loop will run forever, or at least until someone calls . To literally run an async function forever, you need to create an async function that does that. For example:This is why  doesn't accept an argument, it doesn't care about any particular coroutine. The typical pattern is to add some coroutines using  or equivalent before invoking . But even an event loop that runs no tasks whatsoever and sits idly can be useful since another thread can call  and give it work.
I'm unsure as to exactly what you mean when you say I'm not sure how to start the function. If you're asking the question in the literal sense: If you wish to add a function to the loop before initialising the loop then the following line prior to  will suffice:To add a function to a loop that is already running you'll need :In both cases the function you intend to call must be designated in some way as asynchronous, i.e. using the  function prefix or the  decorator.
