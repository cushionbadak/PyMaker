Write a Python program to find numbers between 120 and 200 which are divisible by 7 and multiples of 5 without using a "for loop".I tried to work it out this way...But rather I do get this error. What could I be missing out?
Since you're not allowed to use the  construct, you can accomplish this with the  method:Note that the problem is not asking you to print the numbers but rather "find" them which means to create some form of list or collection of the valid valuesPS: I did  because "divisble by" and "multiples of" means the same thing and so 35 is from .PPS:  returns a filter object which is a generator. You will need to convert that to a list if you want to view the list by doing . You don't need to do the conversion if you just need to iterate through the values and use them for something else since the generator will work just fine for that
Your teacher likes it twisted. Divisible by 7 and multiple of 5 just means divisible by both 7 and 5, so 35...Your original code needs a loop. But python has built-ins that generate loops without a  or  statement (and they're much faster than  or  because they're usually using native compiled C code)sshashank124 gave a nice answer, but it can be simplified even more by:choosing the proper  start point by "aligning" 120 on the next multiple of 35use a step of 35 in like this:It's probably much faster because it only uses one division & multiplication, then only additions.
I think using a list comprehension is more idiomatic for Python than  (of course if you are allowed).Or at creation:
What you are trying to do is define x as a range of numbers but that will make x a list of numbers and you will still have to go through every number to check it. Since "for loop" is not allowed, you can use a while loop or call a function recursively starting from lower limit till the passable parameter hits upper limit.
