This question already has an answer here:subprocess.call                    3 answers                I wanted to create some folders with subfolders and have this python3 script that would read a csv file and create directories for me. I was expecting that it executes commands of this sortwhich works fine from the terminal and creates a folder called  with 6 folders from  and then each folder contains  folders.A sample csv would be like this:I am getting this error when I run the python script.Not sure why it says  when I am creating directories with  which is supposed to create the parent directories if they don't exist.
I believe parameter expansion used in the above command will not work without passing the  argument to . This way Python will execute the command in an intermediate shell process.If you want your script to be platform independent you could instead use  and handle the logic in Python.
