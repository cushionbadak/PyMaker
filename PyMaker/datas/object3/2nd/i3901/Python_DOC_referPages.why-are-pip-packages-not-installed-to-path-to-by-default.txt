Typically when using  in the  ecosystem or / in the JavaScript ecosystem packages are installed somewhere on the  or at least you are instructed to add the package install location to your path .It seems like with  in the  ecosystem there is never an emphasis on this. Instead, you are encouraged to run modules via , etc.Seems a bit odd to me, was this just a design decision? Is it good practice to put  or whatever location  is using into ? Sometimes a binary is added to  (and sometimes with a different name than the package itself e.g  instead of  with  whereas the binary is usually the same as the package name in /JavaScript ecosystems), for example, I see, but is that all of the time?
You're confusing  and .  is for libraries,   is for programs (binaries and scripts).  installs libraries into its  and scripts to the corresponding  directory; e.g. if  is  scripts are installed into . doesn't check if is in . Well, I agree with you â€” it should check and remind user to add  directory to  if it's not already there.
The  directory for a particular python installation is automatically added to  when you run the binary for the installation.  When that binary executes , it looks in the directories on sys.path.  So when you run  with a particular python binary, , by default, puts the package in the  for that binary so that binary can import the package.  Advanced used can do more complicated things.
