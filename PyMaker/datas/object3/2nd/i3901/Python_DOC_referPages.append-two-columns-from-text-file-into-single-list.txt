I have a space delimited text file (temp.txt) as follows:I want to read this into a set, as follows:I've tried the following code, but it only returns 
For this you can simply use array append function and remove temp_Set = set(temp_List)Here we simply append elements and we get output:
This is one of those cases where the function String.partition works really well.it is also possible to replace with Why your code did not work:nothing is appended to , so  is also empty is overwritten in every iteration, and in the last iteration is assigned  through this assignment 
Your code does not work because you are not appending results to .For this problem, you can use  module with a dictionary comprehension.  returns an iterator which then feeds the comprehension.
@TanviP, you can try the below code.Note:  does not preserve the order of elements like . So, it's better to use list if the order matters otherwise you will need to go for 3rd party libraries to use OrderedDict() etc.I have used  list and set both to show you the difference. Add more data lines to temp.txt and run code to see the differences in the order of items (sometimes you'll find set's elements in different order than that of the corresponding list).Thanks.
