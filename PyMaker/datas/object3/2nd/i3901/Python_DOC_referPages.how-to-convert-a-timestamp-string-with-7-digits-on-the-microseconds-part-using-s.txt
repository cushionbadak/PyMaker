Having a timestamp as string like , how can one get the datetime object?I've tried using  for this, but I got two issues:I need to remove  from the timezone part, at the end, for  to work properly.The microseconds part has 7 digits, but  handles only up to 6 digits.Is there a way to parse timestamps in this format without modifying* the string itself before passing to ? * - by modifying, I think of removing the last microsecond digit, and removing the last .Note: This is for inserting a record in MySQL. If that helps.
How about convert like this:https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behaviorSuddenly found a useful method at django:https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/utils/#module-django.utils.dateparseAnother pythonic format (use  https://github.com/kennethreitz/maya):
