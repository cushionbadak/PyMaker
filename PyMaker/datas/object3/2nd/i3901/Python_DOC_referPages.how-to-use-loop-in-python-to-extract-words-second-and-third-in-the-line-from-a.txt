Natural Text
I have several  files, that contain first and last name of the authors.Here are two examples among about thirty (that do not contain the same number of authors).authors1.txtauthors3.txtI want to extract the last and first name of the authors for each file.Since I am a beginner in Python, I wrote a script (more or less suitable).my result is: My question: Is it possible to write a script with a loop, knowing that the files , don't each contain the same number of authors?
You can fetch the files in your current (or any other) directory by using  or . After you've obtained a list of author text files, you can simply loop through them with a simple for loop.Hint: for-looping over a file object will yield you one line at a time, until it reaches end of the file - this is also memory efficient, as it only reads one line at a time to memory, instead of loading the entire file contents to your memory.If you abstract your author name getting to a function, you can then simplify your code to something like this: at the end of the script will be a list containing tuples - each tuple consisting of the first and last name of your author.
Using a simple Demo:Output:
I suggest you read your file line by line, let's say,
I'm a bit rough on my Python, so I'll give you some pseudocode:And that's it.  Read the entire file into a variable, iterate over each line and extract the parts.Or, basically do what @Rakesh suggested =)
