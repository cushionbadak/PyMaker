I currently have this code:It keeps returning the error "name 'namedf' is not defined". Can anyone help me with how to write it correctly please? I'm a little stumped.
As per the docs:glob.glob(pathname, *, recursive=False)Return a possibly-empty list of path names that match pathname, which  must be a string containing a path specification.A reliable way to build such a path specification is to use :
actually I think your problem is that your glob is not accessing the correct folder. Hence no such file is found. Assuming that you are looking for files in the directory V:/FM003, you might consider using:
You defined the "namedf" inside the for loop and printing it outside the for loop.Just write your print statement in the same scope.
