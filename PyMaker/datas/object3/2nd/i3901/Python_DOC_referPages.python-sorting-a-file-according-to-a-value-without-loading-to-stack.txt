Natural Text
as part of my homework. we are suppose to sort a file according to a column, we are not allowed to use list, or load the whole file into the stack, but only 1 line at a time.we are allowed to create new files and delete them latterthe problem is in the "create" function. what i want to do is take line by line from "source_file" and then put them inside my "self" file, but as i enter them into "self" i want them to be in order.but for some reason i get weird letters inside the text file...hope someone can help me, thanks.this is the function i runthis is kiva txt fileand this is the code
I think the error is here:You expect line will be inserted in the correct position, however it will be always appended to the end.The other problem may be that you don't return to the top of heapfile every time you are going to iterate over it. Use  to get back to the top of the file if necessary.
