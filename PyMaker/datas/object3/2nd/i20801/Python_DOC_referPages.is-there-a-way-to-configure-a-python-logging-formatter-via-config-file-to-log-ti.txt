I'm writing a central  configuration file for a dozen or so Python components and I need one specific logger to log time in the UNIX time format (either milliseconds or seconds with fractions, both is good).Is there a way to configure a formatter in the config file, to output  like that? I'm trying to avoid having to monkey-patch a Formatter instance in multiple independent Python scripts, and it's unfeasible to post-process the log-file.Related: Python logging: override log time

I have just found the following solution:
The LogRecord object has the attribute  which is used as basis for the  and is already in the format you want (seconds with fractions). The easiest solution therefore might be to replace all occurrences of  in the format strings with :
