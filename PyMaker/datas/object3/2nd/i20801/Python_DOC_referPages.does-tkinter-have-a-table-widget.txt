I'm learning Python, and I would like to use it to create a simple GUI application, and since  is already built-in (and very simple to use) I would like to use it to build my application.I would like to make an app that will display a table that contains some data that I've loaded from my database.I've searched for  but have not been able to find any examples and / or documentation regarding a  component.Does  have a built in  component? If not, what could I / should I use instead?
Tkinter doesn't have a built-in table widget. The closest you can use is a  or a  of the tkinter's sub package .However, you can use tktable, which is a wrapper around the   widget, written by Guilherme Polo. Note: to use this wrapper library you need first to have installed the original Tk's  library, otherwise you will get an "import error".
You can use Tkinter's grid.To create a simple excel-like table:You can grab the data by accessing the children of the grid and getting the values from there.
If the table is read-only and you're using a sufficiently modern version of Tkinter you can use the ttk.Treeview widget. You can also pretty easily create a grid of  or  widgets. See this answer for an example: https://stackoverflow.com/a/11049650/7432
You could use tkintertable. See here how to start using it.
https://github.com/clarenceangel/tkinterstuff i made this but I am no pro. It does create a table though and return it as a frame that you can add to a frame or root.You feed it a csv with any number of rows and columns so long as the columns are even on each row of course.
