I want to find the position (or index) of the last occurrence of a certain substring in given inputted string .For example, suppose the inputted string is  and the substring is , then it should output 3.How can I do this?
Use :Also don't use  as variable name or you'll shadow the built-in .
You can use  or  Python2 links:  The difference is  when the substring is not found,  returns  while  raises an exception  (Python2 link: ).If you do not want to check the  return code , you may prefer  that will provide an understandable error message. Else you may search for minutes where the unexpected value  is coming from within your code...Example: Search of last newline character
Use the  method.
Try this:
The  library offers tools for finding indices of all characters or all substrings.GivenCodeCharactersNow there is the  tool available:A complementary tool is :SubstringsThere is also a  parameter available for locating the leading item of several items:
If you don't wanna use rfind then this will do the trick/
Not trying to resurrect an inactive post, but since this hasn't been posted yet...(This is how I did it before finding this question)Explanation: When you're searching for the last occurrence, really you're searching for the first occurrence in the reversed string. Knowing this, I did  (which returns a reversed string), and then indexed the  from there. Then I did  because we want the index in the unreversed (i.e. original) string.Watch out, though! If  is more than one character, you probably won't find it in the reversed string. To fix this, use , which searches for a reversed version of .
