Is it possible to create a UNIX timestamp in Python (number of seconds) with only day, month and year from a date object? I'm essentially looking for what the timestamp would be at midnight (hour, minute and second would be 0).Thanks!
--OR--For other Time types like Hour and Second go here:https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior
You can also use datetime.combine()The result depends on local timezone (in this case IST). I hope somebody can point me on how to get GMT result
You could do it by getting the number of seconds between the date and the epoch (1 January 1970):
