The closest was this one summing columns.So I'll do something similar in my question:Say I've a Python 2D list as below:I can get the row totals with a list comprehension:In one line, how can I sum the entire 2d-array?
You can do as easy as or alternativelyand call it a day, if you don't expect more than 2 dimensions. Note that the first solution is most likely not the fastest (as in execution time) solution, due to the usage of . Benchmark and compare as necessary.Finally, if you find yourself using multidimensional arrays, consider using NumPy and its superior array-friendly functions. Here's a short excerpt for your problem:This would work for any number of dimensions your arrays might have.

Another solution using :

You can use sum to first add the inner lists together and then sum the resulting flattened list:
