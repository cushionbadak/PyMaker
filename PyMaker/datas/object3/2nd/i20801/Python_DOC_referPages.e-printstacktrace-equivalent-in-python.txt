I know that  (where e is an Exception) prints the occurred exceptionbut, I was trying to find the python equivalent of Java's  that exactly traces the exception to what line it occurred and prints the entire trace of it.Could anyone please tell me the equivalent of  in Python?
When doing this inside an  block it will automatically use the current exception. See http://docs.python.org/library/traceback.html for more information.
There is also .Output:(From http://blog.tplus1.com/index.php/2007/09/28/the-python-logging-module-is-much-better-than-print-statements/ via How to print the full traceback without halting the program?)
e.printStackTrace equivalent in pythonIn Java, this does the following (docs):Prints this throwable and its backtrace to the standard error stream...This is used like this:In Java, the Standard Error stream is unbuffered so that output arrives immediately.The same semantics in Python 2 are:Python 3In Python 3, we can get the traceback directly from the exception object (which likely behaves better for threaded code).Also, stderr is line-buffered, but the print function gets a flush argument, so this would be immediately printed to stderr: Conclusion:In Python 3, therefore, , although it uses  by default, would buffer the output, and you may possibly lose it. So to get as equivalent semantics as possible, in Python 3, use  with .
