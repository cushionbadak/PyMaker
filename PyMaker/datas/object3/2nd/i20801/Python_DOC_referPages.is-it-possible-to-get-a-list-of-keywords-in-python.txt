I'd like to get a list of all of Pythons keywords as strings. It would also be rather nifty if I could do a similar thing for built in functions.Something like this :
You asked about statements, while showing keywords in your output example.If you're looking for keywords, they're all listed in the  module:From the  doc:Sequence containing all the keywords defined for the interpreter. If any keywords are defined to only be active when particular  statements are in effect, these will be included as well.
The built-in functions are in a module called , so:
The closest approach I can think of is the following:The standard keyword module is generated automatically.  For other things related to Python parsing from Python, check the language services set of modules.Regarding listing the builtins I'm not clear if you're asking for items in the  module or functions in that package that are implemented directly in the CPython interpreter:
help> keywordsHere is a list of the Python keywords.  Enter any keyword to get more help.  
Or you can  :OR (this does not contain errors and stuff with  beside them):
