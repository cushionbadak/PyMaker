Unittest presents only total time spent on running all tests but does not present time spent on each test separately.How to add timing of each test when using unittest?
I suppose, that it's not possible for now: http://bugs.python.org/issue4080.But you can do something like this:Result:
Nose tests with the pinnochio extension has a stopwatch option which will give you this, if nose is an option for you.It also has a ton of other useful features and plugins to make using unittest nicer.
Here is variation of script from horejsek's answer.It will monkey-patch django TestCase so that every TestCase will give its total running time.You can place this sript in the root package's __init__.py, where your settings.py lives.After that you can run tests with ./mange.py test -s
You can use django-slowtests, which provides output like this:If you look at django_slowtests/test_runner.py you could also adapt the technique yourself.
Solution with command-line only:  1/ install  (popular alternative test-runner) and extension  2/ run tests with time recording (times are saved in file )  3/ display tests names sorted by decreasing time:  
You can use pytest with  and it will give you execution time for each test
