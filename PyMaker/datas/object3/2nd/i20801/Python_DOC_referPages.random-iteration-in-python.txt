When you want to iterate sequentially over a list of numbers you will write:But what if you want to iterate over the list of numbers from the range (0..999) randomly? There is a need (in every iteration) to choose randomly the number that wasn't chosen in any previous iteration and there is a need to iterate over all of the numbers from the range (0..999).Do you know how to do that (smart)?
You can use  to, well, shuffle a list:By the way, in many cases where you'd use a  loop over a range of integers in other programming languages, you can directly describe the "thing" you want to iterate in Python.For example, if you want to use the values of  to access elements of a list, you should better shuffle the list directly:NOTE: You should bear the following warning in mind when using  (taken from the docs:Note that for even rather small len(x), the total number of  permutations of x is larger than the period of most random number  generators; this implies that most permutations of a long sequence can  never be generated.
People often miss opportunities for modularization.  You can define a function to encapsulate the idea of "iterate randomly":then:
Demonstrating Python generators and the Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle.You only generate as many random numbers as you use. But honestly, it's probably not saving much, so you should usually use .Note: If the top card is chosen,  would not be safe, so removing the top is done in two steps.
There is a function  in  that does exactly that for you.Your code would look like
Use the random.shuffle method:
Here's a different approach to iterating a list in random order. This doesn't modify the original list unlike the solutions that use shuffle()or:
