I'm writing a Django App, where I am expecting to use many management.py commands.  I like the idea of python functions having parameters with default values, where you define the param as:So I'm writing my management commands such that you input as follows:So far as I can tell, management.py commands don't accept this type of argument list, so I've created a helper to do the following:Is there a better way to do this?
Instead of rolling your own, you could use typical parameter style, and use something like  to parse it:You'd just define your argument parser and then pass the  argument to its  method.
Updated:Per @rix, later versions of Django now use argparse, which should be preferred.Original Answer:I believe the standard approach here is to use optparse, which can hook into the existing option parsing Django uses already. The example from the 1.6 docs:Now you have your command line arguments available in the  dictionary. The Python docs say  is deprecated, but I assume that the Django docs recommend it because it's what Django uses for its own management commands.     
Docs over @ Python argparse are great, but for a quick copy paste answer to solve the original question (post Django 1.8) - here you go:
