Natural Text
I am looking to write a text directly to my FTP site from python without storing a temp fileon disk,something like:is this even possible?Thank you very much.
As the docs say:Store a file in binary transfer mode. cmd should be an appropriate  command: . file is a file object (opened in binary mode) which is read until EOF using its  method in blocks of size blocksize to provide the data to be stored…So, you need to give it a file-like object with an appropriate  method.A string is not a file-like object, but an  is. So:Also, notice that I didn't pass that  argument. The third parameter to  is blocksize, and  is obviously not a valid block size.If you need to work with Python 2.5 or earlier, see Dan Lenski's answer.And if you need to work with Python 2.6-2.7, and performance of the file-like object is important (it isn't here, but there are some cases where it might be), and you only care about CPython, use his answer but with  in place of . (Plain  is slow in 2.x, and  is even slower before around 3.3.)
Have you tried using a  object, which quacks like a file but is just a string?EDIT: @abarnert's answer is the Python3 equivalent. Mine is the Python2 version.
