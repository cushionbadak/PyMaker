This question already has an answer here:Why can't I end a raw string with a backslash? [duplicate]                    4 answers                We have to create a totem pole using strings consisting of 13 characters wide. Each head must have different characteristics. Some of my functions for characteristics are below. However, when I ran my code it gave me the syntax error above. 
You cannot use a  as the last character in a raw string literal: is not a valid string literal (even a raw string cannot end in an odd number of backslashes). Specifically, a raw string cannot end in a single backslash (since the backslash would escape the following quote character).Don't use a raw string there; just double the backslashes instead:or use a raw multiline string by using triple quotes:The slice is used to remove the initial newline which is part of the string.
This is an odd quirk of raw strings, and is indicated by the syntax highlighting difference, see lexical analysis:Even in a raw string, string quotes can be escaped with a backslash, but the backslash remains in the string; for example, r"\"" is a valid string literal consisting of two characters: a backslash and a double quote; r"\" is not a valid string literal (even a raw string cannot end in an odd number of backslashes)To fix it use normal strings and/or concatenation:
