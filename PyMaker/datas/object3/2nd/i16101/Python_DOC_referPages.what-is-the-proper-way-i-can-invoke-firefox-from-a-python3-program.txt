I'm trying to start firefox with an internet page by calling it in python 3 as an argument to os.system or os.startfile.The internet page I want to start is https://schwab.comI can't bring it up at the command line with C:\Python34\hsf\WSC>C:\Program Files(x86)\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe https://schwab.comIt chokes on the spaces.But I can by using C:\Progra~2\Mozill~1\firefox.exe https://schwab.comThat works fine at the command lineSo I put that address as the argument to os.system in my python program, and got the error:'C:\Progra~2\Mozill~1' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.I tried it in os.startfile and got the error message:Exception in Tkinter callbackTraceback (most recent call last):  File "C:\Python34\lib\tkinter__init__.py", line 1482, in call    return self.func(*args)File "C:\Python34\hsf\WSC\fm.py", line 59, in SchwabFileNotFoundError: [WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified: 'C:\Progra~2\Mozill~1\x0cirefox.exe https://schwab.com'Note that it echoed my argument correctly, but the FileNotFoundError has inserted the string x0cire between '\' and 'firefox'I deleted and retyped the '\f', and got the same erroroneous string inserted.To avoid the path, I copied firefox.exe into my folder, but it won't run outside its native milieu.What is the proper way I can invoke firefox from a python3 program?
It depends what you want to do with this site. If all you want to do is open the page use the webbrowser module to open the url.If you need to something more complicated, you can use the Selenium module to interact with the page in pretty much anyway you need.
I suggest that you try selenium a web driver API for Python, which works with Firefox, Chrome and many more. You can completely control the browser in addition to what you need!
