I have a homework assignment in Python and ran into a brain freeze. So i'm supposed to do O(nË‡2) exercise using insertion sort.For example i have a two lists [] and [5,8,1,1] and the program should insert values from one list to another by removing from first and in correct order into another:[][5,8,1,1] = [5][8,1,1] = [5,8][1,1] = [1,5,8][1] = [1,1,5,8][]I've came up with something, don't know if i'm on right track but this seems the most reasonable. Indents are in order but copying code here somehow messed it up. P.S sorry for Estonian language, it's compulsory to write code in Estonian.So right now i'm in trouble what do to with second loop. After it has finished checking for elements in result list called "tulemus" and if it does not find any matches how should i continue my code so it would append the "el" into tulemus.
You can add an  clause to the inner  loop:Its body gets executed if the loop wasn't terminated using . You can read more about  clauses on loops in Python's official tutorial.Please also note that if you find an insertion point while iterating, you should use  instead of  to insert the current element there. Otherwise you'll end up inserting at the end of the list (index -1) when .
