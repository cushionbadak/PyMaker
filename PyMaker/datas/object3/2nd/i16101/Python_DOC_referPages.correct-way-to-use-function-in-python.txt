Question is - where and how to use  and  operators?For example - I have function:Function stored in separate file. Next, from script it calls like:But - there is lot of functions in . Thus, I have big list of  calls in script and it's looks very... Odd? Useless? So - what correct way to call functions and where better use  - inside function, or in script?UPD:For example - in BASH I can use somethig like next:And run it with next result:Or with error:
In Python they usually don't use function return value to denote the success status (like they do in C or Go), rather the function should raise an exception if something goes wrong. You can intercept the exception from the calling side (within your script) or let it fall through, which in your case will cause the script termination with a stack trace. Then you don't need to wrap every single call with .(A side note) If you also don't want the stack trace to be displayed, you can use , like this:
It may look odd in a large file to have many try/catch blocks. It is agreed that this is acceptable and functions should throw an error instead of returning values to denote success or failure. If no error is thrown you continue like normalHere Is how I would be writing your code. In both cases it reaches the end of the script:It's definitely work reading the official python documentation
