I am trying to import a class in Python and after importing the class set a class variable as the imported class. I have searched Google as well as stackoverflow for an answer to this, but have not been able to find one.For Example:DB.py:Ex.py:I would like to be able to access the FetchAll() in the DB class from Ex class through a variable. I know in PHP this is possible by using "Protected" keyword in a class.Thank you for any help you can offer.
JustYou provide a module name (that can be located given the current module search path), not a file name.Check the tutorial for a beginnerâ€™s overview of how modules and imports work.
You can either just use the name of the class as the class variable:Or create a new class variable with the 'as' key:And like the others are saying, import all modules at the top of the script.
