I'm grading projects written in Python. Some are written in Python 2, some in Python 3. I'm grading them through the command line for simplicity, but right now, projects written with Python 2-specific syntax won't work because the interpreter defaults to Python 3. Is there an easy way to designate which version of Python I want to use on the fly?
You could use Python launcher on Windows:If the script has the shebang such as  then the launcher finds the appropriate Python version automatically:Python launcher is included in the recent Python versions (since 3.3). You could install it separately otherwise.You could also use  utility with virtualenv:that runs  in  virualenv.On POSIX systems (Linux, OS X) if the script has executable permissions () and it has a valid shebang such  then you could run it directly:Which python version (or even which program) will be used is defined by the shebang.
The best way is to use a virtualenv.The second best way is to just setup your system to use  for python 2 and  for python3.
Use aliases:On windows its:then call with:On Mac its:then call with:On linux, its the same as on a Mac. Note: these aliases wont save after you close the terminal window.If you want them to save you need to put them in whatever config file your shell reads on start-up. I only know the one for linux and its ~/.bashrc
The best way is to use the conda distribution which is available on all platforms. This makes easy to switch environments even with different python versions. For example:Then to work in a given environment just do:Once you are inside an environment you can install packages there:
