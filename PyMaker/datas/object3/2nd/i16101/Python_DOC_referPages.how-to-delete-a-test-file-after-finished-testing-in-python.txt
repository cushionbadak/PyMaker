I create a test where in setUp I create file like so :at the end of testing, regardless either succeed or not, I want the testing file gone,sohow to delete the file after i have finished testing?
Assuming you're using a unittest-esque framework (i.e. nose, etc.), you would want to use the  method to delete the file, as that will run after each test.If you want to only delete this file after all the tests, you could create it in the method  and delete it in the method , which will run before and after all tests have run, respectively.
Other option is to add a function to be called after tearDown() using  method of TestCase:It is more convenient than  in cases where there are a lot of files or when they are created with random names because you can add a cleanup method just after file creation.
Write a tearDown method:https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.tearDownAlso have a look at the tempfile module and see if it's useful in this case.
