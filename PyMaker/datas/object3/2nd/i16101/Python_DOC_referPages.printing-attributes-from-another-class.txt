Say I have this piece of code:Obviously, this program won't work as  is a string and not an instance.Is there any way to print the attribute  from the instances of the  class out using code in the  class?Or using code in the  class is the only way?
You're trying to access global variables using name. You can use  to get a dictionary that map global variable names to objects:UPDATEUsing  is a sign of bad design.You'd better to use a sequence or mapping to store multiple objects.
The actual way to fix this is to use  class to create your  objects, and then keep these  objects as an attribute of the  class.Fiddling with  may do what you want, but it is not solving the bigger problem with the design:
