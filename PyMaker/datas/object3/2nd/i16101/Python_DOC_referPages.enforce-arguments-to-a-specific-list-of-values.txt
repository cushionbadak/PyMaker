What is the pythonic way to enforce a function to take a specific set of values for a given parameter? For instance there is a function like:I want to restrict parameter 'status' to a set of values like 0, 1 or 99.
You need to check the value inside the function:Here,  is a set, because the only thing we care about is whether  is a member of the collection (we aren't interested in order, for example). To avoid recreating the set each time you use the function, you'd probably define it as a "constant"1 global:Example usage:Always try to raise the most appropriate exception you can -  tells the caller of the function what's going on better than  does, for example.1 It's not really constant, but by convention,  variable names in Python are considered to be intended as constants.
You can check within the function itself if  is a valid value and if it is not then raise an exception.
