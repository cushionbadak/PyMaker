This question already has an answer here:Breadth-first version of itertools.chain()                    2 answers                If I do:I get a ordered list from 0 to 19.Without change the input of the range functions, is there an easy way to specify that I want a list that goes: 0,10,1,11,2,12...Basically I first want the first element of every generator. Than I want the second element of every generator and then the third and so on.Bonus points:Is there a way to change it so that when the generators produce an unequal amount of results, the second generator yields the rest of it's results after the first one is finished?
You are trying to  your iterators; do so explicitly:The use of  lets you continue to use  here, flattening out the tuples  produces.Demo:If you have generators of different lengths, you could use :I used a different flattening technique here with a double loop in a generator expression.This all does get tedious, and since you are not using  with another generator (so you don't need support for  and  to be propagated), you may as well just make this a proper loop:You can also use the  recipe listed in the  documentation recipies section:
