I am new to Python and noticed that the following. Therefore i wonder whether we can do multiplication and join the string (for choice, element can be 0 or 1 only)My desired output would be 
You can explicity zip the lists, mulitply and then join the result:The  function pairs up the characters from  with the integers from , the list comprehension then multiplies the character with the integer, and the  call combines the result of that into one string.If  is used just used to select elements, you are better of using  here: does exactly what you were intending to do: pick elements from the first iterable based on wether or not the corresponding value in the second iterable is true or false.Demo:Using  is the far faster option here:That's a 4x speed increase.
You can use a list comprehension with  and . See below for an example:As the 4th element of choice is 0 the 4th element of  ('}') is not printed.
