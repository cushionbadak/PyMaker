I use pickle to dump a file on python 3, and I use pickle to load the file on python 2, the ValueError appears. So, python 2 pickle can not load the file dumped by python 3 pickle?If I want it? How to do?
You should write the pickled data with a lower protocol number in Python 3. Python 3 introduced a new protocol with the number  (and uses it as default), so switch back to a value of  which can be read by Python 2.Check the parameter in . Your resulting code will look like this.There is no parameter in  because  can determine the protocol from the file.
Pickle uses different  to convert your data to a binary stream.In python 2 there are 3 different protocols (, , ) and the default is .In python 3 there are 5 different protocols (, , , , ) and the default is .You must specify in python 3 a protocol lower than  in order to be able to load the data in python 2. You can specify the  parameter when invoking .
