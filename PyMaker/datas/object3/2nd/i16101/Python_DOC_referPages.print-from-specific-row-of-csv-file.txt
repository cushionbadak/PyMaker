my csv file has multiple tables in a single file for exampleHow can I print from city row to city3 row.using python csv module
You need to come up with a way to detect the start and end of the relevant section of the file; the  module does not contain any built-in mechanism for doing this by itself, because there is no general and unambiguous delimiter for the beginning and end of a particular section.I have to question the wisdom of jamming multiple CSV files together like this. Is there a reason that you can't separate the sections into  individual files?
There is no proper  module for the question. Alternatively, you can probably use  module for regular expression match.An example:it should print all lines begin with keyword "city".
