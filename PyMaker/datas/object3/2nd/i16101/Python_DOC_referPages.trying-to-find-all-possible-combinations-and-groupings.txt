I have been trying to work through the following problem using excel and realized this may be better suited for Python however, am not sure where to start, I have only a basic understanding of Python. how would you guys approach solving this?There are 6 kinds of coffee and there are 10 kinds of flavor shots and you can put one, two or three shots in each kind of coffee. Based on this, I would like to know (and list) the unique flavor combinations and how long you could go without having the same cup of coffee. 
Using  you can easily get all the different possibly combinations of flavour shot:The length of  will give you the number of combinations, which in the case of 6 flavours and one, two, or three shots is 175.The number of flavour shot combinations when added to coffee is simply .EDITAdditionally (as an aside) you don't even need to do this through programming. Assuming you have n elements and you want to work out how many different ways you can pick k of them then the number is given by the Binomial coefficient which can be easily calculated with ,In your case you have n=10 and k=1, k=2, and k=3. Thus your solution is:
I think this is correct. We build up all the 1, 2, and 3 tuple combination of coffee flavors, and chain them together into a single iterable. Then we take the product of combining every combination of flavors with each coffee.
This actually sounds like a job for itertools.product:Define coffees as:And flavor shot as:One flavor shot:Two flavor shot:Three flavor shot:
