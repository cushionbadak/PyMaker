If one does  on some builtin callables (class constructors, methods, etc) on CPython 3.4, one finds out that many of them often have a special attribute called , for example:However the documentation for this is nonexistent. Furthermore, googling for the attribute name suggests that there is also another possible special attribute , though I did not find any built-in functions that would have it.I do know they are related to the function argument signature, but nothing beyond that, what do their values signify and what is the use of them?
These attributes are there to enable introspection for Python objects defined in C code. The C-API Argument Clinic provides the data, to assist the  module when building  objects. Introspection of C-API functions was not supported before.See the internal  function on how the  value is used.Currently, the  attribute is filled from the internal docstring set on objects in the C-API; a simple text search is done for , where the  is typical of Attribute Clinic-generated documentation strings. Take a look at the  object slots if you wanted to find some examples. Or you could look at the  module source to see how the Argument Clinic is being used to define signatures; the Argument Clinic script is run on those when building to generate the docstrings (in the accompanying  file).The  attribute, if present, would be a  object; instead of providing a text version a C-API can provide a fully parsed  instance instead.
