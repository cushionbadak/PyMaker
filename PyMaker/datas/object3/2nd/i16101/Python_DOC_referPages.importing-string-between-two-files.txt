It seems I don't quite understand the import function. I would want to do it two way.file1:file2:That's approximately what I want to do, but it never gets the file name to file2. 
It seems to be your first time with Python, and perhaps programming, so I'll advise you to ask questions on StackOverflow about a particular incident, providing as many details as possible, and to always include all code you've written.Regardless,Python's import statement is a utility that allows one module access to another. So for example, if I defined a file general.py as so:and in any other file, included the code:would give the output "Hello World Stack Overflow!"Also, here's a reference guide to imports: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html
What you have here is a circular import. file1 imports file2:and file2 imports file1:This is a no-no. file1 tells Python to import file2, which tells Python to import file1, which tells Python to import file2... etc.What exactly happens when you run this code? Are you getting an ? Is there any reason the code needs to be in two separate files, or could it be combined into one?
