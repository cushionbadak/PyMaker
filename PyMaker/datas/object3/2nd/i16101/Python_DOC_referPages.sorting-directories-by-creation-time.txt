I am logged into an ftp directory using  and have listed the directories contained inside using:ftp.retrlines('LIST')This is what it gives me in the terminal:This list is in alphabetical order but i was wondering if there is any way to sort it by the dates given on the left? I want to be able to sort it from newest to oldest. Thanks! :)
Should be something like this:What Celeo said is right but will only give you the sorted times without the directories, this will give you both.
Use  to turn the date strings into datetime objects, then sort.
