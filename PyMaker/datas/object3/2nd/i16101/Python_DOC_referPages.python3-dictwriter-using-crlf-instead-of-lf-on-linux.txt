Natural Text
Problem:In Python 3, I'm using csv.DictWriter to append a row to an existing file. However, CRLF line endings are being used instead of the expected LF line endings.Code example:Expected result:Actual result:Notes:The existing file's fileformat is "unix", not "dos".I have tried setting newline to None (the default) and '\n' as well (even that should be unnecessary since the default value is os.linedep, which is already '\n' on Linux), but the result is the same.
By specifying , you can control it.
