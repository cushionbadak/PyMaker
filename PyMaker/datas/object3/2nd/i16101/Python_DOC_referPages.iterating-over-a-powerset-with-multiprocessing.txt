I have a generator for a powerset of a list in python and I want do some calculations to the elements of these set using the multiprocessing module. My code looks like:The problem is that the powerset-function is a generator and that will not work. But I can not replace the generator, because of generate the hole powerset before the calculation needs to much time and memory. Has anyone an idea how I can solve this problem?
If the issue is that you want to avoid having to put the whole powerset in a list, you can use , which will consume your iterator  elements at a time, and send those off to the worker processes, rather than converting the whole thing into a list and chunking that up.If your powerset is very large, you'll want to specify a  other than the default, which is 1:The chunksize argument is the same as the one used by the map()  method. For very long iterables using a large value for chunksize can  make the job complete much faster than using the default value of 1.The  function uses the following algorithm, to give you an idea of a good size:
