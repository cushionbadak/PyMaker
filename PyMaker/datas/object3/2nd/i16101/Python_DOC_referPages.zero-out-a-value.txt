I'm trying to create a program that will allow me to enter a value in minutes and the program will output those minutes as the sum of days, hours and minutes between them.For example if I input 10000 minutes I should get the output, "10000 minutes is 6 days, 22 hours and 40 minutes"). This is how much I have now:I'm only having one problem asides from it being unfinished, if the user inputs a number of minutes under 1440 then i get a decimal answer for the number of days (which is expected) but if the number of minutes is not sufficient to make a day, then I want the it to say "0 days" not ".153 days". How would I zero out the value for days in such a case?
You are using Python 3 so the operator  is true division, not integer division.You can either use floor division which is similar to Python 2's integer division:Or use  to get both with a single command:
You can use floor division (using a double  instead of a single  when dividing), which rounds down to the nearest integer:
You essentially want to round down the result of the division (quotient) to the nearest integer. This can be done in many ways:OrOr
