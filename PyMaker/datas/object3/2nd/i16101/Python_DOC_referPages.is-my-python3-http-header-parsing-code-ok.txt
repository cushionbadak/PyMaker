I have written a short function in Python3 to parse HTTP headers.  I was wondering if anyone would be able to take a look at it and tell me if there is anything that I could have done differently to make the code better.  What I have currently produces the required outcome but I am not sure if there would be any situation in which this code would not produce the desired result.This is what I have:
As noted by Andr√© in the comments, parsing HTTP is not to be taken lightly, unless as an exercise. In real programs you should generally stick to existing, mature implementations if possible.Note that beyond the overall message structure, every header has its own peculiar internal structure, and you will often need to parse that too; Werkzeug can help there.The obvious specific problems with your code are:given a header , it will return  as its value;given multiple headers with the same name, it will only return the value of the last one.
