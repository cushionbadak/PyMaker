Natural Text
Hi guys I am currently doing a bit of a project. here is part of my very last lines of code. There are two characters and i want to be able to use a function. I am almost fully self taught and i havnt been coding very long at all so there might be basic errors or i might be doing something that just cant work, but how can i change the name of the "death" variable in the function using what is in the function call? So for example output(10 needs to change death to death1? is this possible. Also i need to be able to print this in one solid output as Character (then the function parameter) is now dead
Your code demonstrates a profound misunderstanding of the way Python names work. Just setting  and writing  will not access , that simply doesn't make any sense. There is a good primer on how Python deals with names here.Your specific issue could be solved by passing to  all of the variables it actually needs:This is obviously a bit awkward, so the next step would be to encapsulate these parameters as attributes in a  class; see e.g. the tutorial. Then you can pass a single  instance to the function.
Very often, the most natural solution is to use a dictionary.Depending on what 1 and 2 stand for, you might want to use strings instead -- ,  perhaps? (Or  and  if this is a startup game.)
