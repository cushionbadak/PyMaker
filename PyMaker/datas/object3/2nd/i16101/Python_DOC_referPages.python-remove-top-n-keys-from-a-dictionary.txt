I have a dictionary dict. For each key in dict, there is a list, that has two items in it. One is another dictionary, the other is an integer.I want to sort the dictionary dict on the second item in the list, the integer. And then remove the first 'n' keys from the dictionary. Is there any way to do it? The sorted function works only on lists.Here is the function I'm trying to do this in.
You can do it by doing this:This code copies the dict to a list ordered by the second item in dict values. Then it creates a list with only the sorted keys and iterate over it removing them as values from the dictionary.For my value of d and , output is:For n=2:Ps: Might not be most efficient way of doing this, but does the job
In Python, dictionaries don't have an order. You cannot sort a . However, you can take a look at .
