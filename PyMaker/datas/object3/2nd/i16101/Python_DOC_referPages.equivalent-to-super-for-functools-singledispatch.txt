 helps to define a single-dispatch generic method.  Meanwhile, there is  for calling methods or accessing attributes of a superclass.Is there something like  that can be used with ?  I tried the following, but the result of  is just not instance of , so it does not work as I expected:
I believe that something like this will work, but I can't test it since I don't have Python 3.4 installed:Note that it doesn't really make sense to call  with the superclass as the argument, because if you did that you would lose the original argument () that was passed.  In your case it doesn't matter because your function doesn't use  at all, but a real dispatch function would probably actually do something with the value, so you need to pass the value as the argument.
