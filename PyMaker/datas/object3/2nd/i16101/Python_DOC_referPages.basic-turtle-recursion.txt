Natural Text
I have a quick question using Turtle with Python. I want the final drawing to look like this: http://i.stack.imgur.com/IFw5G.jpgBut my code only does a part of this, and I can't figure it out for the life of me. This is a homework assignment, so please don't do it for me, please just lead me in the right direction as I cannot figure out what I'm doing wrong. What exactly I can't figure out is how to make it reproduce the squares on the left side of the image, as it's only on the right.Here is my code: thank you!
You might find the use of debugger helpful. Run your code as First type  to step into the function, then type  for next to execute each line one by one, if you want to step into a recursive call to  type  when you get to it. This should help you to see where your code is going wrong. Since your code is quite repetitive (turtle stuff nearly always is), you might want to add a few print statements to say what each section of the code is meant to be doing (like drawing the top side of the square, or getting into position for the recursive call).Additional commands and more information about the python debugger can be found here. Summary is  for help,  for continue and  to finish the current function call and go back up to the previous function. You can also see the value of a variable just by typing its name.
