I am trying Python logging.Since I want some logger to share a formatter, I use hierarchy of logging like the below code.As you can see, format is At this point, I want loggers to print the  part without the parent name.I mean, normally it will print the name as  but I want Is there any way? 
If you want the name to say 'bar' instead of 'foo.bar', just log to a logger named 'bar', and add your handlers to the root logger.
Add a context filter to your example:And then add it to the handler:The handler filter is the last part of the logging flow. This filter changes the name at that point. This allows you to use SYS as the root of all your loggers (which is good practice) and it allows the end user to decide on formatting. You're the consumer of your own logs here and you only want to print to stdout, but that won't always be the case.You could add a file handler, set it to debug, and NOT add the context filter so it DOES include SYS because now it's including a whole bunch of other loggers and the root is important.
