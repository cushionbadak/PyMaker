I am using IDLE GUII created a file called doss.py and it is saved in C:\python34now on IDLE (GUI)i want that doss.py to open without any RUN command. in python27 i used it worked very fine bt idk why its showing some LOC in red color.its :
You don't have a module called . Your module, if stored in a file named , is named . So try . would be a submodule of  named .
I'm quite sure that  would not have worked in Python 2.7's standard shell, at least not in the way that you think. Simply put, -ing a module is not equivalent to running it from the command line, except inadvertently in some cases. Also, no version of Python has ever accept filenames (e.g. ) as the arguments to ; it has always been a package name (which might be  if there's a file called  in the current directory, but it gets more complicated).The standard Python interactive shell has never included a mechanism to do quite what you want: to load and execute a Python script roughly as if from the command line.You may want to try the enhanced IPython shell instead. IPython does have a  command that does what you want, in addition to a number of other enhancements.
