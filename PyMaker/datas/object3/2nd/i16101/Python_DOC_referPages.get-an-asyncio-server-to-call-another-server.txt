So I have modified the example of asyncio client and server (found here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-protocol.html#protocol-example-tcp-echo-server-and-client) and all I want is for client.py to call serverone.py, and in turn for it to call servertwo.py.client.pyserverone.pyservertwo.pyI launch  and  in a terminal, then call . Things partially work; the client does call serverone which does call servertwo, but then serverone fails with this error:The documentation doesn't cover a lot of odd use cases, so I'm a bit stuck. Should I be using  to make the call? Am I approaching the problem correctly?How do I fix or avoid the ?
You can use  to schedule the coroutine returned by  to be run by the event loop, and then use the  method of the  (more specifically, an ) that  returns to shut down the loop once the coroutine is done:
