If I shuffle a small list using python's , I'm getting also unshuffled results. Here is a sample output:I understand that this must necessarily be the case, after looking into the algorithm details [1], [2]. But I really want get a small unsorted list (say 3 to 6 items) programmatically.What do you think is the best approach to do this?
Well one way would be generate permutations of the list and then drop the first item. After that you can use  to pick any of the permutation:
If you must exclude the original ordering, you could simply retry the shuffle until .
Since it's a short array do a quick shuffle manually:This way you will ensure that you won't get the original array. This is an  solution, you should only use it on small arrays.
