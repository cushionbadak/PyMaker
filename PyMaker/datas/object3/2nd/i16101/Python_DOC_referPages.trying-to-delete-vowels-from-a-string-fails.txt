You are trying to replace the string with the value , not the contents of the variable .Your code is also very inefficient; you don't need to loop over every character in ; a loop over  is enough. Because you already include both upper and lowercase versions, the two loops over the lowercased and uppercased versions are in essence checking for each vowel 4 times.The following would be enough:You are also replacing vowels with spaces, not just deleting them.The fastest way to delete (rather than replace) all vowels would be to use :The  static method produces a mapping that'll delete all characters named in the 3rd argument.
