I got an error at this code:The error is in my function settings() in the Button() command. but I don't got any plan how to fix it, sorry. I can't put the 3 commands in an external function, cause it wouldn't get the variables...Pls tell me what I've done wrong // fix it pls.
If you're trying to string together multiple expressions using the  operator, it isn't likely to work well, unless all of your function calls return integers, which isn't the case here. I don't recommend it, but you can put each command as a separate element of a collection such as a list or tuple:I can't put the 3 commands in an external function, cause it wouldn't get the variablesOrdinarily, this is true. But if you define the second function inside the first, all of its variables will still be visible.
