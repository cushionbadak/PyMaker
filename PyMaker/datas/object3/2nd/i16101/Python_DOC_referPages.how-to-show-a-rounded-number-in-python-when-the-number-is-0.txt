This is what I currently have and it does the math correctly but when i use 5 as input the number comes out to be 165.1 but i need it to show 165.10.
Use the Python format string syntax (docs for 2.7):General remarks about your code: You donâ€™t need the  cast around your arithmetic operations (but you may need it around , as  may return a string, depending on your python version). Doing arithmetical operations on numbers again gives numbers (floats, in your case).
