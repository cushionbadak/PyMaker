So for my first project it is a simple program that prints your name class you are in and what high school you went to. The one thing that is messing me up is for one of them I have to use one  statement for all this and I need to format it so that each piece of information is on a different line.What I want for the format:But what I get isHow do I remove the space?My code is as follows:
 inserts a space between each argument.  You can disable this by adding  after the last , but then there won't be any spaces between  and  or between  and , etc.  You could then go on to insert  manually where you need it in the  statement, but by that point it might be simpler to just give  a single argument formed by concatenating the strings together with explicit spaces:
As mentioned here, you can use the  argument to the  function. That will let you set the separator between printed values (which is a space by default) to whatever you want, including an empty string. You'll have to remember to add spaces between the values that you do want separated. E.g.,There's a better way to do this, involving the  method on strings, but your professor is probably saving that one for the next lesson so I won't cover it in detail now. Follow the link to the Python docs, and read the section on Format String Syntax, if you want more details. I'll just show you an example of what your code would look like using :Note no  at the end, since  automatically adds a newline unless you tell it otherwise.
I recommend reading through str.format() to print your information.The spaces in your output come from the fact that you've called the print function, passing a list of strings, instead of passing the print function a single string.yields
Just don't add space in your code
