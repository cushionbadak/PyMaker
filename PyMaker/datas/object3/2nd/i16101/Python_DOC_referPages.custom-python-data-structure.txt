I have a class that wraps around python  from . When I go and create a deque , I create a empty  object. So if I fill it up:  and simply type in  on the console, i get:My question is how can I output the same thing as above when I have a wrapper for class . For example.IeI want to customize what gets printed out as oppose to just a memory location. What can I do?
I want to customize what gets printed out as oppose to just a memory location. What can I do?This is exactly what  is for:Called by the  built-in function to compute the “official” string representation of an object. If at all possible, this should look like a valid Python expression that could be used to recreate an object with the same value (given an appropriate environment). If this is not possible, a string of the form  should be returned.Because you didn't define a , you're getting the default implementation from  (assuming Python 3… otherwise, you've written a classic class, which is a bad idea, and you don't want to learn how they get their defaults when you can just stop using them…), which just returns that string with the object's type name and address.Note the  method below  in the docs. If the most human-readable representation and the valid-Python-expression representation are not the same, define both methods. Otherwise, just define , and  will use it by default.So, if you want to print the exact same thing as , just delegate :If you want to wrap it in something:Note that I didn't call  in the second version, because that's exactly what  means in a format string. But really, in this case, you don't need either; a  has the same  and .
Delegate the generation of the representation.
