This code tries to use  to sort the cities by how far they are west and the longitudes are based west of the prime meridian. I wrote an  method in the class but the  won't sort to the correct order.
You are comparing your longitude and latitude as strings, not numbers. They are therefor compared lexicographically, not numerically, so  will sort before  because  comes before  in the ASCII table (it doesn't matter what other characters follow).Convert your values to floating point numbers:Your comparison has a small bug; if both longitude and latitude match, you return  instead of . You may want to test for equality and apply the  decorator rather than assume that only  is called.Cleaning up the code a little (and removing the  and  methods, just use  and  attributes):Note that  really only needs to compare ; tuple ordering takes care of the rest:Note the ; you want the larger values (further west from Greenwich) to be listed first.
