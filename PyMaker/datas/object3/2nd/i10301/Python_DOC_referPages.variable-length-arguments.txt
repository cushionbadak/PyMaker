I am creating a python program using the  module and I want to allow the program to take either one argument or 2 arguments.What do I mean?  Well, I am creating a program to download/decode MMS messages and I want the user to either be able to provide a phone number and MMS-Transaction-ID to download the data or provide a file from their system of already downloaded MMS data.What I want is something like this, where you can either enter in 2 arguments, or 1 argument:NOTE:  would be a phone number (like ),  a string (MMS-Transaction-ID) and  a file on the user's computerIs this possible with ?  I was hoping I could use , but that didn't seem to do what I want.This gives the error (removing  gives the same error):ValueError: mutually exclusive arguments must be optionalIt looks like it wants me to use  instead of :When running my program with no arguments, I see:error: one of the arguments --phone --mmsid --file is requiredThis is closer to what I want, but can I make  do ?
This is a little beyond the scope of what  can do, as the "type" of the first argument isn't known ahead of time. I would do something likeTo determine whether  is intended as a file name or a phone number, you need to check whether or not  is .
