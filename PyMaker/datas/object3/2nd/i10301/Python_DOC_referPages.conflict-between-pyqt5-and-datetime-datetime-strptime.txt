So I was writing a tool that would read time from file using graphical user interface based on python 3.52 and Qt5. The minimal operationworks in an isolated environment, giving output "1900-01-01 00:00:00". However, when I run the following minimal exampleI get the outputSo, the first call to the strptime routine works fine, but after the QApplication class is created, it does not work any more. Note that further using QApplication to construct the GUI and do a lot of complicated things with it works fine. The only thing that does not work currently is strptimeAny idea what goes wrong?
I can reproduce your problem: after calling the QtWidget, the results in an error.If I execute after QtWidgetthis works.I am located in Switzerland, so Die in German is equivalent to Tue.It seems that Qt somehow has an influence on the region settings as %A and %a evaluates the local weekday's name(Datetime). Maybe a Qt expert can explain more in detail, what is ongoing.
To elaborate on the nice answer by Patrick, I have now found a way to undo the localization enforced by QT
