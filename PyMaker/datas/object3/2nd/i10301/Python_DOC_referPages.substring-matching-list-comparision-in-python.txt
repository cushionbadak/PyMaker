I have two different lists and I need to find the index number of the list have more similar pattern  for examplea comparison is to be done for both the list, if element of  matches with  then it should return the index of list_1 where that element is present 1. note: for 2nd element of  that is  it must return 4 since it has highest match with 4th element of here is the code I am trying to solve
One approach is to create a function to return position of the sub_string from . And, then call the function on every element of  using 
You would have to do something like this: Where you iterate over each element of the list of "searches" and try to find matches on each element of the second list using the in operator.
The below solution might work for you. Note that, if you have multiple matches, this solution is't enough. But that entirely depend on your use cases. For now, this should be okay.  
This solves your problem,
