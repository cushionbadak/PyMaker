In Python 3, if I have a string such that:yields something like this:I know it's a byte literal. Is there a function that can be used to determine if that string is in byte literal format (versus having, say, the Unicode  prefix) without first interpreting? Or is there another best practice for handling this? I have a situation wherein getting a byte literal string needs to be dealt with differently than if it's in Unicode. In theory, something like this:
The easiest and, arguably, best way to do this would be by utilizing the built-in  with the  type:Since, a byte literal will always be an instance of ,  will, of course, evaluate to .
Just to complement the other answer, the built-in  also gives you this information. You can use it with  and the corresponding type to check accordingly.For example, in Python 3:
