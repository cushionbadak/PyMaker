I am testing a reverse function. My code is as follow:I expect my output L can be like [[7, 6, 5], [4, 3], [2, 1]], but it only works inside my function. I wasn't able to change it in the global variable. How can I make it happen? Thank you
 is just a local variable, and assigning a new object to it won't change the original list; all it does is point the name  in the function to another object. See Ned Batchelder's excellent explanation about Python names.You could replace all elements in the list  references by assigning to the  identity slice instead:However, mutable sequences like lists have a  method, so you can just reverse the list in-place with that:Do the same for each sublist:
