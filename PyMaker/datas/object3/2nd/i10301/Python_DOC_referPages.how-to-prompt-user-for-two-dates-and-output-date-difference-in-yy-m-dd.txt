I have been searching for a clarified answer on this. I have read many threads and other websites about using datetime, but how can I build a simple program that prompts a user for two certain dates, and then calculate the difference between those dates? I am stuck on figuring out how to get the month and days.This is what I have so far:I am just beginning to use Python, but it's seems pretty simple just coming in. So, for example I want to prompt the user for the year they were born, the month they were born, and the day they were born. Then I want to prompt the user for the year they will graduate, the month they will graduate, and the day they will graduate. Then I want the program to calculate the difference between those dates and output the age of the person in years, months, and days. For example
