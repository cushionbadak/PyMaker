I've returned to Python after a few years doing C code and I'm a little confused while training myself to get my Python coding habits back.I've tried to run this little, very simple, piece of code but I keep getting a TypeError as described in the title. I've searched a lot but cannot figure out what is the problem with this :Considering that  is an integer, I don't understand why I get this error. Maybe I think too much like i'm doing C IDK.
You are iterating over the string, so each  is bound to a single character, not an integer. That's because Python  loops are Foreach constructs, unlike C.Just use that character directly, no need to index back into the string. Python strings are also immutable, so you can't replace characters in the string object. Build a new object:If you must generate an index for something, you'd generally use either the  type to produce those for you, or use  to produce both an index and the value itself in a loop.Also, note you don't need to set the  loop target name to a default before the loop unless you need to handle the case where the loop iterable is empty and you expect to use the target name after the loop. In other words, your  is entirely redundant.
