This line:will never be  because  refers to the  method, not to the return value of that method. Therefore your code always thinks that there is a match.I think that you meant to check the  variable, not .It is unnecessary to compile the re pattern because it will be cached by the re module anyway. Also, since you don't use the match object saved in , you could just test the result of  directly:
Should be Because  is a function, and most definitely not . You want to look at the return value.Also, your loopIf you find it on line 1, but then not on line 2, your result is going to be None and give a false negative. You should do Using the Regex engine is a little overkill to simple do "is this string a substring". You can just do something like this
