As far as I know, this is like an Observer pattern. Scenario: A Center object keeps a list (queue) of all its clients. I'm using Twisted.One of client objects changes a variable in center object OR notify the center to change the variable, and then the center object detects the change immediately; then as soon as the detection, the center object invoke some function of next object in queueAfter the client changed the variable, the client object will be eliminated. The center will take care of next client object. So I imagine there's no any function chain between these objects. So it's a little bit different from observer pattern.  (How to address this issue? Correct me if I'm wrong.)following code is just for demo only:
Whenever a property of class is changed,  function is called. You can override this by defining  function in your class.You need to make you required function call within this . Below is the sample example based on your requirement:Whenever you will attempt to change the value of any of class's property, this  function will be called.
Make  a property.
