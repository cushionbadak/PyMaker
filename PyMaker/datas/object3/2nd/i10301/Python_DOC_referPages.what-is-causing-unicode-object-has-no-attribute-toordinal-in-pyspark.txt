I got this error but I don't what causes it. My python code ran in pyspark. The stacktrace is long and i just show some of them. All the stacktrace doesn't show my code in it so I don't know where to look for. What is possible the cause for this error? Thanks,
The specific exception is caused by trying to store a  value in a date datatype that is part of a struct. The conversion of the Python type to Spark internal representation expected to be able to call  method.Presumably you have a dataframe schema somewhere that consists of a struct type with a date field, and something tried to stuff a string into that.You can trace this based on the traceback you do have. The Apache Spark source code is hosted on GitHub, and your traceback points to the  file. The lines point to the  method, which delegates to the  method:which in your traceback ends up at the  method:So we know this is about a date field in a struct. The  shows you what Python type is produced in the opposite direction:It is safe to assume that  expects the same type when converting in the other direction.
