I have a list of URLs for large files to download (e.g. compressed archives), which I want to process (e.g. decompress the archives). Both download and processing take a long time and processing is heavy on disk IO, so I want to have just one of each to run at a time. Since the two tasks take about the same time and do not compete for the same resources, I want to download the next file(s) while the last is being processed.This is a variation of the producer-consumer problem.The situation is similar to reading and processing images or downloading loads of files, but my downloader calls are not (yet) picklable, so I have not been able to use multiprocessing, and both tasks take about the same time.Here is a dummy example, where both download and processing are blocking:How could I make the two tasks concurrent? Can I use  or  in a smart way, perhaps in combination with ? Or must it be  with ?
I'd simply use  and start a new thread for processing.But before that, end last processing thread :See https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html
A year later, we are actually using Python 3's  and .
