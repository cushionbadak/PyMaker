I am attempting to make a simple maze game to test a NNS with genetic algorithms.the maze for each test would use a matrix to hold the x, y points of things like barriers, the start, the end, and the player's current position. The main thing that I need help with is placing the right character in the right location in a string so when the strings of row 1-25 are read (probably with a for loop) it will read out a layout of the map. As an example, the barrier points 1,1 3,4 and 1,5 would look like this if an "o" is a space:first string,second string,third string,fourth string.Any ideas? Thanks in advance!
You're probably looking for something along the lines of this:Using list comprehension, we can easily construct each row one at a time:Basically, print an  if the coordinate contains something, otherwise use .Add the side bars in... is a very useful function for this.Then all we have to do is repeat this for each row, making sure to insert a line break between each row.
