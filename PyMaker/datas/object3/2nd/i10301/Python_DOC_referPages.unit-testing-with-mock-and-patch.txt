I am writing unit tests for a function, f, which imports other functions/classes which the unit test does not (directly) interact with. Is there any way I can patch those functions from the unit test (maybe in set_up())? For reference, I am using Python 2.7.From the unittest, I want to modify/patch the behavior of helper.In unittest file:In some_function() definition
Mocking out a module is fairly standard and documented here. You will see a fairly explicit example of how it is done. Furthermore, it is important to understand where to patch, to understand how you properly mock out modules in other scripts. To provide you with a more explicit example with reference to your code, you want to do something like this: So, the important thing to remember here, is that you are referencing  with respect to where you are testing. Look at the sample code I provided and you will see we are importing . So, it is with respect to that you mock.
