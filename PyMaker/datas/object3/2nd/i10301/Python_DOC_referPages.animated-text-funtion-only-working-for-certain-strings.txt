You just need to use argument unpacking. See Arbitrary Argument Lists in the official Python tutorial.I've made a couple of other changes to your script. The  call ensures that the characters are actually printed one at a time; most terminals will buffer whole lines of text, so you wouldn't actually see the animation happening.Also, I use  for the name of the current string being animated. You should not use  as a variable name as that shadows the built-in  type. That makes your code confusing to read and can also lead to subtle bugs.
