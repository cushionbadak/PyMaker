I am trying to write python code that continuously gets data from machine and plots these data in a figure window. I am using matplotlib with interactive plotting enabled / ion().There is quite a bit of data, so plotting may take a while. Since the python code does not continue until the plot is updated, data acquisition is stopped while the plot updated.I'd like to avoid the data gaps resulting from the updating of the plots. Is there a (simple and reliable) way to update the figure/plot without blocking the execution of the code until the plot is updated on screen?EDIT 23.9.2015:I tried threading as suggested below. I put this in a script:Executing this script results in a crash (Mac OS X with Python 2.7 from MacPorts; see below). The script works smoothly and as expected if I comment out plt.plot(...) and plt.show(). Any help or suggestions what's wrong?
You can use threading which will make it to run independently, see https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html for more details
