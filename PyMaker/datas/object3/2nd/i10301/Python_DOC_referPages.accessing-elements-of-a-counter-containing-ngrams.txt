Natural Text
I am taking a string, tokenizing it, and want to look at the most common bigrams, here is what I have got:If I:Then it will output the bigrams in sorted order. Will print the elements, but not with a count, and not in order of the count.

Elements with equal counts are ordered arbitrarily:You can call it and supply a value  in order to get the  most common value-count pairs. For example:Which prints out:
