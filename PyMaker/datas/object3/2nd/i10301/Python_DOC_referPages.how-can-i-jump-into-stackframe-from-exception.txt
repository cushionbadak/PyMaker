Having a raised  I would like to jump into that frame. To explain better what I mean I wrote this mwe:Assuming I have the following code:which unsurprisingly leads to:Now to debug the problem I would like to "jump" into the frame which originally raised the  (). The original exception is still available under  complete with .
The call that  (or ) calls is from the value field of , and the default invocation of  is done on the  of that value.  However if you want to get to the underlying object, you want to access its  instead.  Given this code example:Running the code.  The  would be analogous to your .Note we have a new pdb prompt at the same location, which is where the exception was originally raised.  Let's try it with  if we need to go further up:If needed, keep repeating until you get to the target context/traceback desired.Now for the multiprocessing case, which I wasn't aware would have made this much difference, as the question implies something general (How can I “jump” into stackframe from exception?), but it turns out the specifics in  made all the difference.In Python 3.4 a workaround was done to just show that traceback as a string; due to how much stuff a traceback actually has, communicating all that proved to be difficult as discussed in the issue 13831 on the Python tracker, so instead a hack was done to bring a  attribute into the current exception, but it is no full  as it just has the string representation of that, as I had suspected.Anyway this is what would have happened:So this isn't actually possible until they figure out how to bring all those states across process boundaries.
