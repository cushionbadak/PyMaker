I am trying to test a python script and when I import the script into my testing suite, it calls the script. In my example below I import list3rdparty and once I run the test it immediate calls list3rdparty. I do not want this to happen. I would like the test to only call the functions within every test case.list3rdpartytest.pylist3rdparty.py
You probably have code at the module level which will be executed on import. For example, if you had a file with the following, it will print the string the first time it's imported.To avoid this, put the code inside a block like this:This will only run the code if it's being called directly from the command line.
