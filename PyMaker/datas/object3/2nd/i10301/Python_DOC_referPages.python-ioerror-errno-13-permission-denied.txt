Im trying to get a local directory from argv and iterate through the folder and print the contents of each file within. However i am getting a [Errno] 13 saying permission denied. Ive tried researching the problem but have come up empty handed.
, as its name implies, returns a list of all occupants of the given directory, including both files and directories (and, if you're on Unix/Linux, other stuff like symlinks and devices and whatnot). You are then blindly trying to  each item in the list and  its contents. Unfortunately,  only works on file-like objects, and specifically does not work on directories, hence Errno 13, Permission Denied.An alternative is to use , which works a little bit differently. Instead of returning a flat list that you can read immediately,  returns a generator which essentially gives you objects as you ask for them, instead of giving them all to you at once. In fact, the following code adapted from the docs is a good starting place for what you need: is returning  objects. Simply use  to create a full pathname out of the  argument you pass to  in your original code, and  from the code above, and then, using the  context manager,  the file and display its contents:One of the advantages of using  is that you don't have to remember to close the file handle that is assigned when you use something like this:Otherwise, you have a dangling file handle that could potentially cause problems, depending on how many there are and what you've done with them. It's just a good practice to  what you . With , you don't have to worry about it - the file handle is closed as soon as you exit the block.
