I need to add an escape character to a variable which I'm appending to another string and have it apply its effects. This is what I have:So if i have \xh I need the character with hex value hh but I can't seem to find anything in python that does this besides \x which I can't seem to use on variables.Any suggestions?
Use  to convert your hex value to an integer and then  to convert that number to a character:
A somewhat faster solution that repeated / calls (assuming you're using more than just the first byte produced) is to create a complete hex string and parse it all at once:This will bulk decode all the hexpairs into the raw byte values (the "escapes" you want), so  would be .Of course, for this specific case (if your real problem isn't just generating all possible bytes values in order), you could simplify it even further, because what you're doing is just generating all possible byte values:Or, just for fun, the fastest possible way abusing :
To answer the OP question, here is a way to convert,  using the escape notation, a string containing two hexadecimal digits to a characterIt is not, however, the best way to do the conversion (see other answers). I would suggest .  Another way would be to use integers instead of strings  and .
