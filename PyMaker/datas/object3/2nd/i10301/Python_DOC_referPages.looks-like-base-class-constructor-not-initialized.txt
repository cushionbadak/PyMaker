I am a newbie in python and trying my hands in oops programming here.I am initializing base class constructor in derived class , but when trying to print its attribute in base class it gives me errorWhat am i doing wrong here ? I tried like calling  also which was a getter function instead of  but this also did not work.I am working on python3.4 
This is why you must not use double-underscore prefixes for your instance attributes. These are name mangled, and almost never do what you expect.Just use  and  everywhere.
Replace your method  of  with the following codeAlso remember to update the  of  toThere're some things that I think it's worth point out if you're new to Python:Regarding getters and setters, Python's use the  and  decorators instead of the / conventions in language such as Java.Using  is also not very Pythonic. First, method names should be in . Second, define a method with the signature  and return a . Then you'll be able to do  without having to call the  as you do for .The proper way to use  in Python 3 is just , with no arguments passed (https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#super).
Variables starting with double underscores are said as private. They are mangled so they cannot be used in subclasses. Using CPython 3.5, you can confirm it simply with:When called from  class,  searches a  attribute and cannot find it.There are two common ways do deal with it:do not use private variables but simply hidden ones, that is just use simple underscore prefixes. The variable will not be displayed by help, but will not be mangled and will be accessible from subclassesuse the getter from base class:This correctly gives:
