i want to turn a queryset into a list of tuples. "result" ist what it should look like:So the solution i do have right now is this one, but it seems to me that there could be a way to shorten the code, and make it more efficient. Is there a way?My current solution:
Assuming  is supposed to look like this, with  and  as string keys:
If you can have multiple keys and you just want certain key values, you can use itemgetter with map passing the keys  you want to extract:
If this is an django ORM queryset (or result of it), you can just use  method instead of . That will give exactly what you want.
Use list comprehension and UPDATEas @aneroid reasonably mentioned, since  object are not ordered the code snippet could return different order in So since i don't want to add duplicate solution. There is one option, not so elegant, and maybe with a lack of efficiency, to use But i personally think that @PadraicCunningham 's solution is the most elegant here.
EDIT
You can use :Or in one line:If you want them in a particular order:
