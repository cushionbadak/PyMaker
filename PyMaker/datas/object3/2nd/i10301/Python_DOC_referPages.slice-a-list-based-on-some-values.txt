Hi I'm looking for a way to split a list based on some values, and assuming the list's length equals to sum of some values, e.g.:list: values: so and I'd like to have a  function to return a tuple or a list, like: currently my code is like:I'm thinking about make this clearer, but closest one I have so far is (note the results are incorrect, not what I wanted)the problem is I couldn't increase  at the same time while iterating values in , I'm hoping to get a better code to do so, any suggestion is appreciated, thanks!
Maybe make a generator of the values in l?
If you weren't stuck on ancient Python, I'd point you to . Of course, even on ancient Python, you could use the (roughly) equivalent code provided in the docs I linked to do it. Using either the Py3 code or equivalent, you could do:
You could just write a simple loop to iterate over  to generate a result:Output:
The idea here is using a nested loop. Assuming that your condition will always holds true, the logic then is to run through  and pick up  elements from  where  is an number from . Output:The first answer https://stackoverflow.com/a/39715361/5759063 is the most pythonic way to do it. This is just the algorithmic backbone. 
Best I could find is a two line solution:
