I have to create a three new lists of items using two different lists.So, Now I should create an algorithm(a cycle) which can do this: . Same for 'green' and 'white'.I undestand that I should create three cycles but I don't know how.I've tried to make a function like this but it doesn't works.What am I doing wrong?
I think you might be looking for itertools.product:
You should do this
There are a few problems with your code:When you do a for loop , you do not need to initialize  () and you should not increment it () since Python knows that  will take all values specified in the for loop definition.If your code indentation (indentation is very important in Python) is truly the one written above, your  statement is inside the for loop. As soon as your function encounters your return statement, your function will exit and return what you specified: in this case, a string. is not a list but a string.In Python, you can loop directly over the list items as opposed to their index ( as opposed to Here is your code cleaned up:This can be rewritten using a list comprehension:And because  has more than one item, you would need to iterate over  as well:
return should be out of for loop.No need to initialize  and increment it, since you are using range.Also, since both list can be of variable length, don't use range. Iterate over the list elements directly. should be like All above in below code:Output:Using List Comprehension,  function will look like below:
