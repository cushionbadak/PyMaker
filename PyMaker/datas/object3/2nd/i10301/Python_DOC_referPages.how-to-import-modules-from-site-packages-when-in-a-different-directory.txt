I made a module and moved it to .When I run bash command  in this folder to start the ide and import the module it works. However if I run  in any other directory (e.g. ) it saysI was under the impression that Python would automatically search for modules in  regardless of the directory. How can I fix it so that it will work regardless of where I am?
Instead of moving the module I would suggest you add the location of the module to the  environment variable.  If this is set then the python interpreter will know where to look for your module.e.g. on Linux
