I have this scriptAs of now,  equals  and  equals .When I run this script, it errors like thisI'm pretty sure my loop is protected right, and it should break before this happens. If this the case, then why is it happening?
my loop is protectedNo it isn't. The condition on the  has to be evaluated first before reaching the body of the loop where the protection  condition is.To be sure  does not exceed the length of the list, move the condition on the  and make it the first condition on the :Otherwise you could move the  block after the update of  so the condition is evaluated before that of the next iteration of :
Your loop is not "safe", "break" only breaks inner loop, thus once i==len(line) it goes out of first while, stays in the main for and you try to read out line[i] in "while not line[i] == """ line, which causes you to index outside "line" (since the condition is checked before entering the loop).
