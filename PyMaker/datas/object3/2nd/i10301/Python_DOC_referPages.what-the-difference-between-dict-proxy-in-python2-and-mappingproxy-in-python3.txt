Natural Text
I notice when I create class in python2 it stores attributes in  object:  But in python3  returns :  Is there any difference between two of them?
There is no real difference, it just got renamed.When it was proposed to expose the type in the  module in issue #14386, the object was renamed too:I'd like to bikeshed a little on the name. I think it should be  MappingProxy. (We don't use "view" much but the place where we do use  it, for keys/values/items views, is very different I think. Also  collections.abc already defines MappingView as the base class for  KeysView and friends.)andAnyway, you are not the first one who remarks that we already use "view" to define something else, so I wrote a new patch to use the "mappingproxy" name (exposed as types.MappingProxyType).The change made it into Python 3.3, so in Python 3.2 you'll still see the old name.
