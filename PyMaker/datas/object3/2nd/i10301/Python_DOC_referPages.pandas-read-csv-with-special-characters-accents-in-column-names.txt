I have a  file that contains some data with columns names:"PERIODE""IAS_brut""IAS_lissé""Incidence_Sentinelles"I have a problem with the third one "IAS_lissé" which is misinterpreted by  method and returned as �.What is that character?Because it's generating a bug in my flask application, is there a way to read that column in an other way without modifying the file?
You can change the  parameter for read_csv, see the pandas doc here. Also the python standard encodings are here. I believe for your example you can use the  encoding (assuming that your language is French). Here's an example showing some sample output. All I did was make a csv file with one column, using the problem characters.Output:
I found the same problem with spanish, solved it with with "latin1" encoding:Hope it helps!
Using utf-8 didn't work for me. E.g. this piece of code: Ultimately returned: OSError: Initializing from file failedI know you said you didn't want to modify the file. If you meant the file content vs the filename, I would rename the file to something without an accent, read the csv file under its new name, then reset the filename back to its original name. If you did mean "without modifying the filename, my apologies for not being helpful to you, and I hope this helps someone else.
