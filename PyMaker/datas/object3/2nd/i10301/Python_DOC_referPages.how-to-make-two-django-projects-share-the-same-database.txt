I need to make two separate Django projects share the same database. In  I have models creating objects that I need to use in  (mostly images).The tree structure of  is:Which is the best approach?EDIT: I'm using sqlite3 in my development environment.I'd like to keep my two django projects as stand-alone projects (so that both can be upgraded safely from their respective repositories). In this way, each project has its own  (the one that I need to be shared):but I guess I need to do something more to make it shared (and unique).The best for me would be to keep the  at project_1/ path and thus set the project_2/settings.py  to point to project_1/development.db.
You can simply define the same database in  in your settings.py. So, if your database is PostgreSQL, you could do something like this:Note that both database users ( and ) should have the appropriate privileges on the database you wish to use. Or you could instead use the same user for both projects.If you want to have more than just one database per project, you should take a look at the docs for multiple databases.On another matter, since you share data, I guess you share functionalities as well. So for example, if  and  do same (or similar) things, it seems they could instead be a single reusable app.EditSince you use sqlite3, you should ensure the path you use is the same. So, assuming that  and  are siblings, like so:you should try this:This would give the structure you ask for. Note however that the projects are not both "standalone".  is clearly dependent on 's database.In any case, perhaps, you should also take a look at the os.path module for more info.
