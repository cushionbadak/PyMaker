I writing a function which populates a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is an element from a different list and the second element is a value which increments.Is there an equivalent to the C++ postfix operators which can be used? Thanks!Bonus question: Is it more Pythonic to use the list constructor, than to construct the list using square brackets? Edit: Here is my current (less beautiful) workaround -
You may use  to achieve this. Enumerate return the index along with value while iterating over the list of values. And as per your requirement, you need list of  as . Below is the sample code to achieve that:
You can achieve the same with , calling  on the  object for each element of the sequence:construct the list using square bracketsThat's a list comprehension. It's pretty standard and most certainly Pythonic to use list comprehensions for creating lists.
 and  have been deliberately excluded from Python, because using them in expressions tends to lead to confusing code and off-by-one errors.You should use  instead:
