Please tell me the difference between calling  by using  and calling by . The method which calls the above function is in  class with name .
In your specific case, there is no difference. If the methods had the same name, you would not be calling the parent class using , but your own method again, creating infinite recursion.With , the call is always going to the method in the parent class in Method Resolution Order, thus preventing the infinite recursion. More details on  itself can also be found in the official documentation.Generally, you only need  if you really need the inherited method, such as when re-implementing that exact method.For example, running this code will lead to , due to maximum recursion depth exceeded. The reason is that  calls itself over and over, because we are using  instead of .This on the other hand has the intended effect:Again, in your specific example it does not matter, because the other method () is only defined in the parent class, so it is unambiguous which method to call. If you had overridden  with something different, the use of  and  would again yield different results:Observe the difference in the interactive interpreter:
