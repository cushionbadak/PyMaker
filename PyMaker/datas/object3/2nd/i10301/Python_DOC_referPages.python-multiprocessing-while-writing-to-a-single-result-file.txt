I am really new to the multiprocessing package and I am failing to get the task done.I have lots of calculations to do on a list of objects. The results I need to write down are saved in those objects, too.The results should be written in a single file as soon as the process finished the calculations (the way I got it at least working, waits until all calculations are done).How to write the results from the calculations simultaneously to one single file, without having to wait for all processes to finish?
You can use imap_unorderedWith Python 3.3+ better do
