I am using pythons ipaddress module and im trying to get the first usable host only, not all usable hoststhe below gives me all hosts, and when i try to index it i get the below error.is is possible any other way to just get the first usable host?Thanksthe below is also failing
 returns a generator object, which does not support indexing. You must iterate through it.If you only want the first element, just use :If you want to convert the generator object into a list which supports indexing, you have to call the  function:You can also loop through a generator object like you would a list, as you did in your first code snippet:
Short version:Long version:This shows 3 ways of computing first and last usable IP addressesin a CIDR block using ipaddress.It shows the "right" (fast, space efficient way to do this)and two others using the hosts iterator which turn out toillustrate a classic space time tradeoff.
Alternate way to get the first host address especially for "big networks" / small prefix values is:No need to use the hosts() generator at all. See e.g. https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#networks-as-containers-of-addresses about ipaddress Network objects as "containers of addresses". First address within this address space / "container of addresses" is the network address (index [0]). Last address is the broadcast address (index [-1]). Or you can use the network address & get the first host address by adding 1:Depending on the prefix / netmask you are using, the hosts() generator can be slow. If you usethe statement creates a list with 2**(32-8) - 2 = 16777214 entriesIf I time this statment, it needs > 10 sec to create this host list:If I compare the time needed to get the first address:Results: hosts() needs about 14 sec to finish. The alternatives are +/- 10 Âµs timeit for a /24 network:
