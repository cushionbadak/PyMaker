I'm trying to get some data from an JSON API. I don't want all the data that the API returns so I wrote a method that reads all the data and returns a dictionary with the relevant fields. Sometimes though, some data are missing and I would like to replace the fields that are missing with an underscore. A sample of the method is like that;  If a field is missing from the data, this throughs a KeyError. Is it possible to catch programmatically which field produced the error, in a single try-except block and not write a try-except block for every field?instead of  Thank you
Use  method of : returns its second argument ( by default) if a dict doesn't have requested key, so it is always safe to use it in uncertain situations. Example:
You can probably get that information from the members of the  exception object, but a simpler way would be to just use  that will return a default value if the key is not there.Another reason this is better than handling an exception is that you can only handle one exception. What happens if two keys are missing? And on top of that,  will not even be defined in your example because the code failed.
Instead of using try block, you can use For example:
If you want to avoid the repetitiveness of typing  for each key, you can use a , setting it to return  when a key is trying to be accessed but missing.
