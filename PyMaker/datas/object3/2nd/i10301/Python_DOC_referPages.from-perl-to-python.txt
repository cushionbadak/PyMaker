I've got some code that I've translated from perl into python, but I am having a time trying to figure out this last part. While I understand (a bit) what this is doing, I can't seem to find out how to do this in python. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Your program is generating a script and running it.A first python approximation is:As you can see, perl is still being used inside your script which is using the module data::dumper. If you want to use python here, you may need the equivalent module.
This part:Is a here doc and you would do this in Python:You would shell out to Bash using something like os.system or subprocess.check_output.The result of that is then fed to  to be run as Perl code. (The wisdom, and the result of the  is dependant on what these Bash commands produce. It would appear that those commands are producing a Perl script. Obviously, that will not execute in Python. Python also has eval. Use  in any language cautiously.)The use of  in Perl would seem to indicate access to the environment of the host. However, the actual Perl variable to access the OS environment hash is  in uppercase. In Bash, you access the environment with a lowercase To access the host environment in Python, use os.environ
