I have an assignment where I have to use Python code to simulate a company's hourly average maximum customer volume. The homework prompt says to import the random module and use the random.random() method. My issue is that I don't know what to put into the function itself. Here's the code I have so far:
Maximum hourly customer volume is a rate so you should simulate this with a poisson distribution. You can create a poisson distribution like this:Documentation for the poisson distribution can be found here: http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.random.poisson.htmlWhen you say average maximum do you mean the average of the maximum customer rate for each day?
