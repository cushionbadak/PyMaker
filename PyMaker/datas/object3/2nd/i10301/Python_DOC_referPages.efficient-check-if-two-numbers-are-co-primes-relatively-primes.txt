What is the most efficient ("pythonic") way to test/check if two numbers are co-primes (relatively prime) in Python.For the moment I have this code:Can the code for checking/testing if two numbers are relatively prime be considered "Pythonic" or there is some better way?
The only suggestion for improvement might be with your function . Namely, you could use  that's defined in  (for Python ) for a speed boost.Defining  that uses the built-in version of :You almost cut down execution speed by half due to the fact that  is implemented in  (see  in ):For Python  you could use  but, as noted in a comment by @user2357112, it is not implemented in . Actually, there's really no incentive to actually use it, its implementation is exactly the same as yours.
