Importing Python modules from files is relatively easy with the Python C API with  however I would need to use functions stored in strings. Is there a way to import python modules from strings (to clarify: there is no file; the code is in a string) or will I have to save the strings as temp files?
If my understanding is correct, you could use  which takes a  to specify the module to be imported.Since my understanding was incorrect:It would generally be better to dump the contents to a  file and then execute them with  but, if you have strings and want to work with those I guess you could use  to compile it to a code object and then feed it to  for evaluation.
No need to use temp files. Use this code:This is code taken from a real commercial application (I've slightly modified it by removing error handling and other non-needed details).Just set the wanted module name in  and the Python code in  and you are done!
