I need to create a single logger that can be used throughout my python package, but some of the functions implement multiprocessing.  I want all those functions to write to the same log file just like everything else.I know at Python 3.2+ there is a built in way to do this, but I need to back port to Python 2.7.x as well.Is there any code out there that works well with both multiprocessing and non-multiprocessing functions for logging?Normally, I would create a log as such:Then the output would write to a single file.  It works great, but when I implement this, this code will create multiple files, which I do not want.Any ideas?Thank you
The functionality to do this in Python >= 3.2 (via the  and  classes, as described here) is available for Python 2.7 through the  project.
