Natural Text
To simplify, let's say I'm trying to write a command line two-way chat in Python. I would like the user to input his message with  at the command prompt, but a listening thread could print a message at any moment. By default, this would "break" the user's input. Visually something like this:The closest I was able to find was this answer here which is almost, but not exactly, what I'm looking for, but it did point me towards the  package which seems to be what I need (although I'm happy with an answer for any package, or even pure ANSII).What I'm trying to achieve is to print incoming output from a Thread above the user's input, so that his text doesn't break. Let's say the user is typing:Suddenly a message comes in from the thread, but our user's input doesn't brake:What should my threads theoretical  method look like to achieve this?NB: I'm using Linux and am not interested in cross-platform compatibility.
There are two ways of doing this.One is to use . There are python bindings for this. With , the terminal screen is under your complete control, and you can print characters at any point.Without , you can't write above the current line. What you can do, however, is print a  character and go back to the beginning of the line.If you save the user's input (say he wrote ), and you want to print the line  above that, you can output:This will overwrite the current line, and introduce a newline, moving the user's input down. The effect is similar, but it won't be as tamper-proof as .
