I have looked at this:Split list into sublist based on index rangesBut my problem is slightly different.I have a listI need to split it up into sublists based on the dates. Basically it's an event log but due to shitty DB design the system concats separate update messages for an event into one big list of strings.I have:which for my example will give:Now I need split the list into separate lists based on the indexes. So for my example ideally I want to get:so the format is:There are also edge cases where there is no date string which would be the format of:
You don't need to perform a two-pass grouping at all, because you can use  to both segment by dates and their associated events in a single pass. By avoiding the need to compute indices and then slice a  using them, you could process a generator that provides the values one at a time, avoiding memory issues if your inputs are huge. To demonstrate, I've taken your original  and expanded it a bit to show this handles edge cases correctly:which outputs (newlines added for readability):
Try:Then:
