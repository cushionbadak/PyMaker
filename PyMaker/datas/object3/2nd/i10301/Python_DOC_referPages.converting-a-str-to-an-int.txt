My Problem is that the type  is str, but i need integer.So i did the convert . Then i got error invalid literal for int() with base 10:So i did a little bit of research and found that i had to put int . Now i get "could not convert string to float".    
According to the documentation,  expects a tuple , with the string being the ip address and the int being the port. You can modify your code this way to fix it :Hope it'll be helpful.
To convert a dotted notation IP address in a string to an integer you need:"aton" is short for "ASCII to number".  This is for IPv4 addresses.
