I am using collections.Counter and I am trying to loop over the elements. However if I have  and use a for loop to print each element, it would only print one of each letter:would print:How would I loop over it in  a way that would print as many of each letter as there are? As in, 2 A's, 2 a's, 1 b, 1 B, 1 C.Edit: apparently there is a method called elements() that serves this exact purpose.
When you iterate over a  you are iterating over the keys. In order to get the counts at the same time you could do something like:
Discovered the elements() method shortly after posting this, here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.CounterIt returns an iterator that repeats each element as many times as it is counted, ignoring elements with counts<1
