Natural Text
I am trying to extract English titles from a wiki titles dump that's in a text file using regex in Python 3. The wiki dump contains titles in other languages also and some symbols. Below is my code:But I am getting an error:at the line: But, I am using  to make output as byte type, below is a sample of the text file:I have searched online but could not succeed. Any help will be appreciated.
You have to choose between binary and text mode.Either you open your file as  and then you can use   ( is a  object)Or you open your file as  and then you can use     ( is a  object)The second solution is more "classical".
The problem is with the  argument you supply, it isn't a  object:Instead, supply  as a bytes instance :Note: Don't prefix your literals with  and don't open the file with  if you aren't looking for  sequences. 
You can't use a  string for your regex match when the replacement string isn't.Essentially, you can't mix different objects (s and s) when doing most tasks. In your code above, you are using a binary search string and a binary text, but your replacement string is a regular . All arguments need to be of the same type, so there are 2 possible solutions to this.Taking the above into account, your code could look like this (this will return regular  strings, not  objects):Note that the code does use a special type of string for the regex - a raw string, prefixed with . This means that python won't interpret escape characters such as , which is very useful for regexes. See the docs for more details about raw strings.
