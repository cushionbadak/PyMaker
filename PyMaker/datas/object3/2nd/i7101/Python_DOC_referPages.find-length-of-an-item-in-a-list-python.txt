I've searched and searched and can't find anything to help. I have a list that goes like this The first and last items are ignored, but i need to find the length of each item in between. The list has no set size or format, so they length change. I need to find the length of the second item (LON) (The length will be either 3 or 5), then i run it through something, and then it must loop back and check the length of the second item, and repeat, but NOT check the length of the last one.Thanks
