Ok, this question has probably been answered somewhere but my Google-fu hasn't found the right combination of keywords yet.I have a function that accepts a string, but when I pass None, Pycharm's inspection is flagging a type error. Is this an error in the linter? Does None count as a string? I know I can call the function with an empty string, but I think I should be able to use None as well.
As a dissenting opinion, Python is not strongly typed so for pycharm's linter to highlight that as an error seems a little odd to me.Of course there are many functions which legitimately need a string, but I'm sure i saw somewhere that 'good practice' for that was a function that looked more like this:This works with anything that can be coerced into a string, which seems more sensible than requiring literally a string.Am I nuts?
 does not count as a string.  is the sole member of the class .  To do what you want, arrange for your function to accept an optional string argument.Then don't pass it , pass it nothing:
First to answer your question  is not a  It is the sole value of  it is a python Built in Contstant. Read about it here.And there are many ways to get around/handle possible  input1. To get around it, not going to handle None:is expecting  so of course, it throws an error. just pass in  instead. but in this case calling  would still give you an error.2. To Handle possible  input:if you want to handle  as one of possible input parameter then set your parameter  to optional parameter with  that way you can input  and not get an errorORDefault your input to  if the value user pass in is not  then you know user pass in something else: This allows you do to  and not get an errorNote: this also allows you treat  and  equally (thanks to Stael for pointing out)
