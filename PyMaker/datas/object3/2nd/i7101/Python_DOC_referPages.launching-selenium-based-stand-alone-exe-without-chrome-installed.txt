I have created a python script that uses selenium and a webdriver (Chromedriver). After completing this script, I used cx_freeze to compile my script into a stand alone exe file that I can double click to execute the script. However, with selenium, I have been using the chromedriver file I downloaded that works along the chrome application I have installed onto my pc. What I would like to do, or try to do is have my exe file work with the chromedriver and not require the user to have google chrome installed onto their computer. Is there anyway I can include the chrome as a package in the same directory to get around this or something?I am also open to other ideas.
You can always bundle the offline installer and prompt it to be installed and just run the executable to install it. (Available here)NOTE: There may be some licensing issues which you may have to look into.Otherwise, use  to direct them to the installation page for chrome. Something like:
