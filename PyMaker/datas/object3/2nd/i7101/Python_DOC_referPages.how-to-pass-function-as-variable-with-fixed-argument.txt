I'm newbie in Python, but the second time I encouter this problem.Problem:In some libraries there are functions with arguments. Sometimes there is argument as function, like this:And I want to pass there some other function like this:which have more than one argument. I want to make one argument static, so  except  as argument.Finally I want to make some kind of cycle where I can change static arg.Something like this:Please do not offer me to change any functions. They are from library and it's not very comfortable to change them.Thanks a lot!
You can use lambda statement:
It sure sounds like you are looking for . From the docs:Return a new  object which when called will behave like  called with the positional arguments  and keyword arguments .In your example, you could pass  as the argument to . Or you could create the  objects and use them in a loop:
My solution with decoratorYou can change myfunc as you wish.You can also insert more function layers.Without the use of this decorator factory,you would lose the name of myfunc and the docstring.
