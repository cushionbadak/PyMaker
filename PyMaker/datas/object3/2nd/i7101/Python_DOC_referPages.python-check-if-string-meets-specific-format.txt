Programming in Python3.I am having difficulty in controlling whether a string meets a specific format.So, I know that Python does not have a  method like Java but that we can use regex.My code hence will probably look something like this, where lowpan_headers is a dictionary with a field that is a string that should meet a specific format.So the code will probably be like this:However, my issue is in the format and I have not been able to get it right.The format should be like , where the first 4 characters should be  and all the rest, with that exact length, should be hexadecimal values (so from 0-9 and a-f).So two questions:(1) any easier way of doing this except through importing re (2) If not, can you help me out with the regex?
As for the regex you're looking for I believe thatshould validate correctly for your requirements.As for if there is an easier way than using the  module, I would say that there isn't really to achieve the result you're looking for. While using the  keyword in python works in the way you would expect a  method to work for a string, you are actually wanting to know if a string is in a correct format. As such the best solution, as it is relatively simple, is to use a regular expression, and thus use the  module.
Here is a solution that does not use :
In fact, Python does have an equivalent to the  method. You can use the  operator:A similar question has already been answered here.For your case, however, I'd still stick with regex as you're indeed trying to evaluate a certain String format. To ensure that your string only has hexadecimal values, i.e. 0-9 and a-f, the following regex should do it: . The additional "complication" are the four 'b' at the start of your string. I think an easy fix would be to include them as follows: .The part that is currently missing is checking for the exact length of the string for which you could either use the string length method or extend the regex -- but I'm sure you can take it from here :-) 
As I mentioned in the comment Python does have  equivalent.(source) (PythonDocs)If you would prefer to use a regex instead to validate your input, you can use this: - Regex101 Demo with explanation
