I am creating a code in which it reads information from a txt-file and stores the information on three separate lists. The code I have created does this, but in a pretty hardcoded manner. My question is if there is any better way to read from the file by for example using a for-loop or anything since the code at this point is repeating itself.The code I have created is:Thank you in advance for your help!
You can use  to read out those contiguous portions and then process each line into a list which is appended to a parent list:The list of indices are easily amendable and can easily be passed as part of the function arguments.
You can read entire filr first and store slices:A slice is configured [Start Position (included):End Position (excluded)].See Docs Here
If rowcount is the only way of splitting the file, maybe something like this:First create a file spec containing the line blocks you are interested in. Then read the entire file into memory (assuming the file is not too large) and use the file spec to slice the file into the separate sections. Should be easy to maintain because you only have to change the file spec to read more blocks. There's a few extra unnecessarily lines in my sample code, but its worth it for readability IMO.If you prefer, you can change share_price_spec into a list of directories or a list of named slices for future readability.
