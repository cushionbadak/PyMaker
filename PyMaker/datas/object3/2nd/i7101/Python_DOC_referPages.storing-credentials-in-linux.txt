I need to access a service which requires a username and password, and i do not wish to store this in the code. The code runs on a linux server with kerberos.Can anybody point to examples which allow me to store a password on linux with python or bash shell from linux?At the moment i am using a clear text password in a file with permissions for only the current user.I have been pointed to a guide using powershell:#
For storing config values I'd recommend using configparser which will allow you to store any kinds of config and parameters in a config file.Storing usernames and passwords is, of course, very sensitive. One way would be to encrypt the data with a master key that is only known to you and not hardcoded anywhere. Instead, each time you run or start your script, you could just prompt for that master key and then decrypt the encrypted password stored in the config file. This approach is explained here.
