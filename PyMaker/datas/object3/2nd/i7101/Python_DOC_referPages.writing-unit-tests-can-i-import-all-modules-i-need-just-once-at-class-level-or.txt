I'm trying to write unit tests for some code using :https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.htmlSuppose that each of the tests I'm writing needs to import the ,  and  module.  Right now I'm importing them in each of the tests I'm writing:To avoid code duplication, isn't it possible to just import them once at class level? This:results in the errorSo it's clearly not the right approach.EDIT just for clarity, both the code for which I'm writing the unit tests (which is composed of just two methods, actually) and the (two) unit tests are in the same module, let's call it . 
Given that the duplicated code you want to get rid of consists of imports, I completely agree with BrenBarn's response, because you don't need to import a module multiple times.For the general case where you want to run the same code before or after every test in a class you should use the setUp() and tearDown() methods of class unittest.TestCase.
