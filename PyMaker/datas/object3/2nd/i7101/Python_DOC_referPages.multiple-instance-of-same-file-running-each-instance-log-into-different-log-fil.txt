I have a master python script, that goes and automates configuring nodes in parallel in a distributed system setup in our lab. I run multiple instances of kickstart.py and it goes and configures all nodes in parallel. How do I create log handler such that each instance of kickstart.py configures each node separately in parallel and each instance logs into different log file. I want to use python logging module. Any help is appreciated. Thanks
You could pass the name of the desired logfile to the python script from the command line. Try something like this.Note that python has some more advanced logging capabilities, but I'm not using them here for simplicity. You should probably use them.Run this as  to log to a file in the same directory as the script or replace  with a full path. I don't know how your 'master script' calls multiple instances of kickstart.py, but here's one way to call python code from python, passing command line arguments
 module is thread safe and very easy to use.Read the relevant documentation.Here is a simple example:Which will give you:
