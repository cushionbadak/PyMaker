I am using python and I am using a method like thisto get the up/down status of the list of ip's I am pinging.  Is there a way to extract the latency from this as well?My output when running this code looks something along the lines ofI would it to say x.x.x.x is down, latency = 50ms.  Is there a simple way to do this that I am overlooking?
You probably need to use .  From the docs on :Changes to sys.stdin, etc. are not reflected in the environment of the executed command. If command generates any output, it will be sent to the interpreter standard output stream.Subprocess will just be easier.
