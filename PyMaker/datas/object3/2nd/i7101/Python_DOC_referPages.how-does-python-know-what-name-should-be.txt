Running a script from the command line, the  attribute of that script will be . But ing that script from a different location, the  attribute of that module will be the name of the script. How does python know what the value of  should be? Can a script tell that it's being imported, and set the  attribute accordingly? 
From the docsThe import machinery fills in these attributes on each module object during loading, based on the moduleâ€™s spec, before the loader executes the module.  The  attribute must be set to the fully-qualified name of the module. This name is used to uniquely identify the module in the import system.So these magic attributes are assigned during the so-called "import machinery". You can read more details about that system in the docs as well.
Q: How does python know what the value of  should be?Well, if you write  Python will look for a module named 'foo' and set its name to 'foo'.Q: Can a module tell that it's being imported, ...Yes, it can. Usually people do that with  -- if the test passes, it generally means that the module is being executed, if it fails it generally means that it is being imported.A particular case where this test will fail is when you have a module named  (in a file named ).If you want to be 100% more sure, you can inspect the frames and see if the module is on top of the stack:Q: ... and set the  attribute accordingly?And yes, you can change  to whatever you want by simply setting it:Although there's no reason to do so, other than generating confusion and possibly introducing bugs.
