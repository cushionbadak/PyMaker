I've been using Python to calculate math equations. For example:Which results in the output:Is there a way to show this answer as fractions as opposed to decimals? I would like to see the output as:
SymPy has Rational class for rational numbers. No need for  unless you actually want to print out the un-evaluated form. Other versions: (rational number can be parsed from a string); (beginning the computation with the SymPy object for "1" turns it into SymPy object manipulation, avoiding plain Python division, which would give a float)
you can work with the  module in order to have integral fractions:there is also the  class in sympy itself:
Use sympy's  instead of . Python will immediately interpret  and return some floating point number ( in this case).
