I would like to create a dictionary of values resulting from a split() sequence without whitespace.If I had a list of strings that were formatted like so:I know how to get the pairs by whitespace >2 by:This returns another list of strings with the pairs:So far so good. Now from here I need to break the pairs by the , the left side is the  and the right side is the . I can do this by:This returns another list of strings with broken pairs:Now each item has either a trailing or a leading whitespace. This is easily fixed by updating that last list comprehension line to:In order to make this a dictionary I know to call a generator expression:But this keeps that trailing or leading whitespace with the  and . If I were to add the  I get the error:Question:How can I use the  generator and  whitespace from the  call at the same time? Or am I forced to  after the  call?
How about this:
You could iterate over  using  with a step of :To fit it all in one line you could also write:
If you could identify a pattern to match with a regex, then you could use  and  to handle the  creation
Here's my go at it:Or if you like to cram things into one line:Instead of splitting by double spaces and then by equals, just split by whitespace in general and then remove equals tokens. Then pass the generator twice to  to generate the pairs for .The drawback of this solution is that it requires to have always whitespace around the equals symbols.
