I am trying to compare the performance of an ANN and the logistic regression on 200 different datasets. Every dataset is named . Therefore I run a loop:and let the ANN and the logistic regression be trained and classifying the data. What I want to catch is the Error of the logistic regression:When the error is catched I want that this dataset is skipped and it will be proceeded with the next one (i+1). Is this somehow possible? I am quite new to programming and have no clear idea how to handle this exception. I already thought about doing it somehow with a if else formulation:But I do not know what to take into the else expression. Would be great if anyone could help me on this issue. Thanks!
Use /.  Here's some pseudocode for your specific case:And here's a working example with toy data:Output:
