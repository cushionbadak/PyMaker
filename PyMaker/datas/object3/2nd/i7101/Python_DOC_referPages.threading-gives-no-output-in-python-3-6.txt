Here's my code:The output should be various lines telling the current time. But after running the program I got no output and no error. Why is this happening? I use Python 3.6.
Probably the first question is why you're using . I am guessing your issue is that your main thread finishes before  manages to produce any output, and on this particular system, that exits the whole program. From the section Caveats in the _thread documentation:When the main thread exits, it is system defined whether the other threads survive. On most systems, they are killed without executing  …  clauses or executing object destructors.When using  instead, you get to choose whether to await threads with the  argument. 
Use :The threading module provides an easier to use and higher-level threading API built on top of this [] module.
