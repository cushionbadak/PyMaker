Let's take an example!When I write the following piece of code, I get a successful match (Please note, the string for the search function has 8 characters including a white-space and the search works for a value of re.MULTILINE greater than the size of the string to be searched which is 8 in this case):But, when I set the value of re.MULTILINE to any value less than the size of the string the search fails, as shown below:How does re.MULTILINE work here?
You never change the value of . That's internal implementation for the module . It needs to be used as a flag (enabled / disabled), not otherwise.Basically it means:re.MULTILINE:  When specified, the pattern character '^' matches at the beginning of the string and at the beginning of each line (immediately following each newline); and the pattern character '$' matches at the end of the string and at the end of each line (immediately preceding each newline). By default, '^' matches only at the beginning of the string, and '$' only at the end of the string and immediately before the newline (if any) at the end of the string.So it makes your regex pattern (^, $) to work on new lines as well. Otherwise, when using ^ the pattern is matched only for the first line.Example:
