I have been trying to work out how to make a  (Python Extension Module) file from a C script (without swig or anything else except MinGW) and have successfully built it into a .The problem however occurs when I try and import the module.If I run it the module runs successfully (as far as I can see) and then an error appears saying  and it closes without executing the rest of the program.Here is my C script (test.c):And Python Script (file.py):I compiled the script with:I can't find any errors when compiling in command prompt and am using python 3.6 (running on Windows 10).I can't find much on the subject and would prefer to keep away from Cython (I already know C) and Swig. Any help to tell me what is wrong would be fantastic.
Creating a Python extension is completely different than writing regular C code. What you have done is simply creating a valid C program but that doesn't make sense for Python.That's how your program should look like (it's just a skeleton, not the proper, working code):I recommend you read more about this at the following link: http://dan.iel.fm/posts/python-c-extensions/ as well as in the official docs.
