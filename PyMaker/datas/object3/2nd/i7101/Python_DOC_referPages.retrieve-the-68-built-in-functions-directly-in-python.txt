Command  just list all the 151 builtin libraries.However, It lists 68 built-in functions in 2. Built-in Functions â€” Python 3.6.2 documentationI tried to get the functions from  as the following steps:How to list the 68 built-in functions directly?
One approach in Python 3.5 would be to list objects that have the  attribute and it set to  and lowercase name:Notice that  is listed in the docs but  is not. 67 names on Python 3.5. The list in the docs has 68 names... This is also because  and  from the documentation do not match my filter, as  is from module  and  is from site builtins; actually the documentation is wrong, because  need not be available:Likewise many exception types are always available, even though they're not listed there.
I tried being smart about it but partially failed, but still an interesting find, so here it is:This returns a list of 42 items for me in python 3.5.3Without using , a nice seperator is to check if the items in  start with a lowercase letter, that usually indicates a function, so Returns 72 items for me, perhaps it's more complete than the documentation is? My guess would be yes. Check it out for yourself to test these ideas
Technically, there are only 42 (in 3.4) or so builtin functions and methods in Python. The rest of the list is builtin variables and typess:Note that  or , for example, are not really functions. They are constructors of the namesake builtin data types:
I tried to filter it (mostly) by functionality and came up with:It produces the same 72 items that @OferSadan's simple  filter produces! (+1)Additions are: , , ,  and Deletions are: If you eliminate the  test, you get back  but you also get  and
