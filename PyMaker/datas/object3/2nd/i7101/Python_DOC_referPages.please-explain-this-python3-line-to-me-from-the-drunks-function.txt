Explanation:Your function  takes 2 arguments ( and ).The built-in  function takes unlimited number of positional arguments (in your case, they are 3).So it will print the three values, separated by the default delimiter (which is a space).First expression ():Python supports short-circuit evaluation. See the first row of the table in the link:  | So in your case , if  is a falsy value,  will be printed. But if  is a truthy one, it will be printed (I don't know what type  is, but I think it is an integer).Second expression ():Here, at first  is always printed.Then, we append the result of . We append the letter  if  is a truthy value (not a falsy one), otherwise we append an empty string (which is simply nothing).In the end, we print the  parameter, which can also be any type of value.
When you say print bottle or '...', it's saying if bottle!=0. If you inputed 0 into this, you would get the no more bottles, if you type in 1, you'll get singular bottle as opposed to bottles. For the second if statement, you'll always write bottles unless bottle - 1 = 0 (when bottle equals 1)
