I was looking at this list of python quirks and was amused that this returns :After seeing this I saw the answers here and here which presented the reason why, and that's that the  clause will always be executed, no exceptions.My question is, where is the previous  value stored:Why doesn't this return  but instead returns the original ?And is it possible to access the going to be returned value programatically?I'd like to know if it's possible to do this without using a variable for example:andreturn  and  respectively.
Why doesn't this return  but instead returns the original ?From the docs:The  clause is also executed “on the way out” when any other clause of the try statement is left via a ,  or  statement.So this means that if a  statement is present in the  clause that value will be returned (since the  block is guaranteed to execute fully, any  statement inside it will be executed as well). Otherwise, if the  block was going to return a value, that value is returned.This means thatWill execute exactly as:And is it possible to access the going to be returned value programatically?No, you can't access the value after the  statement in other parts of the code without saving it.
