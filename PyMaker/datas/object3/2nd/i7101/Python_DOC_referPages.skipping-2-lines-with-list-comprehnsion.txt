I'm trying to utilise list comprehension for sorting data from a very large file. The file structure is like so:... and so on.Basically trying to collect all info1 into a list and all info2 into another list. I have a previous script which does this, but it's slow. I'm also trying to make it object oriented so I can use the data more efficiently. Old script:New script:The new script works for getting info1_data as a list. However, to get info2_data I can't find anything for skipping 2 lines using this method. I guessed at . It runs but doesn't produce anything. Is this possible? Many thanks.Following help from Moses I've this solution. The islice is very confusing though and I don't fully understand it, even after reading the python.docs. Does the iterable get the data (i.e., info1 or info2) or do the start, stop and step dictate what data is extracted?islice(iterable, start, stop[, step])
You should the  the file back to the start in order to repeat the search from the beginning of the file. Also, you could use a generator function to decouple the search operation from the production of the data. Then use  to step over lines:However instead of passing the file, I'll suggest you pass the path to the file instead so the file can be closed after each use, to avoid holding up resources when they are not (or not yet) needed.
You can do like this:But it looks a little weird way!
