I have a set object like thisSince in Python, set object does not support indexing. If I want to extract certain elements, say 'Book' and its lowercase form 'book', from the set and count their frequencies relative to total number of elements (i.e., tokens) in the set. What is the handy way to do this?Thank you.
You can count how many times the word is in the list whatever the casing by couting the occurrences of its lowercased (or casefolded) version (otherwise the question doesn't make sense since  guarantees uniqueness) using :result:and for frequencies:which gives:as explained by a nice comment,  handles more cases (no pun intended!) than , even if  works for most words (use  for Python 2.x, as  isn't available)
If I want to extract certain elements, say 'Book' and its lowercase form 'book', from the set and count their frequencies relative to total number of elements (i.e., tokens) in the set.If you want to find the frequency of a certain element in your set, you can use  to accomplish this:Realize however, that s do not support duplicate elements, so the frequency will always be . Consider using a  or  to initialize your  object.
Result:
This is handy (and it works also for lists) :
