I am working through Python: Crash Course and have got to a problem that I am somewhat solving, but there is probably a better way.I am trying to modify this list:by adding 'The Great ' before each item in the list to get:The books says I am supposed to use a for loop and function to do this, and am supposed to directly modify the list.  I found an ugly solution, but was hoping there was a better way to solve it. Here is what I came up with.Thanks for your help!
Here's how to do this modification to the original list using a function and a traditional  loop. To modify the original list object we can use a slice assignment: . You should not be trying to modify the global  list, you need to work with the  list object that's passed to the  function.outputWe can make the function more compact (and slightly more efficient) by using a list comprehension.
How about this?Output:
You have three requirements: 1) Directly modify the original list, 2) Use a function, and 3) Use a  loop. It's a technicality, but unlike the previous answers the following approach does not create a new list first, choosing instead to update each item in the original list itself. So, here's how you can satisfy all of the requirements:
