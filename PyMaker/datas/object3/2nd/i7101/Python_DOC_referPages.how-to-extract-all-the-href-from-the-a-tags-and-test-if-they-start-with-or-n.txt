I'm using beautifulsoup to extract all the hrefers from the a tags, but some of the hrefers starts like "/videos.com" instead "www.example/videos.com", they haven't the domain. So what I'm trying to do is extracting all the hrefers from the a tags but I want to test if it starts with "/", if so I will add the domain "www.example.com".I wanted something like:How to extract all the hrefs from the a tags and test if they start with '/' or not?I was thinking to use regex, but I'm not sure how to say "if a['href'] starts with regex.
