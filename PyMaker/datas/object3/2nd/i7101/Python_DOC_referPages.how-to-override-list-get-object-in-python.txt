This question already has an answer here:What is the purpose of __str__ and __repr__?                    6 answers                I want to implement a class inherit from built-in class list and override a method, when I get an instance of this class, I can return a custom data, is it possible?Usually when I print an instance of class I will get 'xxx object at 0x0000000002D92358',but if I print an instance of class which inherit from list, I will get a list output, how python do that?
You'll need to teach python how to convert your class into a string.Python's base object has two methods which handle conversion into a string:  and .  In order to get the result you want, you'll need to override them.These two functions serve a similar but not identical purpose. You can find out what the exact difference between them is here. A nice explanation given by Ned Batchelder is:My rule of thumb:  is for developers,  is for customers.In your case however, you don't need to make them different. The unambiguous representation of your custom list class is also the most readable, therefore the two functions can return the same result. Modify your class like so:Note that both functions have to return a string, hence the call to  in the return statement of .
You can modify the representation of an object if you override __repr__(self) method. But it has to return str type.About the difference between  and , there is a great explanation here https://stackoverflow.com/a/2626364/840582
