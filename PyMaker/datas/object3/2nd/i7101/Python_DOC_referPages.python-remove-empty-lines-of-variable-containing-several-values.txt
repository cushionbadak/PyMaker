Good evening community,I'm currently writing a python script which outputs me a variable that contains several values. The name of the variable is 'y'( to be more precisely: I defined y as an array y= []) it gets filled with position data in form of x,y,z coordinates by a function. When i print the variable y the data looks like the following: My question:Is there a way to remove the empy rows between the data rows? In addtion, is it possible to remove the brackets  of the variable y ?Glad for any any help and thank you in advance 
To remove the brackets you can use list list comprehension. In your case, I would do something like the following.
