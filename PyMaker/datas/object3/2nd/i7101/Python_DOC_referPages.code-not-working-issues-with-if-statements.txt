Natural Text
My code is having issues, it is suppose to print either "You have a rare surname!" or a very rare one if you have q or Q in the typed string And if not it will print no q's, but it does not print no q's.Here my not working code:
Your condition  makes no sense, you are testing if  is in  but at the same time defining  as part of , it makes no sense.Also, your other conditions are pretty bad too, you test if the first letter is  and then if that's true you test if it's actually .Your entire program can be written as If you do not understand any of the conditions that I used I highly recommend you go back and relearn basic python syntax for conditions so you can write it better next time
Another way to simplify your code would would be to just use  to convert the string to lowercase and use a string slice to check the string without the first character: Try it out here!
