Can someone explain this to me?When you import  what actually does this mean (Dot Notation)?I know that you can import  but when you import  what actually is this? Is it a class inside a class?I am new in python and dot notation confuse me sometimes..!
When you're putting that dot in your imports, you're referring to something inside the package/file you're importing from.what you import can be a class, package or a file, each time you put a dot you ask something that is inside the instance before it.for example you have this, when you pass  you're actually importing another python module that may contain classes and variables, so to refer to a specific variable or class inside that file you do  for example.this may go further, import a packaging inside another package or a class inside a file inside a package etc (like )For more info read Python documentation about this.
 imports  into the namespace , you can access it by  .  Be aware that this only works if  is a module. (e.g.  in Python 3) however imports  into the current namespace, accessible by . This works for classes, functions etc.Be careful when using from - import:Both statements import the function  into the current namespace, however, the second import statement overrides the first one.
