I have a part in my program that requires working with directories.My current code is:Variable path prints: 'C:Users\\name\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup'.My question is how can I make var path print 'C:Users/name/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Windows/Start Menu/Programs/Startup'
As suggested in the comments the system does it. You are better off changing  or  but however you can do this.But you can simply use this though,Well both are the same as mentioned in the comments!. Also  does not depend upon  or  so changing them doesn't prove any effect.
Use the  method of strings
You can replace '\\' with '/'
