The objective of my problem is to read in a thread post such as this:]))And create a definition to output this:Where the list is sorted from highest upvotes to lowest upvotes, with ties broken alphabetically.However, when I was given this thread:]))Where the author posts multiple times, my program outputs:My program prints each individual post rather than combining the results like this:Just to clarify, if the thread was:]))It should input:My code for this is here:I know I code slightly un-pythonic/ hard to read. Sorry for the inconvenience.Thank you!
I do not understand what you are asking, because the logic isn't very clear. However, the aggregation can be done like so:Related:Group by and aggregate the values of a list of dictionaries in Python
This might work, it ignores content (can be added as well if needed), only takes upvotes and author. It also uses a dictionary and not a list:Outputs:And:For the 2nd example.
This code works, hopefully it is readable enough so you can adapt itThis will return a dict without duplicate authors and won't update the score if it is already there.I tried it on your data and it workedd  {'Mr. Sinister': {'content': "I'm thinking 9 pm?", 'upvotes': 2, 'author': 'Mr. Sinister'}}
