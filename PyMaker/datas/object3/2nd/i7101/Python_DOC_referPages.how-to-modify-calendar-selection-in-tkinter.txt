I have this wonderful Tkinter code that lets me select dates from a calendar widget and display the datetime text in a second Frame, I'd really like for the user to have edit capability in that second frame so they can modify the Hour, Minute, second of the selection.See the Calendar Widget Screen Shot I've tried tkinter.Entry() but I cant seem to tie that back to the calendar for auto updates..See code Below:
Since you didn't specify, I'm assuming you're using the code from http://svn.python.org/projects/sandbox/trunk/ttk-gsoc/samples/ttkcalendar.py since everything seems to match.Instead of using the  widget, use an  widget and bind a  event or a  event depending on if you want to check when the user unfocused the element, or after each time the text is updated.Inside the listener function, get a  from the text that will be used to set the calendar's date.Once you have a , set the 's selection and update the display to show the correct date.I already made all the code you'll need below:All you gotta do is replace your  for  with that code. (Keep the  of course but that's it)Keep in mind you'll have to put a date in the form  (e.g. ). You can change the format on the fourth line where it says  (documentation for the syntax here). Also, this code requires the  module to be imported to create dates.EDIT:You'll also need to change the  method to:That's if you want the text to change even when the user clicks on the calendar
