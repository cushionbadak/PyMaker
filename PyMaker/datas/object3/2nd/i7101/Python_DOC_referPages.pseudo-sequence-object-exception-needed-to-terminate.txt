I lived with the assumption, that defining the  and  methods are sufficient for a class, so its instances can be iterated over via a , until it got violated an example. My original code is quite different, but this shows the problem nicely entering an endless loop: I could not find a specific reference to the requirements for terminating an iteration loop, but it seems that an exception like an IndexError or StopIteration is necessary for termination, if one does not want to comply to full Iterator protocol. Is that correct and where to find it documented?
AnswerYes, an IndexError is required to terminate.  DocumentationSee the documentation for __getitem__() which has the note:Note for loops expect that an IndexError will be raised for illegal  indexes to allow proper detection of the end of the sequence.Underlying source codeThe logic for creating an iterator is in Objects/iterobject.c:Worked out exampleTo fix the OP's code, only two lines need to be added to the beginning of the __getitem__() method:This outputs a finite sequence:
Just implementing the  method python will try to acces all indexes from  to , so if you dont specify when to stop it will keep calling the method.Just check if the index value is higher than the size for example:Here you have a live example
