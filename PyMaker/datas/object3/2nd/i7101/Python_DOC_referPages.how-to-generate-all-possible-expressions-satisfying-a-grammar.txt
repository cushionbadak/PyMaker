I have a grammar for my application with following expressions:Items in round brackets "()" - required, items in square brackets are optional, words without brackets are required.Simple expressions for me would be:FIND an ITEM at DESKFIND an ITEM in DESK  Lookup the ITEM in NEST SEARCH for ITEM at SHELFIs there any parsing methods or libraries I can use to generate all possible combinations? 
Sjoerd's answer points to exrex. Since your expression can be written as a regex this library will do it.
