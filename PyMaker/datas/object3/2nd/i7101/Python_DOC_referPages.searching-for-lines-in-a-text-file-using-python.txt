Natural Text
I am trying to search string in a txt file. Here is a sample txt file. I am working with:I am trying to match the lines in the file and if a match is found then exit the program if a match is not found then add the line to the file:I have the following code that I am working with: my issue is it works correctly if I try to match "abc" in the file, but say if I try to match "pqr" I see my second if block is also executed.Following is the code I have so far.Following is the output i get if i try to match say "123" from the file:
IIUC, you want the second block to execute only if the data does not exist. Well, try this:You can take advantage of the  syntax. The  is executed if the loop does not , i.e., if the data does not exist in the file.
The problem with your code is that if the  is not found in iteration your 2nd if condition prints  even if it exists in the subsequent iteration, only the the first data  will give desired result as the iteration starts from there.One good solution is already given by @COLDSPEED .Another basic approach could be this:It will iterate through the whole data and if the  is found it will set the  to be 1 and will break, else it will set the  to be 0 and will print Hope this help :)
