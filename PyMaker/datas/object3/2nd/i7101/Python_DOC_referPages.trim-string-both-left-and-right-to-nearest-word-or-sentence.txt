Natural Text
I'm writing a function that finds a string near a identical string(s) in a larger piece of text. So far so good, just not pretty. I'm having trouble trimming the resulting string to the nearest sentence/whole word, without leaving any characters hanging over. The trim distance is based on a number of words either side of the keyword.what I've got so far is based on character, not word distance.However a regex could split it to the nearest whole word or sentence. Is that the most Pythonic way to achieve this? This is what I've got so far:Thank you.
You can use this regex to match up to N non-whitespace substring on either side of :2 words:RegEx Breakup:RegEx Demo1 word regex:
You can do this without  if you ignore the punctuation:
Using the  function from this answer, here's one approach which just takes all the n-grams and then chooses the ones with  in the middle:
1 is a tool that probes neighboring elements.CodeThe OP may adjust the final output of these results as desired.DetailsThe given string has been split into an iterable of . A a simple predicate2 was defined, returning  if the keyword (or a keyword with a trailing period) is found in the iterable.A list of  tuples are returned from the  tool:OutputThe first index is  for any valid occurences of keywords and neighboring words with a distance of 1.  We use this boolean and  to find and group together consecutive, neighboring items.  For example:OutputFinally, we apply a condition to filter the  groups and join the strings together.Ouput1 is a third-party library that implements many useful tools including the itertools recipes.2Note, stronger predicates can certainly be made for keywords with any punctuation, but this one was used for simplicity.
