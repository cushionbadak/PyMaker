I am trying to create a class and I can't seem to get it to work?  I'm fairly new to Python, so any assistance would be appreciated.  Also, not sure if this is the most efficient way to create and use an object. I am trying to build a well model and this is one piece of that model, once I get this simple issue figured out the rest should be fairly easy. Thanks.Traceback (most recent call last):   File "u:\Development\Python  Scripts\HCP\CUC Export Files 8_7_17\Well_Model.py", line 71, in        class DP:   File "u:\Development\Python Scripts\HCP\CUC Export Files 8_7_17\Well_Model.py", line 108, in DP      DP_Table = get_DP_Data(id)    File "u:\Development\Python Scripts\HCP\CUC Export Files 8_7_17\Well_Model.py", line 104, in  get_DP_Data      mud_Data = WV_Read_Query(DP_Query) NameError: name 'WV_Read_Query' is not defined
If you are defining non-static, non-class methods within a function, the first argument is always an instance of that class. We usually call this argument :And, Furthermore, you call a these methods on the object :You might wonder why the function is defined with 2 arguments, but only 1 passed to. That's because the instance is implicitly passed as the first parameter, automatically.This is equivalent to  Where you call the method on the class, but explicitly pass the instance to it. Further reading:Python What is the difference between class and instance methods? 
You need to access it with . So You also need to add  to several of your methods. The class instance will always be the first parameter in a method unless you define it as a staticmethod using the decorator .
