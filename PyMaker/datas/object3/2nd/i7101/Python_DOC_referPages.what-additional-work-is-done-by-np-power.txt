Natural Text
I realised that  is slower than :The results are the same (with a few numerical errors of order 1e-16). What additional work is done in ? Furthermore, how can I find an answer to these kind of questions myself?
Under the hood both expressions call the respective C functions  or  and  and running a profiling on those in C++, without any numpy code, gives:This is consistent with the numpy timings. It thus seems like the primary difference is that the C function  is slower than . Why? It seems that part of the reson is that the expressions are not equivalent for all input. For example, with negative  and integer ,  works while  fails:Another example is :Hence, the  trick only works on a subset of inputs, while  works on all (valid) inputs.In addition to this,  is guaranteed to give full precision according to the IEEE 754 standard, while  may suffer from rounding errors.
