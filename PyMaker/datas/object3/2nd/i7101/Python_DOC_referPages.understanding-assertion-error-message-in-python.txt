I'm using unittest for some testing in Python. I have a simple test: that really just checks the equality of two strings. When I run it I get an , which is fine, but I'm not sure what the +/- below it mean. Example: (The first part to the left of the != is the actual output, the second part to the right of the != is the expected). Can anyone help me understand how to read the +/-? Thanks
It is a line difference comparison of the two strings to change the left hand side to the right hand side.   means you have to add the line  and  means to remove the lines  and .Since the left side only contains the two lines removed, and the right side only contains the one line added, that should make sense.  In this case a difference isn't very useful, but if the lines had more in common the difference would help narrow down the reason for the failure.
