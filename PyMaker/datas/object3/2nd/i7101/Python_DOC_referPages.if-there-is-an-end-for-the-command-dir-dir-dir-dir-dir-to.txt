Every object has a  attribute, will the command stop if extra  references are appended?and,will it stop when enough '.dir' are appended?
You are taking the  of the  attribute, which is a  object, which has a  attribute. So yes, you can chain those  attribute lookups endlessly, because the result will always be the same; a bound method object:Every object in Python has a  attribute, it is always a callable.Note: the way you strung the attribute lookups keeps a chain of bound method objects alive, so you will eventually run out of memory; each  method wrapper references the preceding one in their  attribute.
