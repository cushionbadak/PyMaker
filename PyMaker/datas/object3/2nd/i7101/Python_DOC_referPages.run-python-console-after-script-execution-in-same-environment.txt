Is there a way to execute a Python script, yet stay in the Python shell thereafter, so that variable values could be inspected and such?
For those who use IPython you can use the  function for some extra flexibility since it allows you to drop into a shell anywhere in your program:
Metaphox nailed it:I think you are looking for python -i ./file.py, where the -i flag  will enter interactive mode after executing the file. If you are  already in the console, then execfile. â€“ Metaphox 2 mins agoBut I want to thank for the other suggestions as well, which go beyond the original question yet are useful!
