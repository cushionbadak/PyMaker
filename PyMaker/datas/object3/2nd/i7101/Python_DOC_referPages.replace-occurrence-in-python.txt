Natural Text
I have a string and this string could contain some occurrences like:What is the right way to replace, when it's present, this kind of occurrence by What is really important, is to replace only occurrences beginning by  and which ending by ,  and  by the  HTML tag.So if among all the text there is a URL link of any images, it's formatted by a HTML tag to display the image.
Pretty straightforward with regex: matches everything that starts with  or  and ending with ,  or .  here the  refers to the first (and only) capture group in the previous regex (which contains the image url).
This is a simple answer to your question:This includes "http" and "https" site verification, as well as code working for 3 character image extensions, such as you asked: jpg, gif and png.Hope it helped.Feel free to ask if you have any question.Edit: Didn't notice you had not the urls already in a data structure, so this is invalid to your situation
