I have this very basic test code:The  route initialy works until I reload the page, than it either takes very long (60s+) or does not work at all. Sometimes when I reload the app again, I recive the request which was pending before. Reloading the react app sometimes resolvs the problem and sometimes "causes" the problem again, I haven't really found any rule to when it breaks / works... But in order to have it "work" again, I always have to wait about 1-2 mins or restart the computer. It seems like the error gets "cached" somehow.As you can probably tell, I have quite a hard time to pin point the issue to a specific area or even clearly describe and produce the error at any time.Here is what I have tried:Serving the react-app as shown in the code but using a test node.jsAPI => everything works as expected, no issuesServing the react-app via node.js but using the shown python code for the api. It works if I remove the  part. Otherwise I get the described errorReact App and API served via node.js => everything works fineTrying to serve the API and the react app with Flask, but with two different python files and on two different ports => Same issue as if I would use one python fileAny suggestions what else I could try to further pin down the error source?EDIT: When clearning the cookies (e.g. with the "clear cache" app for chrome), the currently pending request magicly comes through... so could this actually be a issue with the react app?
By default,  runs a primitive socket server that does not support concurrent requests. This can often cause apparent lock-ups like this.Use  with a  argument to make it use a thread per request, which can make it more robust in the face of concurrent requests.
