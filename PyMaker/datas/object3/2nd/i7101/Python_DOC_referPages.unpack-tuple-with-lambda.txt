I'm trying to compile my code into a Python 3 module. It runs fine when I choose "Run module" in IDLE, but receive the following syntax error when I try to create a distribution:Can anyone help point out what is wrong with the syntax? Here is the complete code:
PEP 3113 explains why this feature, "tuple parameter unpacking", was removed in Python 3. It also explains how to port code that uses them. In this case you'd need to change a function like:to a version which passes the tuple as a single parameter and unpacks it manually:For a  function, you can't use assignment to unpack. The best solution there is usually to not unpack. For example, change this:… to this:For complicated functions, this can get ugly—but then for complicated functions, you probably want to  them anyway.It's worth noting that running your code through , , or  will find this problem in both  and , and suggest exactly these solutions:If you're trying to port Python 2.x code to 3.x (or to dual-version code) and don't know both languages, you almost certainly want to use one of these tools—or an IDE plugin that wraps them—to help. (Although you may not want to use its output as-is.)
