Natural Text
This question already has an answer here:Learning Regular Expressions [closed]                    1 answer                For example, I have 3 sentences like at below where 1 sentence in the middle contains citation mark . The citation is always in bracket with this format: (~string~comma(,)~space~number~)He lives in Nidarvoll and tonight i must reach a train to Oslo at 6 oclock. The system, called BusTUC is built upon the classical system CHAT-80 (Warren and Pereira, 1982). CHAT-80 was a state of the art natural language system that was   impressive on its own merits.I'm using Regex to extract only the middle sentence but it keeps print all the 3 sentences.The result should be like this:The system, called BusTUC is built upon the classical system CHAT-80 (Warren and Pereira, 1982).
The setup... 2 sentences representing the cases of interest:First, to match  in the case where the citation is at the end of a sentence:To match when the citation is not at the end of a sentence:Combining both cases with the `|' regex operator:Running:In both cases you get the sentence with the citation.A good resource is the python regular expressions documentation and the accompanying regex howto page.Cheers
You can split the text into a list of sentences and then pick the ones that end with ")".
