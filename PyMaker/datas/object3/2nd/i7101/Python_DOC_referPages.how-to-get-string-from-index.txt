Instead of using , you can just parse your  to And I will use  method, which simply takes a string and splits it by a given separator.And after running this code:And I think  is redundant for this piece of code. usage explanation:When we enter  for our  variable, it's value is simply the string .When we do  on it, it creates a list with our values, separated by .So after doing split, we have .
