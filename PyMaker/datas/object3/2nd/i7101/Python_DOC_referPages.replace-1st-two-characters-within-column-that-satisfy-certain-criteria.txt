i am looking into converting the following data from Month_Day within tmaxmin into 'Jan-01', 'Feb-15' etc...Month_Day max min001-01 243 86 101-02 230 90 201-03 233 104 301-04 220 73 401-05 224 71 though i know it is stupid to do replacement like this, may i know if there is any faster way to do so?
