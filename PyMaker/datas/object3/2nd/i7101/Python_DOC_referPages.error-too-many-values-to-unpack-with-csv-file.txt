my program shown below has the goal of outputting statements based off two criteria:( and ) Once that was accomplished, my next goal is to match  with  and  with .  and  are both input statements. The output should be a statement that outputs values from that row. For some reason, I always receive an error about too many values to unpack. My excel sheet is posted if anyone wants a better idea of what I am talking about. Anyway I tried everything but nothing was working for me.
Have you considered using a DictReader? That variable unpacking does seem like a bit of a code smell, and would be much more subject to errors, as opposed to just loading the entire row into a dictionary.
