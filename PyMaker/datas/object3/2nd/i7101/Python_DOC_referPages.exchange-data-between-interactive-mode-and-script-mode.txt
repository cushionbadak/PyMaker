Suppose to run a block of code in script_mode and produce such data:Now I switch to work in console for  debugging the code.I need to use the data produced just now, while cannot copy directly for avoiding the effect of gibberish. My solution is to pickle first in the script_mode and unpickle it in interactive_mode:Codes with 5 commands:Script ModeInteractive_mode:How to do it in less steps?
You can run the file with the  option, like .This will run your file first, then open an interactive shell with all of the variables present and ready for use.
If, in your  directory, you have the script  like this:If you want to debug your script in a Python 2 interactive shell, you can do:Or, with the Python 2+3 way:The built-in function  supports dynamic execution of Python code.The built-in function  returns the current global dictionary.That way you can access to your data:
Personally, I would use IPython, just:Then anywhere you want to drop into a console, simplyat the top of the file and use:where you'd like to drop in.You can type "whos" once you're in for a list of variables alongside their type and values.  It's pretty useful, but yeah, this should work for you. IPython is a solid python shell.You can also use ipdb if you're more used to the standard pdb.  It's really good too.
