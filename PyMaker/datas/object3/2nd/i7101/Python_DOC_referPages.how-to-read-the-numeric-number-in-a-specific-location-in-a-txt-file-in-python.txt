You want to use the linecache module.Then write it to another file.Assuming you want to extract just the number portion of the line:
Cory Madden's answer will work, but if you didn't know what number the line you're looking for is on you could do something like:
This will work. I have already tested it. For explanation for Regex , this should help.
Thank God for your question, you will basically use a for loop to loop through the lines in the file and add each line to a list. So that at anytime you can call the list with the line number you want and that particular line will be delivered to you. You then save it in a variable and then apply regular expression(regex) on it, to get only the floating numbers.example txt file:then in your python fileHere is a book on python that you will like very much - (dive into python3) search for it
