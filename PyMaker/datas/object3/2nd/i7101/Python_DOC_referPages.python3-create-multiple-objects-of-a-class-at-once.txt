i want to create multiple objects with diferent names at once.For example And i need to create n objects when the program first runIs there a way to do this in python3? All the things i've tried just create one object and change its name or overwhite the objects information o simply fails at running. I can't use exec() or eval()ThanksExtra:I need the thing before because i need to store n Client's information whenever i run the program to work with it (that info is stored in a .csv file). Do i need to do the thing i mentioned before or is there another way to deal with this kind of data management?
You can create a list of Cars objects, by list comprehensionreturn function in Car Class creates a "more readable" (and parseable) representation of Car object instead of ""
