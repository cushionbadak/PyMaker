I'm having issues calling functions from the command line with argparse. I just want it to execute one of the functions defined in the script.When I try to call it with an argument I get:error the follow arguments are required: iNo matter what argument is passed.
A couple of problems here:You can't use  to call a defined function directly. However, you can set it to a boolean variable value using  and then define your logic what to do when that variable is true (or false)Your functions have to be defined before you call them in the script.This is what ended up working for me:Also, make sure to prefix the abbreviated argument name with  and the full name with .
