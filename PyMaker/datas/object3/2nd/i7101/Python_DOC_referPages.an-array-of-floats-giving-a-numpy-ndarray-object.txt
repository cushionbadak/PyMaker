This is a followup question from the one I posted a few minutes ago. The problem I was having with multiplying int with float is fixed, thanks to user2357112 in the comments. However, it's come across another roadblock.Code:Code in ideone: http://ideone.com/DO1otSError:I am confused about why  was recognized as a  object. I thought that, since  is a 1-dimensional array,  will therefore return the value (a ) within that array at index . I'm not sure why that is not the case. Thank you in advance!
This is the answer to your question "I am confused about why final[i] was recognized as a numpy.ndarray object." In the following snippet of codeI skipped non-essential code. The code above shows that  is a  and  is a list. Then  is a product of a  and a list. The result of this product is a .What is also important is that  is an array of floats. Therefore  is also an array of floats and not fraction objects. Therefore you cannot call  on elements of .In addition, code such as:looks quite suspicious.
