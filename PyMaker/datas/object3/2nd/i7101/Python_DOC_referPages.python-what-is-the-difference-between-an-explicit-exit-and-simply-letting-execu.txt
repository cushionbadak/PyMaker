For a simple python script that doesn't start any threads or fork any processes, what's the difference between simply letting execution reach the end of the script and explicitly calling quit(), exit(), or sys.exit()?i.e. what's the difference betweenandI'm asking this because I have been having some odd garbage collection issues on script termination (exceptions raised from  apparently due to the order in which things get cleaned up) without the explicit  call, and adding an explicit  appears to correct those issues.  Or at least none of those exceptions get printed after calling , maybe they are simply being silenced.
