I convert  [int, bool ,float] to ['int', 'bool','float'] using many lines of command.How to accomplish such a task in an elegant manner?
You want the  attribute.As an aside, if you are interested in performing introspection on Python data structures, use . For example,  will return a list of all attributes and callable methods you can use on the  type.
you can find available modules for variables and function using 
There may be a more pythonic way to do this but a 1-liner that works for these types is:Btw you can find out attributes an object has using For example:
Here you gosee : https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#special-attributes and https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions for further explanation.
