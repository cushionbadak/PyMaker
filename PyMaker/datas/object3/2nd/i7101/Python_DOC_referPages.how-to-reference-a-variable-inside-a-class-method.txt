Was hoping someone could help me in trying to print a class method's variable. As show below in my code, I want to print variable A of the method "on_status", which is part of my class MyStreamListener. Is this possible? Bit of a noob question...appreciate any insight. Thank you!
Firstly, you should not describe your class's ordinary methods as "class methods". In Python, as "class method" is a method that is called on a class, rather than on an object of a class. Such methods are defined using the  decorator, and take as their first parameter the class (named  by convention) rather than an object (named  by convention). (So a  class method could be called as either , or as , where  is an object of type .)Secondly, if you assign a variable  within a method, that variable belongs to the object, not the method, and can be accessed anywhere where the object is available, as , where  is a variable holding the object. If you're inside a method, then you would use . If you're in client code that has just instantiated your class as , then you would use .Thirdly, if you will be accessing  from outside , where it might not have been initialised yet, you should initialise it with some sensible value in .
