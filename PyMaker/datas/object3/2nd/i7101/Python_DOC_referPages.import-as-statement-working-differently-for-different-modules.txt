I am learning Python, and right now I am learning about the import statements in Python. I was testing out some code, and I came across something unusual. Here is the code I was testing.I learned that in Python, you can reassign the names of modules using , so I reassigned pow to power. I expected both  and  to output the exact same stuff because all I did was change the name. However,  outputs , which is an integer, while  outputs , which is a float. Why is that?Furthermore, I imported the  module as well, and set its name to be . In the case of the pow and power, both the old name, , and the new name, , worked. But with this random module, only the new name, , works, and the old name, , doesn't work.  works, but  doesn't work. Why is this so?Can anyone please explain to a Python newbie such as myself why my code is not working the way I expect it to? I am using Python version 3.62, if that helps.
That's because when you import  from math as  and then you call , the  you are calling is a built-in function, not the  from the math module.For  there is no built-in function in python so you only import the  one.The pow built-in function documentation
when you use pow you are actually using the inbuilt pow function.but there is no inbuilt function called random thus it does not work normally in python if you use 'as' you can only use the module what you imported it as not what it was originally called
