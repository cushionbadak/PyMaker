Given a string with numbers:The goal is to convert the numbers to the  symbol where the  denotes the order by which the number occurs. E.g. given the above intpu the desired output is: Even if are repeated numbers, e.g. given the inputthe desired output keeps the order of the number ignoring the value of the number itself e.g.:I've tried:But it simply replaced the outputs with the same  symbol without keeping the order, i.e. [out]:I could do a post  operation and replace each , i.e. [out]:Is a better way to achieve the desired output without first a generic  and then a post-hoc string editing? 
Use  as a default argument to the function passed to .Note that I am using a simplified regex for matching number just to demonstrate how to get the count, you could replace it with regex that matches floats as well.
