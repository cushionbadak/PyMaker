This question already has an answer here:How can I import from another ipython-notebook?                    4 answers                I have a file called orbital.ipynb (in jupyter notebooks) . I'm currently working on a new file called OrbitalStockSelector , and I'd like to import the orbital.ipynb file to the new file.I've tried changing the extension to .py , using import_module(orbital) but have not been able to succeed. I get: 
 files are not valid python modules.  They use a custom format to store the code and output.  To use your code, you would need to move it to a valid  file that is importable
