in my program (that searches for specific keys) i want to implement that it terminates if the key has more than one value. How can i check a key for multiple values?edit: thanks for clearing up my mistake.It seems my values are lists. In that case how can i check for multiple items in the list that is my value?
It is not possible for a dictionary key to have more than one value: either the key is not present in the dictionary, so it has no value, or it is present, and it has one value.That value may be a tuple, list, dictionary, etc., which contains multiple values, but it is still one value itself. The value may also be  which can be a marker for no value, but it is still a value.As @Ulisha's comment said, if you try to assign a new value to a key, the new value will just replace the old value. Again, there can be at most one value for a given key, although there are ways to simulate multiple values by using container objects such a tuple, list, or dict.If you are looking at a specific item and you want to test if it is a list, you can useThis will also catch items that have a type that descends from list, such as a priority queue. If you want to expand that to also detect tuples, dicts, sets, and most other "containers", you can useFor this you will, of course, need to import the  module.Remember that even if the item is a list, it may have no, one, or multiple items.
Using the  builtin in python, you can check the length of a list. If the length of the value is more then 1 then there are more then one value in the list.Note that this assumes that every value in the dictionary is a list or container.
