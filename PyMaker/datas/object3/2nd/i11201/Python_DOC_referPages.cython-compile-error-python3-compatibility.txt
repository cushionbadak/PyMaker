I am running  on . My Cython's version is . I'm trying to embed some very trivial Cython code  into C code . The problem is, if I use  then everything works well (Python 2.7 is the built-in version on OS X). However if I use  the following errors raised:I have to use Python3 since all my other codes are written in it. Please help me solve this problem. The following are my source files:::And Compiling those two files using following :The following is the command I compile those c files:Update:I changed the  to  as Jim suggested. The code compiles successfully. However when I run  the following errors occured:UpdateI solved this by adding the following line before  in my  code:
This is probably due to the fact that in Python  initialization of modules is not performed by calling  but rather with  (See ). So, if you are linking with Python  and executing via  you need to change the initialization call. In short, changing the call that initializes the module from:To:and recompiling, should do the trick. As for your second problem, an alternate solution other than using  is setting  to the output of  (or ) prior to compilation.
