Is there a way to add an argument to ArgumentParser for an np.array instead of a list?I know I can do something like thisBut I would like to specify the complete description of the arguments before parsing.Is there a way to do this?
To specify a slight change in how the  action handler works you would create a subclass of the handler with appropriate change (the docs have an example right above this section)
As indicated in my comment, 'complete description before parsing' is unclear.But it occurred to me that it is possible to create a 2d array with .  I can use  to specify 3 columns, and  to collect the input in multiple sublists.  And of course  specifies whether it int or float.It will complain if I don't have the right number of columns.  All it doesn't control is the number of rows; but I can easily check the shape of  the array after creation.With this  it doesn't make sense to create the array in the .  And even with the 1d input, there isn't much of an advantage to performing that  call during parsing.  Massaging (and testing) the  values after parsing is perfectly good practice.It  would better, though to put the array values in a CSV file, and specify the name of that file via .   really isn't meant for input of a large number of values.  It's not a general purpose file parser.  The command line controls the behavior of your code.
