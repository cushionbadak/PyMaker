I have been looking at various open source GitHub Python projects like,  and TheanoWhat I am not able to figure out is where their starting points are, so that I can debug them gracefully. Do I need to look in each and every file for the  method? I am from Android background; so I was searching something related like  from where I can get an idea as where the code is getting started, but I was unsuccessful in my attempts.
There are two ways a Python script can be loaded:By import : By commandline : In both cases all code inside the script is executedUsually  defines the entry  point :  In a git project, you can try this to find all scripts made to be launched from command-line : Note that the project you mentioned, doesn't contain any explicitly defined entry point, instead the entry point script is generated at packaging time for distribution (see  for this purpose)
The Python equivalent of a manifest file is generally , so this is a good place to start looking. A package can:define scripts that should be installed, using the  keyword (as Theano does); or use the  keyword to define a function that should be exposed to the command line (as  does, pointing to the  function).If neither of these is provided, the package is probably designed to be ed rather than executed, in which case take a look at the usage examples along with the root  (e.g. Theano's), which will probably tell you what objects are exposed to the outside world. See the Python docs for more information on module structure.However, Python is a dynamic, flexible language so there's no "magic bullet" to tell you where to look; there isn't e.g. a specific  file that must be defined, for example (although there is a  that can be defined, see What is __main__.py?)
