Is there a variable explorer in Jupyter (IPython) like in Spyder? It is very uncomfortable having to print the list of variables all the time each time I run through the test code.Has this feature been implemented yet? If so, how to enable it?
UPDATEScroll down to the section labeled update for a much less convoluted method.OLD ANSWERHere is a notebook on how to make your own Variable Inspector. I think it was written back when jupyter notebook was called ipython notebook but it works on the latest version.I'll post the code below just in case the link breaks.Run inline with the following:Make it a javascript pop out;UPDATEDate: May 17 2017@jfbercher created a nbextension variable inspector. The source code can be seen here jupyter_contrib_nbextensions. For more information see the docs.InstallUserVirtual environmentEnableHere's a screen-shot; 
This might help you, though it's not exactly what Spyder offers and is much simpler:To get a list of all currently defined variables, run who :For more detail, run whos:For a complete list of built-in functions see Magic Commands
If you use Jupyter Notebooks within Jupyter Lab there has been a lot of discussion about implementing a variable explorer/inspector. You can follow the issue hereAs of right now there is one Jupyter Lab extension in the works that implements a Spyder-like variable explorer. It is based on the notebook extension that James mentioned in his answer. You can find the lab extension (with installation instructions) here: https://github.com/lckr/jupyterlab-variableInspector
