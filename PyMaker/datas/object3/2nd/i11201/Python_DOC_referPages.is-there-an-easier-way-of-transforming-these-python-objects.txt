I`d like to transform the following python input:To the following output:The only function I could  think of is the following:I am new to Python and I think this can be done in an easier Pythonic way using list comprehensions. Can anyone please come with a better answer?
First join everything in the input list into one dictionary; that way you can use  to transform all values into rows, and re-combine that with the keys:The  function pairs up elements from the input lists together, producing a tuple with all first elements, then all second, etc. The  in a  call applies all contained sequences (here all lists from the combined dictionary values) as separate arguments, which  then proceeds to pair up. In essence this transposes the rows to column sequences.Those column sequences are then re-combined with the keys (again using  to do the pairing) to form the output dictionaries.Demo:
This is what I came up with. Not very pretty but gets the job done. Also, this requires that the length of the values is always the same and that the first key and value of the dictionary are the wanted param and val.Edit: Ignore this answer. Martijn Pieters answer is way more beautiful and readable!
