I am looking for a pythonic way to iterate through a large number of lists and use the index of repeated values from one list to calculate a total value from the values with the same index in another list.For example, say I have two listsWhat I want to do is find the unique values in a, and then add together the corresponding values from b with the same index. My attempt, which is quite slow, is as follows:and I getPlease let me know if there is a faster, more pythonic way to do this.Thanks
Use the  function and a  dictionary to collect values per unique value: pairs up the values from your two input lists, now all you have to do is sum up each value from  per unique value of .The last line pulls out the keys and values from the resulting dictionary, sorts these, and puts just the keys and just the values into  and , respectively.Demo:If you don't care about output order, you can drop the  call altogether.
