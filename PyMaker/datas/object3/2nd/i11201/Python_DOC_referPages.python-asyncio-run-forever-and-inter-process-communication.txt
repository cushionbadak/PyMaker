What is the most efficient way to achieve the following goal: main process is collecting and distributing events (event loop run_forever) to subprocessess. These subprocesses stay alive and collect signals from outer world or consume signals and perform cpu-bound operations. So far, I came up with something like this:However I have a feeling that the above is not efficient / elegant enough and i'm missing something. Any ideas, suggestions?
As a start, try using a  and  to distribute any CPU bound procedure, otherwise just use regular // from  without any queue.
