I have a list of dicts and I need to access dicts values as attributes.My code:So, when I write something like:It works.But I want to use attributes as  instead of .How to realize that?
As @Tim Castelijns said, that's not how dicts work.The behavior you seek can be achieved by having a  class which holds the  and  as members.You can then do:Furthermore, you can take a look at the Bunch module, which is a dot-accessible dictionary. However if you are using python 3, be aware that it might not work. (at least it didn't for me.)
You can probably use Bunch for this.Bunch is a dictionary that supports attribute-style access, a la JavaScript
Another approach for completeness - use a .
AttrDict used from here.
You can make the comments instances of a dictionary subclass that allows normal access as well as dotted attribute-style access. There are several ways of implementing it, but the following is one of the simplest, which is to make the each instance its own :Note that  dictionaries can be created any of the many ways regular dictionaries can, so in addition to what is shown above, the instances in the  list could have been created like this which uses keywords to define their contents:
