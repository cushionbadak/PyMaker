First let me give some background information that lead to the problem.I had/have two versions of python installed in my Win 8.1 laptop. Originally Py 2.5 was set as the default. The way i did it was that i renamed the   of Python 3.5 as  and the file  as  which seem to have created two  files with the same names to that of the two files (I don't remember whether the two dll files were present before the renaming) and successfully set Python 2.7 as default (i.e. when i typed the command  in the command line, python 2.7 ran). Recently i needed to set Python 3.5 as default. I then proceeded to rename the files of the version  the same way and reverted the file names of the 3.5 version to their original normal formats (i.e.  and ). After all this mayhem, i run  in the IDLE and it springs up the following error:
I was also facing the same problem.This error raised due to naming my file as "collections". That means if you are naming your files as any inbuilt function, keyword, module etc. this error will raise.Solution for this error is, check whether you have created any file by any  inbuilt function, keyword, module etc. If yes then rename the file name which is not related to any python keyword. It will work as expected. 
So i just installed the python 3.5.1 setup again and things are up and running.
