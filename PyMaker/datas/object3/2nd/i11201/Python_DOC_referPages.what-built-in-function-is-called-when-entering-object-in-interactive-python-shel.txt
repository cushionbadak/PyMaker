It's nice to be able to enter an object in the shell, and get something back, e.g.,Usually, using  in a module script will yield the same result, as in the case above (I'm using Python 3.5).  But often, with instances of complex classes, you can get wildly different outputs.This raises the question, what exactly happens when you type an object name and hit enter in the interactive python shell? What built-in is called?Example:In module: Output:tutorial1.h5 (File) 'Test file' Last modif.: 'Wed Jun  8 21:18:10 2016' Object Tree:  / (RootGroup) 'Test file' /detector (Group) 'Detector information' /detector/readout (Table(0,)) 'Readout example'Versus shell output>>>h5file File(filename=tutorial1.h5, title='Test file', mode='w',  root_uep='/', filters=Filters(complevel=0, shuffle=False, fletcher32=False, least_significant_digit=None)) / (RootGroup) 'Test file' /detector (Group) 'Detector information' /detector/readout (Table(0,)) 'Readout example'   description := {   "Country": UInt16Col(shape=(), dflt=0, pos=0),   "Geo": UInt16Col(shape=(), dflt=0, pos=1),   "HsCode": Int8Col(shape=(), dflt=0, pos=2),   "Month": UInt16Col(shape=(), dflt=0, pos=3),   "Quantity": UInt16Col(shape=(), dflt=0, pos=4),
 implicitly applies  to each printed item to obtain a string, while the shell implicitly applies  to obtain a string.  So it's the difference (if any) between an object's  and  methods Note that I'm ignoring the possibility that the shell you use has overridden the default  function.
In the REPL, it's  that's used to give you the representation of an object whereas  gives you the result of the  function, as per the following transcript:
 is the method called in this situation. It returns the "official" (canonical) representation of the object, as opposed to  which is typically less structured.Official Python documentation on repr
Compare  vs :You can create your own custom  and  if you wish:
