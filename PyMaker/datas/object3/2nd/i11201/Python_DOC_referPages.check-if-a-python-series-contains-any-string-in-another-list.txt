I have a series of equal length strings of 24 characters like And I have a list also with equal length strings of 4 characters likeI want to compare each entry in my_list with each block of 4 characters in every entry in my_series and return the my_series items that the list string was found in. For example for the string 'This' in my_list I would want my_series items 1 and 2 returned and for 'XXXX' my_series items 1,2,3 would be returned. 
The following generator will create a 2 dimensional list. Each list will contain any matches, and it's position will match to the my_list index.Output:[['ThisIsASentenceXXXXXXXXX', 'SoIsThisXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'], ['ThisIsASentenceXXXXXXXXX', 'SoIsThisXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX', 'YouGetThePointXXXXXXXXXX'], ['YouGetThePointXXXXXXXXXX']]therefore  contains matches for  etc...I hope this helped you out!
You need to split each entries in the  into 6 chunks:Then you can iterate over this chunks to find the matching items:You'll obtain:
