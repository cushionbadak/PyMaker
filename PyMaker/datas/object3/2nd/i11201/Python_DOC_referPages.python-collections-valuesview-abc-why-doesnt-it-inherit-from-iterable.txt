I was just checking out some docs on ABCs for a project of mine, where I need to do some type-related work. Those are the official docs about the ValuesView type, in both Python 2 and 3:https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.ValuesViewhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.htmland this is the source (Python 2, but same happens in Python 3)https://hg.python.org/releases/2.7.11/file/9213c70c67d2/Lib/_abcoll.py#l479I was very puzzled about the ValuesView interface, because from alogical standpoint it should inherit from Iterable, IMHO (it's evengot the __iter__ Mixin method); on the contrary the docs say that it justinherits from MappingView, which inherits from Sized, which doesn'tinherit from Iterable.So I fired up my 2.7 interpreter:It looks iterable, after all, because of Iterable's own subclasshook.But I don't understand why ValuesView isn't explicitly Iterable. Other ABCs, like Sequence or Set, are explicitly Iterable. Is there some arcane reason behind that, or it's just a documentation+implementation shortcoming for a little-used feature?EDIT:ValuesView works as expected from Python 3.7 onwards. Seems no more than an oversight. 
In Python 3.7.2, it inherits from both MappingView and Collection which in turn inherits from (among others) Iterable. Someone listened to you.
