I have a database on backendless cloud service which has no support for python.So i'm establishing the connection between the python code and the database using php files.The insertion is working fine as there is no response from the php file to the python.However in the retrieving i need the php file to echo the output and the python script to read this echo value. How can i do this?Thanks.
Use the  module to execute the PHP code from python.Assuming that your PHP script write to standard output  would be the easiest, or you could use  if you need better control of the child process.If you are using Python >= 3.5 then you can use .
To read from stdout with python you can use subprocess moduleBut I don't think that this is a good solution to solve your problem. A better solution will be to use php as REST service. And then with python use it as REST.
try to use pipe, for example:that's it, python can get the echo data of php from sys.argv
