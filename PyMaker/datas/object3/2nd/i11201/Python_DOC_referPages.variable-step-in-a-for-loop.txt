I am trying to loop between 0.01 and 10, but between 0.01 and 0.1 use 0.01 as the step, then between 0.1 and 1.0 use 0.1 as step, and between 1.0 and 10.0 use 1.0 as step.I have the while loop code written, but want to make it more pythonic.This will produce 
A special-purse generator function might be the right way to go. This would effectively separate the boring part (getting the list of numbers right) from the interesting part (the  in your example).
One approach would be to use two loops:  one for the order of magnitude, and one for the values from 1 to 9:
You could have a nested loop, the outer one that iterates over the precision and inner one that is just :However floats are probably not going to work in this case as this shows values like  on my machine, for precise decimal values you would want to use the  module:
Just a single line of code through list comprehension - Can't be more pythonic!
I'd recommend a generator function as well, but if the steps are not such convenient powers of each other I'd write it likeIt might be a bit more repetitive, but illustrates much better what is going on and that the yielded values are monotonically increasing (regardless what numbers you put in).If it gets too repetitive, use
You could do something like:Basically you create the entire list of values that you need up front, , then just iterate through them in your  loop.
Just in case you wished to replace the loop with vectorized code...
