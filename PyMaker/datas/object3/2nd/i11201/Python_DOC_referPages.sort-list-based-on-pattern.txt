I'd like to know how I can easily generate a list based on the values/order of two other lists:I'd like to retrieve the "list_b" list ordered by value from "list_a":If an entry exist on list_b but not on list_a, then the value is appended to the list at the end.I'm not sure where to start, my initial thinking was to retrieve all the indexes with enum , then sort the list, but I'm having hard time managing entries with multiples index (eg: web1) . Just wondering if you guys are thinking about an easy way to achieve this ?
An extremely simplistic way would be to just iterate over , and should you find each element in  you remove it and append it to a list. Then after iterating all that remains in  are the elements that you need to add to the end of your list. Outputs:Another trickier way would be to use  and a few list comprehensions, leveraging the set intersection and difference of the counters.
