This question already has an answer here:How to pickle a ssl.SSLContext object                    1 answer                Running Python 3.4.3 on linux.I don't do much pickling, so forgive me if this is well know.I had a bit of a look around the only I found this about pickle in the What's new In Python 3.4 which suggests this should work. Other than that just issues pickling between different python versions.I also tried setting  but this didn't help either.(BTW I've already worked around this issue but I'm curious why it does not work.)
Classes that take extra arguments to  need to provide a  method to tell pickle what the extra arguments are.You can monkey-patch  to add a  method:The new feature of pickle in Python 3.4 is that it also supports a  method that can supply keyword arguments for ; but classes still need to provide  and/or  themselves.
