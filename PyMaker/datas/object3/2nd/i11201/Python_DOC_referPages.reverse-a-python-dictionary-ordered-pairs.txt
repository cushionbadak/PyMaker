This question has been asked many times, and I searched diligently to no avail. Here is an example of my question:The output I am looking for is as below:I am really unsure how to attack this, as here is my current code:What I am currently doing is grabbing the tuple pair as a key/value, as these need to remain the same.

Therefore, your question cannot be answered and you should consider using a different data structure. Perhaps an  which can be reversed:
Firstly, the  object of python is a hashtable, so It have no order.but if you only want to get a list is order you can use  method.
