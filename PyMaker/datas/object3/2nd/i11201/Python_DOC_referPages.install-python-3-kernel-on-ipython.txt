I know the question has been asked in the past but couldnt find a satisfying solution.i want to add a python 3 kernel on ipythonhere the "official" instructions seems quite straightforwardhttps://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/kernel_install.htmlhowever i receive the following error:C:\Users\Vincent>python3 -m pip install ipykernel 'python3' is not  recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or  batch file.This is on a windows system.any idea whats wrong?
Found the solution:windows uses the command py -3 instead of python3 that was suggested in the docs posted above;Sorry if that was abs obvious for all..
