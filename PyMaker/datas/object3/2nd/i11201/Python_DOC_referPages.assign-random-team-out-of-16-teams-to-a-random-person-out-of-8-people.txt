This can be done with Example:The result is a dictionary.If you want to avoid duplicates you have to iterate over the list.
So the thing you're trying to do is just pick random "the length of " elements from . In this case, you should use :From the documentation:Return a  length list of unique elements chosen from the population sequence or set. Used for random sampling without replacement.Returns a new list containing elements from the population while leaving the original population unchanged. The resulting list is in selection order so that all sub-slices will also be valid random samples. This allows raffle winners (the sample) to be partitioned into grand prize and second place winners (the subslices).If you want to assign two teams per person, I'd suggest you  the  list, then split the list into 2 sized chunks, and put the result into a dictionary:
Use . In your case, you could have the following: will be a list of tuples of a name and a team.
This creates a dictionary with names attached to teams, without duplicates
