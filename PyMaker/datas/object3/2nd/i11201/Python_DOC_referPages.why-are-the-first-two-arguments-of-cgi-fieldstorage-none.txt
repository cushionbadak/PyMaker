In a Python CGI environment, I used the following code to print values from a GET/POST request:The output is:Here, I supplied the  parameter with a value of , and I got it as expected.But why are the first two values ?  What are they used for, and what do they hold?
According to the source of the  module, the  method is:Both  and  are optional values.  For , the are set automatically from the  header, if any. seems to be used as the key for this  when using the -style methods like  and . is used by CGI scripts that accept file uploads.If you get a  ("for use when no file uploads are possible"), it's  is just:Same as above, minus the  field.  Unlike , it takes the value of  in  and does nothing with it except repeat it in .  (It's probably also used as a dictionary key... somewhere.)The doc-strings for these two classes are, frankly, much better than what you can find in the  module's official docs.  (Also, the  class does a lot of different things, making it hard to describe in words.)
