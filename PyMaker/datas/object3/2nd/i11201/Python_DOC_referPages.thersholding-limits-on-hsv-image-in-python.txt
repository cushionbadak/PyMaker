I have read an image and I have converted the image to HSV image. I want to apply threshold limits for hue, saturation , and value components separately.Hue thershold 0 to 1, saturation thershold 0.28 to 1 and value thershold 0 to 0.55I want to this application for color masking ! how to apply these limits on my image files.I have done the same in Matlab, I have taken only the pixels of my interest in each band and then merged these back to get the pixels of my interest.Here is my matlab code snippet , which I want to do the same in python.
In python you can write it very similar to matlab. It is usually a good idea to create a function for methods that you might use more than once, but feel free of removing the function declaration if it doesn't suit your needs.And then you can call the function with your data as:As you can see, the syntax is pretty similar (if not identical) to that of the matlab. This holds as long as your  is a numpy array, which is what OpenCV generates in python.
To select values that satisfy your limits (and discard the ones not in the limits), use list comprehensions: is a function that checks whether the passed hue, saturation and value are in the required limits. You can unwrap the above list comprehension to a  loop to if you wish.To limit all values to the given limits, use the  builtin:
