It seems as though it would always make more sense to use the default action of  without specifying  so the output is always as expected, instead of sometimes being a  and sometimes not. I'm just curious if I missed something..example
Both the default  and  expect one value, but  will put it in a list, e.g. will require 3 values, and put them in a list as well.   and  also put the values in a list.From the docs, under :https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#nargsNote that nargs=1 produces a list of one item. This is different from the default, in which the item is produced by itself. is just an instance of .  It's not a special case.For you, as an  user, you probably don't need to use .  In fact to me it's a sign of a novice - unless there's a clear need for the list in the output.  I can imagine, for example, building a parser that programmatically sets  to some number, may be 3, maybe 5, maybe 1, and expects the result to always be a list.
The case for nargs=1 for me is that I can use it with the "append" action, then if I want to use the option once, I get a list of one item, if I use it twice, I get a list of two items, etc.
