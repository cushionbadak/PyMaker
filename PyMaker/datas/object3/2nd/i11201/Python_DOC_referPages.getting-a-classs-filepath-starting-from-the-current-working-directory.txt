This question already has an answer here:Python: Compute relative path from one directory to another [duplicate]                    3 answers                I am trying to print the path to a file. I want the full path from the current working directory to the file.I am using the  module to find the path to my file. However this will give me the full path which is not what I'm looking for.Now for the filename itself I can use . But this will give me just the filename which is also not what I want.It would be relatively easy to use the  in combination with  to get the path I am looking for. This will give me the result I am looking for.I am wondering if there is a better/easier way to do this?
I think os.path.relpath() does what you want it to.Example:
