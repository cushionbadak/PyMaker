I am trying to unit test a piece of code:by using mock_open like so:The problem I am running into is that I do not get any data when running csv.reader. If I run results_file.readlines() I get 'test, test2, test3, test4' which means that mock_open is working properly. But when I run csv.reader(results_file) I lose all the data.
This is because  doesn't implement every feature that a file has, and notably not some of the ones that  needs. implements the methods ,  and , and works both as a function and when called as a context manager (https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#mock-open), whereas  works with…any object which supports the iterator protocol and returns a string each time its  method is called — file objects and list objects are both suitable— https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.readerNote that  doesn't implement the  method, and doesn't raise  when the end is reached, so it won't work with .The solution, as @Emily points out in her answer, is to turn the file into a list of its lines. This is possible because  implements , and the resulting list is suitable for reading into  as the documentation says.
This really got me too, and was a nightmare to pinpoint.  To use your example code, this worksand this worksbut this doesn't workusing Python 3.4.It seems counter to the documented interface of  so maybe an expert can elaborate on why.
