I am facing trouble while converting string into dateobject in python. I want to convert string '10 JAN 2016" to dateobject so that i can compare it to the present date and get the time difference. I tired but i am getting formatting error.What is the solution to this problem?
Use the  module.Use  objects for comparison.You can look up the documentation about the formats (%d, %m, etc.) here
You need to use a valid format.Try looking here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior
