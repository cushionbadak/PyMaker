i am trying to make a tracking program that takes an image and displays where the the object with the specified color is: example: https://imgur.com/a/8LR40to do this i am using RGB right now but it is realy hard to work with it so i want to convert it into a hue so it is easier to work with. i am trying to use colorsys but after doing some research i have no idea what parameters it wants in and what it gives. i have tried to get a match using colorizer.org but i get some nonsence.alredy the colorsys is not acting as documented because at https://docs.python.org/2/library/colorsys.html it says that the output is always a float between 0 and 1, but the value is 201. that also is impossible as in standard HSV the value is between 0 and 100.my questions are:what does colorsys expect as an input?how do i convert the output to standard HSV? (Hue = 0-360, saturation = 0-100, value = 0-100)
Coordinates in all of these color spaces are floating point values. In the YIQ space, the Y coordinate is between 0 and 1, but the I and Q coordinates can be positive or negative. In all other spaces, the coordinates are all between 0 and 1.https://docs.python.org/3/library/colorsys.htmlYou must scale from 0 - 255 to 0 - 1, or divide your RGB values with 255. If using python 2 make sure not to do floor division.
