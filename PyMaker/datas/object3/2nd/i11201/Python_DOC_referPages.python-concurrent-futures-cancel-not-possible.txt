I would like to start a blocking function in an Executor using the asyncio call loop.run_in_executor and then cancel it later, but that doesn't seem to be working for me.Here is the code:I would expect the code above to only allow the blocking function to output:and then see the output of the non blocking function. But instead the blocking future continues on even after I have canceled.Is it possible? Is there some other way of doing it?ThanksEdit: More discussion on running blocking and non-blocking code using asyncio: How to interface blocking and non-blocking code with asyncio
In this case, there is no way to cancel the  once it has actually started running, because you're relying on the behavior of , and its docs state the following:Attempt to cancel the call. If the call is currently being executed  and cannot be cancelled then the method will return , otherwise  the call will be cancelled and the method will return .So, the only time the cancellation would be successful is if the task is still pending inside of the . Now, you're actually using an  wrapped around a , and in practice the  returned by  will raise a  if you try to  it after you call , even if the underlying task is actually already running. But, it won't actually cancel the execution of the task inside the .If you need to actually cancel the task, you'll need to use a more conventional method of interrupting the task running in the thread. The specifics of how you do that is use-case dependent. For the use-case you presented in the example, you could use a :
As threads share the same memory address space of a process, there is no safe way to terminate a running thread. This is the reason why most programming languages do not allow to kill running threads (there are lots of ugly hacks around this limitation).Java learnt it the hard way.A solution would consist in running your function in a separate process instead of a thread and terinate it gracefully.The Pebble library offers an interface similar to  supporting running  to be cancelled.
