Here in this code they are checking the equality of self with the other two parameters.What? Where? No.  doesn't relate  and  together in any way.checks if has a meaningful value (is not ) and, if so, equals to the given .In other words, it does what its name says: it checks if "we" are identical to our parent's left child. This, of course, only works if we have a parent. If we haven't, we aren't its left child.Note: What I just said about "is not " is only half the truth. To be exact, it checks if there is a "truthy value", i. e. a value which evaluates true in the context of conditional expressions. As one normally uses  in the case of an absent node such as , what I wrote is clear enough.
