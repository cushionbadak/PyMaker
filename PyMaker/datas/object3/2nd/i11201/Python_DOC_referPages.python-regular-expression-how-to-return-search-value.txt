Natural Text
I'm sure that this is a very elementary question, so thank you in advance for your patience. I'm using a simple regular expression to identify whether a year is present in a line of text (line is a dictionary so I'm calling the particular field I want to search). Then I want to do something with the year. My question is, how can I return the year that my search finds? Everything I'm finding online tells me how to replace or edit it, but in this case the value is the thing I want to extract/use.
You just need to put the matched object in a variable, then use  attribute in order to return the matched string.match.group([group1, ...])Returns one or more subgroups of the match. If there is a single argument, the result is a single string; if there are multiple arguments, the result is a tuple with one item per argument. Without arguments, group1 defaults to zero (the whole match is returned). If a groupN argument is zero, the corresponding return value is the entire matching string; if it is in the inclusive range [1..99], it is the string matching the corresponding parenthesized group.
