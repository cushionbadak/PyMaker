Shouldn't the below lambda expression return a list? Currently, it isn't.
 is a side-effecting function; it appends a value to an existing list without returning a value (or None, depending on how you want to think of it).Perhaps you want:This creates a new list from the existing list with an element appended at the end.
 does not return a value but because the python list is a mutable object,  will indeed be appended, it just doesn't get returned.For example this will work:If you do not want to modify  you can writeas the lambda will not modify the list  but just return a new list.
the function  returns  so your lambda returns , too. Also the  changes the local variable  only
