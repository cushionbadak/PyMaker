I would like to check if two strings contain the same letters and numbers BUT Ignore special characters, such as Example:
Assuming you want to account for every alphanumeric character in each string being the same (not just the sets of characters), you could compare the s after filtering characters. If you just want to compare the sets of characters, (i.e. "AAB" and "AB" would return true), you could use a similar approach with 
Runs to specification listed in the question.
The following function will compare two strings.Output
what about this?
Edit: And edit in the question was made where only the contents are important, not the count of the numbers. So in order to get the correct result you should switch to a set. And simply make a list of the ignored charactersAnd still compare the resulting sets.
