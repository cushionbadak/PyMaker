Natural Text
I'm writing a small RPG in Python, and I want my different world objects to have varying colors.  I've tried exploring colorama and some similar modules; however, the string always prints as a small box with some numbers and letters in it, instead of, let's say, a blue '~' character for a water tile.  I create my world arrays with a variable that looks like this: I then add world objects to it through a few different functions, to structure a random-esque world environment, like this one: This is of course all stored within a class object. This function is how I create randomized oceans within the world, by calling  which would replace a few of the indexes with .How would I be able to change the output color of the  within the game map? EDIT: My question seems much more specific than the other thread listed.  The problem I am having, is when I print text through colorama, or any of the answers below or in the other thread, in a stand alone file simply printing colored text, it works.  However, when I use that same code to change the color of the  argument in , I get this odd box icon, regardless of the method I used to change the color of the string text.Here is a screen shot:
You can use this package called termcolor, instead of hard coding the values.
You can add ASCII escape codes to the strings you add to your . To make your water blue, just replace  with .For more color codes, see:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#ColorsYou can then print your world using:
