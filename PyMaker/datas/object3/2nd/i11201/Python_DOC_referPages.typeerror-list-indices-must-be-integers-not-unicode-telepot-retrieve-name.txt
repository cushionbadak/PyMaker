I tried to make a bot that retrieve the name of the sender of the chat in a group. I am using Python with Telepot.When I execute this, it gives me this errorError:How do I fix this?
Use  instead of a list to access values in a dictionary.  This method returns a value for a given key in a dictionary (or  if the key is not available):
Square brackets in a representation mean that you have a list, and lists must be indexed using an integer or slice. Try indexing by  before attempting to access any contained dictionaries.
