I am new to Python and I have difficulties in the basics of functionsa.pyb.pyI am using IntelliJ IDE 
 is not .  It automatically namespaces everything to the imported name.  Your first example should look like thisNotice how I had to do  to get the  class, because it was namespaced to , the module that was imported.Python is not staticly-typed.  You could pass any object into .  You're expecting your editor to auto-complete for the  object because that's what you're passing to it in , but that's just one instance.  Python (and your editor) has no way of knowing all the possible types of your arguments you may pass to  (unless you're using type hinting, which is a fairly new feature, and still doesn't enforce variable types, it would simply be for display purposes in your editor).
There are two possible reasons:The hint doesn't show up because this code has typos and will not run anyway. You're missing  after  and a colon after . Also your  class will not be automatically visible, you should refer to it as  in your  file.Your editor doesn't guess at all the possible program flows. For example you could call  from some other place with a string or integer or anything else as a parameter. The editor is just guessing here, so it's just as likely to not give you any hints.Without saying what the editor is, it's hard to say what the real reason is. Fix the code first, then look for specific answers.If you're using python > 3.5, then you can use type hints which may help as well. (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/)
You can something similar to what you're looking for with the  function in python3. This will print everything that's in the scope of the variable. Just change your  file to this:
