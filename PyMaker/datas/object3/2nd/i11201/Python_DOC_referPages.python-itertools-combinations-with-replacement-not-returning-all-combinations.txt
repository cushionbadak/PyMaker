I have written a simple python program:This outputs the following:However for it to be all combinations of the numbers 1 2 and 3, it would need to include:And as you can see above, it does not.  I have seen other posts giving the  combinations_with_replacement function given as the solution to get all possible combinations of the characters passed in.  Yet this does not seem to be happening.  What am I doing wrong here, and how can I get all possible combinations of the characters in the characters variable?Thanks for your time ;-)
"combinations" is an order-insensitive term; if you have , then you don't need  or , because all of them are the same "combination" (if the input sequence to  is unique, you could view the outputs as being all unique values after converting to ; regardless of order, two s and a  is just ).If you want an order sensitive version of  (so ,  and  are all separate outputs), use  with the  argument ( must be passed by keyword due to design of , where it takes variable length positional arguments):
