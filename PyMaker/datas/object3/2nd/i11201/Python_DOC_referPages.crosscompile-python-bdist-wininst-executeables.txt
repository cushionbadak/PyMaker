I'm using a 64bit Windows machine with 64bit python3. I need to build a installable package for a windows 32bit machine and stumbled upon the cross compile feature of the bdist feature: https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/builtdist.htmlI'm using a setup.py like this:And build the install packages like so:In both cases I get the correct executeable format for the specified architecture but the defined console_script  was not executeable after installation.The python documentation says that I need to crosscompile the whole python package for windows - but I'am uncertain if this is even necessary because the installer was for the right architecture and I got no error message while the build process. Is there something wrong with the command? Do I really need to crosscompile or is it sufficiant to have a second 32bit installation of python? 
As I found out this is a reported bug https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/253The setuptools do only check for the OS architecture and ignore the plat-name string for the installation of scripts.Workaround (until this issue is closed): Use the target architecture for building the wininst.
