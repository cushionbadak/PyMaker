Situation: I'm new to python and currently trying to learn the ropes, I've attempted creating a linked list class to assist in getting a better understanding of the language and its structures. I know that the  function is basically supposed to return the same thing as  but I'm unsure on what the actual difference is. Here's my class so far: When I test this code against the below code, I'll get an error basically saying the blank string '[]' isn't actually being returned when using the repr function. How could I edit this methods body to fix this issue? I've also tried  and I'm not sure why that won't work either.
The  function returns a string representation of a Python object that may be evaluated by the Python interpreter to instantiate another instance of the object. So if you had a list:Its  string would be:And you could do:It's a way to get a string representation of a Python object that can be converted back into a new instance of said object.Basically the difference between  and  is that the former returns a string representation of the object meant to be read by a person and the latter returns a string representation of the object meant to be parsed by the Python interpreter. Be very careful with this!In your example code, it appears that  and  return the same string representation. That's fine. However, if you wanted, you could make your  return some prettier formatted version (for instance with carriage returns and no brackets), but  should always return a string that could be parsed by the Python interpreter to reconstruct the object.
