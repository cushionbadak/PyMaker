I'm started learning python-django and I would like create my first django app.I'm following the Django 1.8 tutorial. In my project "mysite", there is a source folder "polls". In the folder there is "views.py" module where a "index" function is defined. And there is a "urls.py" file:Now i'm getting an error:Edit: Updated with new information provided by woljako in an answermy mysite/ursl.py:and I'm getting an error:I added to INSTALLED_APPS app 'polls', but still it didn't help

This is required for the import to work. See the docs for reference. Simply create an empty file with the name . Note the double underscores.Please let me know if this solves you problems.
Try to register polls in your applications in settings.py. Something like this:enter image description here
