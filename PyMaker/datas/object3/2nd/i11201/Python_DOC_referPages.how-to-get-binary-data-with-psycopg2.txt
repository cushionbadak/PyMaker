I have a column containing binary data. If I do  it is not giving me any data, instead I do  then get the result below. How can O get that binary data into a variable and then convert it into a base64 encoded string?
 returns the binary data (probably stored in a  column in your table) in a  object in Python 2, or in a  in Python 3.Both  and  objects can be passed directly to a base64 string encoder, so this will encode the binary data in base 64:In Python 2, if you want the binary data itself you can use  or slice with  the  object. In Python 3 you can use the  method of the  object.
You need to read the buffer:
