I need to feed local variable from one  file to another, combine the variables there and Then get the other variables back into first file.I looked at SO discussions for  and , but it does not seem to solve my problem.Here is skeleton example of what I am trying to accomplish.Couple of  scripts generates reports. #report1.py#report2.py is the variable for report name and needs to be sourced in  that holds most of the environment variables and constants.#mysettings.pyThe code then queries a server and gets a  file and converts to  and modifies as per needs.Back in repor?.py#report1.py#report2.pyChallenge is, How do I feed in  to  and then get the combined variable back in report1.py and report2.pyOnce its working, there will be other reports added, hence I wanted to get variables/settings streamlined.I also wanted to declare as less variables as possible in all the  and instead manage them globally in Any thoughts input is appreciated.
You should define a function in mysettings.py and execute it in other files:#mysettings.py#report1.pyThat way you do not need to use global variables across different scripts
Ok the most strait forward way would be to execute the code in  inside the report modules:However passing several variables between modules is usually handled by an  dictionary, so you could have your  have a function like this:Then in the report files you can handle the environ dict manually:Or take advantage of the fact that the global namespace is kept track of with a dictionary:
