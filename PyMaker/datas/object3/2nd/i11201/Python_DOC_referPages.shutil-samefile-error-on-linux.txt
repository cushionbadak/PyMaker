I have a python script that is giving me a hard time on Ubuntu 12.02 with Python 2.7.3.PS: it runs without problems on Windows.Checking some properties of the files:As you see, calling  I get  but  still raise the .Am I forgetting something? Any other way to move or copy files with Python?
It looks like the two files are both hard links to the same file.  You can tell because they share the same inode numberWindows users generally don't create hard links.  They are more common in linux environments, which is why you may have not encountered the problem until now.It is odd that  returns .  What OS are you using?   is just a wrapper around  (on systems where that function exists).  What results do you get from ?  On posix systems, it just checks that the device and inode match (which they do in your case) and it should return posixpath.py
In python 3 in shutil.copy there's additional argument follow_symlinks=TrueLook at this https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.htmlIf follow_symlinks is false, and src is a symbolic link, dst will be created as a symbolic link. If follow_symlinks is true and src is a symbolic link, dst will be a copy of the file src refers to.
