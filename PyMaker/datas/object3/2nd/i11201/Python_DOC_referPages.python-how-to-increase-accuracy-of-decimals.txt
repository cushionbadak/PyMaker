I'm writing a program where I need to pass in very accurate decimal representations of fractions (i.e. accurate to over 200 decimal places). However simply telling python to include more decimal places (using %.50f, for instance) often simply adds a bunch of 0s to the ends of certain decimals. Is there a way to get python to display accurately an arbitrary number of  decimal places for a fraction? Do I need to install a package/module?
Python 2.7 and above can do the following,Using the Decimal Library from the python standard libraries by using  and do this:
Check the decimal module, which is included with Python. It can show the exact decimal representation of any value stored in a float or decimal variable.This is not quite the same as showing arbitrarily many decimal places for a fraction, but see if it meets your needs.
