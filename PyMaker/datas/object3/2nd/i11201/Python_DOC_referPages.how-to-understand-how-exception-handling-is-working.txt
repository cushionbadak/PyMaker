I have been fiddling around with raising exceptions for Google Big Query. I finally figured out how to make it work in the way it should work, but I don't really understand why it works. I am looking to gain a better understanding what is going on in my code. I have already scoured Stack Overflow and nothing seems to help.Here is my view:Here is my delete method in my Big Query controller:I understand that the  is catching a raised error from the , I don't understand how the errors are being raised in the . Could someone please shed some light?
As the code is, there is no real reason for the  because at the end of the  block you always raise an exception, so you always go to the  block.  So each time the code runs, it goes through the , then hits the exception so goes to the  block where it raises an exception no matter which branch of the if/else statement you go to.  This code here does the same thing, it's just a little cleaner (less duplication) so you can see where the exceptions are being raisedAlthough I wouldn't raise a generic , I'd use one of the built-ins or define your own
