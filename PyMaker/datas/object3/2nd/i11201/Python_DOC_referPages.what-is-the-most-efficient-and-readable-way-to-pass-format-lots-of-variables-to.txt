Natural Text
I have a couple "lengthy" lines like this one:Just by looking at such a line it you can tell that it is quite large and that it is in some ways hard to read and / or understand.Is there a more efficient and readable way to dynamically insert lots of values into large strings?
Another option would be to do:Note that there is no  at the end of each line.However the best way to generate HTML is probably via some templating framework, e.g. jinja, mako, etc.
You could use a multiline string:
by having the strings in a list and then doing a join as in . This will be a lot faster than simple concatenation.  Here is a link to see the difference is performance
