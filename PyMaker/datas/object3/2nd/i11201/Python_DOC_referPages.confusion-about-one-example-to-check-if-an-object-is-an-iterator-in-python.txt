I have read some posts on stackoverflow about how to check an object is an iterator in Python but it seems that they did not solve my question. I have this example from the book Effective PythonTo use:So my question is in this line:Why this line check if the variable numbers is an iterator? When visits = [15, 35, 80], should it be true that ?
When you call an iterable, calling  on such an object will always produce a new iterator object. But calling  on an iterator will always return the same object; it is a requirement of the iterator protocol that they do.From the  documentation:Return the iterator object itself. This is required to allow both containers and iterators to be used with the  and  statements.Because  always returns itself, the test  will be true; the same object is returned in both cases.
To help you understand Martijn's explanation, take a look at the following:So if  was an , calling  on  will always return objects that are internally identical:  will be .
