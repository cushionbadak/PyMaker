Problem overview:In my project's main script,  installs the function  that is used in other modules for translations (like in ).As stated by the doc:the _() function [is] installed in Pythonâ€™s builtins namespace, so it is easily accessible in all modules of your application.So, everything runs fine.Only problem:  shows errors (actually returned by PyFlakes):This is normal, as  is indeed not defined in main_script.py nor lib.py.Simple structure that reproduces the problem:Where lib.py contains this:and main_script.py this:and myapp.po contains:(was compiled by poedit to produce the mo file).As stated above, the main script does work:Important note: I'm looking for a solution working both for the script where  is called and all other modules that do not need to call . Otherwise, the structure could be even more simple, because calling  from main_script.py is enough to trigger F821.Solutions to solve the situation that look bad (or worse):add a  comment at the end of each line using  F821 (don't want to do that because this is useful in other situations)
You could specify the  which is more specific than .You should be able to specify this in a configuration file as well if you don't like command line arguments.
