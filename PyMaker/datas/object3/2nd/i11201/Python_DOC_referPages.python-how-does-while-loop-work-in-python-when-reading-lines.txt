How does  loop work in python when reading lines?so depending on the  variable while loop is executed, and  can be bool,intbut to read lines from file using  as mentioned belowafter reading all lines finally  but  is strSo how did  loop terminate? I knew this could be done better using  and  , reason for not using while loop for this purpose would be helpful 
There are a few implicit boolean conversions in Python.1)  evaluates to False, any other integers evaluate to 2) , ,  also evaluate to . This is useful to test whether a container has any items in it (non-empty strings, lists, dicts etc. evaluate to )So in your case  read the empty string, which got implicitly turned to  and evaluated to , therefore the loop has terminated
Whenever you use a variable as a condition to an  or a  loop it is evaluated as a boolean value. In Python an empty string is treated as , therefore the  loop terminates.reason for not using while loop for this purpose would be helpfulYou should ask for a reason to use a  loop for this purpose.Compare this:To that:
 is a generator object that returns  at the end of the file. But  has a falsy value:Hence, when the  evaluates the line at EOF (End Of File), the value is the same as .The following values are considered  (see the docs):
Empty string is treated as False in python. So, it won't enter the loop. FYI the better way of looping over the lines is You can even do like this also.
You can add:or alternatively:
