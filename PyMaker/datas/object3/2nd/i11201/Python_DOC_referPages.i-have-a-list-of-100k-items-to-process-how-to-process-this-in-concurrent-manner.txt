I have list of 100000 items that needs to be posted to a URL end point.If I were to process this sequentially, performance wise, this would be a long wait. Would this be solved via parallel process or concurrent future? Obviously each element in the list can only be posted once. Do I need to track the threads?
Your problem looks IO bound, not CPU bound, so you may get nice performances by using aiohttp, and use asyncio.wait to wait them all to complete.
