This question already has an answer here:Split a string by spaces — preserving quoted substrings — in Python                    16 answers                I have strings that need to be placed into lists; for instance I require thatbecomesSo everything in quotes becomes a single list element; otherwise, everything separated by whitespace becomes a single list element.My first idea was a simple split, place the items that don't contain  into a new array, and then place the ones that are in a quoted-section back together:But this strategy is pretty ugly, and in addition I have to assume that the string was split on a single space. seemed very promising:but it's awkward because I have to partition again as I iterate through, and it's context-sensitive as to which one was in quotes.Is there a simple Python3 way to split this string as described above?
