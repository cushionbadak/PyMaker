I am new to OOP. My idea was to implement the following class:Then the idea was to create two instances of that class:I know, that is not possible, but how can I pass an input-argument into an instance of a class?
Is this what you are looking for?
The problem in your initial definition of the class is that you've written:This means that the class inherits the base class called "object", and the base class called "name". However, there is no base class called "name", so it fails. Instead, all you need to do is have the variable in the special init method, which will mean that the class takes it as a variable.If you wanted to use the variable in other methods that you define within the class, you can assign name to self.name, and use that in any other method in the class without needing to pass it to the method.For example:
You just need to do it in correct syntax. Let me give you a minimal example I just did with Python interactive shell:
Remove the  param from the class declaration. The init method is used to pass arguments to a class at creation.
