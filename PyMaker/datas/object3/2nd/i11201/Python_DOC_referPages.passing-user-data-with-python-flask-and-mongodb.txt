So basically I have an "/add" route where it is used to manually seed in test user data to mongodb and I want to be able to pass that user's ID to the URL for the route "/agreement" so when the user is on the agreement page, their  will be mapped to that URI and the info they enter on the agreement page will update their data that we seeded in the "/add" route.  I think the issue lies in the agreement resource where maybe I should write  but I think I am missing a fundamental understanding of where the  is instantiated.  I also don't completely understand what the function of the agreement parameter is but I put  because this seems like something I would have to do in order to get the user's info passed to another resource.  I also think  might not be correct as well as .  Part of me thinks that maybe I should do redirect instead of render but if anyone can lend a hand I would greatly appreciate it.
Try this:URL parameter names in Flask are specified in the  parameter, and they have to match the decorated function's signature.Querying in Mongo is done by passing a dict specifying the constraints, so  will return a single result with _id matching the user_id variable.Edit: Actually, as per the documentation, you can just do:.
