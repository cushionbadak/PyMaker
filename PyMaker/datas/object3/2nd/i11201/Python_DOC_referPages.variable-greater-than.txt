Is it possible to make a variable in Python that is equal to any number greater than another number? For example:pretty much for those who are wondering what i am trying to do I am trying to make it so if a  number in a list of integers is over 26 then take that number and change it to a number under 26 depending on what number it is. Sorry this is one small thing in a bigger project so its hard to explain it all
Yes, you can customize your class's behaviour in comparison operations to get this behaviour.
obviously we can't do every number greater than 26 because that's infinity but there are a couple options.
