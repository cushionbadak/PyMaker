I have been asked to define a function that sorts a list based on file extension..I understand sorting, but I don't understand how to start the sort from the "." character.I want the following result:
You can pass key function as a parameter for :If you need the files to with same extension to be sorted by their name you can change key function to reverse the split result:
For a solution that works even if some of the files don't have extensions (and is somewhat more self-documenting), use  as part of 's  function. When there is no file extension, it will treat the extension as the empty string, , sorting it before all other extensions:Note that  sorted before  here, because it appeared first in the input, and the sort only keyed on the file extension. To make it sort by extension, then full name, key on a tuple of the extension followed by the non-extension name (easily done by slicing 's return value using  which reverses the order of the elements returned), so  precedes  regardless of where they appeared in the input:
