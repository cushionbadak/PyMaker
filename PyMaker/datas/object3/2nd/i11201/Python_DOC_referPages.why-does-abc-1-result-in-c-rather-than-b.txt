I thought that it started counting backwards from the start, so A is 0, B is -1 and C is -2.
As Henry pointed out, negative indices indicate counting from the right.Naturally,  is ,  is  and  is , when counting from the left:When going backwards, -1 is the end of the array, like so:For more context, look at it like this, as if two copies were lined up:According to the documentation  and  objects support negative indices, but Range objects to not. 
A negative index means "start counting from the right". Put another way:  is the start of the sequence, why would you expect  to be anything other than the end of the sequence?
