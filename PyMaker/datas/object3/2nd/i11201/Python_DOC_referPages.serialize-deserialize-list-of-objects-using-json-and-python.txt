How do i serialize a list of objects(Person) to a json file and then read that json file back and deserialize them back into objects? I know how to write to a json file but i'm not clear on how to convert my objects to json properly.Below is my simplified snippet of code. I have a list containing two people and i want to serialize them and save to a json file. Then deserialize them back to objects of type People.Thanks for the help.
The  module expects lists, dicts, strings, numbers, booleans, and None, not custom classes. You need to make a dictionary out of your  instance. A simple way to do this is with .
You cannot serialize custom classes using JSON. You should use the  module instead. From the docs:https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#comparison-with-jsonJSON, by default, can only represent a subset of the Python built-in  types, and no custom classes;Emphasis mine. Also, from http://www.json.org/:JSON is built on two structures:A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed  list, or associative array.An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence.Again, emphasis is mine. In python, you can serialize dictionaries or lists that contain values, where values can be:A value can be a string in double quotes, or a number, or true or  false or null, or an object or an array. These structures can be  nested.
add to_dict method to your person class. try thisUpdate:To deserialize json to python object
