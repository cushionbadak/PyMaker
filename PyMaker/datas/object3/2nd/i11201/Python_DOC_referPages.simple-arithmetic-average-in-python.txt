I'm a total newbie on Python and I would like to calculate the arithmetic average.I'm aware that such code do solve my problems but that is not exactly what I'm looking for.I want the user to be able to type the number of terms of the arithmetic average and I would like him to be able of typing them separatley on different lines. So I thought the right thing to use was For Loop. I came out with something like this:I know that all I need to do know is to find a way to sum all values of a typed on each loop and divide this number by  but I have no idea how to do that.Can you guys help me with that?Thanks everyone!
The idea is to create an accumulator variable  to which the entered numbers are added. After the loop  is equal to the sum of all numbers entered. Divide it by the number of terms and you get the arithmetic average.
