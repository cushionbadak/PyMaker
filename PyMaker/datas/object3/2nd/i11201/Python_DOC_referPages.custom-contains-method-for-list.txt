I'd like to get a better handle on the doubly-linked structure. The goal in this scenario is to append a range of values to the end of a list. I then would like to test for a value I know should be in the list, this should return true, and vice versa for a value that I know shouldn't be in the list. So here's what I have thus far.Test:When I test this code I get I get an Assertion error saying " False is not true " I'm unsure why my code is able to recognize that the value 100 isn't in the list, whereas it also says 50 isn't and returns False when it should return True.
Your implementation is wrong. Your  function only returns true if all values in your linked list are equal to a given test value. I.e. it'd only be true if all values in your linked list are equal to one another as well:Moreover, the  call in that generator expression is entirely redundant, you are not pairing up elements from multiple iterables here.Use the  function instead: will only return  if all items in the iterable are true (it'll return  early).  will return  as soon as it finds any one item in the iterable that is true:
