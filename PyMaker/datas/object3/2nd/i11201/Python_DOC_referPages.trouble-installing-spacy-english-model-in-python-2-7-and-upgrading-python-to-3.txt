I am trying to install the spaCy english model on my mac after installing the program. Right now my machine has python 2.7. I have installed spaCy in the venv then followed that with "python -m spacy.en.download" to install the model as instructed on the website. When I try to do that I get the following in response:Traceback (most recent call last):I then tried to install spaCy and the model on my computer outside of the venv which I would rather not do, but wanted to see if it would work. Again I got the same error. Additionally I am wondering if the issue has something to do with running python 2.7? I upgraded my python on my computer to 3.5 but am not sure how to replace 2.7 with 3.5? Right now I can run both on the interpreter using  or . How can I upgrade everything to 3.5?Thank you in advance!
In short:The latest version of  and  doesn't have this issue anymore.Upgrade your  version, it should automatically upgrade  too:In long:In the latest version of , the  line is no longer in the  but the  library is used in other places is an argument parser like the native  or the popular .The error you've occurred above is caused by the difference between the  syntax of Python2 and Python3, i.e.:And this was introduced by this commit.Since there is the  at https://github.com/micheles/plac/blob/46d8d393fbca8820e5cba5d1da808b65a1c879a3/plac_tk.py#L1 The  should have kicked in and allow the  parameters in the print for Python2, e.g.But the  import from  didn't kick in and that remains a mystery to me =( But that's another answer for another question at another time...
