I couldn't find a python tree I could use to create a tree structure for chess openings, so I tried to write my own. To progress deeper into the tree I try to return a subroot when I add a new position, but it seems all the positions are getting added to the root, and I'm not being given a reference to the subroot like I expect, although I did check and root has a lot of grandchildren too.
Your code fails because you have misused class variables.Basically, when you declare  outside of any function it is scoped at the class-level, and all  objects share the same list. You want to define it within  as  such that it is scoped at the instance level.
