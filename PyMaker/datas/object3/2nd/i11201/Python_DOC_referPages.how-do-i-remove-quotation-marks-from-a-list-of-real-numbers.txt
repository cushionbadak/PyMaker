This question already has an answer here:Convert all strings in a list to int                    3 answers                In Python, how do I convert all of the items in a list to floats?                    10 answers                I am reading data from a cvs file and when I import data into a list it will treat the numbers as strings.This is the output:  but I want something like this  so that I am dealing with real numbers and NOT strings? Any suggestions?
You'd simply iterate over it an convert it to the data type you need.As pointed out by @IanAuld - This is called type casting or type conversion.There are libraries that can handle trickier conversions for you.But the bare essentials are a  loop, iterate over each object in your list and convert it and finally place the result in a new list.If i were to expand my answer from using  to a regular for loop, it would look like this:
You can type cast and create a new list easily by using a list comprehension like so:Using variables:For more information on list comprehensions:https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions
