I'm wondering if there is a way to deal with dynamic config files using Python's ConfigParser. By dynamic, I mean that the config file isn't fixed in structure.For example, I could have the config file below.I could also have the config file below (an extra field-value added to Section B).The same code should be used to parse both config files. So far, I've only seen examples where the fields are hard-coded, like the example given here, which would require prior knowledge of the fields in each section.Is there a way to dynamically read the fields/values in each section?
from pymotw.comI just made an adaptation for python3 since I see you use . Enjoy!
