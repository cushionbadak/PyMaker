I have a python project where I am essentially coding a custom language, and for it I need a function that can replace user entered strings with different data, for example random numbers (It's hard to explain what I want to do c:)An example of this would be that the user types into the command line:and the function would  run like:then parseOutput would equal  , with the random number in place of the {RANDOM_INT[x, x]} tagI hope I made what I am looking for clear enough as it is difficult to explain.
Well, instead of using the Python template string (which are powerful but limited) I suggest you using Jinja2 templates.This template engine is well-known for developing web applications.To implement your custom language, you can use filters. Here is an example:First import the required modules:Define a filter to calculate a random number, like this:note: the value parameter is not used here.Define a Jinja environment and add your custom filter:You can then use it like this (you have to slightly change the user input to conform to Jinja template syntax):The result:Avantages: Jinja can check the syntax and missing formats for you.EDIT: more examplesYou can change the environment configuration to usesingle curly braces instead of double:Instead of creating a custom filter, you can use builtin functions and filters.Eg.: use the  function with the filter:finally, you can extend the global context with your own functions
You can try to use  functionality from Python. DocumentationExample:You can generate the  using  from the built-in library . Documentation
Is this what you needed?
