This question already has an answer here:What's the purpose of tf.app.flags in TensorFlow?                    5 answers                I'm reading the tensorflow tutorial file   which contains the following code. I do not understand what those mean.  Why do we need that? It seems that it's just defining some global variables. Why not just define those directly? Any help is  appreciated. thanks
This is google's way for parsing arguments from the commandline.  Have a look at python-gflags.  As far as I'm aware, google is the primary user of this commandline parsing library.  The rest of the world uses  these days.But basically, the "tl;dr;" is that you're right -- They are setting up global data.  However, it's global data that can be fiddled with via the commandline.
