I am making a rogue-like game and was wondering if there was a way to allow a player to drop an item by entering:  being the command and the item name being one located in your inventory, e.g. if I had a rock that I wanted to get rid of I would input: .
Since you're using numbered slots (rather than e.g. "bag", "pocket") a simpler approach would be to use a list for your inventory. You can index into a list, and find items in a list by value, easily.I would also suggest you use  or at least an empty string  to represent the empty slot ( as these both equate to :You can then adapt your function as follows:Note that because Python indexing is zero-based, if you want to allow the user to enter  for the first slot, rather than , you will need to subtract one from the provided value.To print the inventory in a nice list you could use something like the following. The  cosntruction might be new to you:In  we make use of the falsey value of an empty string together with  shortcutting. If  is  the value in  will be shown, if it is  (e.g. empty string) the value after the  will be printed instead. An equivalent without this would be:Finally, an example of a  function, where you use  to find the location of something in your list  and remove it:
you might want to take a look at cmd, which makes command handling much easieryou can create functions for each command, that are then being called
I took it one step further than @mfitzp and made it all one line of code so that Drop Stick will drop a stick. Here is the code I used:
