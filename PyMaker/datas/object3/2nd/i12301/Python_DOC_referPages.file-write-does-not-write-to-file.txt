You are trying to write an integer to a file; the  method only accepts strings.Convert to a string first:You really should not use a blanket  handler in your code; you really do't want to play Pokemon and catch them all. By doing so you are missing valuable error information. See Why is "except: pass" a bad programming practice?Rather than roll your own, you could just use the  module.
You open a file, and then you close it. You don't write anything in it though, because the function  fails should anything but a variable of type  be passed to it! Here is an alternative to  with fewer restrictions: function has fewer restrictions and is a better option here as it automatically formats the inputs it receives as a , regardless of the initial , and excluding functions, instances and generator objects, which would be displayed as, for instance, something like this: . Additionally, be aware that the visual format to which they are converted (and subsequently displayed or written in a file) may not necessarily be to your liking, so I suggest you do experiment with the results and see what works best in a particular situation.

Rename the variable  to something like  to avoid conflicts with the module .You passed , which is an integer, into the method . You should convert it to a string first:
