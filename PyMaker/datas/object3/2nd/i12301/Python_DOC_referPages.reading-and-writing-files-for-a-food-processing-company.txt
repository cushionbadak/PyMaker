I am working on a Python project where a food processing company is trying to calculate its total sales for the year. Python has to read from a text file where its divided into for categories split by commas. The first category is the Type of product, which can be cereal, chocolate candy etc produced by the company. The second category is the brand of the said product, for example, Kaptain Krunch for cereal or Coco Jam for chocolate. The third category is the sales for the last fiscal year(2014) and the last category is sales for this fiscal year(2015). Note that only sales for fiscal year 2015 are to be calculated. The 2014 has no use in this program but it is there.  Here is how the text file looks like. Its name is product.txtCereal,Magic Balls,2200,2344Cereal,Kaptain Krunch,3300,3123Cereal,Coco Bongo,1800,2100Cereal,Sugar Munch,4355,6500Cereal,Oats n Barley,3299,5400Sugar Candy,Pop Rocks,546,982Sugar Candy,Lollipop,1233,1544Sugar Candy,Gingerbud,2344,2211Sugar Candy,Respur,1245,2211Chocolate,Coco Jam,3322,4300Chocolate,Larkspur,1600,2200Chocolate,Mighty Milk,1234,2235Chocolate,Almond Berry,998,1233Condiments,Peanut Butter,3500,3902Condiments,Hot Sauce,1234,1560Condiments,Jelly,346,544Condiments,Spread,2334,5644What we are looking to do is to add the sales for Fiscal year 2015 by products and then the total sales for everything in 2015The output should look something like the in the written text fileTotal sales for cereal in 2015 : {Insert total number here}Total sales for Sugar Candy in 2015 : {Insert total number here}Total sales for Chocolate in 2015 : {Insert total number here}Total sales for Condiments in 2015 : {Insert total number here}Total sales for the company in 2015: {Insert total for all the  products sold in 2015}Along with that, it should also print the grand total on the Python run screen in the IDE along with the text file.Total sales for the company in 2015: {Insert total for all the  products sold in 2015}Here is my code. I am new to Python and reading and writing files so I can't really say if I am on the right track.
The short version here is that you're doing this wrong. Never roll your own parsing code if you can help it. I'd suggest taking a look at the built-in  module, and trying using that to "contract out" the CSV parsing, letting you focus on the rest of the logic.Simple rewrite and completed code with :
