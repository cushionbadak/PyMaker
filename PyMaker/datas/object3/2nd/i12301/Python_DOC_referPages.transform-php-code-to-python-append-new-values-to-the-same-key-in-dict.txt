The only way that I know how to do this, is with php but I want to get the same result in python.PHP Code:I have this code.How I can do this?Regards.
The first line initializes the dictionary, the second initializes  to a list containing one element, and the last line adds two elements to this list. Notice the .Note: you need to use another method if you don't know whether the key  already exists in the dict (thanks SirParselot). Use this if you don't know if it exists:
Or you can use :
you can use a  from the  module like so takes a type as a parameter and every time you create a new key it will have an empty list as the value. This is especially useful for having lists as the value. That way you don't need an if statement to check if that key already exists.
