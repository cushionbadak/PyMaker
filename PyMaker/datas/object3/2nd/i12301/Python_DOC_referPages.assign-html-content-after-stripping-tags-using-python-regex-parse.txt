Natural Text
I want to assign the content of HTML after I do stripping of the tags. Here is the html that I initially removed tags from:Approach for stripping the tags using regex:Here is the output that I get: However, I want to assign the content of each HTML td tag to the variables and so, my expected final output will be:What would be the best way to assign these variables? Also, is there a way I can combine the rules for my regular expressions and have simpler form of regex command? Other appoaches using regex would help.
To follow the comments and for the completeness sake, here is how you can use the  HTML parser to get the total numbers.The idea is to find the  element with  class and get the next  siblings:Prints:
Right now you are stripping out all the tag text. You should not do that, because it is the tag text that provides you the structure you need to identify the start and end of each value. What will you do when the numbers are greater than just one digit each? 10384003899 - is that a 103 or a 10 or a 1038 at the front?Instead, modify your existing framework. Write yourself a regex that can use grouping to extract the value of a single TD element. Something like (except that I guarantee you that doesn't work). Then you can loop over your string, matching that pattern again and again until it fails, appending each match to a list. When you're done, you'll have a list of the values, which you can then manipulate however you like.
