Natural Text
I am printing the output as the name of the file. I am getting the output as VCALogParser_output_ARW.log, VCALogParser_output_CZC.log and so on. but I am interested only in printing ARW, CZC and so on. So please someone can tell me how to split this text ?
If you are only interested in  and  without the  then, you can do it with  method:Or better maker your patten  then call its  method when formatting your string:Also, it might be helpful using  with positive look ahead and group naming:In case, you are not able or you don't want to use  module, then you can define lengths of strings that you don't need and index your string variables with them:But keep in mind that the above is valid as long as you have those common strings in all of your string variables.
this will give you : 'ARW'and this will give you: 'CZC'
is rought but this will give you 'CZC.log', 'ARW.log' and so on, assuming that all files have the same underscore-delimited format.
If the format of the file is always such that it ends with  or  this is really easy to do just using the standard string  method, with two consecutive splits:Or, to make it (arguably) a bit more readable, we can use the  module:
You can also try:
Parse file name correctly, so basically my guess is that you wanna to strip file extension  and prefix  to do that it's enough to use str.replace rather than using str.splitUse os.linesep when you writing to file to have cross-browserCode below would perform desired result(after applying steps listed above):
