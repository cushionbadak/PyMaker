some device returns data (hex bytes) in the form of How can I convert this to something in the form of the following?I already tried compositions of hexlify. I am using Python 3.5.
Take groups of two from your  object. Multiply the first value from each group with 16**2. Add the two values. Use  on the result to convert it to its string representation.I assume that you don't need your strings padded with useless zeros for now.
Use the struct module; it has  function which allows to specify the chunk size size (byte, 2-byte, 4-bytes) and endianess in the data. If what you have is big-endian half-word sized data chunks, then the right format key is ">H".To parse all data at one, add count in the format specifier: for example ">3H" for you input array. You can also write the number of fields dynamically.Full example:
There are two steps:Chunk the input bytestring into 2-byte sequencesDisplay the sequences as hex literals.You could use  module from stdlib:It is efficient, especially if you need to read data from a file.
