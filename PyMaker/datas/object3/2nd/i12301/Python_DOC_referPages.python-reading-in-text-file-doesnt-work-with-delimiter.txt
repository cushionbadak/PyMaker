Natural Text
I have a text file output from gem5 (i.e., I have no control over its format).It is as such:using csv module I have problems with the whitespace delimited rows. If I delimit with whitespace, all the spaces are read in, if I delimit with \t, it doesn't acknowledge anything at all.How can I easily deal with these spaces as I just want to read in the left column and the value attributed to it.Is csv import still suitable or is there something more powerful?
csv.reader can still be relevant for your use case, look at the use of the  parameter in csv.readerThis will cause the file to be delimited by whitespace, but additional whitespace after the delimiter will be ignored.You can then only use the first 2 values of each row
