The python documentation has information on the grammar of formatting strings, however I can't seem to find information on how to read the table defining the grammar for the replacement field.There's also a similar table in the format specification section.I understand portions of the table, like the  separates the definiendum and definien, characters inside quotes are literals, and the  means "or", but the rest of the table escapes me. 
This kind of formatting is what's known as Backus-Naur Form. More information found on BNF here. Basically, BNF is a set of derivation rules.Defining the symbols:Anything other than the meta symbols ::=, |, and class names in closed in <,> are symbols of the language being defined (e.g. This Python example)The meta symbols ::= is to be interpreted as "is defined as"The | is used to separate alternative definitions and is interpreted as "or"The meta symbols <,> are delimiters enclosing a class name. A little bit of dissecting this example to get you started: consists of an optional , optional  and optional . The brackets ( the [ and ]'s ) indicate optional parameters.If you do pass in  to , it consists of an  function in which you pass  or . Note  is mandatory because the brackets are in quotation marks, and thus escaping BNF form for optional.
