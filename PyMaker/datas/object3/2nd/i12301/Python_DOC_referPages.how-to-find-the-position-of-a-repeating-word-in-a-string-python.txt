How to get Python to return the position of a repeating word in a string?E.g. the word "cat" in "the cat sat on the mat which was below the cat" is in the 2nd and 11th position in the sentence.
You can use  to find all occurrences of the word in a string and starting indexes:And using dictionary comprehension:
This will return a dictionary mapping each word in the sentence, which repeates at least once, to the list of word index (not character index)
The following will take an input sentence, take a word from the sentence, and then print the position(s) of the word in a list with a starting index of 1 (it looks like that's what you want from your code).
I prefer simplicity and here is my code below:The 'words' consists of the list of all the words present in the sentence. Then after that, we iterate and match each word present at index 'pos' with the word we are looking to find(word_to_find) and if both the words are same then we print the value of pos with 1 added to it.Hope this is simple enough for you to understand and it serves your purpose.If you wish to use a list comprehension for the above, then:Both the above ways are same, just the later gives you a list.
