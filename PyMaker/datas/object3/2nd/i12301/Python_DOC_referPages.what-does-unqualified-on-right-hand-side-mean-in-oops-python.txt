I came across "unqualified on right hand side" phrase while reading oops concept in python for usage like self._customer = customer. What that phrase trying to explain? Complete statement isFor example, the command, , assigns the instance variable  to the parameter ; note that because  is unqualified on the right-hand side, it refers to the parameter in the local namespace. --Data Structures and Algorithms in Python p. 72
According to the Python docsqualified nameA dotted name showing the “path” from a module’s global scope to a class, function or method defined in that module, as defined in PEP 3155. For top-level functions and classes, the qualified name is the same as the object’s name:...When used to refer to modules, the fully qualified name means the entire dotted path to the module, including any parent packages, e.g. email.mime.text:Put more simply, qualifying a name in Python means that you explicitly define its scope. Thus  is a qualified name (it identifies the instance variable  for the enclosing class) whereas the bare reference does not specify any scope qualifications.When a name is unqualified, Python applies Lexical Scoping rules to try and find the variable, searching (in order)Local variables (including function parameters)Variables local to any outer functions, if we're dealing with a nested function definitionGlobal variablesBuilt-in variables
