Specifically, I'm trying to change this:into something like this:The motivation for this seemingly bizarre task is to be able to store different versions of mapping scripts in a database and then retrieve/use them as needed (with emphasis on the polymorphism of the  method). The above does not work. For some reason,  throws  I don't understand this since it's the same file that's being imported in the first case. Is there some reason why  cannot be used to define classes?I should note that I am aware of the security concerns around . I would love to hear of alternative approaches if there are any. The only other thing I can think of is to fetch the script, physically save it into the node package directory, and then import it, but that seems even crazier. 
You need to use exec: works only for expressions.  works for statements. A typical Python script contains statements. For example:Output:Make sure you either call  (Python 3, in Python 2 it is a statement) at the module level. When you call it in a function, you need to add , for example , to make the objects available in the global scope and to the rest of the function as discussed here.
