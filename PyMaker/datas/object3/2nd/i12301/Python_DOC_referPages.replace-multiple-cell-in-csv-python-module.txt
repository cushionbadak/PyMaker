Natural Text
I've a large csv file(comma delimited). I would like to replace/rename few random cell with the value "NIL" to an empty string "". I tried this to find the keyword  and replace with  emptystring. But it's giving me an empty csv file
From seeing you code i fell you directly should read the file then use regex to change all NIL to "" or " " and save back the data to the file.NOTE: you can give any regex instead of for more info see re module.EDIT 1:  returns a new string so you need to return it to .
A few tweaks and your example works. I edited your question to get rid of some indenting errors - assuming those were a cut/paste problem. The next problem is that you don't  ... but even though you create a reader and writer, you don't actually use them, so it could just be removed. So, opening in text instead of binary mode, we haveWe could add 'with' clauses and use a  to make replacements more clearThe only real problem now is that it also changes things like "NILIST" to "IST". If this is a csv with all numbers except for "NIL", that's not a problem. But you could also use the csv module to only change cells that are exactly "NIL".
