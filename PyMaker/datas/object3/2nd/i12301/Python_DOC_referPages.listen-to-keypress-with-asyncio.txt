Can somebody provide a sample of code which listen to keypress in nonblocking manner with asynio and put the keycode in console on every click?It's not a question about some graphical toolkit
So the link provided by Andrea Corbellini is a clever and thorough solution to the problem, but also quite complicated.  If all you want to do is prompt your user to enter some input (or simulate raw_input), I prefer to use the much simpler solution:
An alternative to using queues would be to make the command line an asyn generator, and process the commands as they come in, like so:
I wrote something similar as part of a package called aioconsole. It provides a coroutine called  that returns two asyncio streams corresponding to  and . Here's an example:It also includes an asynchronous equivalent to :It should work for both file and non-file streams. See the implementation here.
