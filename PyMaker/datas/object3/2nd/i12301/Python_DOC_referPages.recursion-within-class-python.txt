I am trying to create a class that generates a decision tree for a board from the Game Tic-Tac-Toe. I am using the comment from  the user "ssoler" on the post Tic-Tac-Toe: How to populate decision tree? as the basis for the class however I don't think the class is working. For one I cannot see all the outputs as idle abbreviates them by using "...". Also my use of classes and recursion in the past is poor. I am aiming to apply the Minimax algorithm and alpha-beta pruning to the tree outputted by the class.
I'm guessing this simplification of your program generates what you want, all possible boards as a tree.  It's poised for you to now use your winning combinations list to significantly prune the branches as it's generated:The key is not to store in your object things that you want to temporary mutate to see what might happen (e.g. the board and whose turn it is) -- make those local variables.  Also, your available_moves() method had True and False reversed.
