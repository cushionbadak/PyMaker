I have a series of files which need to loop over them (I am using glob)and execute my python script.the pattern of file name is:the two numbers consecutively increase so as the next file is:...0.124 ...0.125and so on.I am not able to find a regex for this pattern.
You can use regex :  to get ,  etc. in a group
In my opinion, using os.walk is much safer than trying to use glob.If you know the path you can try searchDir2 for python2.7 or searchDir35 for python 3.5. Python 3.5 performs much better on large directories.
