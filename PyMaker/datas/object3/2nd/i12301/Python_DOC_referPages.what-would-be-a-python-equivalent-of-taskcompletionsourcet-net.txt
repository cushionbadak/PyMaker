I've tried to rewrite your code in  way but please pay attention: function  has been changed to : The code is still not very pythonic but I hope you'll get my point.
Assuming the provider is a python thread. You can use the join(timeout) method which waits for the thread to compete or the timeout. join() always returns None so to check if the thread is still alive you need to use isAlive(). Here is one option in implementing the taskCompletion
