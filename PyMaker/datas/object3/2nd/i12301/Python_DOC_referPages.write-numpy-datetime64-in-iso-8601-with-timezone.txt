How can the time zone be controlled when writing numpy datetime64 objects as an ISO 8601 string?  Specifically, I would like the time zone to be "+0000", just like the input below.  For this very simple example I just want it to print back the original string.For me, it returnsI am using python 3.4, numpy 1.9.2, and windows.This question is similar, but the first two answers don't actually answer the question and the third answer is specific to unix.
Thanks to ShadowRanger for getting me going in the right direction.  item gets naive datetime from datetime64, then replace time zone with UTC since I know that's what it is in this case, then get it in ISO format with the 'T' separator.
