The program takes a single string as a command line argument. It should print out the number of character classes contained in that string, e.g. for .I use a for loop to include four character classes: digits, lower case characters, upper case characters and special characters, i.e. everything else. 
Following zondo's answer, this is what I came up with:
Another approach but using a set comprehension + nextoutput:A second one, but this time using collections.Counter + next:Output:As you can see, there are many ways of doing it, the last one give you how many characters in each character class.Another way, but this time leveraging the strings module of the stdlib:output:You can of course use the Counter here as well.However I believe that the last technique using the string helpers might be heavier in terms of loops because I had to check if the character is in each predefined list.
