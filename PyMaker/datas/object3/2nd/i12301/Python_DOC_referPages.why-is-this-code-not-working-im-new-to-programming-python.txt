What am i doing wrong?I can't figure it out, i hope you can help ^-^And if you are able to teach me how to improve my programming then feel free to write me how to do it! Im open for learning new stuff btw sorry for my bad english :3 (edit: When i guess the right number, it still says "Nope!" and i have to guess another number.)
This looks like Python3. If so, use  instead.  In Python3  returns a string and you're comparing that string to an integer which will never work. So convert the return value of  to an integer to be sure you're comparing apples to apples.
You need to put int in front of input, so:This will turn guess into an integer, so the code recognises it.
The  command returns a string and a string is not equal to a number ( evaluates to ). You can use the  function to turn a string (or floating-point number) into an integer.I'm assuming you're using Python 3.x given that  is a function. If you were using Python 2.x, you should use  instead, as  causes the interpreter to treat what was entered as Python code and execute it (like the  function does).In 99.999 % of all cases, you do not want to execute user input. ;-)
Another rather major thing your program needs is to prompt the user so they know what they will be doing with your program exactly. I've added the prompt accordingly.
