I have a strange problem. Trying to write a network app in python. Currently I am using osx and I have troubles with sockets. My code works fine on debian, but when I try to use  on a connected tcp socket I get this error: 
Are you using non-blocking sockets, or timeouts? According to this table, Errno 35 is  on OSX; according to Apple man pages :[]The socket is marked non-blocking, and the receive operation would block, or a  receive timeout had been set, and the timeout expired before data were received.It could also be possible that  was called with non-zero value (in which case  would return non-none value.See also Spurious recv() EAGAIN on OSX?; Blocking socket returns EAGAIN.
