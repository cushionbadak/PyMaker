Natural Text
I am trying to use setattr on a UI element (QLineEdit) to fill in with what was read from a text file.   I believe in order to set a QlineEdit it would be self.lineEdit.setText() The text file I am reading consists of a Name and it's value:Name1=Value1splitLine[0] consists of "Name1", and splitLine[1] is "Value1".  self.Name1 is the name of the lineEdit I am changing, hence I used eval() to pass the actual value "Name1" to setattr.I am not sure how to go about setting the value.  Right now I have tried these with no success:Also, using:Does not work as it thinks the actual object is called splitLine, rather than it's value (hence why I tried eval() ).
You need to use , not . That is, you first need to get the line-edit object (via its attribute name), so that you can then call its  method to populate the field:or in one line:
There's no need for ;  contains strings, which is the required type for the second argument and sufficient for the third argument.
