I am writing a program that calculates the Pascal Identity of two variables, hard coded into the program, as I am new into Python and trying out caching and memoization. Here is what I have so far: My function will output the final real answer with what it has now, but with a lot of outputted answers. I cannot seem to get how to properly store the values to be used in the cache.How do I properly use  to store the  values I have already used?Thank you.
Lets see. First, you have a function of two variables, but store result in cache only by one parameter. So , ,  will have one result in your cache. Lets rewrite your function a little:Yes there is no counter variable because I didn't realize why do you need it :)Also, as far as I can judge by the use of , you probably use the Python3.x. If so, you can use standard cache implementing:Good luck! :)
