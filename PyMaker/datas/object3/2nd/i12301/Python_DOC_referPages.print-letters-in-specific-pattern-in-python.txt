LATE FOR THE SHOW BUT READY TO GOAnother way, is to define your function which converts nC into CCCC...C (ntimes), then pass it to a  to apply it on every element of the list  coming from the  over , the finally  them all, as follows:Or if you want to put all of these into one single function definition:EDIT :In case of the presence of  where the OP does not want this character to be repeated, then the best way in my opinion is to go with , it will make things easier, this way:
You could use  with  to check wheter your first symbol is digit or not and then return following string with appropriate count. Then you could use  to get your output:Demonstration:EDITUsing  module when first number is with several digits:Example:EDIT2For your input like:You could replace  with empty string and then add  to the end if the work from list endswith the  symbol:Output:EDIT3Solution without  module but with usual loops working for 2 digits. You could define functions:And then use them as:
One-liner Regex way: regex matches all  and captures zero or moredigit present before any word character into one group and the following word characters into another group. On replacement all the matched chars should be replaced with the value given in the replacement part. So this should loose  character.or
Assumes you are always printing single letter, but preceding number may be longer than single digit in base 10.
Loop the list, check first entry for number, and then append the second digit onwards:
