Here's a snippet to play with to see:Without the  defined, IPython would simply output something along  instead of falling back to . Unless you e.g. explicitly call  or , in which the  will be used.So, you should define a  in the object.What purpose is  nowadays then?It's not that  replaces  in Python 3 or anything, but  merely returns a readable reprentation of the object, while  is a more complete unambiguous representation (to the point where you can even reconstruct the object from the  output)
