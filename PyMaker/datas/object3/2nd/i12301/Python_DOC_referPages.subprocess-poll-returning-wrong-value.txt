I am starting a process and storing it in a variable:If I print the variable I can see that the value is stored.I can see that  is indeed started.However when I check the  value I am getting  instead of When I am stopping the process I do it like so:Sometimes (a lot of the time) it works, I can stop and start the process, read the value from  successfully, however it appears to be unreliable. Any idea why this could be happening?
I can see that  is indeed started.if  returns a non- value; it means the process is dead and moreover it is reaped already (the status is read) i.e., you won't see anything in the process table. If you see something after ; it means that you are looking at a different process e.g., the child process started by  might have started a grandchild process in turn and  exited while the grandchild continues to run or you might see some unrelated to your script process. Compare  with what you see in the process table, to find out which scenario you are observing (if they are close then the former is more likely than the latter). The meaning of the specific return code depends on a command e.g.,  returns  in case of an error (otherwise it returns the exit status of the remote command that it runs --  indicates wrong argument to the  builtin in bash and therefore it is less likely that the remote program produces it). Remove , to see errors as @Andrea Corbellini suggested.
