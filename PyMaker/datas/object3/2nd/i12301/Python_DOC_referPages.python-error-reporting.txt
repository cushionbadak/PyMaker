I've recently started development with Python, and I've noticed that whenever my code generates an runtime error, the details flash into the output for a split-second and then the program closes. Is there a way to either stop the program from closing when this happens or to log the errors into a textfile?
In addition to the suggestions in the comments which all work well, you can always (and should always) use the  module. You can set up basic logging facilities quickly, and it allows to change the level of information displayed to the user.(From the 'Python Module of The Week' website)You can log to different levels (i.e. info, warning, debug, error) and have those displayed while the code is running, or hiding them, by setting the level arg of .How To LoggingLogging Cookbook
To sum up the above comments, you can:run your file from the command-line with log the errors to any text file with use a Python IDE like PyCharmAll of the above should help you reading the error stack trace.
