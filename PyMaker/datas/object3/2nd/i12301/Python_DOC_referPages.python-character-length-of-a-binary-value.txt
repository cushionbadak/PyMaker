Natural Text
I am looking for way to determine the number of characters my binary value takes up. For example if my values binary values were 4, 20, and 60 I'd get the following results:
A positive integer n has b bits when 2b-1 ≤ n ≤ 2b – 1. So The number of bits required to represent an integer n is : And since you have  at the leading you need to add 2 to aforementioned formula.So it would be :And in python you can use  module like following:Example :As a more Pythonic way you can also use  which returns the number of bits needs to represent an integer object. So for get the number of require characters you can add it with 2 :
