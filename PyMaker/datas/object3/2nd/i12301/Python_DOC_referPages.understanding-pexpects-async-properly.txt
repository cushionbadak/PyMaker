I'm trying to write a gdb frontend using pexpect to communicate with gdb/mi. I'm new to pexpect and trying to figure out async property of expect_exact() function. I wrote a simple test which looks like this:In main I simply call attach() and then test() functions. The result is this:Works as expected, but if I pass the argument async as True in the function send_command(), the result output becomes something like this:It only prints the result of the first command executed(which is . Why does this happen? What's the proper usage of async property?
From  docs:On Python 3.4, or Python 3.3 with  installed, passing    will make this return an  coroutine,  which you can  to get the same result that this method would  normally give directly. So, inside a coroutine, you can replace this code:With this non-blocking form:See coroutines.
