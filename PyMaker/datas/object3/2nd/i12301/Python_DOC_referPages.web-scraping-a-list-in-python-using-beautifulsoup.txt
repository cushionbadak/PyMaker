I am new at Python and trying to learn how to use BeautifulSoup to scrape a webpage. For starters, I was just using yahoo.com's HTML code:view-source:https://www.yahoo.com/I wanted to scrape the list of links starting on row 577 and ending at 633 and get their URL and the title and put it in table in Python. So far, I have the following:I am unsure of how to proceed further from this. All the examples I am finding are for web scraping from tables but I am not finding much on how to do it on a list.Does anyone have any suggestions?Thanks,Nick
If you need only scrape specific lines, you need get these line before you scrape it. I'd suggest use  and a list slice to get them.For example:The output is: split the HTML source code by lines, and gives a list.  is a list slice, which slices the list, and gives lines from 576 to 634. I added two more lines because without them, the output will be:And which isn't a valid HTML code block. joins the list by , and gives another string which you want.After we have the specific lines : finds all the  HTML tags in the string (HTML code block) we have, and gives a list of these tags.Then, we use  loop over the list, and use  to get the  attribute (the link you want) of the  tag.You can also use a list comprehension to put the result into a list, rather than print it out: is the list which you're looking for.If you also want get the title of these links, you can use  to get it. However, there's no table object in Python, I think you mean :So you can use  to get the dict you want.In this case,  (title) is the keys in that dict, for example  and .And  is the value (links), for example  and .You can access the value by  as my code above.
