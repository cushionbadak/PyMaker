Natural Text
I've attempted to find this but I end up finding code that replaces that one specific word.I've been using this code:so lets say I have a text file which contains  and I want to replace this with . If I were to do this with the above code how would I? The name will stay the same but the number will not. Since the number is different to each name I'll be unable to search for the number which is why I'm searching for the name. I was thinking of using  but that only changes the one phrase whereas I would want the whole line to change.Edit: This would be made under the assumption that the text file has multiple names of different people with different numbers. I would want it to search for that specific name and replace the whole line.  Thanks!
You can check line by line to modify and modify the original to save changes:
In general, there are many ways, one of them would be:Using built-in method:But this has the effect of creating a new file.EDIT:If you want to do inplace replacement, then you can use  module, this way:Quoting from docs: ...   Optional in-place filtering:  if the keyword argument inplace=True is passed to fileinput.input() or  to the FileInput constructor, the file is moved to a backup file and  standard output is directed to the input file (if a file of the same  name as the backup file already exists, it will be replaced silently).  This makes it possible to write a filter that rewrites its input file  in place.
