Natural Text
I accidentally wrote:instead of:I searched the net and could not find anything. So what happened, why does Python think I mean what I am typing?Computers trust us too much. :)
This is the same as if you were to do like , except positive instead of negative. It basically is the same as  though, as adding a + before a value does not change it.This is called an unary operator as there is only one argument (ex: ) instead of two (ex: ).This link explains it a little more.
If you are interested in catching this type of errors early, you can do that with static code analysis. For example, :In this case, it is complaining about the extra space after the , thinking that you actually meant . This would have helped you to discover the problem earlier.FYI,  would catch that too.
It thinks you're doing , which sets  equal to .  before a variable without another value causes the variable's  method to be called. For most types, this is a , but there are certain types, e.g.  that implement .
