I have some code that takes numbers separated by spaces from input(). I tried to call .split() on it but for some reason it turns [56 78 90 1 2 3] into [78.0, 90.0, 1.0, 2.0]. Thanks
"some reason" is that you're calling  which converts the value to  type.
It does this because you're using float(x).  Use an integer value if all of your numbers will be integers.  Otherwise, you can expect additional decimal places when using the float function.
You start out with the string . It is split by whitespaces giving . Notice the brackets in the first and last element!You then interpret each element as a float which fails on  and , causing the program to enter the  case that you carefully chose to not utilize.Here is how you would turn an integer string into a proper list that could be iterated over, so that you could reinterpret the numbers as floats for whatever reason you would want that:Why are you passing around a bunch of integers as a string anyway? Could you show the place in your code where  comes into existence?
