Can my Python script take its arguments from a file, rather than the command line? I don't mind passing the file containing the arguments on the command line.I am using argparse.The reason is that I have a very complex argument list. I suppose that I could just wrap the call in a batch file, or another Python script, but I wondered if this is possible and thought that I would ask and maybe learn something.So, instead of , can I where args.txt contains
You can tell the parser that arguments beginning with certain characters are actually names of files containing more arguments. From the documentation:The parser reads from  and treats each line as a separate argument.
You can do this by taking command line argument as filename and then opening it. likeHere you get the list of user argument in the list user_argument. Perheps you will get what you want!
