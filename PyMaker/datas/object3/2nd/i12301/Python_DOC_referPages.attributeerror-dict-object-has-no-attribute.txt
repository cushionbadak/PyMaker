I am new to python and couldn't find the answer to this. Referring to the code at the end of the message, can I know what does the part "for item, total in totals.items()" in the line below mean?Also, the code failed and saidAttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'predictors'when I changed all instances of "item(s)" in the code to "predictor(s)". Why is that so?
The  iterates over the key-value pairs of a dictionary. Therefore  will loop over each pair. This is documented information and you can check it out in the official web page, or even easier, open a python console and type . And now, just as an example:The  is an exception thrown when an object does not have the attribute you tried to access. The class  does not have any  attribute (now you know where to check it :) ), and therefore it complains when you try to access it. As easy as that.
