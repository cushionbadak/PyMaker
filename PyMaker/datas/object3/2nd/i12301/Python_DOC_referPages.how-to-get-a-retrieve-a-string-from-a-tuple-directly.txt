Is there anyway to directly access only one of these four values from the tuple and store it? so that i can make a new object of type Card and then set its suit, only to one of the four values in the tuple. i would like to take a string as the input parameter e.g myCard = Card(HEARTS) 
You can validate against SUITS.If invalid suit given, may you raise a One can now create an instance byAnother way could be to use Enum's here:
Within your class you need to prefix  with  (or ) like this:I wouldn't bother with validating the  argument; if an invalid value is supplied  will raise  if it is out of range, or  if a non-integer argument is supplied. You could catch either exception and raise your own, if you wanted.
In case you want to assign  to the given name if the value is among the acceptable ones and otherwise assign it to a default valueNote: I agree with @keksnicoh's approach (upvoted), which raises an exception.Another way can be to pass the default value as a parameter as well (explicit is better than implicit, remember?)However, you should still check if the default values is among the possible values and at that point raise and exception (or add it to them, depending on your goals)
