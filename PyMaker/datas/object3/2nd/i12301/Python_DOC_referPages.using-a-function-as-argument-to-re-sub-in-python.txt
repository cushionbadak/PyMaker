I'm writing a program to split the words contained in an hashtag.For example I want to split the hashtags:into:I'm having troubles when using  with a functional argument.The code I've written is:For example when using these functions like this:The output I obtain is:Which is not the output I had expected:Why is this happening? In particular I've used the suggestion from this answer but I don't understand what goes wrong in this code.
Notice that  returns the entire string that matched, whether or not it was part of a capturing group: also returns the entire match:In contrast,  returns all capturing groups:and  returns the first capturing group:So the problem in your code originates with the use of  in sincewhereas if you had used , you would have gottenand the preceding  makes all the difference:Thus, changing  to , and substituting  for , prints since, alas,  is longer than .One way you could have debugged this is to replace the  function with a regular function and then add print statements:That would focus your attention on which you could then compare withThat would lead you to ask the question, if  returns , what method do I need to return . A dive into the docs then solves the problem.
