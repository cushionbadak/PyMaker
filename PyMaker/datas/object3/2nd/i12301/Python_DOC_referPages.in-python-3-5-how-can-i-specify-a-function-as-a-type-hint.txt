What is the appropriate type hint to specify that a variable should be a function (the equivalent of a delegate,  or  in C#)?Is it also possible to specify the function argument types in a generic fashion as well (for example )?I cannot find any relevant details in the documentation.
According to the docs, you can use Callable, imported from typing.You can view more details in PEP 0484.
