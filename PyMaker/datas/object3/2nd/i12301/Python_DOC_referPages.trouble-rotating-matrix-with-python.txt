I've created a function that successfully rotates the outside layer of a matrix.  I've tried adding a loop so that it does the same thing for the interior layers of the matrix, but I haven't had any luck.Is there a way I could change this slightly to allow for rotation of the interior layers?I am trying to do this without using any libraries or built in functions.
This will rotate the matrix by 90 degrees.Notice the rotation is not done in-place, another matrix is allocated for the result.
Maybe you are looking for numpy.transpose()?
What do you think about using zip() as shown in the following:
