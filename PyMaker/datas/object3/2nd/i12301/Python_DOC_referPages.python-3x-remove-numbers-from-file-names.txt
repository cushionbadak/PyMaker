The code above doesn't rename the file by removing the integers. Can anyone help? (Python 3x)

In Python 3 the String.translate is gone.  Therefore you need to use the str.translate. It needs 'str.maketrans' which normally creates a translation table with the first two arguments supplied(not needed in this example), the third argument supplies the characters to be stripped.This line should have the desired effect ...Previous suggestions used .strip() however in this case as the numbers are mixed in with the filenames (not before or after) I believe it would not work, another used Regular Expressions which is perfectly valid, however within the context of this particular Udacity course translate was the suggested solution.Here are the docs for maketrans : [https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.maketrans][1]
The problem is in your translate function that doesn't do anything. There are better options available, but if your want to use translate then the proper syntax is:
Here is one way of renaming files.Use  to rename the files  Use  to remove numbersCode is given below:To read more about  check here.To read more about the  function, check here.
Another way to do this without . Instead of utilizing the , use the .Another observation is that your code wont read the new file name after changing it. At the top of your code you are reading file names and saving those name in In the for loop, where you are changing the name of each file, YOU ARE NOT reading the new file's name. You need to do something like this.
