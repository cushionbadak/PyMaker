Here initially  is of type  but in the loop it is getting converted to  although I am performing integer by integer division. Why is it so?
You have to use: And your val will remain being an integerThe behavior of  was changed with this: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0238/The  module docs give also a hint about the separation between  (returning a float) and  which returns the floor and therefore an https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html
It is specified in the Semantics for True division in :True division for s and s will convert the arguments to     and then apply a  division.  That is, even  will    return a  (), not an .  For s and , it       will be the same as classic division.So an automatic conversion is performed when an  is found. Note that this is the default behaviour in Python 3. In python 2 you'll need to  from  in order to have similar results.
