I'm new to Python and I'm currently solving questions to improve my coding skills. I had come across a questions where I need to find common elements from 3  in python and print the number of common elements. My code and procedure below:First, I found the common elements from the first two  and stored them in a new  and then took the third  and found the common elements in the  and added them into a new  and found the length of the final . I was thinking what if the length of the  are very high, say 4000 and two  loops running for 4000 iterations is time consuming as per my understanding. So how can one opitimize such questions and what is a better way to solve these type of questions and what methods can be used to improve the code with better performance and produce output in less time. Please help me in understanding this. Thanks in advance. Your help is much appreciated.
Have a look at set.intersection:
If you store lists as sets, they lose their order but have much faster lookups, so that'd work in this case. Then you can just use list comprehension to check if any value is in all 3 of them. Alternatively you can use set intersection to find the values in each, which may possibly be faster.
Using sets intersection seems to be the best way here. This will print the common elements only.
