I am writing a Python 3 C extension where I want to use a MappingProxyType (). From what I saw in the Cpython source code, MappingProxyType is written in Python and not in C.How can I use this type from C? I imagine there must be something like an C-level "import" and then I could find the PyObject (or rather, PyTypeObject) from the name as a C string.
There's a C API for for importing modules. Then you just need to get the  type attribute from the module:
