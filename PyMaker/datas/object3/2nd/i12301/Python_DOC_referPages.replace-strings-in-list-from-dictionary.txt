I'm having some issues with my code:Expected output = , It currently does not replace any occurrences of .  I'm wondering if my sentence loop is correct or not?  Printing  after this prints out exactly what is in .
I guess the (try to rename the variable to , I think that is more appropriate) has lots of items, working example from 
I ran your code verbatim and it worked, but only prints the last "i". If you move the print into the for loop you get what you expected.output:
Using regex:
The replacement occurs on a variable inside the loopSo nothing is changed in the  listTo fix this make a new list with the changed items in itAnother way with mapAnother way with a list comprehension
Using  is problematic, as a word could be a part of another word. Better use  with regular expression , with  being "word boundary", and use a callback function to get the replacement from the dictionary (or the word itself, if it is not in the dict).Also, not that by assigning to  within the loop, you are only changing the value bound to the variable ; you are not changing the string in the list! For this, you have to assign to the list element at that index, or use a list comprehension, as in my example.
