Please explain to me the following. If I execute this:I get this:I understand the first three lines of the output. But why do I have to give the name of the first base class to  in order to get the method of the second base class?
You are mucking with the Method Resolution Order, or MRO. Python class inheritance hierarchies are linearised, given a specific order, according to a system called the C3 linearisation. uses that order to find the next attribute (including methods) in that ordering. Given a current instance, and a class, it'll search the order for an attribute past the given class. For both  classes, the MRO lists the  class first, followed by  and . In your last example you told  to go looking in that MRO starting from the next class after , so only  remains to be found.You can ask any class for its MRO by calling the  method: can be used outside methods too; you can then easily see what happens when you pick different starting points for the search:
