I need to join a list and a matrix using python. The matrix/2d list holds column definitions - column name and datatype. The data is not ordered by the right column positions. Example:The list contains only the column names but it is ordered correctly, which is very important for me. Example:What I want to perform:I want to order the matrix/2d list so it will be ordered exactly like the list. The list and matrix, of course,  hold the names of the same columns. If it was SQL I would just join the two and query the column names from the list (so that the order is kept) and the type from the joined 2d array. How can I perform this in python?
You can use the key param of the standar function sorted (available since Python 2.4):Ref: Sorting Mini-HOW TO, Key functionsOld answerGoing simple, it might be fancier solutions but this solve your problem for sure, just create another matrix using the .
As a quick workaround using  I would suggest the following:Please keep in mind that this approach works only with Python 3.2 and above and is based on this answer.
