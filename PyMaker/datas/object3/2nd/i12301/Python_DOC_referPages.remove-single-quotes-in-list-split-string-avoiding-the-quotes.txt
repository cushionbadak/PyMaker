Is it possible to split a string and to avoid the quotes(single)? I would like to remove the single quotes from a list(keep the list, strings and floats inside:desired output:next line works neither with int nor float
To get  or  based on what each value looks like, so  becomes  and  becomes , you can use  to convert the same way Python's literal parser does, so you have an actual  of s and s, rather than a  of  (that would include the quotes when echoed):Unlike plain , this doesn't open security holes since it can't execute arbitrary code.You could use  for a mild performance boost here (since  is a built-in implemented in C; normally,  gains little or loses out to list comprehensions), in Py 2,  or in Py3 (where  returns a generator, not a ), If the goal is purely to display the strings without quotes, you'd just format manually and avoid type conversions entirely:
The quotes are not part of the strings in your list, so it is not possible to remove them. The output is displaying quotes around the elements of your list to indicate that you are dealing with strings.You can convert all items in your list  to floats withorHowever, this is not "removing the quotes" from the items of your list, it is converting your list of strings to a list of floats. When printed, the floats are not displayed with quotes around them because they are not strings.

The reason your next line doesn't work is because you have an  instead of an
