I searched and found question with same heading is also (here here here here here) but I am not asking that. I came across the problem:To write a function to flatten a list. The list contains other lists, strings, or ints.And my code for the same isBut when I check the code for test cases: : The checker tells me the output is but in codeskulptor I get the correct output which is     .    : The checker tells the output is  but in codeskulptor tells .    This problem exists with many test cases.Then I checked my code in python tutor and found out that after the if statement is executed each time the list  is returned and at-last when the function comes to halt it returns the last edited list .How can I resolve this issue please help me with this and yes I am new to python and do not know anything about itertools, lambda function usage, generators etc. so please tell me in the context in which I can understand.
Your code is relying on a global; if the checker calls your function twice, it'll receive a longer list than expected:Don't use globals. Use a local list, and and extend it with the result of recursive calls:Note that I switched to using  to test for the type. This version doesn't suffer from shared state leaking into the next call:
