This question already has an answer here:Reading binary file and looping over each byte                    10 answers                Is there an iterator for reading a file byte by byte?
There isn't an iterator for byte by byte but it is easier enough to create a generator to do it:But this really isn't very efficient, and it's not clear what you are trying to do.
You can  the file, if you're using *nix or Windows. This should be the most efficient way to iterate over the bytes of a file:
