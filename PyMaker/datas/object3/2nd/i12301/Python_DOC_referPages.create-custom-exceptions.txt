Is there a way to shorten the following scenario so i don't have to use an ugly nested try except statement?What i want can be described as following pseudo code:I don't want to raise the error if the try statement succeeds, however if i raise an exception in the exception statement like this:it can't be caught with an other except, since there is already an except that caught the python exception and the interpreter throws a SyntaxError.Am i missing something obvious?I'm aware that you probably would never use this in an actual program, but i'm curious about the theory.
There is no reason to use an exception here. The following (pseudo-)code achieves the same thing.Note however that it generally is a bad idea to catch all exceptions, since for instance the  Exception will also be caught and the program can thus not be interrupted using 
Create custom exceptions?The Python Tutorial has a section on User-defined Exceptions
