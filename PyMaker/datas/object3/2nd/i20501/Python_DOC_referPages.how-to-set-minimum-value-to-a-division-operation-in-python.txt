Is there a standard library  function which will set a minimum value to a division operation, for example:This will ensure that min value of operation above will always be 1, never 0.Such as:Also, how do I round up a division:I always get "0" when I divide 1/5, even with ceil function:
If you want to use floating point division as default, you can do :If you need the result to be of integer type, e.g. for indexing, you can use
The result of  is an integer already. If you want the floating point version you need to do . The  function will then work as you expect: .If you're working with variables instead of constants, use the  function to convert an integer into a floating point.

You could make a round up function for integers like thisYour example doesn't work because an integer dividing an integer is an integer.As for your min question - what you wrote is probably the best you can do.
I don't know about anything in the standard library, but if you are just trying to make sure the answer is never less than 1, the function is pretty easy:If, instead, you are looking to round up every answer:This will round up any answer with a remainder.I believe Python 3.3 (and I know 3.4) return a float by default for integer division:  https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html
