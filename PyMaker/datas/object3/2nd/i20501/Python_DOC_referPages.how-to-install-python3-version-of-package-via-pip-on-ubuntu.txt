You may want to build a  of python3, then install packages of python3 after activating the virtualenv. So your system won't be messed up :)This could be something like:
Ubuntu 12.10+ and Fedora 13+ have a package called  which will install  (or ,  or  for newer versions) without needing this jumping through hoops.I came across this and fixed this without needing the likes of  or virtualenvs (assuming Ubuntu 12.04):Install package : run , this will give you the command .Install pip using Python 3's setuptools: run , this will give you the command  like kev's solution.Install your PyPI packages: run  (installing python packages into your base system requires root, of course).â€¦Profit!
Short AnswerSource: Shashank Bharadwaj's commentLong AnswerThe short answer applies only on newer systems. On some versions of Ubuntu the command is :If it doesn't work, this method should work for any Linux distro and supported version:If you don't have , use . If you don't have , switch to . If  symlink does not exists, check for something like pip-3.XMuch python packages require also the dev package, so install it too:Sources:python installing packages with pipPip latest install Check also Tobu's answer if you want an even more upgraded version of Python.I want to add that using a virtual environment is usually the preferred way to develop a python application, so @felixyan answer is probably the best in an ideal world. But if you really want to install that package globally, or if need to test / use it frequently without activating a virtual environment, I suppose installing it as a global package is the way to go.
Well, on ubuntu 13.10/14.04, things are a little different.InstallInstall packagesNOT 
The easiest way to install latest / and corresponding packages:Note: please run these commands as 
I had the same problem while trying to install pylab, and I have found this linkSo what I have done to install pylab within Python 3 is:It has worked properly, and as you can see in the link you can do this for every Python version you have, so I guess this solves your problem.
Old question, but none of the answers satisfies me.  One of my systems is running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and for some reason there's no package  or  for Python 3.  So here is what I've done (all commands were executed as root):Install  for Python3 in case you haven't.orWith Python 2.4+ you can invoke  with specific Python version by using .  So  for Python 3 could be installed by:That's it, you got  for Python 3.  Now just invoke  with the specific version of Python to install package for Python 3.  For example, with Python 3.2 installed on my system, I used:
If you have pip installed in both pythons, and both are in your path, just use:References:http://www.pip-installer.org/docs/pip/en/0.8.3/news.html#id4https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/200This is a duplicate of question #2812520
If your system has  as default, use below command to install packages to 
Easy enough:If you want Python 3.3, which isn't the default as of Ubuntu 12.10:
You can alternatively just run  instead of ,
Firstly, you need to install pip for the Python 3 installation that you want. Then you run that pip to install packages for that Python version.Since you have both pip and python 3 in /usr/bin, I assume they are both installed with a package manager of some sort. That package manager should also have a Python 3 pip. That's the one you should install.Felix' recommendation of virtualenv is a good one. If you are only testing, or you are doing development, then you shouldn't install the package in the system python. Using virtualenv, or even building your own Pythons for development, is better in those cases.But if you actually do want to install this package in the system python, installing pip for Python 3 is the way to go.
Although the question relates to Ubuntu, let me contribute by saying that I'm on Mac and my  command defaults to Python 2.7.5. I have Python 3 as well, accessible via , so knowing the pip package origin, I just downloaded it and issued  against it and, surely enough, only Python 3 has now this module inside its site packages. Hope this helps a wandering Mac-stranger.
Execute the pip binary directly.First locate the version of PIP you want.Then execute.
You should install ALL dependencies:Install pip3(if you have installed, please look step 3):Iinstall scikit-learn by pip3Open your terminal and entry python3 environment, type  to check  it.Gook Luck!
If you just installed Python 3.3 and now want to install pip 3.3 locally:This works in Ubuntu 12.04. Don't forget to add  to your path.
Another way to install python3 is using wget. Below are the steps for installation.Also,one can create an alias for the same usingNow open a new terminal and type py and press Enter.
