This question already has an answer here:Understanding Python super() with __init__() methods [duplicate]                    7 answers                I can not understand the usage of  term here? Is it a class or function or something else ?From the code below:Can someone please explain this line of code below ?
It provides a nice shorthand for calling a method on the parent class without having to type it explicitly, which can be long (programmers are lazy) and error-prone. If you change your code later such that  is not a  anymore but a  instead, you don't have to change the call to the constructor (which is itself required as it will not be called by default)Note that the case here is obvious, since there is only one base class, but in case where there is an ambiguity (e.g. two or more parent classes), mro prevails (as you would expect I suppose, since that's what it is about):
Means: Call the method  of the base type of  with the instance . So in your case, this would be equivalent to . But using  lets you avoid explicitely naming the base type again and also works for multiple inheritance.So  basically means get the base type(s) of the type , and bind it to the instance  so you can call methods directly.Note that in Python 3, the arguments to  are optional, so  works.
 is the constructor in python, and  is the parent class which you inherit your class from.For this code whenever you insatiate a new object of type  it will call its constructor  which in its turn calls
