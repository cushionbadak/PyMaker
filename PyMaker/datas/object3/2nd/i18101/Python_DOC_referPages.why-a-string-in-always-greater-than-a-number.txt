This question already has an answer here:How does Python 2 compare string and int? Why do lists compare as greater than numbers, and tuples greater than lists?                    2 answers                I just noticed that Python allows you to compare a string value with a number:Why is any string always greater than any number?
In Python 2, ยง5.3 - Comparisons says:Objects of different types, except different numeric types and different string types, never compare equal; such objects are ordered consistently but arbitrarily (so that sorting a heterogeneous array yields a consistent result). Furthermore, some types (for example, file objects) support only a degenerate notion of comparison where any two objects of that type are unequal. Again, such objects are ordered arbitrarily but consistently. The , ,  and  operators will raise a TypeError exception when any operand is a complex number.In Python 3, ยง4.3 - Comparisons says:Objects of different types, except different numeric types, never compare equal. Furthermore, some types (for example, function objects) support only a degenerate notion of comparison where any two objects of that type are unequal. The , ,  and  operators will raise a TypeError exception when comparing a complex number with another built-in numeric type, when the objects are of different types that cannot be compared, or in other cases where there is no defined ordering.
