Here is the code:The error I'm getting is:But the first argument to  is supposed to be a string according to the docs... so what is going on?I'm assuming I'm using at least Python 3 since I'm using the latest version of LiClipse.

Without having your file to test on try encoding to utf-8 on the 'open'
