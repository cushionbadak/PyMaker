I have doubt on python regex operation. Here you go my sample test.Why does the 2nd regex condition doesn't give match object though the 1st regex gives match object for a normal string match condition, irrespective of special characters is available in the string? However, \w+ will matches for [a-z,A-Z,_]. I'm not clear why (\w+) gives matched object for the string 'a-b'. How can I check whether  the given string doesn't contain any special characters?
Taking a look at the actual match will give you an idea of what happens.As you can see, the expression matched . The character sequence  only contains actual word characters, but not separators like dashes. So you can’t actually match  using just a .Now in the second expression one might think that it would match  at least, given that  matches  and  does match the . However it does not happen due to how  works. As the documentation hints, it only tries to match “at the beginning of ”. So when using  there is an implicit  at the beginning of the expression that makes it only match from the start. So it actually tries to find a match starting with .Instead, you can use  which actually looks in the whole string if it can match the expression anywhere. So there, you will get a result:For further information on the  vs.  topic, check this section in the manual.And finally, if you want to match dashes too, you can use a character sequence  for example:
The first matches the  - one or more word chars.The second is one or more word chars immediately followed by a  which there aren't... (the equivalent of ) means a to z and A to Z - it isn't the literal hyphen in this context, if you did want a hyphen, put it as the first or last character of a character class.
Match's docs sayIf zero or more characters at the beginning of string match the  regular expression pattern, return a corresponding MatchObject  instance. method will return the matched object if it finds a match at the beginning of the string.  matches  in . will print In the second case (), the actual string which gets matched is , which is not at the beginning of the string. That's why its returning .How can I check whether the given string doesn't contain any special characters?I would say, the second regular expression which you have used should be enough and  function should be enough. I insist on , since there are differences between  and  http://docs.python.org/2.7/library/re.html#search-vs-matchRemember, you
