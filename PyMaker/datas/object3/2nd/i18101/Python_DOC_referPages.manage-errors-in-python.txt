This question already has an answer here:How to log python exception? [duplicate]                    5 answers                I need to manage python errors. For example when I type:I give back:but I need to save this error in a variable.I use try..except for this:and see in output:It's not enough for me. I need to error lines numbers like to IDLE (or other IDE)(I use python 3.3 and can't use python 2.7)
Use the  module to extract specific information such as line numbers:
You have saved the exception in a variable, . It's still bound to the exception, even after the  block.(The fact that  on an exception doesn't show all that much is a separate issue.)However, it sounds like you wanted the traceback object, not just the exception object. That doesn't get automatically bound to a variable for you, but you can do it manually:See  for more information.But a  object is a pretty heavy thing, and keeps all kinds of other heavy things alive as long as you store it. One way to avoid carrying around an object as heavy and inter-linked as the traceback is to extract just the information you want from it. That's what the  module is for:Now we're only carrying around a list of small tuples of strings and numbers, instead of the traceback object.Or, even more simply, just format it immediately:
