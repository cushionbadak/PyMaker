I wrote this program in order to be able to find the number of A/U and C/G pairs from the users input. When I run it, it keeps saying "Invalid Syntax" while highlighting the first "else:" after the while loop in red. Anyone know what I need to change to fix it? 
You have an  that isn't attached to any , , , or  statement, which is illegal.If you meant for the  to be attached to the , the solution is simple: Change the indentation to attach it:See  and  Statements, and  Clauses on Loops in the tutorial (and Compound statements in the language reference for full details).
Your  needs to be indented at the same level as your , which doesn't really make sense in this case because there's no  in your loop, or you need to add an  on some line before it.

Others have already explained the error.Try changing you  loops to this:Without any  or .Also the following snippet should do the same thing:
