I have several strings stored in a file one per line like this:As you can see the only character that is always present is the backlash , the rest being pretty random in its composition. I need to store the first and second part (ie: before and after the backlash respectively) of each line separately, so as to end up with something like this:I could do this in python iterating through each line, checking for the existence of the backlash and storing the contents of each part of the line separately. It would look like this:I'm looking for a prettier (more pythonic) version of this code.
 might come in handy here:One of the assumptions made here is that only a single  is present. Knowning that,  will always return a 2-tuple of elements. If this assumption is false, try  instead - it limits the number of splits to 1, counting left-to-right.
As well as  you could use :An alternative more functional oneliner:Explanation for the  in both options -  returns a tuple: . Here, we don't need the seperator (indeed I can't imagine why you ever would), so we assign it to the throwaway variable .Here are the docs for , and here are the docs for .
