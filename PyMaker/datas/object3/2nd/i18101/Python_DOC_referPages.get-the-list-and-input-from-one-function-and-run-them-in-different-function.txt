I think your problem is simple, and has nothing to do with how you're passing values between functions.In , you're reading a value from the user like this:The  function:… reads a line from input, converts it to a string (stripping a trailing newline), and returns that.So, if the user types  at the prompt, you get back the string .Now, you pass that value—perfectly correctly—to .In , you then try to compare it to various numbers, like this:But this will never be true. A string, like , is never equal to a number, like . They're not even the same kind of value, much less the same value.So, you need to do one of two things:Convert the input to an number. For example, change  to . OR…Write  to expect strings. For example, change  to .You may be wondering why that  didn't help you debug the problem. prints out the end-user-friendly string representation of whatever you give it. That is, it automatically calls the  function for you. For debugging purposes, you often want to use  instead of , to get the programmer-friendly string representation instead of the end-user-friendly string representation.For example,  will print out —just like , so you can't tell them apart. But  will print out , unlike , while prints , so you can tell them apart.  can also help you spot things like strings with invisible characters in them, having special "node" objects from a parser instead of just strings, etc.
