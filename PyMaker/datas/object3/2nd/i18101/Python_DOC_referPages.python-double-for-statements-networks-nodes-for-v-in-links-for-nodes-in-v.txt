I'm trying to generate a network with preferential attachment.So I'll start out with two nodes connected by an edge:I have sample code:Could someone translate what [something] for v in [list] for [something] in v might mean? I'm only used to the syntax for i in list: {do stuff}
is essentially what it is doing
That's a nested list comprehension.  That particular form is used to flatten a nested list.
From Wikipedia:A list comprehension is a syntactic construct available in some  programming languages for creating a list based on existing lists. It  follows the form of the mathematical set-builder notation (set  comprehension) as distinct from the use of map and filter functions.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_comprehension
