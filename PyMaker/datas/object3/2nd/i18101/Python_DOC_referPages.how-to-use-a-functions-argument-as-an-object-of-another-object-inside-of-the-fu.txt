I've been stuck on this for a long time (like literally weeks), I've completed everything else in the code but this. I've also researched a lot but can't get anywhere near the solution. The only reason I waited a week to come here is because I wanted to solve this myself, but now, I give up!Now, suppose I have the following code:Now, when I create an instance and try to call the method like this:It gives me an error for obvious reasons. How can I get it do what I want-- pass an argument to a function and use that argument as an object of another object? 
Looks like you want : is equivalent to  (where  in the second case is the string that the  of the first case holds). In this case,  is  and  is . From your snippet, it looks like you want to call the  attribute as opposed to returning it directly, which is why we have a  at the end.
