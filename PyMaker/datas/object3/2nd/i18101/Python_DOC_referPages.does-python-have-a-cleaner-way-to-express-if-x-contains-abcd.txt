This question already has an answer here:Check if a Python list item contains a string inside another string                    15 answers                The Pythonic way to check if a string  is a substring of  is:Finding if  is equivalent to , , , , ,  or  is also Pythonic:But checking if some string  contains either , , , , ,  or  seems clunky:Is there a more Pythonic method of checking if a string  contains an element of a list?I know it is trivial to write this myself using a loop or using a regex:but I was wondering if there was a cleaner way that does not involve regex.
The Pythonic approach would be to use :From the linked documentation: (iterable)Return True if any element of the iterable is true. If the iterable is empty, return False. Equivalent to:Also, notice that I've used a tuple instead of a list here. If your - values are pre-defined, then a tuple would indeed be preferred. See: Are tuples more efficient than lists in Python?
I think that's about as short & Pythonic as you can get it.
A bit late to the party, butwould work, and may be faster (algorithmically, but maybe not for smaller test cases).
without using  but simply gives
