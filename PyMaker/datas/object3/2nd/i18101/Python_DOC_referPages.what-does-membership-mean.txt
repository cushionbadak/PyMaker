What is membership, searching for this it looks like that term is used not just in Python.I found it while learning about sets, the documentation says:Common uses include membership testing, removing duplicates from a sequence, and computing mathematical operations such as intersection, union, difference, and symmetric difference.
Membership means that a value is in the set:is True if  is indeed one of the values present in the set. Those values in the set are called 'members'.The term is a mathematical one and basically is synonimous with 'element', which is what most people use when talking about membership in lists and tuples.The  operator tests for membership, whatever the container you are testing against:The operators  and  test for collection membershipSets are not the only collections; any container with elements can support membership. In addition to sets, lists and tuples, strings and dictionaries also support membership tests for example.
All containers work with the  operator, which tests membership.  That includes built-in containers like , , , and ; and specialized containers from the  module.For technical details, see: What exactly are "containers" in python? (And what are all the python container types?)
