so I did this:But the resulting list is:    [['Date', 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close'], ['2011-10-10', '26.58', '26.97', '26.47',    '26.94'], ['2011-10-07', '26.34', '26.51', '26.20', '26.25'], ['2011-10-06', '25.90',     '26.40', '25.70', '26.34']]when it should be:    ['Date', 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close'], ['2011-10-10', '26.58', '26.97', '26.47',     '26.94'], ['2011-10-07', '26.34', '26.51', '26.20', '26.25'], ['2011-10-06', '25.90',     '26.40', '25.70', '26.34']Can i eliminate the double list somehow?
Is this what you're looking for?Doing  will result in the following table being printed out, with a gap of 4 spaces between each column:You can modify the code so it returns a string instead by doing this:Edit:If you want to only include the first  rows, you could use the below function and call . In essence, we're truncating each row to the first five before printing it.
With this you can easily customize the appearance, even though it's "less automatic" than Michael's solution:Result:Want to display the first columnn centered, all the others right aligned, a large gap in the last one and omit the open column? just a minor change to the format string:(See the format string syntax)  And you get:
There are really many ways to do this if you just want your output to look pretty then as the two responses have pointed out you can do that quite easily. If you just want a generality then your code as everything it needs you'd just have to However if you want to generate a list of lines you'd have to do the following:but for simple pretty output you get you get rid of the date, open line and do this:Hope this helps. Though LeartS has his formatting far better best practice style.
