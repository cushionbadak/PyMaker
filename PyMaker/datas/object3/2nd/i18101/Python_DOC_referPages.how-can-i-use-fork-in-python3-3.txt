how can i use fork() in Python3.3**This is My code :Input:Output:
 is only available in Unix-like system. You cannot use that in Windows.Fork a child process. Return 0 in the child and the childâ€™s process id  in the parent. If an error occurs OSError is raised.Note that some platforms including FreeBSD <= 6.3, Cygwin and OS/2 EMX  have known issues when using fork() from a thread.Availability: Unix.
Since  isn't available on your target, consider instead using the  module or even (batteries-not-included) .These create a convenient abstraction around launching children.
You should use the python's default  package. It works with both Linux and Windows.
