My code is supposed to increment a sentence's alphabets by 2. ex: a->c, l->nI put the print("hi") statement to check if the if-statement was ever evaluated to be true but it never does. Can someone please tell me why?
 checks object identity. Since you appear to be testing whether two strings have the same value (not are the same object), you would be better served by . For example:You can make the same update for your other  statements as well.
The problem is that  compares identity and not equality of strings. Two short strings that are equal may be identical due to some string interning CPython does, but you generally should not build on this behavior. Instead, use  to compare the equality of strings.Note, that you can do this a lot better using , with a map created by :You can further use  so you donâ€™t need to type the alphabet yourself; or use  for lower and upper case characters:
Besides of the  thin, you have another problem in your code:As soon as , it will break: First,  will be added and then  - which results in an error.So change your logic toThis can even improved further:If you make , you can do
This might help clear up the "is" keyword. "is" checks the object identity, not the value.Output:So, all three have the same value, but only 1 and 3 are identical.
