Wow that was a lot of work, you don't have to do all that.here are the functions comprising this one from easy->important returns a string is a way to get a list from 1 number to another.  Written like this  counts backwards. is a way to take an iterable and put the pieces together. is a way to take a function and apply it to an iterable. is a way to write a function in 1 line.   I was being lazy and could have written another  and it would have worked just as well. is a way to shift bits.  (which I believe understanding this one is the key component to understanding your problem)
You only set  in one of the top / statement. If  is , you don't set  at all.Set  at the top of the function (to  or whatever else you want it to be). This applies to all the digit variables, , , etc.What you really should do, instead, is use a list of digits, and append either a 0 or a 1 to that list every time you divide the number by a factor.You may want to take a look at the  function; it returns both the quotient and the remainder. You could also do with some looping here to slash the number of  statements needed here:
