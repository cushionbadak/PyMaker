I need to iterate through the subdirectories of a given directory and search for files. If I get a file I have to open it and change the content and replace it with my own lines.I tried this:but I am getting an error. What am I doing wrong? 
The actual walk through the directories works as you have coded it. If you replace the contents of the inner loop with a simple  statement you can see that each file is found:If you still get errors when running the above, please provide the error message.
Another way of returning all files in subdirectories is to use the  module, introduced in Python 3.4, which provides an object oriented approach to handling filesystem paths (Pathlib is also available on Python 2.7 via the pathlib2 module on PyPi):Since Python 3.5, the  module also supports recursive file finding:The  from either of the above approaches can be iterated over without the need for a nested loop:
As of 2019,  seems the most pythonic solution, i.e.:Output:Notes:1 - glob.iglobReturn an iterator which yields the same values as  without actually storing them all simultaneously.2 - If recursive is , the pattern  will match any files andzero or more  and ..
