I want write a function that deletes even numbers from a list (for example xs=[1,2,3,4,5,6]) and then returns the the remaining list. Help needed. Thank younote: I cant use any built in functions like remove sort etc, but only the delete statement.
Since you need to return the remaining list, you should not delete but filter instead:This creates a list with all the odd numbers:
The obvious way doesn't work:Or, worse, it happens to work in this particular case, but only because you got very lucky (and your teacher may even be counting on you to fall into this trap).Why? Well, when you , that shifts everything else down. So when you next check , that's not the original , but the original . You never check, and therefore can't ever delete, the original !This is explained in a big grey note in the documentation for .*The best solution to this is, as Martijn Pieters says, to not delete in the first place.If you don't care about mutating the original list (if no other object has a reference to the same list, and your teacher isn't fond of trick questions, you don't care), just create and return a new list, as in his answer. Even if you do need to mutate the original list,  will do that just as well as deleting in-place.But if you must delete in-place for some reason (and it sounds like that might be a requirement of your assignment), the easiest way is to work backward from the end:Since deleting a value from a list only shifts down the ones after it, going through the list in reverse order means we never get lost and skip over an element we wanted to test.* The explanation reads like something from Python 1.x; now that the iterator protocol is public, they don't really need to talk about keeping internal counters in some unspecified placeâ€¦
You can also do it using list comprehensions:
