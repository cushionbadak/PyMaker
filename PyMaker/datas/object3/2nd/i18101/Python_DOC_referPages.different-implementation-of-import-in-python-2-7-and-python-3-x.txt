In Python 3 I got something like this to work:in Python 2.7 I get an error that the function I am passing in with  does not exist. In this example the package  is in , it has a package , which has a package . All packages have  files.I tried:playing with the level argument (I tried -1 and 1)removing  from removing  from  and replacing it with Also, if this is completely the wrong approach to do run-time imports of functions, please let me know! I am pretty new to Python (coming from C++, PHP and Java)
Use the  module to dynamically import modules, then use  to retrieve a specific name from that module:
 works just like the  statement.  (For good reason.)When you do this:You don't get a  object in your file; you get !  Likewise, this:returns the  module, but guarantees that it's been populated with .So in your example,  is returning , and you have to traverse the rest of the path yourself.  Which sucks, and is why  is useful.  :)
