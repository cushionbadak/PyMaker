in python what's the difference between  function and  attribute in python?
 calls  internally:
The docs explain it:
dir calls  method if it is present,from python documentation :dir([object])¶ Without arguments, return the list of names in the  current local scope. With an argument, attempt to return a list of  valid attributes for that object.If the object has a method named , this method will be called  and must return the list of attributes. This allows objects that  implement a custom  or  function to  customize the way  reports their attributes.If the object does not provide , the function tries its best  to gather information from the object’s  attribute, if  defined, and from its type object. The resulting list is not  necessarily complete, and may be inaccurate when the object has a  custom .
It's worth pointing out that the  on many objects cannot be customized, so if you call it directly there is no opportunity to place a shim/wrapper in there.It's easy to replace the builtin  and give it some special powers if you need to. Tricks like this can be very useful when debugging.
