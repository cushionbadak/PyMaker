If it is equal, nothing happens. If  it is larger, it is pushed on the stack, and one INDENT token is  generated. If it is smaller, it must be one of the numbers occurring  on the stackIn your code, since the indentation level is larger than the top of the stack (which is ), it is treated as a single indent. The  line popped  off of the top of the stack, so the interpreter has no memory of your previous indentation level of . It only knows that it's higher than the .Problems arise when you start mixing indentation within a block:When the parser reaches , the stack contains . The next line has an indent of , which is not contained in the stack and therefore generates an .
