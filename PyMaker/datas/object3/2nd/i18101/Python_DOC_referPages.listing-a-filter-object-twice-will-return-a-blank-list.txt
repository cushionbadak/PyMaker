I'm using the filter function in Python (3.3). I tried to convert the filter object to list. That's what I found:That's quite strange to me. Can anyone explain this?
In Python 3,  returns an iterator type, and like all iterators, can only be iterated over just once. The  iterator filters values on demand, it doesn't hold any filtered values in memory itself.You can do the same with the list iterator, returned by :This happens because the  method of iterators are expected to raise  once exhausted, then must always raise  from there on out:Once an iteratorâ€™s  method raises , it must continue to do so on subsequent calls. Implementations that do not obey this property are deemed broken. does this correctly:Here the  function calls the  iterator method, and propagates the exception raised;  on the other hand iterates until , catches that exception and returns a list of whatever elements it managed to receive.For completeness sake, in Python 2,  (as well as many other built-in functions and methods) returns a , often wasting memory and cycles on building an intermediary list object that was then discarded again after iteration. By returning an iterator instead, the choice to materialize a list is up to the programmer instead.
