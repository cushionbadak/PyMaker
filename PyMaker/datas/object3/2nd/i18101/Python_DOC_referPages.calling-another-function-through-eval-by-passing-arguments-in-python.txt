I have written the following code for passing arguments to eval function in sample.py and calling the function in another moduleLogin_CSA.py . I am getting error like "Main() takes exactly 4 arguments (0 given)"sample.py:Login_CSA.py:can u guys show me a solution for this how to call a function through eval by passing arguments 
Your  is broken per se. As soon as you import it,you get an error because the  call won't work as  expects exactly 4 arguments.If you have removed this  call, you will be able to import the module as wanted, e. g. with Martijn's solution which he, alas, deleted:Now the import process should succeed, and you should have access to the module's  function. (But please rename it the right way - titlecase names are reserved for classes.)
