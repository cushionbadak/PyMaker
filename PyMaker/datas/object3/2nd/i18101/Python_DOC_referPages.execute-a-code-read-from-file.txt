Natural Text
i have this necessity and i would like to know if it's possible to acomplish: I want to put part from my python code inside a WebServer. And, only after a authentication process, the user who is executing my script, will be able to read a file that is in my WebServer and use that content to execute it as part of script. Is there any function in Python that can read a text from file as a variable and execute that code as if it was written inside the script?
If you explain why you want to do this, I'm willing to bet that it's not actually the way you should be solving the problem.But meanwhile:The  function does exactly what you want: it reads text from a file and executes it as Python code.If you want to read the text into a variable first, and then execute the code in that variable, what you want is the  statement.You might instead want a custom importer, so you can just  a module from an HTTP URL, or from stored text. Or, of course, you can always just write the text out to a  inside some directory you've added to  and then  that module normally, without any custom importer code. See Importing Modules and PEP 302 for all the gory details. (Note that everything related to custom importing is 100x easier in Python 3.3 than 2.7… at the very least because you can find all the docs by starting at The import system instead of scattered in 14 places, most of which are comments in C code…)
Your approach must be a quite bad practice. But you can do for example:
