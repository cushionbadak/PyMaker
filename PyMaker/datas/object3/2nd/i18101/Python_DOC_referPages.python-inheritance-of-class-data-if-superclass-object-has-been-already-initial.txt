I faced with an inability of the inheritance of superclass attribute values. I have already called superclass constructor and now trying to check out the inherited values. Why can't I do this? Should I pass the underlying object to the inheriting object explicitly in order to get x attribute?
 and  are not related;  is entirely a separate instance of the base class.If you want to invoke the overridden initializer (), then use the  proxy object to access it:Note that you still need to pass in an argument to the initializer of the parent class. In the above example, I pass in a constant value 1 for the  parameter of the parent initializer.Note that I used Python 3 specific syntax here;  without arguments won't work in Python 2, where you also need to use  as a parent for the  class to make it a new-style class.
