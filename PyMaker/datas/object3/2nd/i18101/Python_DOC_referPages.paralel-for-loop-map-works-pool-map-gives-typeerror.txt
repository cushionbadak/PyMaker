I am making a condensed (only upper right) distance matrix. The calculation of the distance takes some time, so I want to paralelise the for loop. The unparelalised loop looks likewhere clusters is a list of objects to compare,  is a likelihood function and  is the distance between two objects.I tried to paralelise it by moving the distance function out of the loop like soBefore paralelising I tried the same code, but with  instead of . This worked as I wanted. However, when using  I get the error What am I missing here?
From 's documentation:A parallel equivalent of the map() built-in function (it supports only one iterable argument though). It blocks until the result is ready.For ordinary , you can supply multiple iterables. For example,But you can't do this with . The third argument is interpreted as . You are giving it a list when it expects an int.Perhaps you could pass in only a single iterable, by combining your lists:I haven't tested it with , but this strategy works for ordinary .
