If I have a script in my Python package, how can I get it to read other files from the package, since  contains (for example)  and not ?(The files are just templates, not modules.)
You could use the ResourceManager API from ' :will open  as the file-like object  for example.This will work for regular as well as zipped eggs. Note however that this requires  to be installed. For a solution that only uses the standard library (which is to be preferred), see @abarnert's answer.
Nothing based on a pathname will work, because your package, or your entire site-packages, could be, say, a zipfile, or the files may have been installed somewhere other than inside the package, etc.The  module, in particular the  function, is the stdlib way to get the contents of a data file that's part of a package.See Installing Package Data, and Installing Additional Files for more info on making sure the files actually end up there in the first place.If you want to use  instead of just the stdlib,  can make things easier/more flexible.
