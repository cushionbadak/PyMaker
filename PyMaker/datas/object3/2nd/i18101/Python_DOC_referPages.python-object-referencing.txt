My goal is to create a list of tours. Each tour is a list as well.The problem with this code is that at the end of the loop, the list  is not a list of different, shuffled tours, but a list of the last tour that was added to the list. I imagine this has to do with Python object referencing but I do not know how to change this. I have tried  but to no avail.When I print each tour, everything is fine. When I print the contents of , each item is the same.Here is the output:Tour class:
You're almost certainly making one of two mistakes hereâ€”but it's in the code you haven't shown us, so I can't tell which one.The first possibility is that you're storing  as a class attribute instead of an instance attribute in Tours, so they're all sharing the same attribute:The second possibility is that you're copying the list of cities into the  instance attribute, so they all have different attributes, but all of them are references to the same list value:From your updated question, it's the second one.This is ultimately identical to the FAQ about multidimensional lists, except that instead of directly having a list of lists, you have a list of objects that each wrap a list.At any rate, you want each  to have a separate list, so you can mutate them separately with functions like , right? Then you will need to explicitly copy the list somewhere. For example:However, I would probably write this differently. First, created a  method that doesn't mutate in-place, but instead returns a new list:Then you can replace your whole first loop with:While we're at it, you can replace the second loop with:The tutorial on  loops explains the  part. The second line uses a comprehension and the  method to avoid repeating yourself five times.
