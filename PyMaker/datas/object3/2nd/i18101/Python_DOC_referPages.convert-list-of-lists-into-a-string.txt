I have a list, in which is another list and I want to How can I handle this, do I have to make a for-loop in which I join and add all the sublists?The real goal was to make it somehow readable for human beeing, but I didn't wanted a finished solution from you.
You can try something likei.e.
There are different legal things you can do, and no way for anyone to say which one is right without knowing which one you want.First, you can just write the  or  of :Note that this is what  does (it prints the  of whatever you give it—although with a list, the  is identical to the ; they're both effectively ).Second, you could use a format that's designed for data persistent, like JSON:Third, you can join together the repr of each element of  in some way of your choosing, which is trivial with a  or a comprehension. For example:… or …Or you can do the same thing recursively.Or you can flatten the list (e.g., flatten it one step with , or recursively with the recipes from the  docs or with the  package) and then stringify the pieces however you want and then join them up.Or you can just write the word .All of those are perfectly valid things to pass to .
List comprehension would be the best choice:It's the most recommended approach in a similar SO question, considering performance and syntax.
What about using itertools?Alternatively:You suggested a using a  loop. You could indeed do this, although the options above are probably better.This is basically the previous option, but unrolled.Unless you want to just write the first list, in which case you could do this:
It's difficult for me to be sure, because your question is too short, but it seems to me that you are in a XY problem, that is to say :you ask a question about a Y problem that you think of as being the one that needs to be solved to goes out of an uphill X problem. But your real problem is that you think that the Y problem is the way to answer to the real problem X AND that you present here only the Y problem.Writing that, I only paraphrase what is said here: XY problemIf I am right, my opinion is that you will have a better way to solve your real X problem using one of the following tools, that allow to serialize an object and to record the serialized object in a file:picklemarshalshelveI won't paraphrase and repeat all is the docs on these tools, read them..If i am wrong and that you really just want to write an object under the form of a string representation, you can also do:
You can also just use a simple list comprehension like this:
