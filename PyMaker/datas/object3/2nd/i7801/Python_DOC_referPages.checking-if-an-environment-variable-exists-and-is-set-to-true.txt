So, I want to check and verify if a given variable "abc" exists and that it's true. If the variable exist and is False, then I want it to go to else. Here is how I got it to work in python: Is there a better way to do it?
You can check to see if the variable is in the dictionaries returned by  and . (Thank you to Aaron for reminding me to add the full code)For a local variable:For a global variable:For an environment variable:More information here:https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#localshttps://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#globals
You could use a Try Except Block.
You can use:False is the default value if "abc" is not in env.
It's enough get it from env, I think
