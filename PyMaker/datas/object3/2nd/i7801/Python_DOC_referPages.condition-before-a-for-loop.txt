Just wanted to know what having a variable or a condition before the for loop does in any case, so in this case what does 'b' for i in range do.
Since ,  is effectively  or .Update. I'm assuming that the intended (indented) code is the following:Then if  is, say, , then:after the first for-loop execution (so called "iteration"),  and  becomes ,then  and  becomes , finally  and  becomes .So if  then  is   times,   times,   times,   times and so on.
