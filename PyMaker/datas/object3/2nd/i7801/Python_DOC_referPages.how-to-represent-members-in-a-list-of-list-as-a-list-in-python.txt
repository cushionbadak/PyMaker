I have a list of lists. How can I get a specific index members in each element as a list without using a loop and assignment. Below code snippet is an example. Actual list contains more than 3 sublists. Output should be like a list say mem_lst given below.
In this approach you don't use loop, and you can use  as a iterator to avoiding storage of , but if you strongly need a , just need to wrap it in 
Without any kind of a loop:
You could do this, in python 2.x,zip(*alst)[0]In python 3, you can do it just like this,list(zip(*alst))[0]
