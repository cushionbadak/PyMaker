I am not really familiar with Python yet.I have a string like . Now I want to increase the last byte of that string ( from  to ). I tried to convert the string into an integer ( ) and increase it, and convert it back later, but that does not work for me. Maybe one of you guys has a better idea.Now I want to convert the  from hex into a stringThanks!

So are you literally wanting to change the last two bits of the string to "FF"? If so, easyEdit from comments
