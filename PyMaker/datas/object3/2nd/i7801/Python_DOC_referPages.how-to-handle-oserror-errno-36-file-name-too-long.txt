When handling the errors that occur when trying to create an existing file or trying to use a file that doesn't exist the s that get thrown have a subclass (, ). I couldn't find that subclass for the special case when the filename is too long.The exact error message is:I would like to catch the OSError that occurs when the filename is too long, but only when the filename is too long. I do not want to catch other s that might occur. Is there a way to achieve this?Edit: I know that I could check the filename against a length but the maximum filename length varies too much depending on the OS and the filesystem and I don't see a "clean" solution that way.
Simply check  attribute of caught exception.For readability you may consider using appropriate constant from  built-in module instead of hardcoded constant.
You can specify just how you want to catch a specific error such as errno.ENAMETOOLONG:Specific to your question...Specific to your comments...This will grab all exceptions caused by errors in the . Then it checks if the  matches any specific exception and any additional conditions you want to specify. You should know there is no getting around the  if an error is encountered unless you specific a concrete exception.
