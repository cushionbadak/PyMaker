I'm fairly new to using regular expressions in general. And I'm having trouble coming up with one that will suit my purpose.I've tried thisThis will work as long as the string is not something like'REQ-1234 and then there is more stuff'Is there a way to specify that there must not be anything after 'REQ-' except numbers? The other requirement is that 'REQ-1234' must be the only thing in the string. I think the caret symbol takes care of that though.
You need to add a  quantifier after  to match 1 or more digits, and then add  anchor to require the end of string position after these digits:Note that  is redundant since you are using  that anchors the match at the string start.To match a  that may be followed with digits, replace  (1 or more repetitions) with  quantifier (0 or more repetitions).Note that with Python 3, you may use  without explicit anchors,  or  will do.
