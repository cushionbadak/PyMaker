I'm trying to split a CSV file that has 201 rows. The first 136 rows contains information that is different from the remaining 65 rows. Is there anyway I can split the CSV file after 136 rows?The solutions I have found so far split the file evenly. I have looked into this as a possible solution as well: https://gist.github.com/jrivero/1085501
You can use two  objects on your file object. Slice the first reader object up to the specified number of rows using , and then read the rest of the rows using the second reader.If the two parts are different by say delimiters, the two  objects can easily handle this:
If you know the number of lines you need to skip you can use  to know the line you're reading, you can find more info about it here: https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html#reader-objects
