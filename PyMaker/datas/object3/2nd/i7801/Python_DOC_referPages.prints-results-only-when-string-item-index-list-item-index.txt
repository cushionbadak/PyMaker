I've been working on a little project of mine lately, but I've run into a problem that I'm stuck at. I've already checked various places, but I couldn't really find what I'm looking for. This is my code:The  list contains the special characters that I have in variables. I didn't display them because they're too long, but they're there.The problem I'm having right now is that when I run this code and type in my input, it does actually check the 'name' (string) I've inserted, it just does it in order of the list(alphabet basically). So when I enter: , it only returns the special character for A (because it's the first (0) in both the string and the list) and E (same reason, just it's fifth.)What I'm looking for is how to make it go through the whole list without any order whatsoever and check all the items in it before running the  statement and printing out the special characters.Thank you in advance.
You can use  and  for these kinds of translation jobs:If you pass  a single dictionary argument that consists of strings of length 1 as keys and arbitrary length strings as values, it'll build you a translation table usable with , which creates a new copy of the string where each character has been mapped through the given translation table.For example:
A  of alphabet and spacial alphabet may be a best designin your case try;
