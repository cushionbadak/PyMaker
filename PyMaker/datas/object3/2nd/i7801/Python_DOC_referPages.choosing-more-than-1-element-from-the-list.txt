I am trying to make a choice for each element in , and then I am pairing up the element in  list with its preferential choice(one,two or three). The choice is mostly done regarding the probabilities () of the elements. The code until here:Yields:What I need is, for each element to make two choices instead of one.The expected output should look like:Do you know how to do have this output?
If you need two, just tell  to pick two values; include the  value as a tuple as you loop (no need to use ):or by using a list comprehension:By setting , you get unique values; remove it or set it to  explicitly to allow for repetition. See the  documentation:size : int or tuple of ints, optional  Output shape. If the given shape is, e.g., , then  samples are drawn. Default is , in which case a single value is returned.replace : boolean, optional  Whether the sample is with or without replacementDemo:
If you accept duplicates,  will do the job:random.choices(population, weights=None, *, cum_weights=None, k=1)Return a k sized list of elements chosen from the population with replacement. If the population is empty, raises IndexError.If a weights sequence is specified, selections are made according to the relative weights.
