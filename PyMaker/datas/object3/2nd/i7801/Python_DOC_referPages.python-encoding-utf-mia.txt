UTF-8-encoded text files aren't supposed to have byte order marks, but Windows programs have a bad habit of inserting them anyway.  You can make Python ignore the BOM by opening the file with the utf-8-sig encoding, instead of plain utf-8:But don't use that encoding when writing files, unless you have to interoperate with a program that fails to recognize files as UTF-8 without the byte order mark.
This is because you are using unicode in ,use Have a look at this link and how unicode is being used.UPDATE:After testing your code I got  With No Error.
