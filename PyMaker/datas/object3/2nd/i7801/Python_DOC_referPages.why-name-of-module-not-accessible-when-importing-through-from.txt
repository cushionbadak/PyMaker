I observed that even if you import modules in python through  e.g whole module is loaded. It can be seen in  dictionary. So why the name of the module  is not accessible to our program. What am i missing? It looks like namespace of the main(top-level) file does not have module name. But I can not verify this as I am not able to see main file namespace. It also does not feel ok, just to remove one entry from  without many advantages. Can somebody clear this in detail?   
Because that's what that syntax does; it only imports the names you specify, not the containing module. If you want the module itself, just do .
