I am interested in finding the files with the biggest size in terms of kbs in a folder and then apply a function. After that, I want to apply a different function to remaining files in the same folder. If I knew which files I was going to use, names and sizes of the files, I would use the following code:How I could apply it to many folders that consist of many files
This finds the biggest file in a given directory:
In Python 3.5 and higher, you can do this:Now  is a DirEntry object. Then  is the filename, and  is the full path.Then you can do Or, if you want to skip directories:
Just list your files with , check for files using  and use  for a more reliable size readout, store them in a list and sort that list:Now your  will contain a list of tuples  ordered from smallest to the biggest size in the  directory.You can then use  to get the biggest file, and you can loop through all of the others () to execute something else on them, e.g.:EDIT - It seems that after you execute your functions you want to save them all in one file, so:This will concentrate all of the files in  in the same directory, in order of the smallest to the biggest file. You can use  if you want to store from the biggest to the smallest file.
