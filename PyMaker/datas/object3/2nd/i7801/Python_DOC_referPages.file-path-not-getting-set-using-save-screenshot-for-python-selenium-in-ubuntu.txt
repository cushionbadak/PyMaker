I am using python selenium to get a screenshot of test, but in ubuntu the saved screenshot is taking the path name as file name and getting saved on the desktop. I have used the same code on windows and the file was being saved in the correct destination:Here, if you see the path, I want to save the file with timestamp as file name in a folder named shots present on desktop, but it takes the complete path as file name and gets saved on the desktop. The same thing worked perfectly on windows. I have tried adding the path differently like setting  as path but nothing works. Can anyone please suggest something.
You should use  and  to manipulate filepaths.
Started working again by using / and using os.path.join together. Thanks everyone.
