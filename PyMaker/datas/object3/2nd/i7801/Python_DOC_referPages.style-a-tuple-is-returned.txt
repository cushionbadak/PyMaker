I have come across such a coding style for cases when a tuple is returned.In this case  returns a tuple with two values:  weekday of first day of the month and number of days in month.Is this style acceptable? Is it described in some famous style guides like Google Python Style Guide?What should I do if  is already occupied? For example, in Django it is used for translation like this:
I think, we sould follow the advice from The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Python: http://python-guide-pt-br.readthedocs.io/en/latest/writing/style/#create-an-ignored-variableThat is: use __ in this case.
