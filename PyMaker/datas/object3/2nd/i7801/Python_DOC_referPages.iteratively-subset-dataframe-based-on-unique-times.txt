Given the following example DataFrame:I want to subset this DataFrame by the 'Time' column, by matching a partial string up to the hour.  For example, I want to subset using partial strings which contain "05/10/2017 01:" and "05/11/2017 08:" which breaks up the subsets into two new data frames:andIs it possible to make this subset iterative in Pandas, for multiple dates/times that similarly have the date/hour as the common identifier?  
First, cast your  column into a datetime format, and set it as the index:Then use the groupby method, with a : is an iterator that yields tuple pairs of times and sub-dataframes of those times. If you just want the sub-dfs, you can do .A caveat: the sub-dfs are indexed by the timestamp, and  only works when the times are the index. If you want to have the timestamp as a column, you could instead do:Alternatively, you could just call  on each of the dfs from the former method, but this will probably be much slower.
Convert Times to a hour period, groupby and then extract each group as a DF.
First make sure that the  column is of type DateTime.Second, set  column as index.Third, use  method.
If you use the datetime type you can extract things like hours and days.
You can use the  accessor to truncate the string representation of your date (you might have to cast  if your columns is a datetime and then use  to access the dataframes as a dictionary where the keys are your truncated date values:
