I have multiple classes happily communicating thanks to  being an object of class foo:now I create an object  being an instance of class fooI have a  as a part of a  containing a  with id What I am trying to do is to write function  with  as a propname. How do I point to value belonging to instance of other class.I have read:WarningBe careful with ‘on_’. If you are creating such a callback on a property you are inheriting, you must not forget to call the superclass function too.But as its common with kivy's documentation it does not tell you how.
Kivy Properties are declared at class level, not in an instance. (bad)Binding to a property and using an  event are two different things.You can check for an instance in each of the function with  because of the  argument passed into each event/bind of a Kivy property mentioned here.
