This question already has an answer here:How to install 2 Anacondas (Python 2 and 3) on Mac OS                    3 answers                I am trying to have two environments in anaconda, one with python 3.4 and one with python 2.7. I already had everything working for python 3.4 and created a new environment with:and i activated this with:When i then run python, it still uses packages from C:\anaconda3\lib. Here are the standard packages for python 3.4 located (I think). This will give errors when using python 2.7. How can i make sure the python 2.7 environment uses al standard packages for python 2.7?I tried manually copying the files to C:\Anaconda3\envs\python2\lib, but without success.
From: Using Python in WindowsIf you have multiple versions of Python installed (e.g., 2.7 and 3.6)  you will have noticed that Python 3.6 was started - to launch Python  2.7, try the command:  And:If the launcher is run with no explicit Python version specification, and a virtual environment (created with the standard library venv module or the external virtualenv tool) active, the launcher will run the virtual environmentâ€™s interpreter rather than the global one. To run the global interpreter, either deactivate the virtual environment, or explicitly specify the global Python version.So, I think solution for you is create isolated environment using virtualenv with specific python version:Install pip instructions are detailed here(venv is virtual environment name)For better instructionsValidate your python version by python -VIf version is 3.4, start your anaconda.
I found why it was not working. I was using Spyder, which sets the environment variable PYTHONPATH to C:\anaconda3\lib.I removed the variable with in cmd and now it works. The only thing left is that i have to do this every time and i suspect this to be because Spyder changes it back.
