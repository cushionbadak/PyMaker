Natural Text
I am writing a GUI FTP client app in python ttk. I can't seem to get the text Entries the way I wanted them to.The text Entries have the "SUNKEN" effect. I want to adjust the height and get the text entries to have a "FLAT" look, more like this program:I got the buttons to look flat from here, I am struggling to get the Entries to look flat.How do I get the Entries to look flat?I don't want a tk solution, I know how to set relief FLAT in tk.
Trivia:Appereance of ttk widgets heavily depends on theme in use and/or platform. On windows I can reproduce this depressive gray style with a  theme, so let's assume that this theme in use. List of themes you can find here (note the  theme, wich is most similar to your wishes), just if you wonder.Next stop, our  or, in other words, a structure of widget's theme.You can easily print this structure to see available options. Enough words, let's try a structure of an  widget.As you can see, noone of structure elements has a  option, hence  has no effect on our entry!Workaround:However, we can edit the layout of desired widget, and replace one element with another, wich able to recognize a  option (note a removed , replaced with an ).So try out this little snippet:...and final appereance is:Also, on my machine default theme is  and there I can't even recognize an entry:And also a structure of an  depends on theme, so with  it's:...and if we replace a  with  element in this structure, the appearence is very close to your demands (also try  relief in this case):Conclusion:Unfortunately, this widget will lack options of field and border color, so another option is create own element for this purpose, but that is another question.So, basicly I tryied to answer not "how to workaround this", but "why a relief has no effect on Entry", anyway as you can see, a flat relief for an Entry is achievable.
