I would like to use a decorator for validating data in Python.Normally in Python one uses a decorator on a function, but I would like to use a decorator on a variable, similar to Java:So in Python I would have something like:
only classes and functions/methods definitions may be decorated (functions/methods since Python 2.4, classes since Python 2.6):from docs about function definitionA function definition may be wrapped by one or more decorator expressions. Decorator expressions are evaluated when the function is defined, in the scope that contains the function definition.and class definitionClasses can also be decorated: just like when decorating functionssowill cause .There is no need for this feature, because we can just write function callsP. S.do not use names of built-ins like  for your objects,semicolons are redundant in PythonFurther readingfunctions and methods decorators: PEP-318,class decorators: PEP-3129,PythonWiki page
