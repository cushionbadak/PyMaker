How can I code a python function which matches the callback needed to maybe fill a list with the database contents?I have added the proposed changes on the code, the callback function just prints the value to verify the output. But It wont work I get an error:Many thanks in advance!FINAL WORKING EDITION (@eryksun comments and @MarkTolonen solution)This is working, however, I will look into  and the opaque type.Thank you all!
Tested in Python 2.7 and Python 3.6 (if you change the DLL path) using the following database:Code:Output:I also recommend setting  because it helps catch type errors and for some parameter types (like c_double) it is required.
