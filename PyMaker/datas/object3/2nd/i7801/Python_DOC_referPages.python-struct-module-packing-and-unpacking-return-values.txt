I am using struct module for serializing the data to send the data over socket. I observed that struct.pack(frmt, value1, ...) returns a string of the value 1 in two bytes hexadecimal format. Why does it return only in two bytes format? There should be some reason. Maybe I am missing something while understanding struct class.Thanks in advance.
Read the documentation of the python struct moduleIf you concern about the size of the packed result read this
