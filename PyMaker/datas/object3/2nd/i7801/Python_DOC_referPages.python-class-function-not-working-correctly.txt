I have the below code which I have written in PyCharm.  I can't figure out why it won't run correctly and print out "Chuck".  When I run the code in PyCharm I get the follow message "Process finish with exit code 0".  I am trying to learn Python and follow along with a YouTube playlist but I keep getting stuck here.  Thank you in advance!
Try this:As first.display_name() returns a string you need to use print to display the value in your terminal.
