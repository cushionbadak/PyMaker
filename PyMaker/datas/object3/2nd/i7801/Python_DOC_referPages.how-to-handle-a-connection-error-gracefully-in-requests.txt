I have a simple python telegram bot, here's the code:It works fine but every time I have some problem in my network I have this error:What would be the best way to avoid that error ? I would like to keep this bot up at all times, so it should not fail in a critical way during those kinds of events (or if it does, it should auto-recover / restart by itself).
You need to implement a retry mechanism. Here is an example in python How to retry after exception in python?. A retry mechanism will keep the bot up and avoid the error assuming the connection corrects itself in a reasonable amount of time.Check out Python requests exception handling for an example of catching your specific exception.Combining the two examples we get:......This will retry calling getUpdates every second for 30 seconds until the connection rights itself. You can tune the connection_timeout to be as big or small as needed in order to cover the intermittent connection.
