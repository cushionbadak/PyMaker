I'm getting .  It appears  is expecting an integer only argument.  Did I not define it correctly?EDIT:Now that I understand what happened I'd like to clarify the answer for anyone who might run into this in the future.The problem was here:Which, for the purpose of this explanation simplifies to:or Here  is a tuple and  is a number, a real number.In Pythonresults inIn other words the  operator applied to a tuple results in the replication of that tuple N times.  Which also means we can't multiply a tuple by a float, it makes no sense.  Hence the error:Makes sense.My error was in that I multiplied the tuple by  rather than to multiply my  object by , like this:Given my definition of  this makes sense and works fine.  And this works too:
You are applying  to the tuple . That returns n copies, which clearly requires an integer. Since you've written a  function, you probably meant to call thator directly
 applied to a tuple (like your coordinates) duplicates the contents of the tuple to increase its length, and hence only makes sense with an integer.You're trying to multiply eavh element of an array by a number. If you make  a numpy array then the multiplication operator will do this correctly. If you want to keep  as a tuple then you will need to iterate through it multiplying each element individually (e.g. like in the  function you define for your vector class).Personally I recommend using numpy arrays if possible - they'll make a lot of the maths you're doing quicker and easier if used well.
