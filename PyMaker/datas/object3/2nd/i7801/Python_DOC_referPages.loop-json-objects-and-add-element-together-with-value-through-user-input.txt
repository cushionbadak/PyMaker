If I have a json file with multiple json objects such as followingI want to loop all the json objects add add new element together with value through user input in command line one by one. Is it possible because my format not in json array?
Your code runs fine, so I am assuming the question is on how to add user input as a new key-value pair for each json you load from the file. For python 2.7 use raw_input, for python 3 raw_input was renamed to input.
