Situation: Comparing strings in fileA with pre-defined strings in fileB. Example of said function in my code:Problem: In my actual program,  contains more than 200 strings, while  is a file with more than 50,000 strings. The nested for loop, as I have read, is slow as a comparison function.Question: What is the fastest way to compare the two files' content?Additional information 1: Both files are CSV files, and are opened in my program as CSV-delimited.Additional information 2: Strings are md5 hashes (32 characters).Additional information 3: I am open to other ways to store the strings, i.e. Compare the strings on-the-fly instead of saving it to fileA.Additional information 4: I am also open to other methods or modules that I can use (i.e.: Threading/parallel processing) -- speed is the key here.
You should use sets: now holds all the strings that are present in both listsYou can also do this with a one-liner:If you can do this comparison "on the fly" it is of course better and faster than saving the lists to a file and then reading again from that file, you gain nothing by doing that.And of course, to print duplicates:
If you are okay with not printing duplicates, using set.intersection should be really fast:
