I have devices.txt file that looks like this:Now, I have code like this, and I have to chose how to sort devices in table (for example sort them by code from tw001 to tw004 or sort them by producer's name from A to Z)How to do that?
try this.
You can use the  method of lists:You should use a different variable name in the  loop to avoid messing with . And, if you want to sort by another column, you will need to do the splitting each line of  into a list before you loop over and print them. You may need two loops (the original for loop to print, and a while loop to process each line ready to sort)Side note: for this use case, using  without any arguments would be safer, as that will catch leading/trailing whitespace, as well as removing  style line endings (if the file so happens to have them).Also, since you know the list for each row will always be the same format, you could use  to unpack the list to arguments, which may be shorter or neater.
