im trying to find the mistake in my code.My IDE (Coderunner on Mac) only says this:I never had this exception. I don't know how to handle it and where the problem is. What I am doing wrong? This is my code... I commented line 27.
You need to do  to iterate over the keys and the values together. Iterating just over the dictionary only yields the keys.
When your doit is equivalent to:This is what Python does behind the scenes when you iterate over an iterable. As you can see from the above code, a function call to the  method of the  dictionary's iterator is made when  is iterated over. The  function only returns the next key in the dictionary though. eg:So when you try to unpack the return value of , Python raises an error because only one value is returned, not two. eg:To fix this, you need to use the  method to return a tuple which contains a key, value pair which you can then unpack. From the documentation on :Return a new view of the dictionaryâ€™s items ((key, value) pairs). See the documentation of view objects.
