This question already has an answer here:How does Python sort a list of sets?                    3 answers                min() function should return the smallest of the numbers given. Then whyreturns {0}, whilereturns {1}?
In python sets are compared based on whether or not one is a subset of the other.None is a subset of the other, so  gives  in all cases, so the first one is returned.So  gives  just like  gives  and  gives False.However  gives .This means there is no total order defined on sets.
The comparison operators for sets check for "subset" not for numerical comparisons:Test whether the set is a proper subset of other, that is, set <= other and set != other.And both your sets are disjoint so  and  so it will always return the "first" set you put into .
Because these are sets, not numbers. Moreover, it should return {1}, not 1, as you can see here:That means that it will return the set, not the number.
