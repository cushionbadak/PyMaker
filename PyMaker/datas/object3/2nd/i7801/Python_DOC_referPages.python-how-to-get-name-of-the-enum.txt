I suspect that what's happened is that you're using the outdated pip-installable library called enum.  If you did, you'd get something likewhereas with the "real" enum (either  in the standard library if you're using modern Python, or the  backport if you're not), you'd seeYou can confirm this independently by typing  and seeing whether you see "NAME / enum / MODULE REFERENCE / https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/enum" (as you should) or simply "NAME / enum - Robust enumerated type support in Python" if you're using the older one.
You can start your investigation with the  that comes with your object. Interesting reading is found with In that dict you will see a good start which you can test with the following:which, indeed, yields
dir(testEnum) will give you the dictionary keys.e.g.returns:['Code_1', 'Code_2', 'class', 'delattr', 'dict', 'dir', 'doc', 'eq', 'format', 'ge', 'getattribute', 'gt', 'hash', 'init', 'init_subclass', 'le', 'lt', 'module', 'ne', 'new', 'reduce', 'reduce_ex', 'repr', 'setattr', 'sizeof', 'str', 'subclasshook', 'weakref']
