Take a look at the official python documentation for list comprehensions it explains how they work really well.As for your actual question the following should be an equivalent list comprehension to print out out the Pythagorean triples up til :Hopefully it is clear to you what the issue is in your current code :)Example Usage:
You can use . Try this - To know more about  and  follow this link -https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.productUsing  we get a tuple of 3 elements which we unpack to three variables a, b, c and used comprehension to include only those tuple which satisfies the if condition.This code however generates duplicates like (3,4,5) and (4,3,5)To remove the duplicates you can easily modify the if statement like this - This modified code will get you following output for  -
