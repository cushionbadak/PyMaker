want:input 2want: but the result is:TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not str
Do:to get an Integer, you can't access lists by a String as index.Your variable names should start with lowercase. Generally snakecase too, with all lowercase separated by underscore:You don't need the  here because you want to have just a single character anyway.You can also fill your  list like so:This is called a list comprehension.Lastly, you can just do  if you want to print the full list, no need for the  loop.If you want to print all list elements from index  to  you can use list slicing: for example.See here for more examples of slices.
In Python3, input() returns a string. In Python2, however, input() returns the type you are looking for, an integer. Therefore, you need to cast the input() function to an int, since you are obviously trying to assign a value in the list by index. 
input function accept values as string.
