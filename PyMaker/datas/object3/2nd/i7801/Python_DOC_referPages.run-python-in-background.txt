Natural Text
I've been searching a lot for this problem, but I didnt find any valuable answer.I want to make a script (lets say it is a library) which runs some functions at reboot. Inside my library, there will be a function like After loading this function, everytime a call for randomfunction() in any python run (I will .py as cgi scripts) will return me "randomtext".Is that possible or I miss something?It is working on python idle if I use exec, but I want this exec to be on system. That would be for a linux OS.
Don't you need some kind of Interprocess Communication for this?Might be worth taking a look at these docs: Python IPCAlso, this SO post might help you. I think it offers a solution to what you are looking for.
