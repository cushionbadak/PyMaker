Natural Text
I recently found out that you can play sounds in python. I instantly wanted to make a text to morse code program but when I try to assign winsound.Beep(600,300) to "a" and launch, it just beeps once and when i type a it does nothing.can you tell me how i can assign winsound.Beep() to a varible?
You are mixing up "code that runs right now" with "code I want to run later".Your line,runs  (which beeps and returns ) then runs  (which beeps and returns ) then assigns the result  to the variable .Instead trywhich creates a function which you can run later by calling ... but it will still sound like one continuous beep, because you need to add a short pause after each tone in the definitions of  and . You might find  useful, or possibly  already provides something similar.Edit:You can use a dispatch table (a dict that translates characters to function calls) and an input loop, like so:
My solution to your problem will involve passing functions as parameters to other functions. If this is unfamiliar to you, I suggest you look into functional programming with Python a little bit.You would use the function like so:
In python everything is an object. If you run this:Execute dot() and assign the returned value to  - in your case it's . However, if you want to "assign" the function  to  and then call  you do this:In this case the names  and  refer to the same object.  is now a function which you call with parentheses only.
Adding a layer of indirection is often helpful. Define the character values separately from the playing, then you can loop over any text:How to play (single) dots and dashes (the lines are referred to as dashes):Play one character by looking up the morse value for the character in the  and then iterate over the dots/dashes:to play a text, assuming it's ascii, just iterate through the characters and play each of them in turn:then:
