I would like to know how (in Python) to reference a variable that is inside a def, inside a class. For example:Even better, how can I reference the variable in main if the example looks like:So basically how do I reference a variable that is placed like Class()>Def()>Def()>Variable in main?
What you're calling a  is actually either a function or in this case a method in a class.Variables defined in a method are normally not available. That's the whole idea of encapsulation.If you want to access variables in a class they should either class or instance variables.A variable defined in an instance, a member, would need to be accessed as part of an instance of the class. It's defined in .For example:Accessed as:A class variable can be defined at the top of the class definition:Then it would be accessed with .Look at this Python tutorial on classes to understand this better.If you really want to have a variable in a class method also be accessible directly in the main context then you can make it a global variable by preceding it with . Otherwise variables are by default local and only accessible in the same scope.
