I am in a UCI Coursera course on RaspberryPi, which is using Python.There seem to be some mistakes in the video lecture's code. This is the code in the lecture video, verbatim:I was able to fix one error, which is that  only takes one argument, a tuple, so it should be  instead of .However, there appears to be a type error with the example  value. When I run  it throws:TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'I have to imagine that the instructor's code was close to being correct but has some small typo in it, or something. So I'm trying to figure out what they meant to write and why this is different and therefore throws this type error as being a string.I would follow up directly within the course, but this one unfortunately has no discussion forum, so any help here will be greatly appreciated.
Just add encode.
If you take a look at the socket documentation, you can see that sendall requires bytes to be sent. Python has a built-in function to convert a String to bytes, called encode. So, you must use to convert it to bytes so it can be sent.
before sending message through socket encode it.after receiving decode it:you are all done
