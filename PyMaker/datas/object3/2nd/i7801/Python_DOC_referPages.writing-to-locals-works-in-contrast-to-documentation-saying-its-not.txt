I am currently tinkering with the variable scopes and how they can be modified / copied, as I would like to postprocess some results dynamically in IPython.The confusion about locals(), vars() and globals() is real for me right now. Especially because the output of this piece of code:According to the more than brief documentation this should not be possible in my understanding:Note, the locals dictionary is only useful for reads since updates to  the locals dictionary are ignored.(which is for whatever reason stated in the description of the vars() function)I hope someone can enlight me :)
Where are you reading this? Both Py 2 docs and Py 3 docs have the following disclaimer:Note: The contents of this dictionary should not be modified; changes may not affect the values of local and free variables used by the interpreter.This shows exactly what this is: an implementation detail. Sure, it works in CPython, but it might not  work in the various other interpreters, like IronPython and Jython. It's what would be called a hack.Do not rely on it updating any variables. Do not even try to do it for anything serious, as it causes undefined behaviour.In CPython 3.6.0,  has the following note:CPython 2.7.13 has no such note, however.
at module scope,  returns the global module dict which can be modified. locals in a function are different. Here, the variable is not changed. As mentioned elsewhere, this is all implementation dependent. You can't rely on  working as a writer.
