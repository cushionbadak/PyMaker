How can I find a string () inside a List () in Python 2.7?A search with a wildcard like: ab*Where it would ONLY find the word, if it starts with those letters (i.e. the result should only give absail, but not rehab, despite both having 'ab').The WordList would be a dictionary, which is over 700KB.Please keep the answers fairly simple as I'm on day 4 of learning to code.
You may use  along with a list comprehension to get the list of the words starting with some string as:As per the  document: str.startswith(prefix[, start[, end]]): Return  if string starts  with the prefix, otherwise return . prefix can also be a  of  prefixes to look for. With optional start, test string beginning at  that position. With optional end, stop comparing string at that  position.

As everybody mentioned before,  is your function. You can study regex patterns for more complex operations. regex
