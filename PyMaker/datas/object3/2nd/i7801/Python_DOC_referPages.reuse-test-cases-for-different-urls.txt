I am creating test cases on menu that may be same across all web pages. So I want to reuse the test cases for different urls. I don't want to create a new test case for every url. It will make a test suite cumbersome. I am using automated tests with Python's unittest and Selenium. 
Try using a parameter for the URL.Maybe using environment parameters:https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#environment-variablesor something else depending on your test framework
