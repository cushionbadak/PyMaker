When I try to get the values using ConfigParser,I am not able to get certain values from environment variables in my .ini fileInterpolating variable names are printing variables as it is without value substitution.Below is my code,config_parse.py:config_data.ini:I am getting the following output,$] python config_parse.pyserver1%(USER)/net/server1/mnt/data0/%(USER)/my_logs/%(HOSTNAME)%(SERVER_INSTANCE)$]
You're using , which uses  syntax.The reason why you get  for  isn't because  is interpolated, but because  from  takes precedence.It's easier to see with an example:If  contains an entry for , the  call for  (case insensitive) will return its value, the value from the config file is actually ignored.So that means that for  you acutally get the value of the  environment variable.  does not exist in , so you get the value from the config file: .So if you use ExtendedInterpolations, use  style, if you use BasicInterpolation use  style. You can't mix both. And if you blindly pass , be aware that the envionment variables will override all options in all sections with the same name. Depending on the context the application runs in, that may be relevant for security.
