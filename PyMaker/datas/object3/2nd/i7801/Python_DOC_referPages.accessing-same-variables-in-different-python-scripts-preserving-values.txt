I have below scriptsscript1:script2:script3:script2 will execute first then script3In script3,  script1 is importing so all values update as per script 1 I am expecting var1 to print 30 and var2  print ['1', '2']So what is the best way to use variables in this case.
As I understand the question,  and  are ran independently of each other, i.e.Then, no, changes you make to variables of  in  will not be persisted after the program has finished. However, if you have another script, call it , that executes both of and  within the same program...... then the changes will be persisted (im memory) and  should print  and  as you expected.If you want to store variables between program execution, I suggest you have a look at , or some other persistence module for Python, for storing data on disk or in a data base.
