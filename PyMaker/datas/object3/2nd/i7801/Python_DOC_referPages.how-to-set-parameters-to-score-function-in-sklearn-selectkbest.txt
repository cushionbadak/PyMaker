I'm using the  class for feature selection in sklearn.  can take a callable score function as an input. In this case I would like to use  as the score function.  can take a few parameters which I would like to set myself. For example, I would like to set the . The problem is I'm not sure how to pass parameters into the score function since the score function is itself a parameter in . Obviously something like  won't work because the  function would be called directly. I feel like this is probably a very basic question about python classes but I can't seem to find anything addressing what I'm looking for. Thanks in advance for your time! 
You can create another function which calls mutual_info_regression and pass it instead:Python standard library provides an useful helper for creating such functions - it is called functools.partial. It allows to create functions with some parameters pre-set; instead of "manual" my_score definition you can writeOf course, you can also pass  directly, which gets you very close to your example:
