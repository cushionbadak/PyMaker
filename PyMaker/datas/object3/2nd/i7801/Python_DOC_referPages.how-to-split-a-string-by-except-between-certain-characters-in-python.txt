How to split a string by "," except between certain characters in python?My data is like:I need to split them by "," except for 'Aa,Ab'.The result should be:Do you know how to do that?
It appears that you are looking for ''.join():
It appears you're trying to parse CSV data. The csv module should be more than sufficient and be able to handle all these edge cases.
I'll take a stab at some code.Splits a string by  if it's outside .Assumes both  and  are one character long.
