Essentially what I'm trying to do is remove values within a list when a condition has been met.The conditions are based upon the position of the value in the list, which is what remove_position stands for in the function definition. The code below is what I have so far and I'm using Python 3.6.0. The list in this case is from an external python file which imports the function from another python and is:  What I'm trying to do use the remove_position value above in an arithmetic function that will delete the item that corresponds to the function's result.The output that I'm looking for is this:
You can do something like this:Output:
First of all:  objects are mutable and when you change them inside of a function â€“ the original changes too, so if you use  method in  your  loses element as well.I advise you to create new object instead of mutating the old one.We can write thisor using list comprehensionor following @ChihebNexus suggestion using  slicesSo which one to choose? The last version looks more elegant to me.Testsgives us
Try this
list comprehension is a good choicespecifically, you may want this
