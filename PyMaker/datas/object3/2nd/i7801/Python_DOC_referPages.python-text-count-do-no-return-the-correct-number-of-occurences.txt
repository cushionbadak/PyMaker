Natural Text
This question already has an answer here:string count with overlapping occurrences                    21 answers                I have a question regarding the text.count() function in python.Suppose I have the following text and I want to return the number of occurrences of "CCC":why it returns 2 and not 3?
According to the documentation of the  method:So in your case there are two non-overlapping occurences of  in the string .Hope it helps.
returns the number of occurrences of the substring sub.In this case: "ACCCGTTGCCCC" Gives you 2 because your substring is "CCC" collectively which occurs only twice in the string.(i.e. where "C" is placed next to each other at least 3 times.) 
Best would be to use the already available .
