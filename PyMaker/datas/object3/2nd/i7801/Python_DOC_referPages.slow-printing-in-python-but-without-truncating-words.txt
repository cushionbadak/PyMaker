I am writing a text adventure for some fun in Python and found a cool function that prints the text to the terminal slowly:However, as it is writing it letter by letter if the word doesn't finish before the end of the line it will truncate it i.e:Whereas I rather it do:Any easy way of doing this?FULL CODE: Please ignore the bad story, this was just a proof of concept that I could get it to work! :)
