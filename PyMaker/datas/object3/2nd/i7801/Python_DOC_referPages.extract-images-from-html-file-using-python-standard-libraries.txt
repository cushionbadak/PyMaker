so I'm trying to write a script that basically parses through an HTML file, finds all the images and saves those images into another folder. How would one accomplish this only using libraries that come with python3 when you install it on your computer? I currently have this script that I would like to incorporate more into.This is a script I found on a zendesk forum that basically backs up our articles on Zendesk.
Try using beautiful soup to retrieve all the  nodes and for each node using urllib to get the picture.And you probably need to add some error handling and change it a bit to fit your page, but the idea remains the same.
