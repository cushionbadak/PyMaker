I am working on parsing XML dumps of English Wikipedia and have got stuck at writing killing regular expression in Python. I am attaching a sample data snippet as follows:Amy Jean Klobuchar''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|oʊ|b|ə|ʃ|ɑr}}; born May 25,  1960) is the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|senior]] [[United  States Senator]] from [[Minnesota]].

She is the  first woman to be elected as a senator for Minnesota and is one of  twenty-one women serving in the current [[United States Senate]]. She previously served as the [[county attorney]] for [[Hennepin  County, Minnesota]], the most populous county in Minnesota. As an  attorney, she worked with former [[Vice President of the United  States|Vice President]] [[Walter Mondale]].{{cite web|  author= Senate Web site| title = U.S. Senator for Minnesota Amy  Klobuchar: Biography| year = 2007| url=  [URL]| accessdate=  2007-02-23|archiveurl =  [URL]  |archivedate = February 21, 2007}} She has been calld a "rising  star" in the Democratic Party.{{Cite  news|url=[URL]|title=Huffington  Post names Klobuchar the smartest U.S.  Senator|last=Tsukayama|first=Hayley|date=March 15,  2010|work=|access-date=May 14,  2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}{{Cite  news|url=[URL]|title=As  state's only senator, Klobuchar gains sympathetic  attention|last=Dizikes|first=Cynthia|date=May 20,  2009|work=MinnPost|access-date=May 14,  2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}==Early life and education== Born in [[Plymouth, Minnesota]], Klobuchar is the daughter of Rose Katherine (née Heuberger), who  retired at age 70 from teaching second grade,{{Cite  news|url=[URL]|title=Rose  Klobuchar, mother of Sen.

For instance, ref tags and its content indicatewhereas a section header means I've actually succeeded in parsing these fields with following code:I want to expand the current regex so that I can also get preceding and succeeding texts of up to 250 characters when parsing ref tags and its content.For example, I want to getinstead ofSo, I modified my code as follows:Some problems arise 1) when multiple ref tags occur consecutively at the end of a sentence:The anticipated result was However, the code only captures the latter ref tags and related preceding/succeeding texts.2) when section heading appears in succeeding text. ref regex captures the header as succeeding text and header regex is skipped as follows.I wonder how I can tackle this issue.Happy coding!
While this is (probably) possible with regex by making use of lookarounds, it's a lot easier to just use string operations:
