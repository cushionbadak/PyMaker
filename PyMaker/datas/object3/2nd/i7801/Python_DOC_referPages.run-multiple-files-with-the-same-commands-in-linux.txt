I have a python command like the following:However, I have 90 files and I would like to execute the same command.All the Filename Extension are , and each output file should be placed in a specific folder.Would there be anyway I can execute the command at once?
Internal to your program, I'm going to assume that you are opening the input file.  So when you parse the argument why not allow wildcards?the glob module is what you want.  It will take a string and turn it into a list file paths, then in your program you can loop over them (or maybe use multiprocess to run them in parallel.  Here's how it works.  (I'm assuming that you're using argparse to get the argument from the command line...)If you want a tutorial on these modules, check out Python Module of the Week.  It covers all of these tools (and more).  You just replace """your_mappable_function""" with a function wrapper that takes a single filename as the input, and you should be good to go.  This is faster than bash scripting, because it will not have to start and stop the python processes until the whole list has been mapped over. EDIT:When I went back to make sure the code ran, I added a function wrapper, and a way to test the code without process pooling.  Because, whenever you do mess with a pool, then it can take over your terminal on a bug.
