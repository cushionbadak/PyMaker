I have 2 functions: The first one, , is an asynchronous function and the second one is  which is a regular function and called with the result of  as a callback with the  function.My code looks like this:And it's work perfectly.The problem began when also the second function, , became asynchronous. Now it looks like this:But now I can not provide it to the  function, because it's not a regular function.My question is- Is it possible and how can I provide  to the  function if  is asynchronous?
 is considered a "low level" interface.  When working with coroutines, you can chain them in many ways, for example:Keep in mind  will still call the callback if your future raises an exception (but calling  will raise it). 
This only works for one future job, if you have multiple async jobs, they will blocks each other, a better way is using asyncio.as_comleted() to iterate future list:
