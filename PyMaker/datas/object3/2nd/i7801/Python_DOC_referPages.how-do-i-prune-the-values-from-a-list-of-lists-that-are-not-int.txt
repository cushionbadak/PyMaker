I've tried the following function. Which is supposed to get a list of lists, check if each one of its sublists contain an int value, turning it into int, or if it doesn't, deleting it. To do this this is supposed to create a newX which would be a new sublist with nothing but ints, and a newlist which would contain the sublists.I've managed to get the values from the sublist, but I can't wrap my mind around how to put the values of each sublist back into x. Since by creating a new sublist now I need a whole new list of lists and I'm really confused around the whole thing. There must be an easier way.Sample input:Sample output:
You may use nested dict comprehension with  filter as:Edit: Based on the edit in the question, dict comprehension is not required. In order to get the list of values, you may use list comprehension expression as:
It is a bit verbose but here is my take:Now for your edit if you have a list of lists you can apply the same logic:
In case you want to work with a list of lists, you can simply use nested list comprehension:(where  is the original list). This generates:Nevertheless your sample list does not contain any s: it contains ings that represent numbers. In that case, you should use :this generates:
You can doPy3
