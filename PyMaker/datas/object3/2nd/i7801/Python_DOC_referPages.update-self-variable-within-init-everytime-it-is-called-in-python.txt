I want a self variable within init to update every time it is called  e.g. every time I execute , self.plot should reinitialise by parsing the self.n to the Plot class.Another example: When I execute the following code, I want the answer variable to equal 16. Instead it equals 20. How do I implement this behaviour within the above classes?
What you want is a . This is a special type of attribute that calls a custom getter function when getting the value, so you can make it dynamically return the correct plot.As a side note, look at the data model to override python operators.Another way would be to link the Plot to the data, so when the data changes, the plot does to. A way to do it would be just to have it as an attribute, so when it changes, the attribute does too.
You don't need  in the -object:
