I am trying to split a list of 24 objects coming from grasshopper3d,[poly-lines1][poly-lines2]....[poly-lines24] into 4 parts, so each 6 lists of poly-lines could be appended to different and separate lists- each 6 objects represents faces for a box, so each box which is a seperate list [] has 6 elements in it-, i have been trying to use the itertools library to do that but i am kind of having a problem with function.i was trying to split the list as well.
