So I just started learning a few basics with Python. Since I am a pretty practical person, I enjoy doing it with the book "Automate the boring stuff with Python".No there is a chapter introducing lists in python and their advantages.To be practical one should write a code which asks the user to enter cat names, which then will be added to the list. If no cat name is added anymore, all the cat names should be displayed.Until now, fair enough. So I thought I should give it a try and go a small step further and extend the functionality by adding the ages of the cats. The desired result would be that the user is asked for the name input, then the age input, the name input again and the age input again and so on. If the user doesnÂ´t put in a name again, it should list the cats with the respective ages.I created a second list and also the second input and everything kinda works but I just dont know how to combine the both lists or rather the values. It just gives me the two names first and then the two ages.Is anyone happy to help me with this beginner problem? Thanks in advance
In general you would use dictionaries for this kind of task.But if you were to use lists for your problem, it could be implemented like this: 
I think you're looking for :Out:
If I can understand correctly you want it to print the age and the name together?Well if thats so you can do it like this:Resulting output:If you have any issues with what I did, please just ask.
