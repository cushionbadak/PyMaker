i am getting error in  print "".join(tsOutput)is it due to syntax are different in python 2.x and 3.x versions? 
I'm going to go out on a limb and say you must be using python 3. In that case, this must be written as This is because  is a function in python 3, and needs standard function syntax. (In python 2 it was built more tightly into the core language and was an exception to the regular syntax in that it required no parentheses)
You should add parenthesis to your print statement should work
