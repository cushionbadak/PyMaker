My code is below.
Your question is very unclear. After reading it over, I think that you want to obtain a user name that only has alphabet characters in it. You can use  for that:
If you want to keep up with your idea of checking for numbers, you could also check if a string contains only digits with str.isdigit()Like this:Note that this code will only ask for another input if the given string consists of only numbers. If you want to make sure a string consists of only alphabetic character you could work with string.isalpha()That would do the trick and no numbers are allowed in your input. However, you should read the documentation on Built-in Types.
