Natural Text
Sometimes when I get input from a file or the user, I get a string with escape sequences in it. I would like to process the escape sequences in the same way that Python processes escape sequences in string literals.For example, let's say  is defined as:I want a function (I'll call it ) that does this:It's important that the function can process all of the escape sequences in Python (listed in a table in the link above).Does Python have a function to do this?
The correct thing to do is use the 'string-escape' code to decode the string.Don't use the AST or eval. Using the string codecs is much safer.
 doesn't work in generalIt turns out that the  or  solution does not work in general -- particularly, it doesn't work in the presence of actual Unicode.If you can be sure that every non-ASCII character will be escaped (and remember, anything beyond the first 128 characters is non-ASCII),  will do the right thing for you. But if there are any literal non-ASCII characters already in your string, things will go wrong. is fundamentally designed to convert bytes into Unicode text. But in many places -- for example, Python source code -- the source data is already Unicode text.The only way this can work correctly is if you encode the text into bytes first. UTF-8 is the sensible encoding for all text, so that should work, right?The following examples are in Python 3, so that the string literals are cleaner, but the same problem exists with slightly different manifestations on both Python 2 and 3.Well, that's wrong.The new recommended way to use codecs that decode text into text is to call  directly. Does that help?Not at all. (Also, the above is a UnicodeError on Python 2.)The  codec, despite its name, turns out to assume that all non-ASCII bytes are in the Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1) encoding. So you would have to do it like this:But that's terrible. This limits you to the 256 Latin-1 characters, as if Unicode had never been invented at all!Adding a regular expression to solve the problem(Surprisingly, we do not now have two problems.)What we need to do is only apply the  decoder to things that we are certain to be ASCII text. In particular, we can make sure only to apply it to valid Python escape sequences, which are guaranteed to be ASCII text.The plan is, we'll find escape sequences using a regular expression, and use a function as the argument to  to replace them with their unescaped value.And with that:
The actually correct and convenient answer for python 3:Details regarding : is a bytes-to-bytes decoder decodes ascii escape sequences, such as:  -> ,  -> . does not care or need to know about the byte object's encoding, but the encoding of the escaped bytes should match the encoding of the rest of the object.Background:@rspeer is correct:  is the incorrect solution for python3. This is because  decodes escaped bytes, then decodes bytes to unicode string, but receives no information regarding which codec to use for the second operation.@Jerub is correct: avoid the AST or eval.I first discovered  from this answer to "how do I .decode('string-escape') in Python3?". As that answer states, that function is currently not documented for python 3.
The  function comes close, but it will expect the string to be properly quoted first.Of course Python's interpretation of backslash escapes depends on how the string is quoted ( vs  vs , triple quotes, etc) so you may want to wrap the user input in suitable quotes and pass to . Wrapping it in quotes will also prevent  from returning a number, tuple, dictionary, etc.Things still might get tricky if the user types unquoted quotes of the type you intend to wrap around the string.
This is a bad way of doing it, but it worked for me when trying to interpret escaped octals passed in a string argument.It's worth mentioning that there is a difference between eval and ast.literal_eval (eval being way more unsafe). See Using python's eval() vs. ast.literal_eval()?
Below code should work for \n is required to be displayed on the string.
