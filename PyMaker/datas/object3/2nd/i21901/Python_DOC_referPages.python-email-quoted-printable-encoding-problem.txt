Natural Text
I am extracting emails from Gmail using the following:However, some emails I get are nigh impossible for me to extract dates (using regex) from as encoding-related chars such as '=', randomly land in the middle of various text fields. Here's an example where it occurs in a date range I want to extract:Name:  KIRSTI   Email:   kirsti@blah.blah   Phone #:  + 999  99995192   Total in party:  4 total, 0  children   Arrival/Departure:  Oct 9=  ,  2010 - Oct 13, 2010 - Oct 13, 2010Is there a way to remove these encoding characters?
You could/should use the  module to decode mail messages, for example (quick and dirty example!):Using the "decode" parameter of , the module automatically decodes the content, depending on its encoding (e.g. quoted printables as in your question).
That's known as quoted-printable encoding. You probably want to use something like  - http://docs.python.org/library/quopri.html
If you are using Python3.6 or later, you can use the  method to decode the text automatically.  This method supersedes , though  is still available.Say you have a string  containing this email message (based on the examples in the docs):Non-ascii characters in the string have been encoded with the  encoding, as specified in the  header.Create an email object:Setting the policy is required here; otherwise  is used, which returns a legacy Message instance that doesn't have the get_content method.   will eventually become the default policy, but as of Python3.7 it's still .The  method handles decoding automatically:If you have a multipart message,  needs to be called on the individual parts, like this:
