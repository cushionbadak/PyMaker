If I have:Couldn't find it on the web. =(
if you do it on the console without the try block will tell it to you
. 
Its called KeyError
So a wild guess might be...a  ?
If you don't know the specific exception to handle, you can simply do this kind of thing,The out put of the above code is,When an exception occurs, it may have an associated value, also known as the exceptionâ€™s argument. The presence and type of the argument depend on the exception type.The except clause may specify a variable after the exception name. The variable is bound to an exception instance with the arguments stored in instance.args. For convenience, the exception instance defines __str __() so the arguments can be printed directly without having to reference .args. One may also instantiate an exception first before raising it and add any attributes to it as desired.
