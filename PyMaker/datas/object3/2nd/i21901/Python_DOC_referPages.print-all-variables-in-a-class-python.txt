I'm making a program that can access data stored inside a class. So for example I have this class:So using this I can call out a single variable like:But if I wanted to print all variables, I'm a little lost.If I run:I get:But I want to be able to print the actual data of those.How can I do this?Thanks in advance!

Rather than using magic methods , Vars could be more  preferable.
Define __str__ or __repr__ methods in your Person class and print the object.
Just try beeprintafter , it will print this:no methods, no private properties.
print(vars(objectName))Output:{'m_var1': 'val1', 'm_var2': 'val2'}This will print all the class variables with values initialised.
