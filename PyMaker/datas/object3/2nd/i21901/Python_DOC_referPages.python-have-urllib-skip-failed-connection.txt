Using a Nokia N900 , I have a  statement that I want to be skipped if the server is offline. (If it fails to connect > proceed to next line of code ) .How should / could this be done in Python?
According to the urllib documentation, it will raise  if the connection can't be made.Edit: As unutbu pointed out,  is more flexible. The Python documentation has a good tutorial on how to use it.
If you are using Python3,  has a timeout parameter. You could use it like this: is measured in seconds. The ultra-short value above is just to demonstrate that it works. In real life you'd probably want to set it to a larger value, of course. also raises a  (which is also accessible as ) if the url does not exist or if your network is down.For Python2.6+, equivalent code can be found here.
