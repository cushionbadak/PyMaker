Is there any way to customize the border color of a  widgets or frames?
Yes, you can create your own style and apply it to the widget or configure the attributes of an existing style. Some documentation and examples are in the official docs, specifically the section about ttk.Style.Additional information on using styles (for several languages) can be found at tkdocs.com.
