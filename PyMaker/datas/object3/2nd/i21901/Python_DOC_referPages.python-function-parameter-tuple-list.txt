My function expects a list or a tuple as a parameter. It doesn't really care which it is, all it does is pass it to another function that accepts either a list or tuple:Now I need to modify the function slightly, to process an additional element:Unfortunately this is not going to work: if arg is tuple, I must say .Obviously, I can make it work by coercing arg to list. But it isn't neat.Is there a better way of doing that? I can't force callers to always pass a tuple, of course, since it simply shifts to work to them.
If  just wants a iterable you can pass  to it.
What about changing the other function to accept a list of params instead ?
how about:Edit:Re-reading question, I think this is more what you want (the use of  and  was a little confusing):As others have said, this is probably not the most efficient way, but it is very clear. If your tuples/lists are small, I might use this over less clear solutions as the performance hit will be negligible. If your lists are large, use the more efficient solutions.
Output:
If an iterable is enough you can use , but be aware that if function  (the first one called), also iterates over the iterable after calling , then you might have problems since iterables cannot be rewinded. In this case you should opt for a sequence or use  to make a copy of the iterable:Even though  isn't really that efficient if  consumes all or most of the iterable, at that point it's simpler to just convert  to a  or a .
My suggestion:This is not very efficient though, you'd be better off passing around mutable things if you're going to be, well, mutating them.
You can use the type of the iterable passed to the first function to construct what you pass to the second:
Have your function accept any iterable.  Then use  to add whatever sequence you want to the iterable.
I'd say Santiago Lezica's answer of doingis the best because it is the simplest. (no need to import itertools stuff and use much less readable chain calls). But only use it if you expect t to be small. If t can be large you should use one of the other solutions.
