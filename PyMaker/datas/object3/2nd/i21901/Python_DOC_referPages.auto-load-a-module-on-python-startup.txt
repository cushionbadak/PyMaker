I want IPython or the Python interpreter to auto-load a module when I start them.  Is it possible?  For example when I start IPython:Something like SymPy's live shell found in the tutorial pages.
Check the file  - you can list all modules you want to load at the startup.
Have a  in your home directory and load modules there and point  env to that file.Python commands in that file are executed before the first prompt is displayed in interactive mode. http://docs.python.org/using/cmdline.htmlI use it for enabling command line completion in python interpreter shell 
Unless  option is passed to the  binary, a special site module is imported by default before the execution is passed to your script, or the interactive interpreter. Among other things the module looks for  files. On each line the  files should contain either a path to include into , or a command to execute. The module as well imports , and  (which can contain arbitrary code, a good way to make your colleagues crazy, if they happen to raise errors) if they exist somewhere in . The problem is though, that the current directory in not in  when the  module is imported, that is it is hard to configure your particular script.I sometimes add the following line at the beginning of my scripts, so that the script would start with searchin for  files in the current directory and adding the missing paths to :
Another possible solution is to use the argument  from  interpreter that launches the interaction mode after executing your script.You could for instance use: in case you have defined a or even
