I don't understand what  and  do and how they work.
They are used for formatting strings.  acts a placeholder for a string while  acts as a placeholder for a number. Their associated values are passed in via a tuple using the  operator. will print . Note that name is a string (%s) and number is an integer (%d for decimal).See https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#printf-style-string-formatting for details.In Python 3 the example would be:
 is used as a placeholder for string values you want to inject into a formatted string. is used as a placeholder for numeric or decimal values.For example (for python 3)Would output
from python 3 doc is for decimal integer is for generic string or object and in case of object, it will be converted to stringConsider the following codethe out put will begiacomo 4.3 4 4.300000 4.3as you can see  will truncate to integer,  will maintain formatting,  will print as float and  is used for generic numberobviouslywill generate an exception; you cannot convert string to number
These are placeholders:For example: This line of code will substitute %s with Alice (str) and %d with 42.Output: This could be achieved with a "+" most of the time. To gain a deeper understanding to your question, you may want to check {} / .format() as well. Here is one example: Python string formatting: % vs. .formatalso see here a google python tutorial video @ 40', it has some explanationshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKTZoB2Vjuk
 and  are placeholders, they work as a replaceable variable. For example, if you create 2 variablesyou can assign those variables to a sentence in a string using a tuple of the variables.Note that  works for String and  work for numerical or decimal variables.if you print  it would look like thisI was searching for an answer in StackOverflow and found more than 45 answers to my question.
The  and  string formatting "commands" are used to format strings. The  is for numbers, and  is for strings.For an example:andTo pass multiple arguments: will return 
They are format specifiers. They are used when you want to include the value of your Python expressions into strings, with a specific format enforced.See Dive into Python for a relatively detailed introduction.
In case you would like to avoid %s or %d then..Output:
speaking of which ... python3.6 comes with  which  makes things much easier in formatting!now if your python version is greater than 3.6 you can format your strings with these available methods:
As per latest standards, this is how it should be done.Do check python3.6 docs and sample program
