We have a problem in our program creating several objects in a loop. We're reading a list of all the elements in the periodic table and their respective atom weights from a text file. We want to create an individual object for each atom with the atom weight and the atom name as attributes. How would we easiest go about doing this? So far, what we've come up with is this: We've created one list with all the atom names, and one with their weights. And then we tried making a loop to create multiple objects without having to create them one by one individually so we tried this:(Our class is named  and has the attributes  and )
I think what you want is:If this syntax is unfamiliar, see Python for-in loop preceded by a variable and What does ** (double star) and * (star) do for parameters? If your class only accepts keyword arguments, you can switch to:For more information on , see the docs.
