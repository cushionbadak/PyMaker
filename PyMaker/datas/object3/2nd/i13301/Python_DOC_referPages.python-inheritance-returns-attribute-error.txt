Just starting out Python, i'm a fan of Derek Banas and have been following a tutorial and I'm stuck with a bit of code.And i'm receiving the following error:As I've previously transferred from programming with vb, the indentation for the format of the 'tostring' method baffles me a little bit. I even tried putting it all into one line and it still doesn't recognize the inherited attribute '__name' from the class Animal.Help would be appreciated.Edit:It might be worth mentioning that i'm using Pycharm to write all this in.Also here's the Animal class
Your  class is using Name Mangling. From documentation -Since there is a valid use-case for class-private members (namely to avoid name clashes of names with names defined by subclasses), there is limited support for such a mechanism, called name mangling. Any identifier of the form  (at least two leading underscores, at most one trailing underscore) is textually replaced with , where classname is the current class name with leading underscore(s) stripped.(Emphasis mine)Hence , after your  class got defined any name such as  would have changed to  , etc. You would also need to access them alike that in your  class.But I don't think you actually need to use Name Mangling , you should avoid using the two leading underscores, if you didn't mean for Name Mangling to happen.
Change your function code from to 
The child class itself doesn't have the attribute, use this instead.
