How can I define a class with  in the constructor or class body?For example what I want:or example with class body attribute:My solution (But I would like to see a more elegant way)
Most magic methods aren't designed to work with / - in general, you should only be using  inside the dedicated asynchronous magic methods - , , , and . Using it inside other magic methods either won't work at all (as is the case with ), or will force you to always use whatever triggers the magic method call in an asynchronous context.Existing  libraries tend to deal with this in one of two ways: First, I've seen the factory pattern used (, for example):Other libraries use a top-level coroutine function that creates the object, rather than a factory method:The  function from  that you want to call in  is actually using this exact pattern.This at least addresses the  issue. I haven't seen class variables that make asynchronous calls in the wild that I can recall, so I don't know that any well-established patterns have emerged.
I would recommend a separate factory method. It's safe and straightforward. However, if you insist on a  version of , here's an example:Usage:Output:Explanation:Your class construction must return a  object instead of its own instance. 
Another way to do this, for funsies:
If you're using Python3.7 or newer then you can use asyncio.run:Note, this won't work if you're instantiating  in an asynchronous function that's already running. See this blog post for a discussion on how to handle this scenario and a nice discussion of asynchronous programming in Python.
