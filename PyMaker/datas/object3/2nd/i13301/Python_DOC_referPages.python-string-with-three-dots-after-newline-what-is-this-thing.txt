This must be something specific to IPython then and not a language feature after all (maybe to simplify copy-pasting from the interpreter?)Alternative '...' usage in python.I just saw the  in a different context the other day for multi-indexed  numpy arrays like this: .  It does not affect the indexes in the middle.  Here is an example usage:

Here is the reference tutorial for python's interactive mode.2.1.2. Interactive ModeWhen commands are read from a tty, the interpreter is said to be in  interactive mode. In this mode it prompts for the next command with  the primary prompt, usually three greater-than signs (); for  continuation lines it prompts with the secondary prompt, by default  three dots ().
