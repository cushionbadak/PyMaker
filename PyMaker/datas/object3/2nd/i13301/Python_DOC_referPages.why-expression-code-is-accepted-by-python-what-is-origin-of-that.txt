This question already has an answer here:Python for-in loop preceded by a variable                    4 answers                I wrote this expression and python accepted it as definition of list, but when i wrote this expression:it raises an error.what is mechanism of that and from which language does it origin? is it from functional programming ie. LISP? What is equivalent in Java or C?EDIT: the difference from answered question is that there is not left part of equitation, just right part Also I was interested in origin of list comprehension and equivalents in other programming languages.
 is a list comprehension.  This is perfectly valid Python syntax.The other expression isn't an expression at all.
