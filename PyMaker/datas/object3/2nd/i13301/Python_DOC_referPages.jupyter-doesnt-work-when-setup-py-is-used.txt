I tried to install Jupyter on my Mac (10.9). Since I'm using a computer at the university and don't have permission to write in , I downloaded Ipython from GitHub and typed  on Terminal.Though I didn't get any error while installing, Jupyter does not launch when I type  ( or  were the same) and I got  error.(I also tried to install via pip.
