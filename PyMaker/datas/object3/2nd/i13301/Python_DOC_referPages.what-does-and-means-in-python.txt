 and  are the Binary Left Shift and Binary Right Shift respectively.The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand.Example, Code: The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand.Example, Code: 
It's bit shift, like in C.  Please read this link.Basically  multiplies an integer by 2 in a fast way while  do a integer division by 2.   is like doing   times, so it multiplies by . In the same way,  do an integer division by .Technically, if you represent your numbers in binary (as computers do),  shift all the bits on the left and  shifts all the bits to the right.Thus 3, represented in binary by (00000011) becomes (00001100) when applied with .  (00001100) is the representation of 12.  Again,  shift (00000011) to (00000001) which is , the same result as .
These operators are bit shift : shifts the bit pattern to the right - i.e. moves all the bits to the right - equivalent to dividing by a power of two shifts the bit patter to the left - i.e. moves all the bits to the left - equivalent to multiplying by a power of two :5 >> 2 = 1 :equivalent to 101 base 2 shifted right by 2 = 001 base 2 = 1and 1 << 2  = 4 :equivalent to 001 base 2 shifted left by 2 = 100 base 2 = 4
