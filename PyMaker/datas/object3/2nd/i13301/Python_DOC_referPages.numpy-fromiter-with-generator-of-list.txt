The error said This is a very stupid piece of code. I'd like to create an array of list(finally a 2D array) from a generator...Although I searched everywhere, I still cannot figure out how to make it work.  
You can only use  to create 1-dimensional arrays (not 2-D arrays) as given in the documentation of  -numpy.fromiter(iterable, dtype, count=-1)Create a new 1-dimensional array from an iterable object.One thing you can do is convert your generator function to give out single values from  and then create a 1D array from it and then reshape it to  . Example -Demo -
As the docs suggested,  only accepts 1-dimensional iterables.You can use  to flatten the iterable first, and  it back later:Demo:Only tested on Python 3.6, but should also work with Python 2.
