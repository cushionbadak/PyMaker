Natural Text
I am pulling a json response from an api. I then want to turn that response into a dictionary.The print(data.text) functions as expected and returns the expected valueThe issue comes with:The output for print(data2) is:This omits the initial "summonerId" pair and I can't figure out why.  Thank you!
If you successfully parsed the JSON response the key will definitely be there. However, dictionaries have no order; the  key is just displayed at the end, rather than the start, in the part you replaced with . You'd be better off printing just the keys of the top-level dictionary:and you'll get a sorted list of the keys. Alternatively, print a formatted, indented structure using the  function:Note that  supports JSON responses natively, you don't need to use the  library separately:The  call parses the response data as JSON.
