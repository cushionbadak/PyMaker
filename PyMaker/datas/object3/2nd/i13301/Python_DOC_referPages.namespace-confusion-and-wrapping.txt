propably this question was asked before but I found nothing about it so far.Suppose I have some code in a file called test.py (that was a result from my question yesterday Wrapping np.arrays __pow__ method)So far it worked great in my file every array was produced using the wrapped np.array. But then to compare the speed gain I was confused:How come the linspace now works with the wrapped ndarray instead of the old one? How does it come that  now calls ? I thought that was another namespace and what does linspace have to do with np.array?As a note I read through https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html but that's really tough reading and so maybe I have missed it in there. I would be happy if anyone could give me a push in the right direction.
In test.py,  reassigns the  variable in the  module that you aliased as . All code using  now use the new thing you put in it. Actions such as  create new variables in the local module, but  only gives you a reference to the module itself.Consider how python variables work. Namespaces are python dicts that store key (variable name) / value (the object referenced by the variable) pairs. Namespaces are associated with things like methods and functions (local variables), classes (class variables) and modules (module global variables). When you use a variable, python pokes about in several namespace dicts looking for the name and returns its object.  means lookup a variable called , get its namespace dict and then look  up there. In your case,  is the numpy module and  is a vvariable there.
