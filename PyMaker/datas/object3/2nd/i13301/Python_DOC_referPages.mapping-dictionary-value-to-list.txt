Given the following dictionary:How can I apply these values to a list such as:in order to get something like:
Using :Using a list comprehension:
You can use a list comprehension for this:I personally propose using list comprehensions over built-in  because it looks familiar to all Python programmers, is easier to parse and extend in case a custom default value is required.
You can iterate keys from your list using  function:Or if you prefer list comprehension:
Don't name your dictionary .  is the name of the type.
Do not use a  as variable name, as it was built in.
I would use a list comprehension:The  part is used to return a default value (in this case 0) if no element with this key exists in .
In documentation of Python 3: "Return a new view of the dictionaryâ€™s items ((key, value)pairs)" https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict.items " in conjunction with the * operator can be used to unzip alist" https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zipSo,  give your result.
