The script runs up until the 'takenotes' function is called and then just stops when it should run the function. There isn't any errors it just stops. Why is this?
It doesn't "just stop".  calls ; it gets to the for loop inside the while loop; the first time round,  is not greater than 0, so it returns True. Since you do not do anything with the return value from , nothing is printed, and the program ends.
First of all, you need a  statement to change any global variable (like ).You also have no  function in your code. See the docs.
This script run correctly. It call the takenotes() function and then execute it normally (display message, set local payment array and then execute main() function).You could check this on this online Python interpreter. Also you could execute it step by step here to see what your script exactly do.Also when you want to edit a global variable you must use the global statement.
