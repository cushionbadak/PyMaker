This question already has an answer here:Subprocess check_output returned non-zero exit status 1                    2 answers                Executing the following script...[...]... results in an error:CalledProcessError: Command '[ping', '-q', '-c2', '-W1', '10.81.3.80 ']'   returned non-zero exit status 1Adding "stderr = STDOUT" in  did not produce any useful feedback.  How can I obtain more information regarding the error so that I can troubleshoot it?
subprocess.check_output raises CalledProcessError on non-zero exit code, and  returns non-zero exit code if something is wrong (e.g. unknown domain name, or site is down, or site has ICMP blocked for some reason, or your Internet connection is down).If you want to examine both output and exit code, use subprocess.Popen:Examples:
As your error message said, ping finished with non zero exit status.  It might mean that e.g. the IP address provided is not reachable or you passed in wrong parameters. From  man page (http://linux.die.net/man/8/ping):If ping does not receive any reply packets at all it will exit with code 1. If a packet count and deadline are both specified, and fewer than count packets are received by the time the deadline has arrived, it will also exit with code 1. On other error it exits with code 2. Otherwise it exits with code 0. This makes it possible to use the exit code to see if a host is alive or not.You can try to catch  and see what it contains in .
