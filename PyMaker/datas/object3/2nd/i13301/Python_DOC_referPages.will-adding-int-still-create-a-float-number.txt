In the above it is likely that the height in metres will be entered as a float number (ie. 1.8) so having declared 'bmi = int' and 'height = int' will the end bmi still produce a float number if necessary? 
Yes. If you add a floating point to an , then the  is promoted to a floating point before the addition takes place.
In Python, when you perform an operation with a float and an int that would return a float, Python will automatically handle returning a float.For instance:here we can see the bytecode instructions for adding an  and a .The  operation is what we're interested in digging into. From the source of Python 3.4 we can see the following operation:And following : To  at this point, we could continue tracking down those arguments passed to  or hop over to the documentation of the C-API.From here, we have a pretty good reason to believe this is what we're looking for:This function is used by PySequence_Concat() and has the same  signature. It is also used by the + operator, after trying the numeric  addition via the nb_add slot.We can then hop back in and look for our  call, ending up at a float_as_number variable.  Following that  will direct us to the following:where we can see that the passed arguments are passed to a  function.  From here, we can see the conversion if the value wasn't a float:
