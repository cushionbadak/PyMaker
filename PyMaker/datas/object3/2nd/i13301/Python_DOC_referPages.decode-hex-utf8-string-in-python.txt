A chinese string:so, how can i get correct chinese string in situation a?
Use ast.literal_eval after some preprocessing. It's particularly easy if you can assume the string contains no quote characters:If it could contain quotes, you have to do slightly more work to escape the internal quotes, but it's the same basic idea. On Python 3, the code would have to change depending on whether your input is really  or ; it's complicated, but you're clearly running Python 2 anyway.
You can probably do something like this.
Try this, if you can sanitize the string and make sure it does not contain anything malicious:I see that ShadowRanger has already posted similar and probably better solution.
