After research I found a solution to read a file without locking. But I can not decode received buffer from descriptor in the string / chars. How to do this? Or is there another option to read the file without blocking, and not working with bytes?I receive error:
You're passing a value  to be formatted into the message, but your message doesn't contain a field for this to be substituted.  It follows the printf-style string formatting syntax by default.
