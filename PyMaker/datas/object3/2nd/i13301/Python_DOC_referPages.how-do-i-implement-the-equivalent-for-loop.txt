In java, I can have the following loop:How do I write the equivalent loop in python?
Using  + In python you can get a range by invoking  — where  denotes the start of the range, and  is the upper limit (not included in the resulting range). Mathematically speaking the result will be the set of numbers in the range .In order to port your java code into python, you can easily create an outer range with the construct previously mentioned, and then have the inner range depend on the former.Using You can of course also write the equivalent looping construct using , even though this is not very pythonic — nor is it as clean.
It can be done like this,Please go through a basic python tutorial. One is found here

in python you can write for like so for what you want it will be like 
The range takes 3 parameters(start,stop,step)start - from where to begin a for loop, when to stop the loop and how much to stepin the above code snippet the loop will begin at 1, stop at 10 and will step by 1 every time just like i++ in java
