Natural Text
I save a book as a text file on my python and i am trying to read the file line by line. I have tried using this But, everytime i try running this, it doesn't work. This is what i get as my output
By itself  is not a valid mode for opening a file.You could specify mode as . If you omit the mode it will default to  (read in text mode) which is probably sufficient for your purposes. (If your file contains binary data, you can add the  to the mode.)I would also consider writing it like this with a  statement:This has the advantage that you don't need to worry about closing the file - it will happen automatically upon exit from the  statement, for whatever reason.UpdateSo you are executing this code from within the Spyder IDE? When you successfully run a script Spyder will display: in the console. This is what you are seeing, so your script is running without error.There are a couple of possibile explanations:You are not calling the function  from within yourscript. The script runs without error, but the file is not displayedbecause  is not called. This is the most likelyexplanation because your original code that attempts to open thefile with mode  will raise an exception, and that exceptionwill be logged to the console. But the error is not displayed, hence it is probable that the function is not actually called.You are calling  but the file is empty. In this casethe "runfile()" message will be displayed because the script ransuccessfully, but nothing else is seen because the file is empty.Try adding a call to  after you define the function:
I would put my money on the following statement:You're telling Python to print the line without a newline, effectively concatenating all individual lines into a single line on the screen.See https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print
