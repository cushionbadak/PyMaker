 is an argument to the  function, which requires you use Python 3 or use a special  statement in Python 2 (see the  function documentation.The normal plain vanilla Python 2  statement (which is what you appear to be using) does not support altering the separator used.Since the separator is always a space, you don't need to specify it here at all:If you wanted to print without spaces, use string formatting instead:If you are using a Python 3 tutorial using  or similar similar syntax, get yourself Python 3 installed, or get yourself a Python 2 specific tutorial instead.
In  print doesn't take arguments because print is a statement and not a function. You can use the  function by importing from the  module:As the first import of your  file.And then call print (don't omit the parentheses!):Alternatively,  spacing can be added explicitly by adding it in the string to be printed along with the  operator that combines strings:Check your python version (by running  in your terminal) and read the right docs (Python 2, Python 3)
