Natural Text

I've tried with my code, but for one or another reason it doesn't write the text to the other file.My code:if someone could tell me how to solve this and explain why? thanks alot
Here's a solution using a regular expression and  to replace the 2nd comma with a semicolon if the line matches the regex.Explanation is in the code comments.transform.pyinput.txtresults
