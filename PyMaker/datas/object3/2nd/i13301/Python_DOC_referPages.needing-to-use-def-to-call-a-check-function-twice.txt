Natural Text
We're making a Gibberish converter. The user inputs a chosen word and two gibberish lines (each two characters long)  that will replace the vowel in the chosen word. As you see there are two check loops that check to see if the user imputed a correct line. We have to use the def function to replace this code and instead call it twice.How can I go about doing this?
This recursive function condenses the validation into a generator expression and calls itself again with the same prompt if the line is not valid.
