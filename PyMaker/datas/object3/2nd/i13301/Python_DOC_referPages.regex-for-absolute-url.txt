I am searching quite a while for a regex compatible with Python's  module for finding all URLs in HTML document and I cannot find it except one that was only to able to check whether an url is valid or invalid (with  method). I want to do simple I suppose needed regex (if exists) would be complex enough to take into consideration a bunch of special cases of urls so it cannot be some oneline code.
Use BeautifulSoup instead.It's simple to use and allows you to parse pages with HTML. See this answer How to extract URLs from an HTML page in Python
