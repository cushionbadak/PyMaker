I want to add the three first elements to  and the next three to  and so on.the result should be:
The documentation for the standard itertools module has this recipe for dividing a list into fixed-length groups:As a beginner, you might not understand how this works, but I did this to confirm that it does:prints: . So you have tuples of each three items, now you just need to add them up, which is what the builtin  is for:If your list is a length that isn't divisible by 3, this will break with an error like this:Which can be fixed in one of two ways: if you want to ignore the odd elements, change  to call  where it currently calls ; on the other hand, if you want a final element in  that is the sum of the odd elements, use a fill value of 0 like this:
Try withwhich producesThat works if the number of elements in the input list is a multiple of 3.In case you want to make it work for other lengths as well dowhich producesEDIT: another solution is to use which works for lists of any length (multiple of three or not)
Here are a couple of other ways. Note that (as in most of the answers already submitted) a partial group of less than 3 items will be ignored by my first 2 methods, but the last one will handle such partial groups.output
All you need to do is add the elements from 3*i to 3*(i+1)where i is will be the index of the new list2
