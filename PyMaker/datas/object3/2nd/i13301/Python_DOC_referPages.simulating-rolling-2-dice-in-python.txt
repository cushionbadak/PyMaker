I have been asked to simulate rolling two fair dice with sides 1-6. So the possible outcomes are 2-12.my code is as follows:My problem is that this is only returning the outcome of rolling the dice 1 time, so the outcome is always 2-12. I want it to return the sum of rolling the dice (n) times. Does anyone have any suggestions for me?
Roll the dice in the loop:The  augmented assignment operator basically comes down to the same thing as  when summing integers (it is slightly more complicated than that, but that only matters for mutable objects like lists).You could even use a generator expression and the  function:This basically does the same thing as the  loop in the first example; loop  times, summing up that many random numbers between 1 and 6 inclusive.If instead of rolling  times, you need to produce  results of 2 dice rolls, you still need to roll in the loop, and you need to add the results to a list:This too can be written out more compactly, with a list comprehension:You could also use  from a list of generated sums; these are automatically weighted correctly; this basically pre-computes the 36 possible dice values (11 unique), each with equal probability:Either way, you'll get a list with  results:You could pass the list to the  function to have these printed on one line, or on separate lines:
