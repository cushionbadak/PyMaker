Natural Text
I want to replace dashes which appear between letters with a space using regex. For example to replace  with  The following matches the character-character sequence, however also replaces the characters  [i.e.  results in , rather than  as i desire]How i adapt the above to only replace the  part?
You need to capture the characters before and after the  to a group and use them for replacement, i.e.:DEMOhttp://ideone.com/LAYQWTREGEX EXPLANATION
Use references to capturing groups:This assumes, of course, that you can't just do  for whatever reason. Perhaps your text uses hyphens where it should use en dashes or something.
 always replaces the whole matched sequence with the replacement.A solution to only replace the dash are lookahead and lookbehind assertions. They don't count to the matched sequence.The syntax is explained in the Python documentation for the  module.
You need to use look-arounds:Or capturing groups:See IDEONE demoNote that  also matches some non-letters (namely , , , , , and ), thus, I suggest replacing it with  and use a case-insensitive modifier .Note that you do not have to escape a hyphen outside a character class.
