How can I achieve such job:IE:if I do  it should be calling  (see input as string but I call it as an attritube.Thanks
Use the builtin function .getattr(object, name[, default])Return the value of the named attribute of object. name must be a string. If the string is the name of one of the objectâ€™s attributes, the result is the value of that attribute. For example,  is equivalent to .

If  has an attribute named  thenor if you want to set an attribute to the supplied object then:Try it
You should use setattr and getattr:
