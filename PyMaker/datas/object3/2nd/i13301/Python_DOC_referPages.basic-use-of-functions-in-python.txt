Natural Text
I'm trying to learn Python 3. This is an example I am trying to learn from. So here I define a function to read text. Open a file, read the contents, print it, then close.So this code runs well. The thing I don't understand, however, is why we write:print(contents_of_file), but not read(quotes). How come it's quotes.read()? As far I can understand both print() and read() are functions and I expected both to be used the same way. What am I missing here - please help?Is there a rule when to put stuff inside brackets and when not to?
 is a function.  is a method of the object bound to . As such,  must be referred to by accessing . Only then can we add parens to invoke it.
You've stumbled across the often argued definitions of functions and methods. is a method that belongs to  (which is an instance of a class, I don't actually know the name of which).  Technically, Methods belong to Objects, Functions are normally defined in a style that isn't strictly Object Orientated, or in global scope (like all C functions).It might be worth reading up on the OOP aspects of Python, this will likely help you understand it more.
 is a file object. I understand you don't yet know what is an object. But try printing .This object has a function  whose purpose is to read contents from the file. To call a function of an object, you have to write:As this is exactly what we want, we are just calling that function. So  we are writing: doesn't belongs to any of these type of objects. So, we can call it without any object reference.
