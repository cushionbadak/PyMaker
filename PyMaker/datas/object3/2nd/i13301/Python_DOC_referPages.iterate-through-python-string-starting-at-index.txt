If I have a very long string (say 100 million characters), is there a way to iterate through the characters using something like  but starting a certain number of characters in? I'd prefer not to slice the string and use a subset, because I understand that slicing the string will make a copy (very expensive in my case). In other words, can I specify a start point for an iterator over a string?
In python3  is an generator, and not a list. That means that the following code will not require excessive memory:If you'd rather use an iterator over  then you need to write it yourself:
you can do it using string indexes, like it's list:
Consider using itertools.islice as follows:
Instead of generating indexes into the string, we could use , which returns an iterator over a slice.
