As the title states, what is the difference between these two flags? It seems they both convert the value to a string using repr()?Also, in this line of code: What does the 0 in front of the !r do?
 is not a valid placeholder in the  formatting operations; it only works in old-style  string formatting. It indeed converts the object to a representation through the  function.In ,  is the equivalent, but this also means that you can now use all the format codes for a string. Normally  will call the  method on the object itself, but by using ,  is used instead.There are also the  and (in Python 3)  converters; these apply the  and  functions first.The  in front indicates what argument to the  method will be used to fill that slot; positional argument  is  in your case. You could use named arguments too, and pass in objects as keyword arguments:Unless you are using Python 2.6, you can omit this as slots without indices or names are automatically numbered; the first  is , the second  takes the second argument at index , etc.
