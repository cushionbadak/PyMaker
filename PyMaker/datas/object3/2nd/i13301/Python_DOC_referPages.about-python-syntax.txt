This question already has an answer here:How can I read inputs as numbers?                    19 answers                I am not getting the answer and it's just not working, I am looking for answer like this, 
The  built-in function returns a value of type . As is specified in the (doc)string right after the declaration of function :You will need a type conversion.So, you must wrap it in an  to convert it to an integer .Then you can use comparison operators to evaluate if it is  the qualified range of accepted values :If you supply numbers this works perfectly:But if you supply a single character or a string (type ), you'll get an error:    This is beyond the scope of the question but you might want to look into it.Anyway, your while condition is setting me off..It seems that you might be using  with the  imported through . (or else the comparison between different types would raise a  in the  statement). Check your version of python  [in the command line] and:If using python 2 instead of  use :If I am wrong and you are indeed using , use  as explained.
