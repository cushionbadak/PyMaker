I have tried to somehow get a documentation for a partialmethod to work. My current code isBut if I runand Sphinx lists them using  as .I have read https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#partial-objects and https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.partialmethod but does that mean that there is no way of getting documentations into partialmethods or am I just too stupid about it?
It's not possible to set a docstring on a  object. That's because  is a class written in Python, and instances of classes get their docstring from the class's , not from a  attribute on the instances. Functions behave differently, with the  attribute of the function object being looked at.Depending on how complicated your use of  is, you may be able to write your own version that returns a function, rather than an instance, thus allowing you to customize the documentation by assigning to the  attribute.Here's a quick version I've thrown together with only basic testing. I think it works for common cases (e.g. where  is an actual function), but it probably won't be as flexible as the regular  type, so you should double check that it does everything you need it to do:The multiple unpacking in the call to  is only legal in Python 3.5. In older Python versions, you'll have to merge the arguments yourself with something like this:Here's an example use:You can of course pick which attributes to overwrite. I'm not sure if using  is a good idea or not, as it may copy over a bunch of invalid attributes, beyond the ones I'm modifying in my example.
