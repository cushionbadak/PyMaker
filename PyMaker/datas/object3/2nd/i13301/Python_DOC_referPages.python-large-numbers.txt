Is there anyway to run a for loop with a range of over 13 characters?For example:I know this won't work but is there any way it could?
Using  can also give you  Error as the number has to fit into a C long. To overcome this use  to create you own range:If you wanted to use the same logic with python 3:Or a  loop:A long is  on windows so you are going to hit the limit using  with  a number that large. See what-is-the-bit-size-of-long-on-64-bit-windows 
For python 2.7, use  (which uses a generator instead of initializing a large list) instead:
If the bounds and step are within the range [-sys.maxsize-1, sys.maxsize), and the total number of elements is , then  has you covered.If not,  provides the parts you need to completely reimplement  (and efficiently too, pushing all the work to the C layer in CPython) for the purposes of generation ( is a real object can be generated over and over and supports a few other features; this only generates, and only once per call):The above is obviously slightly overkill to handle s other than the default 1; it could be simplified dramatically if  support wasn't needed.In CPython (the reference interpreter) this should run more efficiently than using Python level code (which requires repeated byte code execution); once initialized,  and  do all their work at the C layer, which can dramatically improve performance. For example, compared to the  based loop from the other answer, in ipython running on Python 2.7 on my machine:Even with the overhead of mimicking s non-standard argument prototype, the overhead for the + code is only about 50% over , which ain't half bad given that it actually handles scenarios  can't.
Remember that there is a limit of minumum and maximum value to store in processor register. It means that not all modules can receive big numbers as arguments.
