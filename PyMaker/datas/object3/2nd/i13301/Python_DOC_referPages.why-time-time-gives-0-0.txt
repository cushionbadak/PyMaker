I have a python program defined by a function Basically, the function contains two for loops.I would like to calculate the time elapsed for I do it like this:The result is 0.0 almost always. Why?
Per the  docs, even though the time is always returned as a floating point number, not all systems provide time with a better precision than 1 second.So if  takes less than a second and you are using such an OS, then the difference between two calls of  could be 0.0.You could use  instead of .  will choose the best timer (,  or ) for your system.Also note that the timeit module offers more accurate ways to test the performance of code snippets.
Because  will be  when  doesn't take very long.
