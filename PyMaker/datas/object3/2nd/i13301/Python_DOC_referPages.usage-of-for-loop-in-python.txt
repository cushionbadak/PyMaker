Natural Text
I have created a script that gets the  link from inside an anchor tag, along with the text.Here is my python code:Output:Instead of using two for loops can I do this?
Let's examine what you're trying to do here:The  part right after the  indicates 'unpack the tuple indicated after  into two parts'. If the tuple doesn't have two parts you'll get a .Both of the lists you're iterating through have single values, and simply putting a  between them won't do what you're looking for. As suggested in another answer, you can  them into a single array:What zip does is return a list where each element is a tuple comprised of one element from each of the provided lists. This works well, but doesn't solve the problem of not looping through your list twice: you're still doing that, once for zip  and once to unpack the zip. Your deeper problem is how you're getting your values.You seem to be stepping through each link you have, and then for each link you are getting the url and the text and putting it into a list. You're then printing everything in those lists. Do those lists ever have a length greater than one? The  function will only return a single value:Putting it into a list there is not meaningful. As for your regex search, it could in theory return multiple values, but if you use , then you'll only get the first match and don't need to worry about additional values. This is what you're currently doing:When really you can simplify to:Then you don't have to worry about the additional for loops and zipping. This refactors to:
You can use the zip function:What it does is zips two or more iterables. They need not be of the same size either.
