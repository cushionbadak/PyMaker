I want to write a code in Python that asks the user for the weight of a package and then how much it will cost to send it given we have the costs. weight in kg:                             price per kgup to 2 kg:                                30from 2 kg up to 6 kg:                        28from 6 kg up to 12 kg:                       25from 12 kg and up:                           23This is what I have written:(vikt is the weight and kronor is the currency)for some input weights this works fine but when I write e.g. 7.15 kg which should cost 178.75 I instead get 200.20000000000002. Which is incorrect and second is there any easy way to not make it display the cost with that many decimals? But perhaps if we make it display the correct cost we wont even have that issue. Thankful for any help I may get! 
I think it would be better to use function to retrieve cost of one weight unit:
Eugene, thank you! I did it like this: vikt = float(input("Weight of package?: ")) And it seems to be working
Try evaluating your highest weight first:
As with fairly much everything, Python actually has a standard library module that does this kind of thing for you quite easily. It's called , and one of the things it can do is a table lookup. To use it, you put your cutoffs into a list, and the associated multipliers into another list in the same order like this:Then finding the right multiplier given an arbitrary weight is one function call:You will still need to special-case invalid inputs, but all the branches of your  that lead to calculating a total cost are consolidated into one.
To make it more pythonic, get rid of the multiple tests, insert the parameters in tuples and use a generator expressionproduces the desired output.Examples:EDIT:as suggested by @lvc, using bisect would be even better
