Im trying to achieve next effect:I have two counters, one should be "Current" counter that should count from 1 to 123, while there should be also counter named "Total" on bottom of console that should display total count for example 234.This is my code:It is almost what i want, except that "Total" line is overwritten every time when inner for loop is performed. SO there should be always displayed only one "Total" line with total number of loops.Is this possible to do in Python and how?
If you really want two lines, you can make use of the  (Cursor Previous Line) ANSI escape code to move the cursor to the beginning of the previous line.Note that on Windows you have to import the  module first.
The console writing is only happening on a single line and hence it will clear the 'total'.One way is to always print the 'Total' along with the 'Current' on the next line.Or, have a separate rendering loop (on another thread) which prints these global variables (current and total) continuously. It will have its own refresh rate.
Solved after playing with curses as suggested by @JoostFinal code:
