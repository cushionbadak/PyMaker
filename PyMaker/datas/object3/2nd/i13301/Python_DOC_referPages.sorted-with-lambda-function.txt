I have strings that look like "co1/co2", "co3/co4" ... "co11/co12"describing it as a regex:I want to sort a collection of these strings based on the equivalent of the "month" group of the regex. (the first number in the string (eg.  the "1" in 'co1/co2' or the "12" in 'co12/co13')I'm unable to figure out a lambda function I can use in sorted() that will do this for me, though.
Without a regex:This takes the part of the string before the , then everything but the starting , then converts that to an integer.I used  as it is faster than  for the split only once case.Demo:
try this:Lambda whats it doing, first it split with "/" and select the 1st value and select the value after 1 index and convert to integer
