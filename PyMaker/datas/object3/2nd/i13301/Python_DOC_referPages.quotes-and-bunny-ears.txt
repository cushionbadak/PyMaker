I am very new to Python, going through a guide, and was wondering when you state the following (code below) what are the differences? There seems to be a pattern here that maybe I'm not catching on and the more I push through the guide the more this question pops up in my head :)
Strings, type , in  or  can be declared by using single quotes  or double quotes  (and triple quotes  which, generally, have a special purpose). Python treats them similarly.For the first two cases of your  function, you are just passing the space character  and  and  is just consequently just printing it. A similar logic applies to the other functions.A function called with empty parenthesis  just means that no arguments have been passed to it. What behavior this has (and if it is allowed) is up to the definition of the function called. For instance, the documentation for the  function states that:If no objects are given, print() will just write end.With  here being specified as the new line sequence .The only special cases where you need to use  instead of  is if your string contains . Vice-versa, you will need to use  if your string contains .So, for example:And vice versa:Let's note that with triple quotes  you can have a string with both  and :Try these out to get a feel of them.
