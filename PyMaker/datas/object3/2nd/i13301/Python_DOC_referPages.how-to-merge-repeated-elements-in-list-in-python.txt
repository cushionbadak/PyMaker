I have a list of coordinate like:Output of this code:I want to merge this value list for similar element and want output as:Expected output:
If you prefer one-liners, you can do it like this:It will output:Note: As set is being used in the code, ordering of the elements is not guaranteed here. 
You could use an  for both of your cases. Firstly for just the  coordinates:Giving:Note, if for example  was repeated later on, it would not change the output.Secondly, for whole coordinates. Note, the data has  repeated 3 times:Giving:
you can use which producesand it is guaranteed to be in the same order as the input list (if it matters).Basicallygroups the elements in the iterable, passing to a new group when the key function changes.If the key function is omitted, the identity function is assumed, and the key for the group will be each element encountered.So as long as the elements in  stay the same, they will be grouped under the same key, which is the element itself.Note: this works for contiguous repetitions only. In case you wanted to get rid of re-occurring duplicates, you should sort the list first (as groupby docs explains)As per your comment below, in case you wanted to operate on the coordinates directlyproduces the same output
Why don't you use a set:
