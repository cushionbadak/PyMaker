I have two lists of timestamps obtained from two separate sensors, like so:I would like to efficiently extract the index in  of values that closest match each value in .In the above example  is an earlier timestamp than  and should therefore be discarded. I would like the code to return .The list of both reference and sensor timestamps is already sorted.My attempt is this:
of use  bisectyou can you bisect module, it will find for 100001.0 in reference     index 3 in sensor that is 100000.9924bisect
