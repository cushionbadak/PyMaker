That's my code; I want to know how to concatinate headName() and tailName(), so that they're on the same line. Thanks
You can't do that without rewriting the functions.  The newline is added by .  Since you call  inside the functions, nothing you do outside the function can undo the newline that was already added inside.A better idea is to have your functions return the values, and then do the printing outside:Incidentally, what you are doing can also be accomplished directly with .
To print on the same line call them in one  statement, something like:
You can also use string formatting, which in case that you wanted to customize further the output would give you more control over the outcome:
You can also try:This will cause your print function to end with nothing, instead of ending with a newline (default).For more information: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html
