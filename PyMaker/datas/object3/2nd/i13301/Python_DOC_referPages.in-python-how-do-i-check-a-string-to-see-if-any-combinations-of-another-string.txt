This question already has an answer here:python check string contains all characters                    4 answers                I have a 170 000 list of words and I am writing an algorithms using a graph for each word to see the longest word chain possible;Word chain being a list of words where the i-th word is the (i âˆ’ 1)st word with one extra character and the other characters are arranged in any mannerA -> AN -> CAN -> CANERight now I have all the words listed alphabetically like CAT = ACTand I say add an edge when String 2 contains string 1, plus one other characterHowever in the case of A-> AT -> ACTthe edge between AT and ACT isn't drawn because the C split the A and the T and my if statement only works if "AT" was found.How do I tell python to search a string so that the order of the characters do not matter?
You can create a set of the two strings:And then see if  contains everything that's in 
You can use  and convert both strings into it (it would count the letters in the string) , and then you can compare that for equality. Example -Demo -If you want to check if one string is contained in the other without caring about order, you can use  built-in function as below -Or you can also do the following (as indicated by @Kevin in the comments) -

You can turn the longer string into a regular expression and then match it. A simple way is to make all the characters optional, having first checked that the target string is one character longer:If you don't have Python 3.4, then use an explicit  anchor:
