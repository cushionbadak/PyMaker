Python's  module doesn't try to figure out how to serialize arbitrary objects.  It only knows about the Python types that have an equivalent JSON type: , , , , , , .  You need to instruct it how to dump other types.  SQLAlchemy models can be particularly complex: there are many column types that don't have an equivalent JSON type, do you embed relationships or just include their foreign keys, what about hybrid properties, etc.  Rather than trying to make decisions for you, Python requires you to tell it how to reduce a complex object to the basic types.
