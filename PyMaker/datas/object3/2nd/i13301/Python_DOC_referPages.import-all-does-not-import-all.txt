This  statement:does not import . Why it doesn't?
 is a package, when doing  , it would import all the names defined in the  for the  package, as well as only modules and subpackages defined in the  in the  of  package.In my Python 3.4 , there is no  defined in  , hence it does not import any modules (like ) from within it.This is explained in the documentation -The only solution is for the package author to provide an explicit index of the package. The import statement uses the following convention: if a packageâ€™s  code defines a list named  , it is taken to be the list of module names that should be imported when from package import * is encountered.If  is not defined, the statement from sound.effects import * does not import all submodules from the package sound.effects into the current namespace; it only ensures that the package sound.effects has been imported (possibly running any initialization code in ) and then imports whatever names are defined in the package. This includes any names defined (and submodules explicitly loaded) by .
Generally, the values imported from a  depend on the values specified in the  list for the  file of that package.Not being able to import  means that it is not contained in the  list for the   file.A quick way to evaluate whether a package 'exports' some submodules is to evaluate whether it has an  attribute after you  it. If it does, it will return the available submodules, if not an  will be raised.So for example, for a package like :
