I'm having the problem that when running this program, no matter what, everything you input are counted as seconds rather than wahtever unit you actually chose.I first thought the problem was the indentation on the first if, but if it is intended at all, the program ceases to work. I've tried figuring this out for awhile but I can't for the life of me. Help?
You should use what you calculateEven though you are doing the correct calculation(s), you never update the value of  — which means that you are effectively calculating something that you then toss away.ExampleThe code is confusing—indentation matter!The indentation level of the s after  looks like they will only be evaluated if  is equal to  . This might not be an issue if the whitespace in your code is actually written so that the interpret doesn't read your code that way, but it looks weird and is very error-prone.ExampleHow to fix the problemsAt every point where you are currently doing the "calculate and discard"-dance, update the code so that you actually store the calculated value—making it available for future use.Also fix the indentation level so that it no longer looks like you are using nested if-conditionals.Note: Another point worth raising is that  could never match more than one of those if-statements, you are better of using if-elif-statements.

As already pointed out, you are not actually updating  and your if's should not be indented inside the first but a simpler approach to your overall logic would be to use a dict mapping seconds, hours etc.. to the appropriate values:All the logic of your if statements are combined in , it will pull the appropriate value from the dict or return 1 if the user enters something invalid leaving remind as is.You may want to actually use a while loop and validate that the user enters some valid input, something like.If you were using the if logic then use , a unit cannot be five different things at once, if's are always evaluated but elif's are only evaluated if the previous if or elif evaluated to False:But again that logic does not handle when a user enters no valid input.
