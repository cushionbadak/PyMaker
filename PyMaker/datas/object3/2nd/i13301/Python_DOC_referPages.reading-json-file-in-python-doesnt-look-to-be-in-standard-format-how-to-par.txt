Natural Text
I don't think this is in the standard  format. I don't see the colons that I've seen in other examples. For example, you can see the first line shows Florida (FL). So I would have thought I would see something like 'State':'FL'. The headers aren't shown here but when I look at the web page results the headers are shown. Are the colons required in order to parse this effectively? Ultimately I'd like to get this into CSV format so that I can load it into Excel. The below is a sample of the file.Current CodeEDITAdding this code gets me to the data I want to extract:Result:But these needs to iterate through the file and find each instance. The pattern is , , . The file can have many like this. How can I iterate or loop through the file and print each of these?EDIT - final code that works
As you have realized by now, the JSON is correct and you correctly parsed it in Python.  Now you have a data structure to process.In Python, you can process a list using a  loop:You'll want to use the  module to encode the data structure you produce (namely the list of data you want in your file) correctly according to the CSV respresentation.
