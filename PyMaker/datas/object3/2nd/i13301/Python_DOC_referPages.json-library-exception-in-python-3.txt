As the Python 2 API seems to be messed up - from file system functions I sometimes get unicode strings, sometimes standard strings - I am now attempting a transition from Python 2 to Python 3. But while doing so I run into problems regarding the  module.I run a standard Ubuntu system with Python 3.4. When I try to use the JSON module I get the following error message:At first glance this seems to be a bug in the JSON module of Python 3. Something I can hardly believe because I don't do anything which would be out of the ordinary: I just read a very very simple JSON configuration file.Do you have any ideas how to deal with this error?
 in Python 3 does not accept binary files and therefore the 2nd parameter  is removed. is interpreted as  parameter here that is unrelated to the encoding that leads to the  that you see. Drop  from the  call -- you should pass the encoding to the code that opens the file instead:
The second argument of  in Python 2 was , however in Python 3 the second argument is  and it must be  (the default) or  subclass. The signature of  is nowYou need to remove  from the list of arguments (pass it to the file opener instead).OTOH  still has the  argument, but it "is ignored and deprecated".
