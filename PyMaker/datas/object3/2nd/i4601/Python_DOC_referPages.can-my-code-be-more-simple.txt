An n-by-n square matrix (table of numbers) is a magic matrix if the sum of its row and the sum of each column are identical. For example, the 4-by-4 matrix below is a magic matrix. The sum of every row and the sum of every column are exactly the same value 34.Write a function that takes a 4-by-4 matrix as an argument and then determine if the matrix is magic or not. The    #matrix should be stored as a two-dimensional list. Test your function with a magic matrix and a none magic matrix.
With a couple of set comprehensions and a  that is fairly straight forward to cleanup like:Code:Test Code:Results:
