I have some listHow I can get element 'v8' where 'test' equals test1, and replace it with other value?
(you shouldn't use  as a name as it overrides the  function, so I replaced it with )Just iterate over the list and replace where appropriate:giving:
First, extract the item you need.You have a list of one element; check access to field Now, simply reassign that field.Note that the value of the original dict changes: this happens with references to mutable items.  Go through enough tutorials that you understand this before you try to make further use of it.
