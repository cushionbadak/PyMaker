This question already has an answer here:Get a random sample with replacement                    4 answers                If I have a list of 10 items like would return a list of 4 unique items within the range.Is there another "random" method that returns a random list with the possibility of repeating items?
There isn't a trivial function (like ) for sampling with replacement because it's so trivial you really don't need one:There is a function for less-trivial uses of sampling with replacement, . And you can call it with no weights or anything else if you want:But it's not really any easier to understand.
