I have written a web scraper according to a youtube vid. It gives me just one container from all 48 containers. Why isn't my code looping through all the containers automatically? What did I miss here?
Because the loop is "empty". In python you have to indent the block of code that should run inside the loop, e.g.:In your code:
You asked me what was going on and why I get the correct result. Below the script adjusted for py 3.5. As it appears some error occurs at the print line. I by accident almost fixed your script in your question itself.As Ilja pointed out there were indentation errors and its correct he mentioned empty list returns... prior to my accidental partial fix. What I missed out in the accidental fix was not bringing in the print statements into the for-loop. So I get one result. Checking the web-page... you want to collect all phone products.Below script fixes all the issues by having the print-statements inside the for-loop. Thus in your Pycharm standard output you should now hget many blocks of printed products. And fixing your file wire should show similar result in the csv-file.Py3.5+ is a little bit childish when it comes to print ('title' + title`). IMO... style py2.x should have been kept as it gives more flexibility and reduces RSI by less typing. Anyway, the iteration through this phone web-page should work now like a pyCharm.. comment : no you didn't use  at all and its not needed but....For print syntax examples check here and for the official python docs here.In addition, I've added some formatting code for your output-file. It should be now in columns... and readable. Enjoy!
Thank you all for helping me solve this. It was the indentation of the print lines. You are the best!
