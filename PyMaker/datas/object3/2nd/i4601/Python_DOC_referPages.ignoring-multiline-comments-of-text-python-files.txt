I'm working over python, making a function that must open a python file (it must compile), and extract the name of all functions contained on it.But it has to ignore every commented line. I tried everything and I'm not be able to do it. It includes the lines, or enter in infinite loops.My code looks right now like this:EDIT: For example, the test file I'm using for input is this:It must output only defined functions:This will be sorted lately, but I want only defined functions and its lines, or, as default, managed in lines.
The problem with your code is here:When  is set to True, this  statement will evaluate to true and your loop won't increment . So the next iteration of the loop checks the same line again, the  evaluates to True again,  isn't incremented, and you have an infinite loop.The correct way to work with python source code is to use the ast module. You use  to parse the code, and then  to find all function definitions:
