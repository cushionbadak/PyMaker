I have an I/O trace file with the following fields ('asu', 'block_address','size', 'opcode','time_stamp').The Data looks like this. (over 5 million rows)I am trying to add a cache layer in my project and want to calculate the misses and hits.I am using to find cache hits and misses for the block_address.Following the tutorial I tried calculating the miss/hits.  is the trace array for block_address.On looking at the cache info  , I get  . Which is not right.I am fairly new to python and caching concepts. I don't know what I am doing wrong.How do I find the miss/hits for the block address? 
The cache is for the function  -- you only called  once, therefore your cache size is one, and it has one miss.Consider the following function with When called with a certain value for  the function will run and the result will be stored in the cache. If called again with the same parameter, the function will not run at all and the cached value will be returned.In your example, even if the cache was setup correctly, you would have all misses and no hits anyhow  will call with a new argument each iteration, therefore the cache will never hit.
