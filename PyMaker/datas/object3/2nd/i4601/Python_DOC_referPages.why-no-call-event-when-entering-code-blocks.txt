I'm using Python's  to trace through code execution for a program analysis task.In contrast to what the documentation states I do not see a call event being registered when entering a code block.A sample tracer I'm using is below:For example, consider the source code:I see the expected return event upon exiting the  body, but there is no call event when entering. Am I missing something here?I'm using Python 3.6.3 on Mac OSX, in case that is relevant.
The docs are poorly worded. They say a  event occurs whenA function is called (or some other code block entered).but "some other code block" is referring to anything with its own code object and associated scope, not blocks like .
