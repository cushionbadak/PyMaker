Natural Text
Im am trying to scrape developer jobs from indeed.nl to Excel using Python and bs4. Everything works fine but when I open it in Excel, there are extra lines cells between the jobs  Can anyone see what I did wrong?
The  element starts with a newline and some spaces. Remove those with .strip().You can also consider the csv module to write well-formatted CSV files. The module will help you with correct escaping of special characters.
