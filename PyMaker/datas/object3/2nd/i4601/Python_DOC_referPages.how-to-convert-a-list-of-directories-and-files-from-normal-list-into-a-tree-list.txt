i am using python and PyQt5 library  in order to display the list of directories and files existing in a required path.where the user choose the desired folder and the program create a list that holds all the existing folders and sub_folders and files then it append this list to QlistWidget  in order to display all the folders.what i want is to transform this list into a TreeList to make the display like this :the function is :
This method will build the tree view recursively.The  method makes the root directory object and sets it as the top level object of the tree.The  method builds the folder hierarchy recursively by creating a tree item out of the supplied path, then if that path is a directory, adding each sub item as a child of the new tree item.Be careful which folder you set as the root of this method, you could end up with many many thousands of tree items.  It would be a good design idea to implement some sort of a depth limit.
I think what you need can be more easily achieved by  than os.walk, together with Path.parts you can assemble a nested dict like this:use this tree to populate your TreeWidget with something like this:
