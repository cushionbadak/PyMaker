I have a python function (using the Pythonista app) to show an image in the console. I have the image saved in a BytesIO object but the function requires a file path.Is there any way to give it a path to the bytesIO or somehow give it the image without needing to save it as a file?The specific function is console.show_image(image_path)
The general answer is that if the function you call expects a filesystem path and cannot handle a file-like object instead then your only solution is to write your data to a file (and ask the function's author to add support for file-like object, or if it's OSS implement it by yourself and send a merge request).
