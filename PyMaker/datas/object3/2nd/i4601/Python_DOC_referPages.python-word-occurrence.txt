Natural Text
I'm trying to open and read a text file and count the number of types a word occurs for example if the word better is in the text it would have a frequency of 8. I have attached the code below. I got the following errorUnicodeDecodeError:  'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x97 in position 861: invalid start byteI am using IDLE 3.5.1
It seems that you IntroductoryCS.txt is not in UTF-8.You should change encoding in open() function.Something like this:See documentation here.I don't know what encoding is your file but try this:Here are avalaible encodings.
Your code is working fine.Try to save the txt file as . Open the file on notepad, then save as, and choose encoding .
