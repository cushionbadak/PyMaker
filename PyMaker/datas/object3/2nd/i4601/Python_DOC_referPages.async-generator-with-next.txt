I have the following piece of code:It looks like It is blocking my async function that is calling is_it_bad. I'm not very familiar with async, is there any way to make this function non-blocking?Function calling is_it_bad:
make this function non-blocking?In context of  blocking function is a function that spends much time waiting for network-related operations (when you're requesting something from web) or a function that spends much CPU-time (long calculations).Usually you can use  to run network-related operations concurrently that allows to get results faster.  can't somehow speedup CPU-related operations other than running them in executor (pool of processes) to get benefit of multiple cores. Latter however can be achieved with pure ProcessPoolExecutor, without  at all.As far as I can tell your code is none of the described situations:  has nothing to do with network and it doesn't seem to contain long-running calculations that can be parallelized on multiple cores. Read this answer for detailed explanations.Long story short, if I'm not missing something you don't need  at all, there's just no sense to use it. Just make  a plain function and use it so.
What I see from your code is that you are doing CPU bounded call and it can block the reactor(loop), I think the better way to solve your problem is using multiprocessing or just using a wrapper to run the tasks in an executor(another process)https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#executorhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#processpoolexecutor
