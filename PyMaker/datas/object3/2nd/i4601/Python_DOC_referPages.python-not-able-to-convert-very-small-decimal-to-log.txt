I am using a function that multiplies probabilities there by creating very small values. I am using  module to handle it and then when the compuation is complete I convert that decimal to  using  module/function. But, below a certain proability python cannot convert these very small probabilities to log2 or 10 of likelyhood ratio.I am getting So, I printed the value before the traceback started and it seems to be this number:Other small numbers like this are getting handled by  though in the same program:Is it true? any way to fix this. I know I can take the log of the probs and then sum it along the way, but when I tried to do that, it seems I have to update several places in my program - could take significant hours or days. and there is another process to convert it back to decimal.Thanks,
If you want to take logarithms of  objects, use the  or  methods. Aside from a weird special case for huge ints,  casts inputs to float.
