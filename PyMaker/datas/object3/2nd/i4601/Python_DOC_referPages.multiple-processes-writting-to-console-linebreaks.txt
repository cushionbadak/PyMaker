I have multiple python threads printing output to a command line window. Each process writes logging messages to the command line window. Depending on the timing of the print operations, it sometimes happens that two lines (from different processes) are printed on a single line:Is there any way of guaranteeing every line is printed on a different line in the command window, as suchI've played around with adding breakline characters. But this only makes empty lines appear.
The answers given above are good suggestions. I also found another solution on stack overflow after some more searching:How to share stdout for multi-threaded python script?This answer suggest to use the logging module for python, which is supposed to be thread safe.
