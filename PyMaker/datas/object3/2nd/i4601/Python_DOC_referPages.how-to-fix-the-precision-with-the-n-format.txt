I want to print a decimal using a comma as decimal separator. When I do thisI get . The comma is there, but the precision is only one, whereas I set it to two. How come?Note this format is constructed as follows:: "The  option causes the "alternate form" to be used for the conversion. ... In addition, for  and  conversions, trailing zeros are not removed from the result.": Precision.: "Number. This is the same as , except that it uses the current locale setting to insert the appropriate number separator characters."where the quotes come from the manual: Format Specification Mini-Language.Using  as suggested in the comments does not do what I want either: . The precision is correct, but the comma from the locale is ignored.
When  is used to print a , it acts like , not , but uses your locale for the separator characters. And the documentation of precision says:The precision is a decimal number indicating how many digits should be displayed after the decimal point for a floating point value formatted with  and , or before and after the decimal point for a floating point value formatted with  or .So  means to print 2 total digits before and after the decimal point.I don't think there's a simple way to get -style precision with -style use of locale. You need to determine how many digits your number has before the decimal point, add 2 to that, and then use that as the precision in your format.
