Natural Text
I am trying to read the first line of a CSV file and assign it to . The CSV file looks like this:Here is the code:I expect the output to look like:However the output looks like this:What did I miss?
That first character is the Byte order mark character.Try this:This advice is somewhat hidden away in the documentation, but it is there:In some areas, it is also convention to use a “BOM” at the start of  UTF-8 encoded files; the name is misleading since UTF-8 is not  byte-order dependent. The mark simply announces that the file is  encoded in UTF-8. Use the ‘utf-8-sig’ codec to automatically skip the  mark if present for reading such files.
