I want to make use of properties in python while still being able to call the setter method of a property directly in some cases. The reason being, that I need to assign variables in lambda statements while using PySide/PyQt.The following example includes two classes which should behave almost identical. One using  and one .This works pretty well. For class  i can assign values to the variable using 3 different ways. 2 of them are possible to use in a lambda statement.However, if I'm using the  decorator I only have 2 ways left (As far as I can see at least!). And the only possible way to assign in a lambda statement is using , which I'd rather avoid since it hurts readability in my opinion :(QuestionIs there a way to use the syntactic sugar of the  decorator while still being able to use the setter directly?
Edit: actually, there is a way to do itBut this is far less readable than  so I wouldn't use it.No there isn't. But you shouldn't expect there to be.Complaining you now only have two different ways to do something is not a good argument. Like @Aran-Fey said, you can use a real  function or  like in your example. It is not wrong to use these and anyone worth their salt in python will understand what is going on.
