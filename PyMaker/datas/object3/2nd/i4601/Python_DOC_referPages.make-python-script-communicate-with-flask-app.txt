I have two scripts that are running in loop independently: a simple python script that generates dataand the flask application that displays dataI wish to somehow connect the two scripts, so the application displays the data produced by the python script.When I combine the scripts as shown above, I can see that the execution does not get to the while loop (past  line) until I terminate the app.I found a similar question here, but not not helpful, and another question here that is identical to what I am trying to do, but it also does not give me any clue. I can not find any info that tells how to make a flask application to communicate with a separately running script. Here's a similar question with no definite answer. Please, give me an insight how these two things should run together, or an example would be greatly appreciated.
Since your script keeps generating data indefinitely, I would suggest transforming it into a generator and iterating over it from the web request handler:You can also communicate with a long running separate process (external command):
You can create a function that will procedure the data, which can then be served on the route:
