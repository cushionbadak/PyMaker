So I understand that:The end of a logical line is represented by the token NEWLINEThis means the way Python's grammar is defined the only way to end a logical line is with a  token.The same goes for physical lines (rather an EOL, which is the EOL of the platform you're using when writing the file but nevertheless converted to a universal  by Python.A logical line can or cannot be equivalent to one or more physical lines, but usually it's one, and most of the times it's one if you write clean code.In the sense that:Without showing examples of how 1 logical is equivalent to > 1 physical, my question is the following part from the docs:Statements cannot cross logical line boundaries except where NEWLINE  is allowed by the syntax (e.g., between statements in compound  statements)But what does this even mean? I understand the list of the compound statements, be them: if, while, for, etc. they are all made up of one or multiple clauses and each clause, in turn is made up of a header and a suite.The suite is made up of one or multiple statements, let's take an example to be more specific:So the if statement is something like this according to the grammar (excluding the elifs and else clauses):where the suite and its subsequent statements: so this means that if you want you can choose (given by "|") your suite to be 1 of 2 ways:on the same line:disadvantages: not pythonic and you cannot have another compound statement that introduces a new block (like a func def, another if, etc)advatanges: one liner I guessexample:introduce a new block:advantages: all, and the proper way to do itexample:but I don't see how Statements cannot cross logical line boundaries except where NEWLINE  is allowed by the syntaxWhat I see above is a suite, which is a block of code controlled by the if clause, and in turn, that suite, is made up of logical, independent lines (statements), where each logical line is one physical line (coincidentally). I don't see how one logical line can cross the boundaries (which basically is just a fancy word for the end, the limit, which is newline), I don't see how one statement can cross those boundaries and span into the next statement, or maybe I'm really confused and have everything mixed up, but if someone can please explain.Thank you for your time in advance.
Pythons grammarFortunately there is a Full Grammar specification in the Python documentation.A statement is defined in that specification as:And a logical line is delimited by  (that's not in the specification but based on your question).Step-by-stepOkay, let's go through this, what's the specification for a :Okay now it goes into several different paths and it probably doesn't make sense to go through all of them separately but based on the specification a  could cross logical line boundaries if any of the s contains a  (currently they don't but could).Apart from that only theoretical possibility there is actually the :I picked only the  statement and  because it already suffices. The  statement including  and  and all of the content in these is one statement (a compound statement). And because it may contain s (if the  isn't just a ) it already fulfills the requirement of "a statement that crosses logical line boundaries".An example  (schematic):would be:And all of this belongs to the if statement (and it's not just a block "controlled" by the  or , ...).The same  with ,  and A way to visualize that would be using the built-in ,  and  modules (really, I haven't known about this modules before I wrote the answer):Actually I cannot explain most of the  result but it shows (if you remove a lot of unnecessary lines) that the  including it's newlines really belongs to the . Indentation represents the "depth" of the parser at a specific point.That could probably be made much more beautiful but I hope it serves as illustration even in it's current form.
It's simpler than you think. A compound statement is considered a single statement, even though it may have other statements inside. Quoting the docs:Compound statements contain (groups of) other statements; they affect or control the execution of those other statements in some way. In general, compound statements span multiple lines, although in simple incarnations a whole compound statement may be contained in one line.For example,is a single  statement occupying 3 logical lines. That's how a statement can cross logical line boundaries.
