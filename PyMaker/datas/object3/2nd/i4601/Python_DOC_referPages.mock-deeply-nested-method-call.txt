Natural Text
For a test, I need to mock some slow, external calls.This is my current test setup, which looks bloated and ugly.child_object is not available at test run, buthas to be called during test and return the custom_list.Quoting Raymond Hettinger... "there must be a better way!".Any shortcut or better way compared to above setup?
Alternative ugliness with context manager?
