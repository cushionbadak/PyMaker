In my Python Shell, deleting  makes it become . Although, checking with  confirms that I am not refering to  from some global variable.My guess is that we are using it from some closure. How is this behaviour taking place?
All names are looked up first from local variables, then global variables, then , which is available everywhere. It's where all the built in functions are.
As you can probably guess from the , you're accessing the name of the  module.Whenever you access a variable and that variable isn't found in any closure, the local scope or the global scope, the lookup falls back to the builtins. This is why you can access things like  or  or  even though they're not global variables:The same thing happens with . Initially, there's a  variable defined in the global scope:But once that name is deleted with , the lookup in the globals fails and falls back to the builtins - so you end up with the name of the  module.
