How can I convert bytes to string without changing data ?E.gInput:Output:I want to write an image data using StringIO with some additional data, Below is my code snippet,This works fine with python 2.7 but I want it to be working with python 3.4.on read operation  returns bytes object data something like this  While writting data using  it accepts only String data, so unable to write  with some additional characters.So I want to convert  as it is in String object without changing its data. Something like this so that I can concat and write the image data.I don't want to decode or encode data. Any suggestions would be helpful for me. thanks in advance.
It is not clear what kind of output you desire.  If you are interested in aesthetically translating bytes to a string representation without encoding:This is the informal string representation of the original byte string (no conversion).  DetailsThe official string representation looks like this:String representation handles how a string looks.  Double escape characters and double quotes are implicitly interpreted in Python to do the right thing so that the  function outputs a formatted string.String intrepretation handles what a string means.  Each block of characters means something different depending on the applied encoding.  Here we interpret these blocks of characters (e.g. , , , ) with the  encoding.  Blocks unrecognized by this encoding are replaced with a default character, ï¿½:Converting from bytes to strings is required for reliably working with strings.In short, there is a difference in string output between how it looks (representation) and what it means (interpretation).  Clarify which you prefer and proceed accordingly.AddendumIf your question is "how do I concatenate a byte string?", here is one approach:Equivalently:
