As described in this answer how to import module one can import a module located in another path this way:My question is: How can I execute this other module (and also pass parameters to it), if this other module is setup this way:and  uses  to work with the parameters supplied?I ADDED THE FOLLOWING AFTER THE FIRST QUESTIONS/COMMENTS CAME UPI am able to pass the parameters via so this topic is already covered.Why do I want to call another module with parameters?I would like to be able to do a kind of a small regression test for another project. I would like to get this other project via a  and have different versions locally available, that I can debug, too, if needed. But I do not want to be involved too much in that other project (so that forking does not make sense).AND SO MY REMAINING QUESTION ISHow can I tweak the contents of  when calling the other module? 
There are multiple ways to approach this problem.If the module you want to import is well-written, it should have separate functions for parsing the command line arguments and for actually doing work. It should look something like this:In this case, you would simply import the module and then call its  function with the correct arguments:This is the optimal solution.If the module doesn't define such a  function, you can manually set  and use  to execute the module:Note that this only executes the module; it doesn't import it. (I.e. the module won't be added to  and you don't get a module object that you can interact with.)
