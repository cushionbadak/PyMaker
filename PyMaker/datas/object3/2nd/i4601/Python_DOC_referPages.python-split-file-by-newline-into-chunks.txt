I have a file which is separated by newline into chunks of the same number of rows. Each row is a field. For example, in chunk1, the first field = a1,a2,a3. In chunk2, the same field = a2,a3,a4.How can I get a dataframe (or other data structure) like below?Thanks!
An open file is an iterator of lines. You want an iterator of groups of lines.Since all of these groups are 6 lines long (counting the blank line at the end), the easiest way to do this is to use the  example from the  recipes in the docs. (You can also get a pre-made version from the  library on PyPI, if you prefer.)If the length of your groups isn't known in advance (even if it will always be consistent within a file), you can instead use  to create alternating groups of empty and non-empty lines. This is kind of like using  on a string.We can just use  as a key function here—a non-empty line is truthy, and an empty line is falsey. (If that seems odd to you, you can write something like  or  instead.)Or, if this seems way over your head… well, first read David Beazley's Generator Tricks for Systems Programmers, and maybe it won't be over your head anymore. But if it is, we can do the same thing a bit more explicitly:
If you can use pandas and know how many fields there are:If don't know how many fields:
you can try generator approach:output:
