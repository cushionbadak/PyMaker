I'm trying to iterate all elements in (dictionary). But I'm getting this error. Why does it say  as ? And how do we resolve this problem?'list' object has no attribute 'items' on line 13 in main.py
The problem lies in the sorted(...) method. From python documentation:https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sortedYou'll see that the method returns a list. Therefore, when you callYou are actually converting your dictionary to a sorted list. Off the top of my head, a better way of doing this would be getting a sorted list of the keys, and then referencing that. Something like Obviously this is not including validation on your initial array. 
 returns a list; you are replacing your  with the list of sorted keys.Instead, you just wantwhich iterates over a list of key/value pairs sorted by key.
