Some key things going on here.If possible, you should be using  (or  installed via ).You are likely patching in the wrong location.When using  you probably want to use the  keyword argument, rather than Suppose your production code looks something like this....If you wanted to test  from your production code, mocking  your test code should patch  not So your test code may look like thisAnother way of using  is as a context manager. So the patch will only apply in that context.
