Natural Text
I am a primary school teacher and want to create a program to randomly choose a word from a bank of spelling words that I will enter. I want to create this to insure that there can be no bias on the part of the judge choosing an easier or harder word due to personal feelings. I have no programming experience and I have tried to fins this information on google. I appreciate any help that you can offer.
If you've got excel, the easy way is to create a list on a tab (name the tab List). Create a new tab called retrieve and in a cell of that tab, enter the following formula. I assume you have 250 words. If you don't, change the number 250 to your number of words in both spots where it occurs.Everytime you hit the  key, you will get a fresh word, though this method doesn't guarantee no repeats.
