I have an SQL database "Garage.db" that has 3 tables:Customer, Car and MOTI want to update the field BookedMOT in the MOT table when someone has entered a Registration that is in the Car table. Can someone help me with the SQL query that can do this, thank you.I am coding this in python 3.6 using tkinter. Here is my attempt,
(this addresses some Python problems I noticed before even realising that the SQL didn't look right, which should probably be fixed first)Try this:In general, when you say , you should probably use  inside the  block. After the block finished it did an automatic commit and trying to use  or  afterwards is probably incorrect. The  also means that you don't have to  any more.sqlite3 connection objects ( in this case) have an  method:This is a nonstandard shortcut that creates a cursor object by calling the cursor() method, calls the cursorâ€™s execute() method with the parameters given, and returns the cursor.Finally, you had some redundant parentheses that could be removed.
