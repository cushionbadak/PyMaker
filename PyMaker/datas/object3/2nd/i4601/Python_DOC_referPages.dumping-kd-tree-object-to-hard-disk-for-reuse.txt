I am building a set of KD-trees for some problem. But I realised, I do not need to load the files and construct the same set of KD-trees again and again, if I manage to somehow write then to hardisk, and just read them again. Upon searching a bit, I hit upon the example below, but not sure where does it dumps the file. How can I store it in hard-disk to some example location(C:\my_file):And after saving reload it from that location: Is it even possible? What are some other possible ways to do it?
Start with the docs.Then you will hit this usage along the way:There is a lot to say about pickle-protocols, relative vs. absolute paths and co., but the documentation is the way to go there!(Sometimes you might hit a problem when an object is not ready to be pickled (again: python-docs). But in terms of scipy and sklearn, pickling should be possible for most interesting use-cases)
