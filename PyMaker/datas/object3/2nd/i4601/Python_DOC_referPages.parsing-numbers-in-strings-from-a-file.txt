Natural Text
I have a txt file as here:what I want to do, is check that the % of each "res" gets to 100%So in my code I manage to split the last ',' and enter it into a list, but im not sure how I can get only the numbers out of that text.
It seems like what you have is CSV. Instead of trying to parse that on your own, Python already has a builtin parser that will give you back nice dictionaries (so you can do ):For the  part, you can either parse the field manually (it appears to be structured):  and then  each  separated part (the last thing should be the percent). If you're trying to enforce a format, then I'd definitely go this route, but regex are also a fine solution too for quickly pulling out what you want. You'll want to read up on them, but in your case, you want :Or with regex:Regex is certainly shorter, but the former will enforce more strict formatting requirements on  and will allow you to later extract things like candidate names.Also some random notes:You don't need to open with  unless you plan to append to the file,  will do (and  is implicit, so you don't have to specify it).Instead of  use a for loop!
You can use regex to find all the numbers:This will printThe  method finds all substrings matching the specified pattern, which in this case is , meaning any continuous string of digits. This returns a list of strings, which we cast to a list of s, then take the sum.
