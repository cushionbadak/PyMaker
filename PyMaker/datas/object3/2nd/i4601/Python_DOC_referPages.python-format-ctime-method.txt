I am trying to get a the modified date of a file using  and to convert time into human readable format; it is advised to use  method but it gives the name of the date and month too, which I do not want. Is it possible to format ?Currently I have code like:
You can do that with datetime.fromtimestamp() like:Code:Test Code:Results:
As documented, the  function just calls , which has a fixed format. If you want to use a -style format string, the way to do that is to call the  function.There are actually two ways to do this. The modern way is to construct a  object and call its method:If you want to stick with the  module, you need a  to pass to its function:If this is the only thing you're doing with timestamps, there isn't much difference. But if you want to be able to, e.g., sort them, do arithmetic on them, etc., you'll probably be happier with .
