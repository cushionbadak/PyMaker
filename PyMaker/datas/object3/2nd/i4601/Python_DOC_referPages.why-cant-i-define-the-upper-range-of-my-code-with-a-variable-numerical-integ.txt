This question already has an answer here:How to use a decimal range() step value?                    33 answers                I'm relatively new to Python, so my code is very simple.I have a project to write code which approximates integrals using the rectangle rule, followed by the trapezium rule:Near the end, I try to use a for loop from the initial limit to minus 1 the number of step sizes.I've defined this as a float but it I keep getting the error TypeError: 'float' object cannot be interpreted as an integer.Any ideas how to fix this?
when you collect your  and  variables, you convert them in :Then you try to iterate from a to N, but let's assume  and .How do you expect python to behave?so you have to convert your float into integers ():or you can use numpy, and define 2 float values and the step between them:
,  and  are floats.  does not allow its arguments to be floats so you will need to convert them to :
The error message clearly states that you are using floats where an integer is wanted. Read the documentation of  - what lead you to believe is is capable of doing anything with floats?There are unlimited floats between 1 and 2 - and still very many if you take the resolution of float into consideration - how should python be able to give you all of them as range?
