You have a name conflict. You can't have both  and a  package. When Python imports  it'll either find the  module or the  package. You can't have both.On my Python 3.7 setup on OS X, packages win:which would mean your  file is never even executed.Move the  contents into  and import your submodules there. When you import a submodule of a package, that module automatically becomes an attribute.So all you need to do is remove , and then you can useanywhere, at which point  will suffice to be able to reach .See the Submodules section of the Python reference documentation on the import system:When a submodule is loaded [...] a binding is placed in the parent moduleâ€™s namespace to the submodule object. For example, if package  has a submodule , after importing ,  will have an attribute  which is bound to the submodule.I'd use package-relative imports at the top of your  file:to ensure that the submodule is loaded when you import .
