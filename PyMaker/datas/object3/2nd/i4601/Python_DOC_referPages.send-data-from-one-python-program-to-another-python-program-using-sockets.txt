Hello fellow programmers! I'm trying to send a string from one python 3 program on my laptop to another python 3 program on my other laptop.I think I have searched the whole web for tutorials on using sockets but they don't seem to solve my problem what so ever. I found helpful answers here on stackoverflow, but unfortunately didn't do trick.How would I send a message like this: "Test message 123" to my other laptop?I tried this 
https://docs.python.org/2.4/lib/socket-example.htmlStart server on your machine 1Start client on your machine 2Make sure they are connected to the same network and you can ping one machine from the other.Be sure you use the port which is open for such connectivity purpose.
