I'm generating a list filled with sublists of randomly generated 0s and 1s, and then trying to compare each list with every other list to determine their similarity, efficiently.I know that my code works with a single process (i.e. without involving , but once I start involving  or   everything starts to break.I want to compare how long a single process would take compared to multiple processes. I've tried this with , but a single process actually ended up taking less time, probably due to the Global Interpreter Lock.Here's my code:And here's the error:N.B. I have tried using  but it results in the same error. The code also seems to be attempting to run indefinitely, as the error appears over and over again.Thanks!
The problem is that your top-level code—including the code that creates the child —is not protected from being run in the child processes.As the docs explain:, if you're not using the  start method (and since you're on Windows, you're not):Make sure that the main module can be safely imported by a new Python interpreter without causing unintended side effects (such a starting a new process).In fact, it's nearly identical to the example that follows that warning. You're launching a whole pool of children instead of just one, but it's the same problem. Every child in the pool tries to launch a new pool, and, fortunately,  figures out that something bad is going on and fails with a  instead of exponentially spawning processes until Windows refuses to spawn anymore or its scheduler just falls down.As the docs say:Instead one should protect the “entry point” of the program by using :In your case, that means this part:
