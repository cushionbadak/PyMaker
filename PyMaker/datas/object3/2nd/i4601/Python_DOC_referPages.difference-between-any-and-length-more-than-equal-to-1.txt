I am trying to evaluate whether there is any elements in an object (series in the following example). I used  and I couldn't understand it's behavior. I am wondering why  returns True while  return False?
The Python any function is a short-circuiting boolean test of all elements of inside a sequence or iterable:The sequence itself is  unless it is empty or has 0 length:The Python function len returns the length of a sequence and is completely unrelated to . Although you could force  to be like  I suppose:(An iterable, such as a generator, may not support  but  can still be used on these iterables.)To answer your question of I am wondering why len(s)>=1 returns True while any(s) return False? you need to understand Truth Value Testing in PythonAll objects are  in Python except:; in a numeric object;Empty containers, mappings or sequences (those where );A user written object that has defined its own notion of true or false.So  is  because all the elements of the sequence  are  while  indicates that  contains objects and therefor  would be .This is way simpler, once understood, than other languages sense of 'truthiness', such as Perl'sPandas any and len methods mirror the Python built-in functions.
