I already trained a model for topic classification. Then when I am going to  transform new data into vectors for prediction, it going wrong. It shows "NotFittedError: CountVectorizer - Vocabulary wasn't fitted." But when I did the prediction by splitting training data into test data in trained model, it works. Here are the code:Here is an error
You need to call  for the count vectorizer to build the dictionary of words before calling . You can also just call  that combines both. But you should not be using a new vectorizer for test or any kind of inference. You need to use the same one you used when training the model, or your results will be random since vocabularies are different (lacking some words, does not have the same alignment etc..)For that, you can just pickle the vectorizer used in the training and load it on inference/test time.
