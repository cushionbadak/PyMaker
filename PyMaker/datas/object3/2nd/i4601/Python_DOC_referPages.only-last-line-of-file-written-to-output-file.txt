However when I do a print of the variable I get all the lines I would expect.Example output of when I do print I get multiple rds arn's:However when I check the file I've written there's only:
You should use a  to write to files, ensuring they get closed even if exceptions happen. As soon as the code leaves the block below the  your file will be auto-closed - no need to do it manually.You could reformulate your code like this:You might also addd a  to your write output - it is not automatically added.
When you print the results it prints the value of  for every single time the loop runs.And when you're writing the value into the file it will only take the value of  the last time the loop runs.What you can do is open the file before the loop and write the value within the loop instead of doing it after. Then close the file after the loop.
