This question already has an answer here:Easiest way to persist a data structure to a file in python?                    7 answers                I am writing a Python script that takes a username and determines if it is a valid username. If it is different from any other username and is greater than 6 characters, it is added to a list of usernames. If the username is shorter than 6 characters, or is the same as an existing username, the program ends and informs the user of the invalid name. My issue is if I put in a new username which gets added to the list, and then put in that same username again, it does not inform me that it is already taken. Say I input JonnyBoy as the username; it gets added to the name_list. If I then run the program again using the same username, it does not recognize it is the same as an existing username. 
Your list gets reset everytime you restart your script. You need to store the list in a file. Read that file next time you run the script to get the old list.Have a look at this article: http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/files/reading-and-writing-files-in-pythonIn this case I think the json module will do a great job.Just call  to store the list.Example for writing the list to a file:And to read it:
