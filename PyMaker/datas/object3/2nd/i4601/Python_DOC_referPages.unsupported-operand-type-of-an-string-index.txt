I tried to run the code down below, but I couldn't because it launched the following error:  unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'int'.  I've been searching and I found that it has something to do with the input, but not in this case.
The problematic part is , more specifically  where you are subtracting 'str' and 'int' types. This is not supported in Python.
You have several errors. Here is a code which I believe does what you want:The comments should explain the changes. Main points:You cannot assign to a  (the  variable), because s are immutable. Use s instead, with each element being a single character ( of length 1).When you loop over a , what you get are its characters, not the indices  you are looking for. I've used  which gives you both characters and indices.The last index in  is not , but , because Python's indexing is 0-based. Also, because Python supports negative periodic indexing, your whole if statement is not actually needed. Try leaving it out.
The first problem you are encountering is that  is a string and you cannot substract an integer from a string.The next problem you will encounter is that strings are immutable so you cannot set a given character of a string.Since a string is immutable, you will need to create a new one if you want to change even one character. In that case, it seems what you want to do is rotate your string by . This can be achieved like this.
