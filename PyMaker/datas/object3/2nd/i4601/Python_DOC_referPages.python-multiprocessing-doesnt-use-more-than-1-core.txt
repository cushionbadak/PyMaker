I have a problem with multiprocessing to use more than 1 core. I didn't use .join() which waits the previous process to finish, i have a CPU with 4 cores and i still don't know why this code only uses %20 of the CPU, it supposed to use more than %50.I guess the program executes them one by one instead of parallel judging from the output: 1 5.3739461898803712 10.6639742851257323 15.9029927253723144 21.29733967781067DoneSo, my question is how do i use multiple cores and execute the code parallelly?
