I have the following code:The output that I get is:Why is "there" being printed twice? Similarly, if I add another object of class A inside the loop and print a message, it gets printed thrice.The documentation says that logging.getLogger() will always return the same instance of the logger if the name of the logger matches. In this case, the name does match. Should it not return the same logger instance? If it is infact doing so, why is the message getting printed multiple times?
logger is created once, but multiple handlers are created.Create  once.Or change  as follow:UPDATESince Python 3.2, you can use  to see if this logger has any handlers configured. (thanks @toom)
In my case , the root loggers handler were also being called , All I did was to set  attribute of logger instance to .
Since python 3.2 and newer:Consider using  to check if a logger has handlers or not.https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.Logger.hasHandlers
