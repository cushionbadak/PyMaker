I have the following code running on Windows 8 x64:Checking the SQLite file that is created (test.db) (using sqlite command-line shell to test if there are entries in the table created via the code) shows nothing.  Any help?

The spec says that the cursor can be read only, or that your database may be in transaction mode. I am also unclear as to why you are using execute without specifying your parameters in a prepared statement, as in . Try these ideas, I don't see any error off the top of my head in your code, but am just suggesting best practices.
