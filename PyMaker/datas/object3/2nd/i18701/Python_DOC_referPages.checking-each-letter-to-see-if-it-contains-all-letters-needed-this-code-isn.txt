I need to check if all the letters that form a given word are contained inside a given string. I´ve tried something but isn´t working:print check('jshdgfyrgj', 'Correo')Should return "Correo is not here"print check('cfgotyrrtepo', 'Correo')Should return "Correo is here!"It currently returns correo is here in all cases. Whats wrong with my code?Thanks!
A couple issues - one, you expect the function to ignore case differences, but don't tell it to do so. - 'c' is not 'C'.For checking to see whether a letter is in a string it's often better to use  rather than the  method. Be sure you understand what find returns - check out the docs.In the example below I use  - this only checks the letters of  once if there are duplicates. For small strings this won't make much of a difference in performance.You can use the  function to do a bunch of boolean checks.
Why not something like: this ensures repeated letters are repeated in texto also.e.g.
If order doesn't matter:If order is important:
