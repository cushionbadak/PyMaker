In a python unit test (actually Django), what is the correct  statement that will tell me if my test result contains a string of my choosing?I want to make sure that my  contains at least the json object (or string) that I specified as the second argument above
You can modify it to work with json.Use  only for  objects. For other objects, use .
To assert if a string is or is not a substring of another, you should use  and :These are new since Python 2.7 and Python 3.1
You can write assertion about expected part of string in another string with a simple assertTrue + in python keyword :
Build a JSON object using .Then compare them using 
As mentioned by Ed I,  is probably the simplest answer to finding one string in another. However, the question states:I want to make sure that my  contains at least the json object (or string) that I specified as the second argument above,i.e., Therefore I would use multiple assertions so that helpful messages are received on failure - tests will have to be understood and maintained in the future, potentially by someone that didn't write them originally. Therefore assuming we're inside a :Which gives helpful messages as follows:
I found myself in a similar problem and I used the attribute rendered_content, so I wrote and similarly if I want to test that a string is not renderedBut it also worked the early suggested method,So I'd say that the first one is more straightforward.I hope it will help.
