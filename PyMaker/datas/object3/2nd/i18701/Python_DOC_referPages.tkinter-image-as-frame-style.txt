Natural Text
I'm using the code I found here: http://svn.python.org/projects/python/branches/pep-0384/Demo/tkinter/ttk/roundframe.py which gives me frames with rounded corners. (Here's a link to the related article by Bryan Oakley). However, I'd like to colour the background of the frames produced using that style.It looks to me like what that file does is that it applies an image as a style sheet, and that image is the enormous text block. Consequently, when I try giving either the style itself or the frames background colours, Python returns me: .I think the solution would be to change the image. After some research, I find that apparently the PhotoImage class takes 'base64-encoded GIF files' as strings, now, how do I decode this, alternatively, what image format would I feed PhotoImage so that I can change the frame appropriately?
You can use base64.decodestring to decode the encoded image. Change the decoded file , and encode it back using following code.(Following code output base64-encoded string)
