Natural Text
I'm taking an input from a text file and trying to split the text whenever it comes across the "\n" character, but it doesn't split anything. I tried it on tabs and spaces and it works perfectly. For some reason it doesn't work with the newline character. Does it have something to do with the way I'm getting the string? I'm piping the file into the program. When I give the same lines of code a try on IDLE it works fine.
