Here is an example.  The file has a string: .I would like it to output: In this example the limit determining when to splice would be any number greater than 4. I have tried looking at the python libraries and other questions here.  My guesses have involved the following:Is there a more efficient and faster way?  I am sure there is but I am not that experienced in python and would appreciate the help!  
Use :Demo:The  utility function groups sequences by a key; here by wether or not the values are greater than 4 or not; each iteration gives us a sequence of values that are one or the other  If the values in the current group are indeed greater we print them on seperate lines, otherwise they are joined again into one string with semicolons.
