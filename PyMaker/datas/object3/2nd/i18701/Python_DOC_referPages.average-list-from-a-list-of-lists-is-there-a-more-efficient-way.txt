I have a list of lists named 'run'. I am creating an average of those lists using this section of my code:Much to my surprise, this code worked the first time that I wrote it. I'm now planning on working with much larger lists and many more values, and it's possible that performance issues will come into play. Is this method of writing an average inefficient in its use of computational resources, and how could I write code that was more efficient?
List comprehensions may be more efficient.Alternatively, you could try 
You can improve efficiency by having Python do more of the work for you with efficient built-in functions and list comprehensions:
