When I type , a random number is assigned to . It asks me for a prediction and I put in a number, say 5. After putting in 5 I always get the  statement and not the  statement. I even put a  to find out what number was generated. Sometimes I'm right on or within 1 (The game also allows for within 1) and it still re-directs me to the  statement. Could anyone help? Thanks.*Functions such as  or  are part of the game logic and defined elsewhere, so you can ignore them. 
Use the  statement after the very first statement. At current, your codeis checking if lobby == 'back' and running the else in all other cases. You probably don't want this, as the code under else is run in addition to every other if case.Code should look like this
Your problem is that you're comparing a string to an integer.You'll need to first convert the input to an :
The "else" block is only matched with the final "if prediction == number1 + 1". This means that if the correct number is guessed (or the number1 - 1 case) then it still also run the final else block.You need to change the code to use "elif" for the intermediate conditionals:
Your have three different if structures there. You almost certainly wantelif ...elif ...else
The  returned by  is a string, so all the comparisons fail. Try casting the value to an integer:
