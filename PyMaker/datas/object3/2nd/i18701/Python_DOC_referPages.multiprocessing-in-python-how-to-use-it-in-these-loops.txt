The code below handles a huge amount of data and I want to ask how can I use the multiprocessing module in Python for parallel processing in order to speed things up.Any help is appreciated
I think your problem resides in the use of yield. I think you can't yield the data from different processes. I understood, that you use the yield cuz you can't load the data "inline"  that would cause the ram to overload. maybe you can take a look at the multiprocessing Queuehttp://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html#exchanging-objects-between-processesi didn't really get what you are trying to do with your code, so i can't deliver a precise excample.
