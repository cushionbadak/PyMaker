Having following hypothetical code:is there some way how to convert the lists to c arrays?I have read and tried Cython - converting list of strings to char ** but that only throws errors.
Try following code.  function in the following code is what you want.
If you're on Python 3, here's an update to @falsetru's answer (untested on Python 2).Warning: The pointer returned by  is cached in the parent unicode-object. Which has two consequences:this pointer is only valid as long as the parent unicode-object is alive. Accessing it afterwards leads to undefined behavior (e.g. possible segmentation fault).The caller of the  isn't responsible for the freeing the memory.
