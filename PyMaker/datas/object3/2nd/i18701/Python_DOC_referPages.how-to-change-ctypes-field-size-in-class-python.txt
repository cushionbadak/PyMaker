I'm trying to parse input packets from network with python.For do that i created simple class:Field "challenge" it's null-terminated string and it has a variable (changeable) size. So i added pack variable to my S2C_ChallengePacket class.Python's documentation:pack An optional small integer that allows to override the alignment of structure fields in the instance. pack must already be defined when fields is assigned, otherwise it will have no effect.But, If i try refer to "challenge" field i get a "Segmentation fault" error.
A  is a pointer, so that won't work. This would be easier using the struct module:
