Sometimes, I like to time how long it takes parts of my code to run.  I've checked a lot of online sites and have seen, at large, two main ways to do this.  One is using  and the other is using .So, I wrote a very simple script to compare the two:Basically, it times how long it takes to print "ABC" 100 times in a for-loop.  The number on the left is the results for  and the number on the right is for :As you can see, sometimes, time.time is faster and sometimes it's slower.  Which is the better way (more accurate)?
 is more accurate, for three reasons:it repeats the tests many times to eliminate the influence of other tasks on your machine, such as disk flushing and OS scheduling.it disables the garbage collector to prevent that process from skewing the results by scheduling a collection run at an inopportune moment.it picks the most accurate timer for your OS,  or  in Python 2 and  on Python 3.
