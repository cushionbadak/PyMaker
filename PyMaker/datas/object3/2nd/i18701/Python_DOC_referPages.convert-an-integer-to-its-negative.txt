I'm trying to write some code that if a certain occurence happens, a specific number has to change to -that number.I have the following code so far:if the word "bar" is in words, x will need to come out as -6, if it is not in words, it needs to come out as +6.In some cases however x=-6 in which case it needs to become positive if bar is in words.I need to replace "crazy_function()" with something that actually works.
Use the negation operator:
The "crazy function" is trivial to implement:Use it like this:Or simply in-line it:To make it even shorter, as pointed by @kroolik:
There's already a function for this in the standard library: .In a case like this, where you just need an expression and there's no good reason it has to be a function, it's silly to use . Compare:The second is clearly more readable, as well as shorter.However, there are cases where you actually need a function. In that case,  is better than creating a function on the fly. Compare:(Of course in this case, you could just write â€¦ but not every higher-order function maps to a comprehension clause.)
Well, there's always the old standby, multiplication.
Multipy the number by -1?  That seems the simplest way to do it.
