Wrap your function with another function:I leave working out how to build the string as an exercise for the reader.Note that the structure of a decorator expression is . It's effect is . Accordingly,  (the decorator) has to return a callable of the same type as .In , the expression  is the decorator - that is, the final effect of the decorator is , and so  ends up holding .The purpose of  is to fix up properties of the decorated function to copy over metadata (such as name and docstring) from the argument function to the wrapped function, so that the whole wrapping process is transparent.
I'm perhaps dubious that this is a good use case for decorators, but here:Example:Demo:The common misconception with decorators is that the parameters  are parameters to the decorator ; that is not the case. Rather the result of the function call  is calculated as  and becomes an anonymous decorator . Therefore 'decorators with arguments' are actually decorator factories that need to return a decorator as a value.
