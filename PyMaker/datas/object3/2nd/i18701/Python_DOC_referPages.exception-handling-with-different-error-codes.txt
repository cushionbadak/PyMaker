I'd like to know how to handle different exceptions that have the same "type". I'm trying to use some code to make a directory:And I know this can fail for a variety of reasons, for example if the directory already exists:or if there's no permissions to create a new dir:I'd like to tailor my error messages to the specific failure cause, so I came up with the following code:but I'd like to do something a little less hardcoded. Is there a Pythonic way I could update my sub-failure checks?
The only information I've found... which I guess is my best answer:With the errno module I can at least rewrite my current code as:If I upgrade to python 3.2 there is the much nicer:Seems I could do something fancy with using  and  to make sure it's at least  as well.Hopefully something better will come up...
