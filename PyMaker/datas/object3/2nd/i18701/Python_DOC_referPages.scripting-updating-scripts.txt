I am completely new to python and I'm just trying it out. Something is confusing me for hours until I finally made this little test. I have 2 scripts, a.py and b.py When b.py is ran, this prints 3. But if I change the value of num to any other number, the output is still 3. How can I resave / update my script files?
Python will only read the module file on the first time the module is imported. So what you are editing is still the old version of the imported objects. If you want to reload a module, you can use . For more clarification, you can read When I edit an imported module and reimport it, the changes donâ€™t show up. Why does this happen?.
To reload a module, use  from the  module. See http://docs.python.org/3/library/imp.html#imp.reload
How do you run ? As a side note remove *.pyc files before running script again.
Next time you run b.py, result is the same.Because a.num is always init as 3, so you maybe need to update the raw a.py file to change 3 to some other values.But this is wired I suggest not do so.
