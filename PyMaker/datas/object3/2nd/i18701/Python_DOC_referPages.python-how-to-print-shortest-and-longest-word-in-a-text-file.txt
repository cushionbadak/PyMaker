Natural Text
I'm trying to make my program print out the shortest and longest word found in a text file. Let's say I type "Pie is delicious" as my block of text. I then type EOF on a line by itself to end the input phase. I typed in option 1 to see the Shortest word and "is" should pop up, but I only get the letter "p" as my output. I get the same result for the second option, which is finding the Longest word, I end up getting the letter "p" when it should be "delicious." I'm using the min and max function to do this by the way.
You are not splitting the text into words; instead you are looping over the characters one by one.Split your text using the  method leaving the arguments to the default (splitting on variable-width whitespace):
