Due to this line  python thinks that  is a local variable and will not search the global scope when you used . That's why you got that error.Use  statement to handle that:From docs:All variable assignments in a function store the value in the local  symbol table; whereas variable references first look in the local  symbol table, then in the global symbol table, and then in the table  of built-in names. Thus, global variables cannot be directly assigned  a value within a function (unless named in a global statement),  although they may be referenced.
It is actually better to use nonlocal in this case. Use global as sparingly as possible. More information about nonlocal here  docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#nonlocal
