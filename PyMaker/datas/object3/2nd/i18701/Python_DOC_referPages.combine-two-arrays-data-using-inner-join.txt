I've two data sets in array:I want to combine them into one array like this:I mean, just combine those lines with the same  column.=== EDIT===Thanks everyone, Just for clarification, I don't need those lines which not appear in both array, just drop them.
Organize your data differently (you can easily convert what you already have to two s):Then:
You can convert the arrays to a dict, and back again.
It may be worth mentioning set data types. as their methods align to the type of problem.  The set operators allow you to join sets easily and flexibly with full, inner, outer, left, right joins.  As with dictionaries, sets do not retain order, but if you cast a set back into a list, you may then apply an order on the result join.  Alternatively, you could use an ordered dictionary.This only gets you the union of dates in the original lists, in order to reconstruct arr3 you would need to append the [1:] data in arr1 and arr2 where the dates are in the result set.  This reconstruction would not be as neat as using the dictionary solutions above, but using sets is worthy of consideration for similar problems.
A single dictionary approach:That would be the equivalent of a full outer join (returns data from both sides even if one side is null). If you wanted an inner join, you might change it to this:
Generator function approach, skipping corresponding elements whose dates don't match:But yeah, if possible, organize your data differently.
Unless both are very large lists, I'd use a dictionary:Otherwise, it would be more efficient to sort each, and then do a merge that way. But I imagine for most purposes this would be fast enough.
