Natural Text
I need to parse files and detect empty URLSthese are the scenarios:Both cases, although there are spaces in the second, work the same. What i have done is get all the text in the file into a string variable .i have used  not equal to -1 for the former case above , but in case of varying spaces like in the second, am not sure what i need to do to ensure i catch those scenarios too...Initially i thought of  using index to caputure the index , and then traverse , but it seems like a laborious solution to me....It may seem silly, but am new to python, just started learning since yesterday. Could anyone share some insightthanks a lot in advance,Philip

check the length (or better yet, the ) of :
why don't you strip hrefOr 
You can use . You'd better read the documentation.
