How can i break the Line?If i doand print the returned string i get a lot of withespace. Is there a way to do this? Maybe join the string with single arguments? But this will add a lot more lines of code.
Putting strings together  will join them into one, .  It can be used across lines.
You can split up a string between parentheses and have Python automatically join them at compilation time:The parentheses are not really required if you use  before the end of the line, but with parentheses this is just a little cleaner.
