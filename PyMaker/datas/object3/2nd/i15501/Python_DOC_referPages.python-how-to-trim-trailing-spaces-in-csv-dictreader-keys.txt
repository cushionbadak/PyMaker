I am using python (2.6) csv DictReader. My input file has a header line where the column names have trailing spaces:The returned dict object has key() = Is there an option to trim leading and trailing spaces from the keys?--editThe problem arises in processing by key names:The files are database dumps. And the dump program is way too smart - it adjust the output column width depending on data -- which means different sets of selects are going to have different column width and different key lengths. Sometimes I must use  and sometimes pad or reduce spaces. ouch!
Just read the first line manually and pass it along to the .
You need to register a custom dialect in the csv modulethen use the dialect when creating the DictReader:Here's all the Dialect Options
