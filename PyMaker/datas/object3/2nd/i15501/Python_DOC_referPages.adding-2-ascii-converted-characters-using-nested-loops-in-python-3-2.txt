Natural Text
I'm trying to add together strings where each letter has been converted to ASCII and then added together accordingly. So for example, adding together the strings   I'd like to convert each letter to ascii then add them together like so:In this instance,  must be interchangeable, i.e. user inputted. This is the code I've generated so far:This code doesn't work. It just seems to add the first character of  to every character in , an innumerate amount of times.The count is in there as I'd like the loop to stop after each character in  has been added to the loop of . 
You are looping over all of  for each character in , because you nested the loops.Use the  function instead to pair up letters:where  will stop iterating once the shortest of the two strings is done. Since  has been extended to repeat until it is at least as long as , that means you end up processing all characters of , and no more, unless  was longer to start with.Instead of manually repeating , you can also use  to cycle through all characters in  indefinitely:Demo of the latter approach, with some extra formatting to illustrate what is going on:
