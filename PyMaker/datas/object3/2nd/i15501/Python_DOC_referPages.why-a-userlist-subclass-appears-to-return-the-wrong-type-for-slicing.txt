Let me start by saying I get why subclassing  doesn't work as you might expect (because  is a primitive built-in type and there are issues of performance, etc.). AFAIK collections.UserList is supposed to avoid all these problems and make subclassing UserList work completely as you might expect. For example,returns , butreturns  as expected. However, slicing appears to return the wrong type, even when using  instead of :returns , not  as expected.Two questions:Why is this?What should I do to make slicing return the correct type? The simplest thing I can think of is something like:Â ...but it seems like this kind of boiler-plate code should be unnecessary.
In Python 2, plain slicing (without a stride) would be handled by the  method. The  implementation predates the addition of extended slices (with stride) to the language and never added support for them, see issue 491398.The Python 3 implementation simply took the Python 2 version, moved into  and removed  and  as those are no longer supported in Python 3.As such, the  implementation is still simply:assuming that slicing would be handled elsewhere.In Python 3, all slicing is handled by passing in the  built-in type to ; simply test for that type and wrap the result in a  call:
