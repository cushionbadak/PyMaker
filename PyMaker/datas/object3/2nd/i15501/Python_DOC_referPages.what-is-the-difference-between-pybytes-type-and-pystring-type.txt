It appears that Python 2 has PyString_Type whereas Python 3 has PyBytes_TypeWhat is going on under the hood?I'm writing a C++ wrapper (currently wrapping Python3, but I hope to add Python2 support later), and I just got round to the task of wrapping strings.Is it correct that 2&3 both provide separate support for a byte-string and a Unicode-string, but they have just done some renaming?If this is so then is this table correct?:And if so, how to complete it?EDIT: Python2 doc for String says:These functions have been renamed to PyBytes_ in Python 3.x*. Unless  otherwise noted, the PyBytes functions available in 3.x are aliased to  their PyString_* equivalents to help porting.
In Python 2,  contains bytes (and the type ) and  contains Unicode strings. Therefore 2.x has three types effectively.In Python 3,  contains bytes and  contains Unicode strings. The  type in 3.x is the  type of 2.x. Therefore 3.x has two types effectively. This is the conceptual approach that you should take and any 2.x-related work should also separate Unicode strings and bytes in this way.Based on this section in the documentation that means  is used in both 2.x and 3.x for the Unicode strings.  is used for byte-strings in both and the  type only has meaning in Python 2.x.
