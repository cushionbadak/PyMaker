Natural Text
I'm fairly new to python. I'd like to save the text that is printed by at this script as a variable. (The variable is meant to be written to a file later, if that matters.) How can I do that?
you can store it in variable like this:or you can store it in list for later use:
You can store it in a list:
Both answers already provided are correct, but Python provides a nice alternative. Since iterating through an array and appending to a list is such a common pattern, the list comprehension was created as a one-stop shop for the process.
While NSU's answer and the others are all perfectly good, there may be a simpler way to get what you want.Just as  tests whether a certain file matches a shell-style wildcard,  lists all files matching a shell-style wildcard. In fact:This is done by using the  and  functions in concert…So, you can do this:But notice that in this case, you're going to get full pathnames like  rather than just , which may not be what you want. Often, it's easier to keep the full pathnames around and  them when you want to display them, than to keep just the base names around and  them when you want to open them… but "often" isn't "always".Also notice that I had to manually paste the  and  together into a single string, the way you would at the command line. That's fine here, but if, say, the first one came from a variable, rather than hardcoded into the source, you'd have to use , which isn't quite as nice.By the way, if you're using Python 3.4 or later, you can get the same thing out of the higher-level  library:
Maybe defining an utility function is the right path to follow...I have put the  inside a   clause to catch thepossibility that we cannot list the directory (non-existent, readpermission, etc). The treatment of errors is a bit simplistic, but...the list of matching filenames is built using a so called list comprehension, that is something that you should investigate as soon as possible if you're going to use  for your programs.To close my post, an usage example
