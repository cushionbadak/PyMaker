I want to do a infinite loop function.Here is my codeWhen use  to do this, it's a little slow, so I want to use a thread pool to concurrently execute the function . How to do this ?Just like use  (Apache Bench) to test HTTP server.
You can use threading in Python to implement this.Can be something similar to this (when using two extra threads only):Basically, you start as many threads as you need (make sure you don't get too many, so your system can handle it), then you  them to wait for tasks to complete.Or you can get fancier with multiprocessing Python module.
Try the following code:The main thread stars a service thread that does the request and goes on until it has to, and then it finishes up the service thread.
Maybe you can use the concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor
How about this?To end this thread...
Finally, I've solved this problem. I use a variable to limit the thread number.Here is my final code, solved my problem.Thanks for all replies.
