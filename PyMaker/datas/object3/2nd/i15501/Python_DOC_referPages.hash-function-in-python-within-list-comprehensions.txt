I am trying to understand why the code behaves the way it doesThis outputsI'm wondering why in the second case I get all same hashcodes
If you don't define a  method in your class Python will use the memory address for the hashing.In the second case  isn't needed after the . Python throws it away and reuses the memory for the next  instance, so all subsequent calls get the same hash value.
k carry list of instances pass to class  with value see here, instance pass to class  is same. because  uses same memory references and throws the previous memory reference for the instances.
