Natural Text
I am facing a problem with split characters from text file and find their frequencies. I have write this code but it founds only the words.I want the letters in a A-Z dictionary.
You can use  and  to get your letter count. The use of  will allow you to only count letters, and not punctuation, etc.
If you want to iterate through letters individually, no need for . Strings are directly iterable....Although, this will also count whitespace such as " ". If you want only letters, you might iterate through the words, and then iterate through each character in the word.Incidentally, Python already has a  class, so you don't necessarily need to construct a frequency dict manually.
