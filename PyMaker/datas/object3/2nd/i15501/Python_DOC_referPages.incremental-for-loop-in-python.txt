I have a hard time understanding for loops in Python.I have the following code in Javascript (Modolus 11 test) I want to convert to Python:What would the Python equivalent be ?
Python uses for each loops, so iterating over numbers would require you to produce a sequence of numbers first. Python uses the  type for this:Note that  is assigned  explicitly, separately.Usually however, you'd just loop over objects directly, rather than generate indices:But if you are summing the factors, just use the  function:Note that I avoided using the name  there to avoid masking the built-in function.To multiply bytes from a sequence of bytes, just  the bytes and factors together:which can be collapsed with  and a generator expression:This only works if  is a  object, not a Unicode  string object;  objects are really sequences of integers in the range 0-255.If you wanted to interpret the characters as digits, use a Unicode string and use  to convert each to an integer:Demo of the latter with the sample input you provided:Note that the  test already produces a boolean; there is no need to use a conditional expression in Python to produce a boolean result.

read about documentation of for in python:Note: indexing start from 0 and end one lessdemo:I think this is what you want:
In Python there is no "traditional" for-loop, but there are many constructs which make loops in Python very powerful:This prints integers from 0 to 9, range creates an iterator with the interval [low, high)Prints 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 because the steps (third optional parameter are set to 2).Also you can enumerate through your factors:This gets you a key and the corresponding value of each element in factors.If you do not need keys, than this simply does the job for you:This iterates over every element in factors.If you need a special condition to be checked, you can use break or continue:
Python doesn't strictly have C/Javascript style for loops but prefers a simpler syntax.The C/JS style for has:an initializer a conditional test, an iterator, and a task to repeat A pythonic for loop has only a variable and a list or iterable and a task, and looks like this:where range(length) is a built-in function that expands to [0,1,2,3,.., length-1]and the task consists of the indented block after the colonIn JS strings and numeric types are automatically converted (even when you dont want it), but in Python that is not true.   converts to integer and  converts to floating point number.
