The beginning of my code is:But my error is:I tried changing my .py name and my my database name but nothing is working. Please help if you can. 
 does not exist.  The function you are looking for is called :Also, you should never use  or similar tools to insert values into a query.  From the docs:Usually your SQL operations will need to use values from Python  variables. You shouldn’t assemble your query using Python’s string  operations because doing so is insecure; it makes your program  vulnerable to an SQL injection attack (see http://xkcd.com/327/ for  humorous example of what can go wrong).Instead, use the DB-API's parameter substitution. Put  as a  placeholder wherever you want to use a value, and then provide a tuple  of values as the second argument to the cursor's  method.  (Other database modules may use a different placeholder, such as  or  .)
sqlite3 module does not have attribute named "connection" it does however have an attribute named connect. You should try 'connection = sqlite3.connect('practice1.db')'
I see a couple of possible mistakes:From the file path, I guess that you are on window. Well, you need to change the file path:  to avoid to be confused as an escaped character.On my IDE, the  module does not have the method .. maybe ?
