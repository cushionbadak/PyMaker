Natural Text
I am very new to Python and I would like to know how I would clear a text that has been printed and add another piece of text. For example, I would like to display "Hello" then program with a delay of 10 seconds to replace text with another text "Goodbye". I am using Python 3.3 on Windows 7.
version 2, using some 'visual' effects :D
Once text is sent to stdout, there really isn't a good way to change it. What you probably want to do would require a UI library such as tkinter (which comes with Python) or wxPython. Then you can create a Window with a label widget that can change every few seconds. You might be able to use Python's curses library too, but I have yet to see a coherent tutorial on how you would use that for this sort of thing.
Python's output is based on an abstraction of "output is just a file that you can write to", so there's no way to do this cross-platform.However, if you want it to work in a Windows  console (aka "DOS prompt"), and don't care about working inside IDLE, on Unix, over a network, etc., you can use the MSVCRT console I/O APIs.Unfortunately, the limited set of console I/O APIs built into the standard library doesn't include the clear function. But you can look for third-party extended console I/O libraries on PyPI, or use PyWin32 to call the MSVCRT functions directly.Or you can use a cheap hack:This just calls the  function, which does everything for you.
