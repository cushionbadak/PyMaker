I want to change the position of date. Because my excel can't detect this is a date. Before my string is day/month/year. So I want to make it like this month/day/year. Is there a way to move the position of the string with python?
I assume, that you have already extracted the string from excel. You may use datetime.strptime with subsequent strftime. format descriptions are here
Use datetime module
