Python supports zipping files when zlib is available, see:https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/zipfile.htmlThe  command-line program on Linux supports  fastest,  best.Is there a way to set the compression level of a zip file created in Python's  module?
Starting from python 3.7 zipfile added the compresslevel parameter. (https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html)I know this question is dated, but for people like me, that fall in this question, it may be a better option than the accepted one.
The  module does not provide this. During compression it uses constant from  - . By default it equals -1. So you can try to change this constant manually, as possible solution.
