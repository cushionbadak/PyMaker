Does Python 3 (standard implementation) guarantee that the following code always produce the string ?If yes, where does this feature (order-keeping) documented?If no, what function can be used to get an order-keeping join?
 joins strings in the order the sequence you passed in lists the strings.Since you are passing in a list literal and lists have a fixed order, your sample will always produce the string output in the same order, yes.Rule of thumb: if the order would be handled any differently, the  documentation would have mentioned this explicitly. Not concatenating strings in the order the iterable provides them would be... very surprising, not to mention not very useful.
