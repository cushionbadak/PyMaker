Given the following list of tuples:How would I flatten it into a list?Is there a one-liner to do the above?Similar: Flatten list of Tuples in Python
You could use a list comprehension: is also used a lot in cases like this:That's not exactly a one-liner though.


you can use  which adds up all of the elements if it's a list of list (singly-nested). or convert to list:Adding up lists works in python.Note: This is inefficient and some say unreadable.
Not in one line but in two:Declare a list object and use extend.
