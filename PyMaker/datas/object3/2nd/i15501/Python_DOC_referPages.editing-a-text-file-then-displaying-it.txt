Natural Text
In my code, I want to insert words into a text file from a user. So I have these words in the text file that must be replaced by the user input, here are the strings must be replaced in the file ,  adjective,plural_noun,noun.
A little something to get you started...If Sample.txt contains  and the user input is , this code prints:Let's step through it bit by bit: opens the file for reading ( means "for reading"). reads the content of the file and puts it in the variable . looks for occurrences of the string  and continues with the indented commands as long as it finds one., which only runs if there is a remaining occurrence of , gets user input and puts it in the variable ., which also only runs if there is a remaining occurrence of , replaces the next occurrence of  with the user input, overwriting the old text., which runs once all occurrences of  have been replaced with user input, prints out the new text.This is not how you would write an efficient programme with lots of different  strings, but hopefully it will lead you in the right direction and walking before running is often a good idea.There is excellent online Python documentation and you can also use the pydoc tool -- e.g.  from the command line.
