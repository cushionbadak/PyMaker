I'm working on simple graphic interfaces in Python. I`m using the tkinter library to practice with.The form generated is quite simple, it just consist of two inputs and a button that calls the function: my_function.I have troubles calling that function because the attribute "command" does not allows any parameter, but my_function requires two that are given by the inputs of the form.Then, the idea is calling several functions inside my_function and return in a label a calculated_property.Can you give me any solution?Thank U so much!
You can simply use a lambda function to pass the arguments:This code is equivalent to doing:except that the function is created inline.
