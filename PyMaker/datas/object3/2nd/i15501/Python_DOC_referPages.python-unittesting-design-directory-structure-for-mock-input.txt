I am writing production code that parses a large file, which itself contains many different cases. To unittest the production code, I want to write a test case for each case. My question case is what a good way is to set up the testing directory and the testing code. The current directory structure is:The testing code looks like this:Is there a more Pythonic way to factor the directory  out, so that the test case is cleaner and one only has to write ? 
If you want to avoid writing the whole path in your test methods, which is understandable, you could isolate this in a separate method which doesn't begin with  and therefore won't be called when executing the tests:The main idea here is separation of concerns. One specific method to take care of the "putting dirs and filenames into a correct path" labour, another one to do the parsing and the test methods to do the actual tests (and only that).Note that as suggested, you should use  (documentation) instead of hardcoding the slashes .Also, according to PEP8, class names should be , not  or .
