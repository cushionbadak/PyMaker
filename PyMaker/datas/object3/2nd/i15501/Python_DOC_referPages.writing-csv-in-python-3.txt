Apparently,  in Python 3 doesn't support binary output streams. This isn't mentioned in the documentation, and worse, it's backwards from the Python 2 recommendation of always opening the underlying files with . Luckily for you, the fix is easy: just open the file in text mode instead of binary. The docs also recommend that you specify  when opening the file, so you might as well do that too.
