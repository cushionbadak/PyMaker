The function definition below comes from the itertools recipes page (https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html#recipes):The function signature would seem to be more readable written with the "repeat" argument specified explicitly, e.g.But I'm guessing there is a reason why it is written using the general idiom. Can anyone explain?
Because you can't have keyword arguments after  in Python 2.x, it's a :The only option is therefore to use  and extract , if present, from the resulting dictionary.By contrast, in the 3.x documentation,  is implemented as you suggest, as that syntax is valid in Python 3:
The original code was probably copied from a library function  and kept this way to look similar to the  function. Plus  isn't valid in Python 2.x (kudos go to jonrsharpe for pointing this out).Other than that, I don't see a reason to use  here. If this was a library function that changed over time, it might be there so old arguments would be still supported but even then, I'd prefer  to document which arguments are still supported and which are ignored.To support my point, the next example reads .
