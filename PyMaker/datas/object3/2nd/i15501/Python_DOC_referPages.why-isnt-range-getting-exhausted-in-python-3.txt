If I do the following:Python's generators, after raising , normally stops looping.  How then is range producing this pattern - it restarts after every iteration.
As has been stated by others,  is not a generator, but sequence type (like list) that makes it an  which is NOT the same as an .The differences between ,  and  are subtle (at least for someone new to python).An  provides a  method and can be exhausted, thus raising .An  is a object that provides an  over its content. Whenever its  method is called it returns a NEW iterator object, thus you can (indirectly) iterate over it multiple times.A  is a function that returns an , which of cause can be exhausted.Also good to know is, that the  loop automaticly queries the  of any . Which is why you can write  instead of  or .All of that IS in the documentation, but IMHO somewhat difficult to find. The best starting point is probably the Glossary.
 is a kind of immutable sequence type. Iterating it does not exhaust it.
 is not a generator, it's a sequence type, like strings or lists.So is no different than
