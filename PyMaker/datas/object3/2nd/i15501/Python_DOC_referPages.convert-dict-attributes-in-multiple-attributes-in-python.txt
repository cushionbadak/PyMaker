I have a class with a dict attribute, like this :When I want to get the values, I have to do this :What is the solution to get the values directly in attributes please :
You could add an additional function to the class that will be able to parse the dict and insert the relevant attributes:I'm using the built-in  function here to set attributes with dynamic names/values:This is the counterpart of . The arguments are an object, a string and an arbitrary value. The string may name an existing attribute or a new attribute. The function assigns the value to the attribute, provided the object allows it.For example,  is equivalent to .You can call this function inside your constructor after the  variable is defined or even just place the loop in the constructor. 
Using , you can set attribute dynamically:
Another solution is to implement :
You can directly update the  attribute of your object I believe:
Another way would be to override  and  together, which avoids having two object references to the same attribute in the class instance object (one O.R. to  inside , and another O.R. to  in ):Note that doing it this way means you cannot add more key,value pairs to  unless you call the property directly, e.g.:Also note that getting and deleting the  members will be overridden by any existing attribute of the same name (not only that, but you can't delete  members at all unless you also override  to enable this behavior): If you want to change this behavior, you have to override  (EDIT: which, as  bruno desthuilliers notes below, is usually not a good idea).
