I have two questions on exception handling.Q1) I am slightly unsure as to when exactly the operations within  will be carried out in exception handling. I am unsure when the  block would be executed, which doesn't occur in the code below:Q2) When I run the code below:I am unclear as to why the output is:
When Python encounters a return-statement inside a function, it immediately returns (exits) from the function.  This means that when you do: will never be printed because you returned in the  block, thereby skipping the execution of the  block.Your second code piece is different however because you used a  block.  Code inside a  block is always executed, no matter if an exception is raised, you return from a function, etc.  This is to ensure that any cleanup code which is important (i.e. frees resources) is always executed and not accidentally skipped.You can read about this behavior in the docs both here:When  passes control out of a  statement with a   clause, that  clause is executed before really leaving the  function.as well as here:When a ,  or  statement is executed in the   suite of a  statement, the  clause is also  executed "on the way out."As for why the output is:and not:the answer is that the  line is executed in the  block before Python is able to print  (the return value of ). Put simply, the execution path for Python is:Return .Run the  block.Resume normal execution with the  line and print .
In the first case, you return within , so you never hit the  statement.In the second one, the  is executed regardless of how  is exited.  From the python docs:A finally clause is always executed before leaving the try statement, whether an exception has occurred or not. (...) The finally clause is also executed “on the way out” when any other clause of the try statement is left via a break, continue or return statement.Here is a good example of the order of execution:Be sure to read the docs on exceptions!
