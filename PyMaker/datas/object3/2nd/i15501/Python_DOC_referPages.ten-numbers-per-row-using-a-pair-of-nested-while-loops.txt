I was trying to do an exercise, but have a hard time doing it. I need to write a program containing a pair of nested while loops that displays the integer values 1-100, ten per row. I'm not sure how I should use while loops in such a task, I was trying something like this, but it seems like it only gives me first line to 10 and then all other numbers in second line:Any advice?
Hope This will helpanother solution with nested while loop:
Seems like I did the job right, thanks guys for helping me out.
