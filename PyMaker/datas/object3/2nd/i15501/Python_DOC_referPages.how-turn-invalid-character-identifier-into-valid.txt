Natural Text
I'm trying do the follow sentence:but I'm getting the follow error:Ok, I know that is an invalid sentence in Python, but I'm looking for a solution that allows me to use this syntax.My target is create a script to run Propositional Logic Easily, and if I can do it, I'm be able to do some things with sugar syntax like as below:
Short of rewriting the parser (which isn't a good idea), this is impossible in Python.  Variable names may only contain letters, digits, and/or underscores.  Additionally, the first character must be either a letter or an underscore.  Also, a variable name cannot be the same as a keyword such as  or . Other than that, there can be no other characters in the name.  You likewise cannot make your own keywords or operator symbols (although you can overload most of the existing operators on a custom class to do whatever you want.  Here is a reference: operator overloading in python).For more information, here is a link to Python's grammar specification and one which defines identifiers and keywords in Python.Also, just for the record, you could use  instead of making your own function to invert booleans.
Thanks a lot for the help, the @iCodez has answered perfectly to python context, but in true I am opened to use others languages who can do it, and I found it on Ruby, below the ruby code that runs what I want:and the output:thanks again for help! And thanks too to the programmers thread that help-me to find other languages.
