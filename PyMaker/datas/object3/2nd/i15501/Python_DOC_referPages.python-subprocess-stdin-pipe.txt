Note that if you want to send data to the processâ€™s stdin, you need to  create the Popen object with stdin=PIPE. Similarly, to get anything  other than None in the result tuple, you need to give stdout=PIPE  and/or stderr=PIPE too.i.e., to pass input to the subprocess, specify  parameter; to get a non-  value, you must specify .In many case password prompt and password itself are not written to/read from a pipe but directly to/from terminal i.e., you might need a pseudo-tty to pass the password unless the command allows to set an option to accept password via stdin. You could use  to interact with a child process using . See the first reason in  Why not just use a pipe (popen())?
