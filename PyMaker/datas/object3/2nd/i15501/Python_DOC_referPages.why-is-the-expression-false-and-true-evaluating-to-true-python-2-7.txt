I have two boolean variables in my program called after and late. Just to make sure each variable got the right value, I tested each one with the following command:The program printsas expected. However, when I run the following code:the program printswhich means that the expression after and late is evaluating to true. Why is this evaluating to true even though true and false should yield false?
Boolean values have a capital letter in the beginning. I guess you use strings. You could check that with .You don't need to divide all the cases manually to "debug" your program. That's not the way Python was intended for...Just  the evaluated code , use  like me above or use your interactive python console to play around.
