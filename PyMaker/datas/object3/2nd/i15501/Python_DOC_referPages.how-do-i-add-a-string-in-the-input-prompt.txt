I want to make the input prompt say people's name while asking income, for example:If I type  when , I want the next question to ask .How do I do that?

Edit:Actually, it would probably be better to do this instead:By using a conditional expression and , we ensure that we do not accidentally add a  on the end of a name that already ends in .You can just insert the name into the prompt string with :Also, there is no reason to do  since  always returns a string object.Finally, you should use a  with  instead of :Otherwise, the output will be , which isn't very readable.
Alternative way:
