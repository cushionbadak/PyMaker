I have a simple multi-line string:How do I add a variable inside the  so that it will be part of the HTML? Or is how I did the code right?
Concatenating large strings with  is kind of ugly in my opinion.  You should only use  when you have a few small strings to concatenate.A cleaner approach would be to use  to insert the value into the string:Note too that your posted code is actually invalid since assignment is a statement in Python.  Meaning, you cannot perform an assignment in the middle of a line.
