Each traceback item has a format like:I'm interested in changing the filename field (to something custom) for certain modules. Is this possible? I've tried modifying the  member of the module object, but that doesn't seem to be used when python generates the traceback stack.
You can use the  module to get the filepath of many modules.  e.g. Knowing that the traceback comes from traceback.print_stack(), we can then look to the definition of :With "where is it defined?" out of the way, I'll save you the trouble of following the function calls around and suggest looking at format_exception and the relevant examples.  Without knowing specifically what you want to do with the traceback, I'd suggest looking at the jinja2 source as it does quite a bit of traceback mangling.
