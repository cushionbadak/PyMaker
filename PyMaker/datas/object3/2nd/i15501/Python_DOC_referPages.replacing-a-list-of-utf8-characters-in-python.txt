Natural Text
I have a list of Farsi characters (utf8) like this:And I would like to replace every occurrence of characters in this list in a text with another character like 'a'. Right now my code is like this:Is there any way to do this in one shot, for example using Regex and lists in Python 3?

You could use a for loop instead:This way your list could be an arbitrary length but the size of your code wont change. Plus you aren't repeating code.
