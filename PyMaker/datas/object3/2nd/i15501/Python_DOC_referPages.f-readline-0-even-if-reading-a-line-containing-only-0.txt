Natural Text
I do not have trouble setting variables in the program with the  function, but I am having trouble with the  statement when it comes to reading out of a text file. I am trying to see if a 0 is in a text file and every time I use the  it acts as if it does not equal 0.Example of my script below:My code would come out as Why is this? And how can I use an  statement with the  function?
The  method does not remove trailing newlines from lines.  You need to do this manually:Otherwise,  will be equal to , which is not equal to .Also, you forgot to close the file by calling the  method:Of course, using a with-statement would be better: will automatically close the file when control leaves its code block.
