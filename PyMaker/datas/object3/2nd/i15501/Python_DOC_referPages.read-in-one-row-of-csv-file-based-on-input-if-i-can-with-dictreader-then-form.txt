Natural Text
I'm trying to read in a csv file with many rows and columns; i would like to print one row, in a particular format, to a text file, and do some hashing on the values. SO far, i have been able to read in the file, parse thru it using DictReader, find the row i want using an IF statement and then print the keys and values. I cannot figure out how to format it to the format i want in the end ( Key = Value \n), and i cannot figure how to write to a file (much less in the format i want) using the value of 'row' obtained below. I've been trying for days and make a little progress but cannot get it to work. Here is what i got to work (with much detail left out of results):result-output{'Full_Name': 'Jack Flash', 'PHONE_NO': '555 555-1212', 'ALIAS': 'Y4K'}I'd like to ask the user to input the Alias and then use that to determine row to print. I've done a ton of research but am new-ish to Python so am asking for help! i've used pyexcel, xlrd/xlwt, even thought I'd try pandas but too much to learn. I also got it to format the way i wanted in one test but then could not get the row selection to work--in other words, it prints all the records rather than the row i want. Have 30 Firefox tabs open trying to find an answer! Thanks in advance!
The following may at least be close to what you want (I think):This would write 3 lines formatted like this into the output file for every matching:BTW, the notation means basically "take all the entries in the specified dictionary and turn them into keyword arguments for this function call". The  syntax in the format string refers to any keyword arguments that will be passed to the  method.
