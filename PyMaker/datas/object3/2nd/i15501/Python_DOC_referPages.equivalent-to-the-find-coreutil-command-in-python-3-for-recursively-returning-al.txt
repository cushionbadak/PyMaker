What is best alternative to find in python (3) for recursively returning all files and folders in a directory structure?I want something similar to:I rewrote a tip from another question and got something that kind of works, but it has some problems:This will not work if there are any files in "~/x/y/" which could happen I'm also not sure it's a robust or idiomatic way to do this.So what's the best way to copy the above find command in Python?
You can use :To get directory, file name list:To write the file list to text file: is used to replace  with home directory path.Alternative using  which available since Python 3.4:
Kinda like os.dirwalk, but with new pathlib constructs:This one also chops off the root, so it's like like GNU find's version:
As much as I like globs, since your question specifically says python 3, I'm more than happy to recommend using  +  to simplify the approach.
