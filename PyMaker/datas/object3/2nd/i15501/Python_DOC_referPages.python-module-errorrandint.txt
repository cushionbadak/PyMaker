This is the code I've used to import the Random module. When I run the code, it instead imports a file of mine for testing code called random.py.This was leading to all sorts of errors, so I 'permanently' deleted it in the Recycle Bin and all it's shortcuts I could find.Yet it still is there somewhere and it causes errors.My entire program depends onThe game I'm making depends in randint to randomly create ships and submarines.I am running Windows 7.Thanks
Python creates a bytecode cache for each python module you import; for Python 2 the same name as the original file with the extension  is used. It is that file that is imported when you import , even if the source  file was deleted.Use:to  locate the stale  bytecode file and delete it.In Python 3 these files are normally stored in a subdirectory called  but these are ignored if there is no corresponding  source file. People that want to distribute just the bytecode files (to obfuscate their code in commercial software distributions, for eample) they'll have to use the  script with the  switch, something you almost certainly did not do.
There will also be a  file, either in the same folder (for Python 2.x) or a subdirectory called  (for 3.x).
