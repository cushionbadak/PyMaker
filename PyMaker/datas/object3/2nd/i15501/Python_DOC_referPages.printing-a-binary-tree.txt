I just started working with classes in Python and I am at a roadblock trying to print a binary tree that I created. Here is the code I have:The first part represents the root of the tree and the add_node function adds a node in the tree. I created a new instance for the root of the tree:Tree = Node(6)The problem that I am facing is printing the tree. If I just say , I get this:Somebody told me that I have to create a function to actually print the tree and this function looks like the function that's creating a new node but so far I wasn't able to do that. Any help please?!
You can add the  method to determine how your node object reacts when used as a string, i.e.  . This is useful if you want to give out a string representations in print statements etc. without calling methods directly.Edit:While  returns bytes,  returns characters.  is actually supposed to replace  , so it's actually recommended to use  instead (in Python 2.x there's both for compatibility reasons).A 3rd way to represent your object is  which is used for less formal string representations but rather for debugging etc. The returned string should look like a valid Python expression that could be used to recreate an object with the same value. For more information have a look at the language reference.
Yes you need to add a function to create a function to  the value at the node. The function can be as simple asAnd you can now print using
