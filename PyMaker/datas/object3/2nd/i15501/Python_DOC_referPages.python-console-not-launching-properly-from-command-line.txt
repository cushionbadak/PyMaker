I seem to have problem launching python from command line. I tried various things with no success.Problem: When trying to run  from the command line, there is no response i.e. I do not get message about 'command not found' and console does not launch. Only option to open python console is to run  directly. Running using  command does not work even when in the python directory but  launches. Issue with the launching this way is that python console is launched in new window. This whole problem is present only on one machine while on my other machine I am able to run python correctly and console launches in the command prompt window from which the  command was executed. PATH is correctly set to and  correctly returns . I verified that running other commands imported through PATH (such as ) run correctly.Things I tried:Completely re-installing python both with x86 and x64 python installations with no success.Copy installation from my second machine and manually set the path variables - again no success.Can anyone hint how to resolve this behavior?(Additional info: Win 8.1 x64, python 3.4.2)
Issue resolved. Since no feasible solution was found in 2 days, I decided to wipe all keys containing 'python' from registry as well as some files that were not parts of other programs. This resolved the issue after re-installing python.If anyone finds the true cause of this misbehavior and other - less brutal - solution, please write it here for future reference.
Recent Python installer has option to add PATH.If you didn't use it, you can register directory where python.exe is to PATH environment variable.But I prefer  launcher. It may be installed via Python 3.3 or 3.4.With it, you can start Python via  or .See https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#python-launcher-for-windows
