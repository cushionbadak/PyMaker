Well, I placed a breakpoint at .When I stop at the breakpoint, I want to evaluate .The error is:Well, this is a mystery to me. Because I have the getter method and outside the class it works perfectly.Well, you may tell me that I could easily take no notice of it as it works outside the class. But I need it during the debugging. Could you comment on why I can't catch the value at the breakpoint?
When you prefix an attribute name with a double underscore, Python "mangles" the name by placing  before it.  This means that you would need to do:in order to access the  attribute.But it doesn't look like you should be using the  in the first place.

I would remove it.  You generally want to avoid getters and setters in Python since 99% of the time they do nothing but clutter the class definition.
