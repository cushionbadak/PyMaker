i have the below python code, no data is received and the program quits without running the except clause with print and return statementsany ideas on what is happening?
The problem is that a  exception is a completely different exception from a . So,  doesn't catch a  for the same reason  doesn't catch a .(The documentation for this isn't exactly obvious in 2.x. This is one of the many things that was cleaned up in Python 3.3/PEP 3151—see the nice new docs—but as long as you're sticking with 2.x you don't benefit from that.)The right solution is to handle the right error:If you also want to handle socket errors (like, say, a failure from the  call) the same way:Notice I also added in the  and added it to the output. That way, if something unexpected goes wrong, you'll know what went wrong, instead of having to guess.Of course, you may want to handle the two errors differently, as well:
I just changed the except line
