I'm trying to have a parameter that changes based on the current time in terms of the model.I set up a function:I want to have Iapp vary over time. Namely, I need it to be -0.7 from time 50 to time 500.My current efforts that have produced literally no change in my plots:Any ideas?
Your code will set  to  450 times, then set it to . This is why you don't see any change. What you need is an if statement:Or, if you want a one-liner:
Another approach is to define the time varying parameter outside the ODE. This allows you to change the parameters without modifying the ODE function. One way to do this is to pass the forcing parameter as an array the same length as the time array. Assuming t0=0, Change your call to:Example usage with scipy's .
