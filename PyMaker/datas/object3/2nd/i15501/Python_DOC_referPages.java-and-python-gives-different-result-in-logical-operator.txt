I am trying to get broadcast ip address coding in Java and Python for practice. Here is my code in java which gives me correct output:Here  is the number representing IP address,  - number representing its mask. Here I got expected broadcast address.By in python using the same logic I got unexpected results:Here all components represent the same entries as in java. After debugging I got that number  is negative. In documents operator  gives inversion in bits but I don't understand why this number is negative in Python and not in Java?
Python integers are not bounded and are not signed, so  creates a negative number:However,  in Java would give you the two's complement, while the operation on the subnet mask requires a one's complement, which can be achieved by using  on the netmask. Since that'd undo the other  operation you already applied, you don't need to use the 1's complement here at all:I suspect that you could just use  here:
