I have created a program that uses recursion to solve simple mazes. In the event of a rather complex maze, I get a maximum recursion depth error. I have searched that error on this website and read threads, so I believe I have a general understanding of what is occurring.Unlike the other threads I saw, I am not trying to increase the recursion limit. sys.setrecursionlimit() is not what I am looking for. I would like to be able handle the overflow, and instead of crashing have the program print a message () and close. I am aware of using try and except to handle errors, but I'm not sure if I can incorporate that to handle a maximum recursion depth error.
A maximum recursion depth error is just another exception; you can catch the  exception (Python 3.5 or later):I've incorporated the error message attached to the runtime exception; for a recursion error that's .If you need to support Python versions earlier than 3.5, you can catch the base class, . If you are worried about catching runtime errors that are not recursion depth errors, you could introspect the  value:Demo of the options:Altering a dictionary size also raises a  exception, but testing the resulting exception message allows you to differentiate.
