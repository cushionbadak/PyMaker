I'm facing a problem in my python program, I have two optional arguments, the problem is that there must be at least one of these two arguments that must be used but the two arguments can't be passed together, is there a way of doing this with argparse ?Here is the code I'm currently using:Here are some examples of how I would like it to work: => OK => OK => Not OK
I would suggest, you refactor the arguments and combine -o and -i into one mandatory argument. Then you define o and i (or whatever is appropriate) as allowed values using the choices argument of .E.g:Now the user has to specify one of the two, but can't specify both at the same time.
A  will give you the required, but not both action.But first, you don't want .   is a function that converts its input to  or , but does not convert the string 'False' to boolean .   I'd suggest using the  instead.It raises an error is neither of  or  is used, or if both.  It sets the appropriate attribute to  if one or the other is used.  Note that the usage line indicates this 'exclusive or' logic with .
