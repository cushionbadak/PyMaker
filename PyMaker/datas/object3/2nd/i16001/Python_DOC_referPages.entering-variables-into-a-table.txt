So, when I chose to enter certain data into a table, instead of entering the values that the variables represent, it enters the actual name of the variable, here's an example.When I check the database files, instead of having the information that the variable represents, it instead enters the variable name. I guess there is some kind of syntax to put around the variable name?
The string is passed literally to the database driver which has no idea there is a variable of that name in you Python code.The seemingly straight forward solution to this problem is to use string formatting to substitute the representation of your variables into the SQL query before sending it to the database.However, please don't do that.  It makes your code vulnerable to SQL injection if one of the variables expands to some unexpected value.  For example consider what would happen if  was the string .Instead, you should use prepared statements:Here, the database driver will receive the unmodified string followed by the serialized tuple of arguments.  This is not only faster but also secure against SQL injection.From the Python documentation:Usually your SQL operations will need to use values from Python variables.  You shouldn't assemble your query using Python's string operations because doing so is insecure; it makes your program vulnerable to an SQL injection attack (see http://xkcd.com/327/ for humorous example of what can go wrong).Instead, use the DB-API's parameter substitution.  Put  as a placeholder wherever you want to use a value, and then provide a tuple of values as the second argument to the cursor's  method.
