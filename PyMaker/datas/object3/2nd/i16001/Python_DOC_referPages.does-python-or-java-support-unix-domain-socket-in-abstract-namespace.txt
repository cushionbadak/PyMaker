Like thisabstract: an abstract socket address is distinguished by the fact            that sun_path[0] is a null byte ('\0').  The socket's address in            this namespace is given by the additional bytes in sun_path that            are covered by the specified length of the address structure.            (Null bytes in the name have no special significance.)  The name            has no connection with filesystem pathnames.  When the address of            an abstract socket is returned by getsockname(2), getpeername(2),            and accept(2), the returned addrlen is greater than            sizeof(sa_family_t) (i.e., greater than 2), and the name of the            socket is contained in the first (addrlen - sizeof(sa_family_t))            bytes of sun_path.  The abstract socket namespace is a nonportable            Linux extension.I want to connect the socket which has been create in abstract namespace(@xxx or \0xxx).
Support for "Linux abstract socket namespace" has been in Python since version 2.5 2006.That's according to the source and changelog.Misc/HISTORY (note: big file)Patch #1062014: AF_UNIX sockets under Linux have a special   abstract namespace that is now fully supported.It's not mentioned in the Python2 docs but is explicitly mentioned in the latestPython 3 socket docsHave you tried it under Python2?As for Java, it doesn't even support AF_UNIX sockets directly; it requires JNI.There are many implementations (search around) but you will almost certainly need to do some C development to get Linux abstract namespace support.You might try Jtux  It's a complete UNIX api library for Java and of course includes AF_UNIX sockets.
