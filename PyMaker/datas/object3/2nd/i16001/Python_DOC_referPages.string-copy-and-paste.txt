Natural Text
I have a string like this  and I have to copy the part after the second colon and paste it at the end of it,  can someone help me?
Try like this  
You can use string built in  function to do this.

This will produce output as required'1:sometext:othertext'  -->  othertext'1:sometext:othertext:abc:jkl'  -->  othertext abc jkl
