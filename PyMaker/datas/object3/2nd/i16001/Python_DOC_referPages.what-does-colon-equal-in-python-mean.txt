What does the  operand mean, more specifically for Python?Can someone explain how to read this snippet of code?
What you have found is pseudocodehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PseudocodePseudocode is an informal high-level description of the operating  principle of a computer program or other algorithm.the  operator is actually the assignment operator. In python this is simply the  operator. To translate this pseudocode into Python you would need to know the data structures being referenced, and a bit more of the algorithm implementation.  Some notes about psuedocode  is the assignment operator or  in python is the equality operator or  in python Note that there are certain styles of pseudocode and your mileage may vary:Pascal Style PseudoCodeC-Style PseudocodeNote the differences in brace usage and assignment operator. 
PEP572 proposed support for the  operator in Python to allow variable assignments within expressions.This syntax will be available in Python 3.8.
The code in the question is pseudo-code; there,  represents assignment.For future visitors, though, the following might be more relevant: the next version of Python (3.8) will gain a new operator, , allowing assignment expressions (details, motivating examples, and discussion can be found in PEP 572, which was provisionally accepted in late June 2018).With this new operator, you can write things like these:instead of these:
