I am following the Pandas tutorialsThe tutorials are written using python 2.7 and I am doing them in python 3.4Here is my version details.I create the zip as per  the tutorialBut after creation the first error shows that I cannot see the contents of the zip.Then when I go to create the dataframe I get this iterator error.Is  this a python 3 gotcha where I need to do it differently? Or other?
You need to change this line: to:This is because  now returns an iterator in python 3, hence your error message. For more details see: http://www.diveintopython3.net/porting-code-to-python-3-with-2to3.html#zip and https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip
