I am just trying to fetch data from a live web by using the urllib module, so I wrote a simple exampleHere is my code: But I got error like: 
You are reading the wrong documentation or the wrong Python interpreter version. You tried to use the Python 3 library in Python 2.Use:The Python 2  library was replaced by  in Python 3.

This is what i use to get data from urls, its nice because you could save the file at the same time if you need it:output:Edit: urlretrieve works in python 2 and 3
In Python3 you can use urllib or urllib3urllib:urllib3:More details could be found in the urllib or python documentation. 
make sure you import requests from urllib, then try this format, it worked for me:make sure you import all the required librariesfrom urllib import requesturllib.request.urlopen( )
