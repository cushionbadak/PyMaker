Natural Text
I'm trying to load the columns of a file with a strange encoding. Windows appears to have no issues opening it, but Linux complains and I have only been able to open it using the Atom text editor (others give me either a blank file or a file with data encoded)The command:returns:Opening the file in binary mode and reading the first 400 bytes gives:The rest of the file consists only of ASCII numbers separated by semicolons.I tried the following ways to load the file: Sort of works but skips the first several hundred lines. Failed with every encoding I tried with the error: Complains about  and shows for each line something similar to .How can I load this data file?
You have a codepage 1252 encoded text file, with one line containing NULL bytes. The  command determined you have binary data on the basis of those NULLs, while I made an educated guess on the basis of the  and  codepoints, which stand for the  and  characters.To open, just decode from that encoding:The first 10 lines are then:The NULLs were stripped from the Data measured with spectrometer name: 0905077U1 line; the spetrometer name is now 9 bytes long, together with the 55 NULLs it looks like the name could be up to 64 characters long and the file writer didn't bother to strip those NULLs.
Guessing an encoding can be really hard, luckily there's a library that tries to help with that: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/chardet
