I am trying to interface with some existing code that saves a configuration, and expects a file path that is of type 'path.path'.  The code is expecting that the file path is returned from a pygtk browser window (via another function).  I want to call the save_config function elsewhere in my code with a file path based on different inputs, constructed from string elements.When I try to run the code, I am able to construct the file path correctly, but it is a string type, and the save function expects a 'path.path' type.Is there a way to convert a string to a path type?  I've tried searching, but could only find the reverse case (path to string).  I also tried using , but that returns a string as well.edit: This is python 2.7, if that makes a difference.

If  represents a type, you can probably create an instance of that type with something like:
