Natural Text
I'm creating a program where an input object is checked to see if it is present in a list.  If it is then it gets the position number and then uses that to determine the response from another list.Is it possible to have variables in a list like so:So that one very long list isn't needed (it also makes it easier to find term values)If you are aware with arrays in Small Basic, you'll know what I mean.

In addition to dawg's answer, if you really want a python list, you should do it as such:Then, you can use it:You could also build  this way, but it is less "pythonic":Also remember that python indexing is  based!
