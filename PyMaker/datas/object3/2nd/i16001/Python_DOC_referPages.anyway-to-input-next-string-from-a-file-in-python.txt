Ok I'm new to python and Im trying to input a file and my question is that is there only the .read() function to read in a file? Or is there anyway you can take in the next string up to the next whitespace? Would the best way be to read in the line with .readline() then split the line? Any help is welcomeThis is an example of the program, the question is where the infile.read(1) is. Right now that only takes in the next character I was wondering if there was anyway to get the next set of characters until the next whitespace.
There is no built-in method on file objects to read up to the next whitespace, or up to a certain character.Reading a character at a time does of course work, and if you've opened the file with the default settings it will be buffered reasonably (either in C's stdio for Python 2.x, or in Python's  module for 3.1+)â€¦ but it still may be pretty slow just because of all that looping.You can definitely use  and then , as you suggest. That just means you need somewhere to store the other words on the line between reads. The cleanest way to do that is probably with a wrapper around the file. For example:Or, in Python 3.2 and earlier:Then you can do this:In particular, your whole code could be written as:If you actually want to wrap this in a complete file-like object with an extra method instead of just a generator of words:In 3.1+, you can look at how  works and add a  method that interacts with its buffering the same way  does, which is pretty simple.But in 2.x that isn't possible. Unless you want to  the file descriptor and create an  object out of it instead of a traditional file object, the best option is to create a custom  subclass that delegates to a real file object, which is a lot more work.Fortunately, most apps aren't going to need a complete file-like object, so this isn't a big deal.
