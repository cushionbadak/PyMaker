This is a bug in SymPy. See https://stackoverflow.com/a/22574099/161801 and https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/7322.
The limitation of floating point numbers is that they are only accurate to a certain about of decimal places. I was curious about your question myself and found https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html
Use a symbol instead of the number (and substitute it in at the end if necessary):
