Natural Text
I've some problem with "decode" method in python 3.3.4. This is my code:But I can't decode the line for this problem: Do you have any ideas? Thanks
One encodes strings, and one decodes bytes.You should read bytes from the file and decode them:Luckily  has an encoding argument which makes this easy:
 already decodes to Unicode in Python 3 if you open in text mode. If you want to open it as bytes, so that you can then decode, you need to open with mode 'rb'.
This works for me smoothly to read Chinese text in Python 3.6. First, convert str to bytes, and then decode them.
