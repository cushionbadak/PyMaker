I am learning to use unittest with python and walkthrough with this examplehttp://agiletesting.blogspot.com/2005/01/python-unit-testing-part-1-unittest.htmlso my test script is like this:while running it in console using python .pyIt gives me error   I guess it is due to time module but as you can see I already had import time.what can be the reason if I comment those line containing the time it works.But i need to keep track of duration What can be the reason and solution to this problem.
The syntax error is in your tearDown method.on the  call you forgot to close the parenthesis, that is the last line of your  method.I would also suggest you keep the style of your code conforming to PEP8
