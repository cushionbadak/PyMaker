So I was playing around with  function. I ran a simple  function which gave me a list of defined names. What was unexpected is when I ran this just to fool around:This gave a me a entirely different list of names. Can someone explain what is going on? :) thanks!
 returns names of attributes of the given object. is a string literal. So you get attribute names of the string object.
