Flask suggests the following file layout: runflaskapp.py contains: flaskapp/init.py contains: Running this with 'python3 runflaskapp.py' works fine. However it seems to me that a more Python3onic way of doing this would be to rename 'runflaskapp.py' as 'flaskapp/main.py' and then run the whole thing as 'python3 -m flaskapp'. Unfortunately this doesn't work: Does anyone know why and how to fix it? 
The  flag does this:Search sys.path for the named module and execute its contents as the  module… When a package name is supplied instead of a normal module, the interpreter will execute  as the main module.In other words,  is not imported as , but as , just like a script would be, and then its  module gets executed.This means  will not work, because there is nothing named .But the relative import  will. So, as long as there are no absolute imports anywhere in  except in your new  file, that one-liner should do it.
