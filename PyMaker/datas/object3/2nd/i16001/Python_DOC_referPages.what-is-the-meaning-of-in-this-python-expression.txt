Can someone explain what this regular expression means? I am looking at someone else's python code, and I just find myself curious as to what the expression is doing. I am also not certain what the 2nd % sign means.
So it does this:First it generates all of the permutations of the input (unique orders):For each of these, it converts each item to a string and joins them with Then it joins all of those with and finally uses  to wrap the result in brackets:The pattern  matches all sequences like .The patern  matches one of , ,  or .So the resulting regex matches any permutation, with each item repeated any number of times (including 0).The outer brackets make this a capturing group.
Just try it with a test string. Let's try 'abc'So it creates a  search string, with each character of the permeated passed in string delimited by  and each of the permutations delimeted by .If any of the steps within that line of code confuse you, look at the documentation for each component
