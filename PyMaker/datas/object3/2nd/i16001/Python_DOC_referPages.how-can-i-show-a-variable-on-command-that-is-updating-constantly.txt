If you want something to keep constantly working in the background, even while you're waiting for input, the simplest way to do that is with a thread.The  module has some great documentation, but I'm not sure the examples will be sufficient for someone who's never heard of threads before, so let's make a simple example.First, you want to wrap your die-rolling loop up into a function:However, since , etc., are all still global variables, that  isn't going to work inside a function unless you first add this to the top of the function:Now, to start that function running in the background, you just pass that function to a  object and  it.But how can you ever quit? You need some way to signal the worker thread to stop working. Or, more simply, you need to be able to abandon the worker thread, so the OS will just kill it when the main thread quits. That doesn't work in many situations, but it happens to work here. You do that with the  attribute.And there's still one more problem. What if the main thread is trying to print out  at the same time the background thread is trying to do ? As it turns out, CPython (the Python implementation you're almost certainly using) guarantees this is safe, but if you don't understand why, you shouldn't rely on that. Instead, you want to use a lock, to make sure only one thread at a time can touch each variable.So, putting it all together:As a side note, using lists and loops instead of a bunch of separate variables and copy-pasted code can make things a lot simpler. For example, this replaces your whole function:And this replaces your whole output loop:
