I am working through Learn Python the Hard Way and am browsing through some code on Git Hub before moving on. I am just curious what the .N does on the line with "tm.N = 1000" and how it relates to the end of the code.
 is a global in the  module, that is used all around the module to test arrays and other things. Its default value is 30. E.g.In the code you're posting it have poor usage, because  can be feed with a  parameter that end up being substituted by  if  is not provided. This is the correct usage, that would not confuse you:

Source: https://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/master/pandas/util/testing.pyN is a variable in the pandas.util.testing library (imported as ). It's used in a few of the functions defined in that library, including the  function called in the  which is in turn called in the  function that you call with 
You can get information about  from the docstring and the type() function:
In pandas in the module pandas.util.testing the N property means TimeSeries See this reference in the section:
It makes a timeseries of length 1000. 
.N provides the number of elements in array type. For example, if you use a colormap, will return  because it consists of 9 colors whereas  will return
