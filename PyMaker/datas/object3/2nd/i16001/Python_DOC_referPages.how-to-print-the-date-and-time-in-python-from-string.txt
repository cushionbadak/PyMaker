Should be quick, but I can't for the life of me figure this one out.I'm given the following strings:201408110000201408120001201408130002Which I loaded as a date(?) time object via the following:Where datestring is the string.From there, how do I output the following:11-Aug-1412-Aug-1413-Aug-14I tried  but all it gave me was this weird thing:time.struct_time(tm_year=2014, tm_mon=8, tm_mday=11, tm_hour=12,  tm_min=1, tm_sec=5, tm_wday=0, tm_yday=223, tm_isdst=-1)What am I doing wrong? Anything I add so far to  gives me  or something.
Using strftime
When you use  module it return a time struct type. Using  returns a datetime type.

If you're doing a lot of parsing of variety of input time formats, consider also installing and using the  package.  The  module will eat a variety of time formats without specification, such as this concise "one-liner":This uses  to eat the datestring into a , which is then reformatted using , not to be confused with , used in a different answer.See more at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-dateutil or the python-dateutil tag.
