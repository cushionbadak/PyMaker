My application parses the command line arguments:This works great but at the same time odd: if I put the arguments in the different order, they aren't get parsedThat's disappointing because the order of the arguments shouldn't matter, should it? Is there any way to solve that?UPDATE:
As stated in the first comment to your question, your main example regarding failed parsing of arguments in a different order works just fine:If that's not the case for you, please update the script to print the remainder as well, and show its output.However, you have still misused the  library and that's the reason the latest examples you provided don't work as expected. You can't specify more than a single character as an option, since the second character would count as a new separate option.  provides no way to differentiate between two consecutive characters that count as a single option (with the first one carrying no argument value, as it is not followed by a colon) or a single option that is composed of two characters. From 's documentation, with my added emphasis:options is the string of option letters that the script wants to recognize, with options that require an argument followed by a colon.Therefore, when  parses your arguments, each time it encounters a  argument, it associates it with the first  option it notices, which in your case is not followed by a colon. Thus, it sets this option, discards its argument value, if there was any (if  was passed as an argument to the script, the second  counts as the argument value) and moves on to the next argument.Finally, regarding  and . The documentation clearly advocates :The getopt module is a parser for command line options whose API is designed to be familiar to users of the C getopt() function. Users who are unfamiliar with the C getopt() function or who would like to write less code and get better help and error messages should consider using the argparse module instead.More about why  is better than both  and the deprecated  can be read in this PEP and in the answers to this question.The only functionality that I've found to be supported in  while it requires a bit of work in  is argument order permutation like that of . However, this question explains how this can be achieved via .
