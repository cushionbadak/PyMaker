I am trying to install scipy in cygwin (Win8-64) using easy_install and I have such kind of error:I can't figure it out by my owin what is wrong. Help will be appresiated here.I also wonder if the successful installation of scipy will result in installation libraries for python2.7 or for python3 both of which I have in me PC (I need both)?Any help? Thanks in advance!After help of @abarnert:What I have done so far:install all FORTRAN libraries via setup.exe (libgfortranlib, gcc-fortran, etc)pip2.7 install scipypip3.2 install scipyNo problems were met during this type of installations.
The error at the end seems pretty clear:error: Blas (http://www.netlib.org/blas/) libraries not found.And it even tells you how to solve the error. What do you want someone here to tell you beyond that?There may be a BLAS library as part of Cygwin's setup app. If not, go to the URL linked in the error message and download BLAS yourself.Meanwhile, even though this is a completely separate question, I'll answer it:I also wonder if the successful installation of scipy will result in installation libraries for python2.7 or for python3 both of which I have in me PC (I need both)?It depends on which  you're running. The simplest thing to do is not try to guess or figure it out, just explicitly use  and  (or whichever version).However, you probably shouldn't be using  in the first place. Use  instead unless you have a good reason to do otherwise, as recommended by both the Python Packaging User Guide and the official Python docs.
