I have a simple windows executable that asks for user input and I'm trying to make a python script to automate the input. What I've done:Now, normally when the program runs, it outputs to the command prompt "give me input:" then expects input from the user.If I use Popen with the  option, nothing is written to the command prompt at all - it just sits there blank.Then, when I use communicate, "Test Input" ends up on the python console, and not to the process.Is it possible to automate something like this? Or am I missing something fundamental here..
You can give  to  function.like 
"Test Input" ends up on the python consoleYou see the output because  function prints it. If you want to pass  literally to the subprocess then drop  call:It is not guaranteed that  accepts utf-8 input on Windows (it might accept input encoded using Windows console OEM encoding such as  or Windows ANSI encoding such as  instead) and therefore  input may be wrong. It should be ok to pass a bytestring with bytes in ascii range (created using  bytes literal)).
