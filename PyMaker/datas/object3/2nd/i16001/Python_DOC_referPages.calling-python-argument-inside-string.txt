I want to call python argument inside string. Is that possible?Suppose I have declared variable mypath asand I need to call it inside another variable that is string like following
It looks like what you want to do is insert a variable into the middle of a string.This is done with string formatting. Python has a couple different ways of doing it, but the simplest is the  method, as explained in the tutorial section Fancier Output Formatting:if  is, say, the string , then  will be the string .But that's not quite right, because you're trying to format a command that can be run by another Python interpreter. So, you want not just the contents of the string, but a Python literal for the string. How do you do that?The  of a string is the string in quotes, with proper escaping to make sure it can be used directly in Python code. (This isn't true for all objects; for example, some will return something like , which isn't particularly useful; it's generally only true for objects where typing the output into Python code would make sense, and get you an exactly equivalent object.)So, how do you get that? As explained in Format String Syntax, you use the  conversion specifier:Now,  will be the string And that's exactly what you want.
You do use a tuple Or using a format string
