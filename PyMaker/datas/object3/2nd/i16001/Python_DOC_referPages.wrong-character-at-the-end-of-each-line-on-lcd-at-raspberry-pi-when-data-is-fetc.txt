Hi connected a HD44780 compatible LCD with a Raspberry Pi Model B. The wiring is as follows:When I execute this script, which just grabs via Python subprocess some host information from the system, I get on the LCD a wrong character at the end of each line.This image shows the result.When I do not use subprocess and just insert any strings, I do not get the wrong character a the end of each line. This what this example proves:This image shows the result. There are no wrong characters.The software I use is Raspbian os operating system.I think this issue is caused by subprocess. What can I do to fix this?Thanks for any help!
When confused about string contents, always inspect the string with using the  function (or when using Python 3, ). This'll produce a string representation of the string that can be pasted back into your interpreter without encoding headaches and will show any non-printable or special control character as an escape sequence instead.In this case, the most likely culprit is a newline character,  when represented as an escape sequence. 
James Kent and Martijn Pieters solved it. There was newline at the end of each line.  removed the newline.
