So what I got here is a series of functions searching for the targeted value in a string.(for example: find R in $&(*,.02468:<>@BDFHJLNPRTVXZ\^`bdfhj, H is found at index 18.)But when the test for the function is executed for some characters it works fine but for some others(such as D or L) it gives me the "maximum recursion depth reached error". Also for the characters in front such as $ in $&(,.02468:<>@BDFHJLNPRTVXZ\^`bdfhj, the result is "it cannot be found"*
There are two issues in your  function.Code below fails for  which is at the beginning. Your search eventually comes to  then  will be , returning Bigger problem is you enter into endless recursion loop in the code below when you search for 'D'. When you search for D, your start and end will be following ,,,,,,....infinitely!!!I believe the fix for both 1 and 2 above can be done by handling situations where .Remove lines below:Replace with:Quick sample way to test without having the you enter the input is:However if you want thorough testing you would be better off using python unit-testing and use assertions. See the documentation here: https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html 
This works without errors for the characters contained in the string:Built-in python function:
