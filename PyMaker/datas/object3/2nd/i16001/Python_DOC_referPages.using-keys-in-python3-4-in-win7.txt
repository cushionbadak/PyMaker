Natural Text
I'm reading Natural Language Processing with Python by Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, Edward Loper.And in this book, they use python2.4 or 2.5, but I could get python3.4.1 and python3.3 and python2.7.1. So I can1t use keys().Please tell me how to use python2.4 or 2.5, or how to make "keys()" on myself.I know the concept of function so I will make keys() with some hints, please help me!
If you are trying to use a book designed for Python 2.4 or 2.5, you can use Python 2.7 and not have any problems.Python 3  exists and works just fine. It returns a dictionary view object rather than a list like in Python 2, so all you have to do to get the same result is call .However, you'll have other problems translating the Python 2 code to Python 3, and I strongly advice you to stick with a Python 2.x interpreter.
