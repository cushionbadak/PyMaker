I would like to store a bunch of variables under a Python namespace without creating a separate module. I notice that the result of 's  is a  object. You can access the arguments through dot-syntax.How can I create the equivalent of an ? I know I can do something similar with a  but I would like to use dot-syntax. Is there any built-in class that just lets you assign arbitrary attributes?
Starting with python3.3 you can use .However an alternative is simply:The full code for  isn't much longer.Note that you cannot simply use an  instance:This is because instances of  do not have a  attribute:Which means you cannot set the attributes of an instance of . Any  subclass that does not have the  attribute set does have the  which is used (by default) to store/retrieve attributes:For further information about attribute setting/lookup you should learn about descriptors.
It sounds like you want a python . See the docs.Depending on what you want exactly, you can define a bunch of variables as attributes of a class (either a variable of an instance or of the class itself) and access them that way.
If you want "the equivalent of an ", use :
A class can be used as a namespace, where the variables are class members:To prevent callers from trying to instantiate, you can use a baseclass like:And use it like:
If I'm understanding correctly, you want to dynamically add attributes to it.  For example, a class parses command-line flags you access them directly like args.verbose, right?  If so, you may be thinking of setattr() that lets you add arbitrary attributes.
