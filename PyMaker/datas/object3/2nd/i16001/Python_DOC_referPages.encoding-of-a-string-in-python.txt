I have a string S="Test" in Python. I want to encode the string into CP1256, ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-2, ISO-8859-6, ISO-8859-15 and Window-1252 formats. How can I do the encoding of the string into the mentioned formats?
I don't know why Slava Bacherikov deleted his answer, but it was the right answer, so I'll repeat it with more detail. is exactly what you want:Return an encoded version of the string as a  object. Default encoding is . errors may be given to set a different error handling scheme. The default for errors is , meaning that encoding errors raise a . Other possible values are , , ,  and any other name registered via , see section Codec Base Classes. For a list of possible encodings, see section Standard Encodings.If you follow that link to Standard Encodings, you'll see a nice table that shows you the names to use for each of these (you can use either the main codec name, or any of the aliases). So:While you could use  as the other answers suggest, there's really no good reason to do so, and one good reason not to:  enforces the fact that you're calling it on a  object, and using a codec that translates  to ; you'll get an exception if you accidentally use it on an already-encoded  or a  or something.All of the above is assuming you're using Python 3. If you're using Python 2, a  is already encoded. So, if you can start with a  object, like  instead of , do that; if not, you will want to  it first. Unfortunately, Python 2 won't enforce that; if you call  it will actually decode it with , which will usually be ASCII, which will lead to silly errors.
its what that   module is for :
Just use the  moduleIf you want to first check if python is aware of a certain encoding format just use
