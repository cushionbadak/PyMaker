When I enter this code, there is an error in the way a slice works...It won't let me enter it, and it overall just wont work. Yields the error:
I believe that what you're looking for is called slicing not subtraction and specifically in line 3.  It's working okay when I run the code you've pasted here in idle and this is because the else statements should take care of any type errors from user input. You can however read more on strings and how slicing. Try this: http://docs.python.org/release/1.5.1p1/tut/strings.html
