Hi I have a list of lists and I need to compare a value of each list with another one extracted from an XML file. The structure is similar to this:I need to compare the second value of each list with the values in the XML:The problem is that the main_list has a huge ammount of lines (1000+) and this multiplied by the values from the xml (100+) results in a lot of iterations becoming this method unefficient.Is there a way to do this efficiently?Regards.
A membership check on a set will be significantly faster than manually iterating and checking:Here we construct the set with a simple set comprehension.Note that it may be worth swapping what data is in the set - if  is longer, it will be more efficient to make the set of that data.These both also only do the processing on the data once, rather than each time a check is made.Note that a set will not handle duplicate values or order on the set side - if that is important, this isn't a valid solution. This version will only use the order/duplicates from the data you are iterating over. If that isn't valid, then you can still process the data beforehand, and use  to iterate a little quicker.As Karl Knechtel points out, if you really don't care about order to duplicates at all, you can just do a set intersection:
