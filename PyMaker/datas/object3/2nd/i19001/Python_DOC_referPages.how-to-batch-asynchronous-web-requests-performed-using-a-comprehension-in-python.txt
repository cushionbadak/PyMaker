not sure if this is possible, spend some time looking at what seem like similar questions, but still unclear. For a list of website urls, I need to get the html as a starting point. I have a class that contains a list of these urls and the class returns a custom iterator that helps me iterate through these to get the html (simplified below)2 - I want to be able to use like3 - problem i have is that I want to batch all the requests rather than having fetchhtml operate sequentially on my list, and once they are done then extract the image list.Is there ways to to achieve this, maybe use threads and queue? i cannot see how to make the the list comprehension for my object work like this without it running sequentially. Maybe this is the wrong way, but i just want to batch long running requests initiated by operations within a list or dict comprehension. Thankyou in advance
you need to use  or .also, in Python3, there is . Take a look at  and .The example in the docs for  does almost exactly what you are asking:Note:  similar functionality is available for Python 2 via the  package on PyPI.
