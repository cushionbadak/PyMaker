Natural Text
After parsing some webpage with utf-8 coding, I realize that I obtain characters that I can't manipulaten, though it is readable by the means of print.How can I get this into a decent coding using Python?I would like to obtain(I mean being able to cast that text in a variable as a "regular" string)I saw several solutions related to that topic but did not find relevant answer (mainly based on encoding/decoding in other charset)
With a little help from this answer:The  method takes a dictionary that maps one Unicode code point to another. In this case, it maps the full-width Latin alphabet (which is essentially part of the ASCII character set shifted up to the range 0xFF01-0xFF5E) to the "normal" ASCII character set. For example, 0xFF21 (full-width A) maps to 0x41 (ASCII A), 0xFF22 (full-width B) maps to 0x42 (ASCII B), etc.
This functionality is built into the unicodedata module:
Consider using Python 3, which has better printing support for Unicode characters.  Here's a sample:
