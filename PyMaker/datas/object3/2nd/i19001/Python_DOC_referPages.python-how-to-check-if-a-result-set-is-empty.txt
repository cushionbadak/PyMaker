I have a sql statement that returns no hits. For example, .I want to check how many rows are returned, Here I get already exception: "(0, 'No result set')" How can I prevend this exception, check whether the result set is empty?
 will usually be set to 0.If, however, you are running a statement that would never return a result set (such as  without , or ), then you do not need to call ; there won't be a result set for such statements. Calling  is enough to run the statement.Note that database adapters are also allowed to set the rowcount to  if the database adapter can't determine the exact affected count. See the PEP 249  specification:The attribute is  in case no  has been performed on the cursor or the rowcount of the last operation is cannot be determined by the interface.The  library is prone to doing this. In all such cases, if you must know the affected rowcount up front, execute a  select in the same transaction first.
MySQLdb will not raise an exception if the result set is empty. Additionally cursor.execute() function will return a long value which is number of rows in the fetched result set. So if you want to check for empty results, your code can be re-written as
I had issues with rowcount always returning -1 no matter what solution I tried.I found the following a good replacement to check for a null result.
Notice: This is for MySQLdb module in Python.For a  statement, there shouldn't be an exception for an empty recordset. Just an empty list () for  and  for .For any other statement, e.g.  or , that doesn't return a recordset, you can neither call  nor  on the cursor. Otherwise, an exception will be raised.There's one way to distinguish between the above two types of cursors:
if you're connecting to a postgres database, the following works:
