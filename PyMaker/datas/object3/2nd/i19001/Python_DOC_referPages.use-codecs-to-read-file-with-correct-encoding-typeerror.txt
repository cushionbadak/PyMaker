I need to read from a file, linewise. Also also need to make sure the encoding is correctly handled.I wrote the following code:This code does not work on all files, on some files I get aIm using python 3.3 and the script must work with this python version.What am I doing wrong, I was not able to find out which files work and which not, even some plain ASCII files fail.
You are opening the file in non-binary mode. If you read from it, you get a string decoded according to your default encoding (http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=open%20builtin#open). codec's StreamReader needs a bytestream (http://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs#codecs.StreamReader)So this should work:or you can use the encoding parameter on :The reader returns decoded data, so I fixed your variable name. Also, consider pep8 as a guide for formatting and coding style.
