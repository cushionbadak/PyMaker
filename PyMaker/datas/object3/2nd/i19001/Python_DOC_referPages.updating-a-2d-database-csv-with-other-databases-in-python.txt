I basically have a file such asAnd I have "update files" in the formSo I need to keep track of which rows extend horizontally, which extend vertically, and which extend both ways. In excel this basically looks like splitting each dataset into 4, and pasting the data in the appropriate places.I was hacking together a solution but I figure perhaps NumPy or Pandas or some other suite has great tools for this purpose?Edit: The "update" files always contain more up-to-date information, so whatever they contain overrides the original file. If it helps, the update file could be counted on always having a higher number for any Name/Day combination.
How about this, using :First, read in the data (this will depend on the details of the format):Then append the new data, which automatically extends the columns:Combine by the Name column, and take the last valid value (originally I was worried this would lose the Day1 and Day2 information for Abe, but it doesn't):Replace the missing values with 0:And finally write out:
The  module might be a better fit for dynamically-modified data like this. It's built into Python, and is quite easy to deal with. Initially, you'll want to read in your data using the  module, and in and of itself it may provide enough functionality for what you're trying to do, especially if management insists on using this format.
