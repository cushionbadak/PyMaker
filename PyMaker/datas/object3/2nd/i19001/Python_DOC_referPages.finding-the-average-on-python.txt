What is the average value of the numbers in the field [Num] in the range (3987) and (5026) inclusive? The field is below it is field [4] on excel. I have tried the following code and I cannot figure out what else to do. Thanks in advance
Use the  module, it was designed for a task like this:The above code also uses the file as a context manager (with the  statement); as soon as the  block has completed, the file is closed for you, automatically.In your version, you tried to close the file manually, but only managed to reference the  method, not actually call it.We also don't read all values into a list, not when you can instead just sum the values and keep a count of how many values you summed. This uses much less memory and makes processing even huge CSV files fast and efficient.For your sample data, the above code outputs:The average of the values is 3261.2
Here's a version that does not use the  module. (note that it is encouraged you learn how to use suitable modules if present for each task)
