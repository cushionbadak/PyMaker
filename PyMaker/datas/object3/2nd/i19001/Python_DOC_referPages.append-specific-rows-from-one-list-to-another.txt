Having some difficulty trying to take a 2d list with 7 columns and 10 rows, and append all rows from only columns 4,5 and 6 (or 3,4,5 from index 0) to a new list. The original list is actually a csv and is much, much longer but I've just put part of it in the function for troubleshooting purposes.What I have so far is...This code gives me a new list with 'ID' only but I also want 'Lat' and 'Lon'.The new list should look like...['3_10', '-21.77','119.11']['4_10','-21.10'...]I tried re-writing newList.append(row[3,4,5])...and of course that doesn't work but not sure how to go about it. 
 refers to the fourth element. You seem to want the fourth through sixth elements, so slice it:You could also do this all with a list comprehension:
