There is code:Why the name  is not mangled to  but  is?
As the Python tutorial puts it:This mangling is done without regard to the syntactic position of the identifier, as long as it occurs within the definition of a class.Name mangling occurs at compilation time for code that is lexically inside of a  statement. It doesn't occur for code outside of  statements. It doesn't occur for code in functions that are defined outside a  statement and then added to the class object. It doesn't occur for code dynamically executed by a  or  call inside a  statement.
Exactly because you declared it outside the class, and name mangling happens inside classes.
