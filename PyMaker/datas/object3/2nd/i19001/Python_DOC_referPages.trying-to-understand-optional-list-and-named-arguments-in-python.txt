I'm a beginner at Python, trying to understand function arguments and their types and orders.I tried to experiment a little with the different kinds of argument and here's my experimentI really understood most of things after this experiment. But there's one issue that i can't get inside my head.In the function definition in  and  where  are defined before optional argument and list argument, when i run the program, even if i didn't use that function, just defined it.. It produces  .. I'd be grateful to know why is this happening ?Thanks.
Keyword arguments have to be the final arguments passed to a function. Read up on it here. Parameters like  must be the last parameter in a function signature (as detailed on that page in the docs). From the documentation:When a final formal parameter of the form **name is present, it receives a dictionary (see Mapping Types â€” dict) containing all keyword arguments except for those corresponding to a formal parameter.The reason your code raises a SyntaxError even if you don't use that function is that if you violate this rule, Python can't even complete the function definition since the signature you're trying to give it is illegal.
 and  must be the last arguments specified (in that order!); the reason is that they're essentially "catch-alls" that match arguments passed to the function that don't match the specific arguments listed beforehand, so having them listed before specific arguments is ambiguous.For example, test_m above must be specified as
