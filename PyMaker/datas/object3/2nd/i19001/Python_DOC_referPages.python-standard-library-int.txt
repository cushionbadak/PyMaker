Natural Text
I was reading through the documentation to the Python Standard Library. In section 4.4. Numeric Types there is a note to :Conversion from floating point to integer may round or truncate as in  CWhat does this mean? I thought int always returned the floor? Is that not the case?
Conversion from a float to a integer truncates towards 0 as it does in C. This is basically equivalent to , where  gives the sign of a number.
