I am trying to make a function that prints the variance of a list of defined numbers:So far, I have tried proceeding on making these three functions:When I try to execute the code, however, it gives me the following error at the following line:Apologies if my current Python knowledges are limited, but I am still learning - so please if you wish to help solving this issue try not to suggest extremely-complicated ways on how to solve this, thank you really much. 
First I would suggest using Python's built-in  method to replace your first custom method.  then becomes:Second, I would strongly recommend looking into the NumPy library, as it has these methods built-in.  and  would cover both these cases.If you're interested in writing the code for yourself first, that's totally fine too. As for your specific error, I believe @gnibbler above nailed it. If you want to loop using an index, you can restructure the line in  to be:As Lattyware noted, looping by index is not particularly "Pythonic"; the way you're currently doing it is generally superior. This is just for your reference.
Try numpy.
When you say isn't the index of the item.  is the item
While gnibbler has solved the problem with your code, you can achieve this much more easily using built-in functions and a generator expression:It might look a little scary at first, but if you watch the video I link about list comprehensions and generator expressions - they are actually really simple and useful.
python 3.4 has a statistics lib which does this.https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.pvariance
I suppose you would like the sample variance i.e. the unbiased estimator of the variance. I think this function might do the job. It will print the variance and the mean of a vector n.
the below code is used to get the average of valuesvariance formula -> The average of the squared differences from the Mean.This code below is used to get the variance of values
