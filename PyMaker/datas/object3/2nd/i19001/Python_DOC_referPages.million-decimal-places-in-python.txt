We recently delve into infinite series in calculus and that being said, I'm having so much fun with it. I derived my own inverse tan infinte series in python and set to 1 to get pi/4*4 to get pi. I know it's not the fastest algorithm, so please let's not discuss about my algorithm. What I would like to discuss is how do I represent very very small numbers in python. What I notice is as my programs iterate the series, it stops somewhere at the 20 decimal places (give or take). I tried using decimal module and that only pushed to about 509. I want an infinite (almost) representation. Is there a way to do such thing? I reckon no data type will be able to handle such immensity, but if you can show me a way around that, I would appreciate that very much.
Python's decimal module requires that you specify the "context," which affects how precise the representation will be.I might recommend gmpy2 for this type of thing - you can do the calculation on rational numbers (arbitrary precision) and convert to decimal at the last step.Here's an example - substitute your own algorithm as needed:
