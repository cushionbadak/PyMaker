This question already has an answer here:What is __init__.py for?                    10 answers                When creating a Python package, I am told to create a blank file called init.py. What I don't understand is why I need to create this file. The  build script doesn't modify it, so five builds later it's still blank. What is it's purpose?
It a signal to Python that the folder is a package, not just a folder. It also contains initialization code that is run when the package is ed into a script.See the docs on the subject for more. The most relevant extract:The  files are required to make Python treat the  directories as containing packages; this is done to prevent  directories with a common name, such as , from unintentionally  hiding valid modules that occur later on the module search path. In  the simplest case,  can just be an empty file, but it can  also execute initialization code for the package or set the   variable, described later.
