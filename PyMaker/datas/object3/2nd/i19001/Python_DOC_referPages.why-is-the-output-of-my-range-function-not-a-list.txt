According to the Python documentation, when I do range(0, 10) the output of this function is a list from 0 to 9 i.e. [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. However the Python installation on my PC is not outputting this, despite many examples of this working online.Here is my test code...The output of this I'm thinking should be the list printed, and the type function should output it as a list. Instead I'm getting the following output...I haven't seen this in any of the examples online and would really appreciate some light being shed on this.
That's because  and other functional-style methods, such as , , and , return iterators in Python 3.  In Python 2 they returned lists.Whatâ€™s New In Python 3.0: now behaves like  used to behave, except it works with  values of arbitrary size. The latter no longer exists.To convert an iterator to a list you can use the  function:
Usually you do not need to materialize a range into an actual list but just want to iterate over it. So especially for larger ranges using an iterator saves memory.For this reason  in Python 3 returns an iterator instead (as  did in Python 2). Use  if you want an actual list instead for some reason.
