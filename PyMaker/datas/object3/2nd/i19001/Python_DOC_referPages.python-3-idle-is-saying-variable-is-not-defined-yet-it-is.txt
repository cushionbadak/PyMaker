I am creating a program where you enter the password, and you can play games. In one of my definitions , It tells me , , , , and  are being referenced before they are defined, but to the best of my knowledge they have already been defined. Also when this was still working, i tried to make it that solving a task would make it say it had been completed, but when I completed one, it still said that 1 was incomplete and so on. I need a fix for both of these problems.
Inside the  function, you are assigning to the , , etc. variables. That makes those variables local to that function, but you also try to test their contents at the start.  This is where your error comes from.You'd have to declare those variables :You may want to use a list instead:and This has the added advantage that now you no longer need a  keyword either; you are no longer assigning to  but to the indices contained in . You are mutating , not replacing it with another value.Other remarks; the line:also won't work; I think you meant that to be:but with a list that could be:or perhaps When testing for a specific string, use , not . The latter works but has to do two things; loop over the list and test for equality on each element.  goes straight for the equality test.
