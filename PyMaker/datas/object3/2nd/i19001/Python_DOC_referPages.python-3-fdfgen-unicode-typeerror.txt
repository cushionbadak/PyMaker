I am using Python 3.3 and am trying to make use of the wonderful fgfgen / forge_fdf script (thanks guys, btw). When I attempt to run a sample test of fdfgen, I return the following error. After some looking around, this seems to be a result of python 3 handling unicode encoding? but I am unsure.  Here is a sample of the fdfgen code executed followed by the fdfgen code so nicely provided.  Thanks in advance:
Encoding produces byte values, but you are using string values to try to replace things. Use Byte literals instead:
Fdfgen has now been ported to Python 3, mostly just by explicitly turning all of the strings into byte literals, as Martjin Pieters mentioned.
On fdfgen 0.11.0 with python 3.4.2 on Vista, when writing the fdf data to a file, I got this error initially:and I also got this initially but can't reproduce it now:Turns out the only change I had to make was to add the 'binary' mode to the file open command.  Instead of:use this:all the other lines were the same as in his example on the fdfgen web site.  Hope this helps someone out.
