This question already has an answer here:How to input a regex in string.replace?                    7 answers                I have a parameter file of the form:Where the parameters may be in any order but there is only one parameter per line.  I want to replace one parameter's  with a new value.I am using a line replace function posted previously to replace the line which uses Python's .  The regular expression that I'm using works for instance in vim but doesn't appear to work in . Here is the regular expression that I'm using:Where  is the parameter name that I'm replacing (/i for case-insensitive) and the new parameter value is the contents of the  variable. Is there a way to get Python to recognize this regular expression or else is there another way to accomplish this task?
 v2|v3 does not recognize regular expressions. To perform a substitution using a regular expression, use  v2|v3.For example:In a loop, it would be better to compile the regular expression first:
You are looking for the re.sub function.will print 
As a summary 
 is definitely what you are looking for.  And so you know, you don't need the anchors and the wildcards.will do the same thing--matching the first substring that looks like "interfaceOpDataFile" and replacing it.
