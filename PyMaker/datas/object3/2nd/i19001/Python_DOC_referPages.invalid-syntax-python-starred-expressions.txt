I am trying to unpack set of phone numbers from a sequence, python shell in turn throws an invalid syntax error. I am using python 2.7.1. Here is the snippetPlease explain. Is there any other way of doing the same?
You are using Python 3 specific syntax in Python 2.The  syntax for extended iterable unpacking in assignments is not available in Python 2.See Python 3.0, new syntax and PEP 3132.Use a function with  splat argument unpacking to simulate the same behaviour in Python 2:or use list slicing.
This new syntax was introduced in Python 3. So, it'll raise error in Python 2.Related PEP: PEP 3132 -- Extended Iterable UnpackingPython 3:Python 2:
That functionality is only available in Python 3, an alternative is:Or something like:but that is pretty hacky IMO
