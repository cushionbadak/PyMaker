I have this portion of a class that takes a whole number and a fraction and add them together.The outcome of this is 3 and 17/12, when it should be 4 and 5/12, I am not sure how to do this, I assume with an if the fraction is >= 1. Any help would be much appreciated
If you are using the  library, ou can just sum everything, then take the  portion of the fraction:The  class implements  for you, you can just sum up integers and  objects and it all works as it should.Demo using constants:One little-known but handy factoid is that Python the  type has both  and  attributes, that the  class makes use of. If you are not using the  library, you can make use of that yourself:
One way to "fix" your version would be to deal with the improper fraction directly:Although there are more efficient ways of doing this addition more directly.
