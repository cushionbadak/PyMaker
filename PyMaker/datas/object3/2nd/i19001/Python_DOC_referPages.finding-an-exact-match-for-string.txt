I used the following function to find the exact match for words in a string.   But I get an exact match for both words "award" and "award-winning" when it only should be award-winning for the following string.How can i get it such that re.findall will match whole words with hyphens and other punctuations?
Make your own word-boundary:copy-paste from here to my interpreter:Actually, the casting to  is unnecessary and not helping at all. The function is better off without it:note:  is pretty unconventional casing. just call it exact_match.
The problem with your initial method is that  does not denote the zero-width assertion search that your looking for. (And if it did, I would use  instead because backslashes can become a real hassle in regular expressions - see this link)From Regular Expression HOWTOBecause  is a non-alphanumeric character, your findall regular expression will find  in  but not in .Depending on your searched phrase, I would also think of using  instead of  as suggested by Elazar. In your example  works, but if the word you are looking for is nested anywhere beyond the beginning of the string,  will not succeed.
