I have two lists:Keys that must be in dictKeys that are optional for dicthow can I check if the keys that must be there in a dictionary are there or not?how can I check if any of the optional keys is there in the dictionary or not?
Use dictionary views and sets:Sets, like dictionaries, make membership testing cheap and fast, and set operations make it easy to test if items are present or not. You really want to make  and  be sets to starts with.For example, subtraction on sets calculates the difference, so  is set to the difference between the  list and what keys are in the dictionary.Using the  operator on sets (normally binary AND) gives you the intersection, so  gives you what keys in the dictionary are also in the  sequence (doesn't have to be a set in this case, but using a set there would make sense).For testing individual keys you can still use , but using set operations avoids excessive looping.Note that  is  specific to Python (added in Python 2.7); in Python 3, the dictionary enumeration methods ,  and  return dictionary views by default and the  methods are gone.
You can use the  for the first case and set difference will solve the second one. Dicts can behave like sets using  ( in py3x):You can use  to check if all the keys in a list are present in a dict.Set difference:
