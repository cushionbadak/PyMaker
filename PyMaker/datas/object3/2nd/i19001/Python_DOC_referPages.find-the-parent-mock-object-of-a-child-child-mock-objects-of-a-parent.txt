Is it possible to identify the parent  mock object instance of a child mock object instance, or the children of a parent mock object instance? For example, if I have the following codeHow could I confirm later that the child mocks spawned from calling ? How could I check which mock objects  produced?Also, how could I distinguish that  originated specifically from the call , while  originated from the call ?I understand one can manually attach mocks as attributes of other mocks, however, it requires a good deal of setup in that you will need to make sure to explicitly define the return calls of the parent mock so that it returns the designated child mocks, and so it doesn't scale well past a few calls. 
How could I confirm later that the child mocks spawned from calling ?Well, there's an undocumented attribute , which you could use like this......but it looks as if the answer to all your other questions is "you can't".I suppose you could subclass  to keep track of its children with something like this......then you could do...
Careful there!26.4.2.1. CallingMock objects are callable. The call will return the value set as the return_value attribute. The default return value is a new Mock object; it is created the first time the return value is accessed (either explicitly or by calling the Mock) - but it is stored and the same one returned each time.If you want different calls to give different results, you'll want to give your mock a  attribute. If  is a function, then  will call  and return whatever that returns. You can make your custom  keep track of what calls produced what values.
