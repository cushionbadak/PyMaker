This question already has an answer here:“Unicode Error ”unicodeescape" codec can't decode bytes… Cannot open text files in Python 3                    10 answers                What does this error message mean?SyntaxError: (unicode error) 'unicodeescape' codec can't decode bytes in position 123-125: truncated \uXXXX escapeI get this error reported at a position in the comments, which contain only non-Unicode chars.The problematic code is the following:
It's worth noting that the "problematic code" is not technically a comment, but a multiline string which will be evaluated during bytecode compilation.Depending in its location in the source file, it may end up in a docstring, so it has to be syntactically valid.For example...There's no true multiline comment delimiter in Python, so if you don't want it to be evaluated, use several single-line comments...
As the others have said, it's trying to parse  as a Unicode escape and failing because it's invalid. The way around this is to escape the backslash:Or to use a raw string instead:PEP 257, which covers docstring conventions, suggests the latter.
It means that the \uXXXX escape sequence in the data you are decoding is invalid. Specifically it means it's to short. Most likely you have the text '\U' somewhere in the text, but not followed by a Unicode character number.
Python 3 strings are Unicode, so it attempts to decode the '\u' escapes. So, even though you are trying to use a string as a comment, it will still attempt to decode it.An actual comment, such as:will not be decoded.If you notice it's in the class of s, which means that even if it's 'unreachable code', it raises a flag.
