I have a function which takes no arguments and returns a string, which I want to be called using a string format. Here it is, and here's how I've tried to use :So neither of which is quite what I want, i.e. the value of .PEP 3101 describes some way in which  can be overwritten but it doesn't seem to give many examples. How can I subclass/customise the string  class to do this?A hacky thing I considered would be to overwrite the  method of , and I really don't want be "considered pathological" (or, at least, *that* pathological).
I guess the main deficiency I see in your answer is that it doesn't also handle the original compound field name syntaxes like  for 'getattr'/'dot' operator access nor,  for 'getitem' retrieval specified in PEP 3101. Here's a version that works in both Python 2.7 and 3.3. A major implementation difference is that it overrides the  method instead of .While it's a little hacky about how it detects calls in the  method, I don't think it's to the point where it would be considered pathological. ;-)Output:
You can overwrite the  method of  as follows:Doing something like this comes with a health warning, so I think it's worth pasting the Security Considerations section of that PEP in full (emphasis added):Historically, string formatting has been a common source of      security holes in web-based applications, particularly if the      string formatting system allows arbitrary expressions to be      embedded in format strings.  The best way to use string formatting in a way that does not      create potential security holes is to never use format strings      that come from an untrusted source.Barring that, the next best approach is to ensure that string      formatting has no side effects.  Because of the open nature of      Python, it is impossible to guarantee that any non-trivial      operation has this property.  What this PEP does is limit the      types of expressions in format strings to those in which visible      side effects are both rare and strongly discouraged by the      culture of Python developers.  So for example, attribute access      is allowed because it would be considered pathological to write      code where the mere access of an attribute has visible side      effects (whether the code has invisible side effects - such      as creating a cache entry for faster lookup - is irrelevant.)
