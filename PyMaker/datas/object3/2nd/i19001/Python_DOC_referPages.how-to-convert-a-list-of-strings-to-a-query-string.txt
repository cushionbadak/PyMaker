I have list of values:I want to concatenate them into a Query String:What is the best way to do that?
Since you're building a query string, it's better to use a function from the standard library that's specifically designed to do so: (in Python 3) (in Python 2)... than to muck around with . Here's how you'd use it:Result:Alternatively (thanks to Jon Clements in the Python chatroom), you can pass a dictionary to urlencode and the parameter :... which produces the same result. This is explained in the documentation linked above:The value element in itself can be a sequence and in that case, if the optional parameter doseq is evaluates to True, individual  pairs separated by  are generated for each element of the value sequence for the key. The order of parameters in the encoded string will match the order of parameter tuples in the sequence.
The part inside the parentheses is a generator expression, which gives you  for each  in the original list.The  function takes that expression and links it into one big string, putting an  between each pair.
