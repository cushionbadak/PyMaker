I'd like to use  to read from either  or an input file. In other words: If an input file is given, read that.If not, read from stdin only if it's not the terminal. (i.e. a file is being piped in)If neither of these criteria are satisfied, signal to argparse that the inputs aren't correct. I'm asking for behavior similar to what's described in this question, but I want  to recognize no file as a failed input. 
Using the information from the question you linked to, what about using  to check if the instance your program is being run is part of a pipeline, if not, read from input file, otherwise read from . If the input file does not exist or  is empty throw an error. Hope that helped.
I would recommend just settings  and then handling the case of a Nonetype separately. According to the official documentation, "FileType objects understand the pseudo-argument '-' and automatically convert this into sys.stdin for readable FileType objects and sys.stdout for writable FileType objects". So just give it a dash if you want stdin.Example
