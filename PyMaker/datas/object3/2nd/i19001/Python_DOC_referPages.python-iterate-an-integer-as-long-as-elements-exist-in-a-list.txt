Natural Text
I have a list that looks like this: is read in from a dynamic file and split up to be like this, so the number of elements are unknown.What I am trying to do is rejoin the information with a  between the items and store it into a text file per line but the problem is with a loop to iterate through the data elements and increment an integer to be used on the data list.here is a snippet:thanks
Flatten the list, then join.  does the flattening:This would put a  between all the items in all the sublists, writing them out as one long string.Demo:If you need the sublist each to be written to a new line, just loop over :or use a nested list comprehension:
Is this what you're looking for? Assuming you're not using that n for anything other than iterating over the data list, you can get rid of it altogether and do a nice little loop like this:You could condense it even more, if you felt like it, but I'd probably avoid that. Readability counts!
If the integer would only be used as an index into , you can just dispense with the integer entirely and iterate over the elements of  instead:
Do you mean like this:
If you really want "a loop to iterate through the data elements and increment an integer", that's exactly what  is for:However, I don't see why you think you want that for your problem. (Maybe if you described the problem better, or just showed us the code you have and the part that you don't know how to write?)
