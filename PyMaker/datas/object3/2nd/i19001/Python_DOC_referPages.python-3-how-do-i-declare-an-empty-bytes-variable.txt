How do I 'declare' an empty  variable in Python 3?I am trying to receive chunks of bytes, and later change that to a utf-8 string.However, I'm not sure how to declare the initial variable that will hold the entire series of bytes. This variable is called . I can't declare it as , because you can't add a  and a . I can't declare it as a unicode string, because then I will be trying to add  to a string. Also, as the receiving program evolves it might get me in to a mess with series of bytes that contain only parts of characters. I can't do without a  declaration, because then  would be referenced before assignment.The following is the code in question
Just use an empty byte string, .However, concatenating to a string repeatedly involves copying the string many times. A , which is mutable, will likely be faster:To decode the byte array to a string, use .
Use .Encase you want to go with the default encoding, simply use , but this will garbage the whole buffer if its not in the same encoding
As per documentation:Blockquote  socket.recv(bufsize[, flags])  Receive data from the socket. The return value is a string representing the data received.  Blockquote  So, I think msg="" should work just fine:
