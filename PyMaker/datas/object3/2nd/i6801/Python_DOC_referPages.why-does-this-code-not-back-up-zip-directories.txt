I'm making a program to ZIP files. In this scenario, I am trying to ZIP a directory, with a subdirectory inside of it. I'm using the following function if the program has to ZIP a directory, yet it doesn't ZIP subdirectories, it just takes the files from the subdirectory and puts them with all the others. Thanks.
The second argument to  is the archive name, i.e. the filename of the file inside the archive. Since the ZIP file does not contain any folder information on its own, that is where that has to go. So in order to put a file inside a subdirectory, you have to adjust the  to include a directory name.You can use  to calculate a path relative to your  which appears to be the root of the ZIP file:
