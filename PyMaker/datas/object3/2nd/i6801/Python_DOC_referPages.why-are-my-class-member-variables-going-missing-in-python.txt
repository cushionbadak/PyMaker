I made a class. I think that I create a member variable named "myTup" in the initializer/constructor. I try to make sure that I actually did create myTup  by making the following call right at the very end of the initializer:However, later, the interpreter says that my instance/object doesn't have a member variable named "myTup."Where did myTup go? Come back to me... please Q_QThe following script is only long due to all of the little debug statements. Without the debugging, it's actually quite short and simple.Code:Output:
You can't replace the instance created in . The following replaces only the  reference in the  method, not the previous instance that  was bound to:When  returns, the  line still bound the first instance, not the one you created with your recursive call. That first instance has no  attribute.You'd have to call  instead to operate on the same instance:This then calls  again, with the same instance bound, and thus will set  on the right object.Note that I'd avoid using recursion here. There is no need, just set a tuple in the different branches and then assign  at the end:If you must control what instance is returned when trying to create a new one with , then you can only do so with the  method; it is responsible for producing the instance in the first place (after which the default implementation would call  on that new instance).
