Natural Text
I have created a menu bar and a textbox, in the textbox I like to show the info in the variable that belongs to the chooice that been made in the menu.But I can not figure out how.Heres what I managed to put together by different guides on the web. Im verry new to python and Im still struggeling with the concept on objects and classes so any help at all will be greatly appriciated.
Here's a little push forward:In general, I'd try to avoid importing all those symbols and just do something likethen where you write  or  you'd use  or .Also, I moved all your widget creation inside of the class.  So now your Text widget is a class member () and can be accessed and controlled easily from within the class -- all of your  methods call  (another class method) which sets the Text widget's contents.Hope it helps.
Thank you all for your input.And I'll will continue to work with your post jedward.I'll look in to Eclipse and Py Charm since I really need something like that.
