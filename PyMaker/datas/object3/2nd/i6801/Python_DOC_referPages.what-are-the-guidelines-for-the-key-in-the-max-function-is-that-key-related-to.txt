Natural Text
I am a beginner in Python , I tried to understand how this (2nd line) works.Is it comparing the lowercase letters based on the key (which is the repetition of the letter in the text string) ?From documentation , I found max(arg1, arg2, *args[, key])but there is no definition for what is the key in the function What are the guidelines for the key in the max function & is that key related to the dictionary keys in Python ?Thanks for illustration
For every character in , this calls , and picks the character for which  has returned the highest count.In other words, this finds the lowercase ASCII letter that occurs in  most frequently.
The key is the criteria in which the  function will consider a maximum (the criteria used when comparing elements), so when , you're having the following conversation with  :you : Get the maximum letter. : what do you consider a maximum letter.you : the maximum letter is the letter that has the most count.
