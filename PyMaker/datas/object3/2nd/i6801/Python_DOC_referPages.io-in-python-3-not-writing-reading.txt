This question already has an answer here:Possible to call single-parameter Python function without using parentheses?                    4 answers                Python write to a file returns empty file                    2 answers                I am copying an example from a book with a piece of code to write and read a file that has already been created (using utf-8). The thing is that the code I have doesn't print anything when I run it:
You are missing parens in the call to :Adding that then it prints for me in both python2 and python3.Writing to a buffered io (the default using ) may causes writes to be deferred -- especially when writing small amounts of data (less than the default buffer size).  Since the file is never closed, the buffer is never flushed to disk causing subsequent reads to see the file as truncated (the initial state when the file gets opened for writing).I'd strongly suggest using the contextmanager protocol instead (as you won't even have to think about closing files):
