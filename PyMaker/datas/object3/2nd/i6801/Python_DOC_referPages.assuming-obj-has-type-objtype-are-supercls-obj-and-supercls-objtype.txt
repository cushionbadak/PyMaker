In Python, assuming that  has type , are  and  the same? Is it correct that  converts  to another object whose class is a superclass of  which is after  in the MRO of ?What does  mean then?For example, given an implementation of the Singleton design pattern:any subclass of    (that does not further override   ) has exactly one instance.What does  mean, where  is a class? What does it return?Thanks.
According to the docs,  Return a proxy object that delegates method calls to a parent or sibling class of type.So  returns an object which knows how to call the methods of other classes in the class hierarchy.The second argument to  is the object to which  is bound; generally this is an instance of the class, but if  is being called in the context of a method that is a  classmethod or staticmethod then we want to call the method on the class object itself rather than an instance.So calling  means call  on the classes that  descends from, rather than on instances of these classes.  Otherwise  calls behave just like a  call in an instance method. The usage looks more natural in less complicated code:Note that  is required in python2, but an empty  is enough in python3.In your singleton example,  returns the result of calling , an instance of .  It's being created this way to avoid recursively calling .
