When I run the program var_c gets printed out like this: ('hello my name is:', 8, 'and', 3, 'bye') but all the brackets etc get printed as well, why is this and is there a way to get rid of those symbols?If I run the program like this:I don't have that problem
In Python 3.6+ you can use the new f-strings (formatted string literals):
You can format your string to get your expected string output.As commented, your existing output is due to the variable being returned as a tuple, whereas you want it as one string.
 is actually a tuple, so  interprets it like that and you get its representation printed.but you could just tell  to use the tuple as arguments with result:(of course this is theorical, it's better to use  as other answers said)
You should create var_c as a string, like this
with this line, you are making var_c as tuple... to make it string make it likeand it will output
Your program is creating a tuple and you print the tuple:output:Alternatively print like this:output:
That's because you are using syntax to create a tuple!Refer this : https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_tuples.htm.If you just want to concatenate these you can write:
output:Alternatively print like this:output:
