I wrote this code with nested  cases, but I feel it's so ugly and wonder if there's any way to improve it (or any better way to accomplish this).The main concern is that I wanna extract a url/link from a response, and then split it and get the first element. But a_url only exists in one of two(or may be more) elements. I can't do the split directly because a_url may be . I wanna try with  but that seems getting even more complicated.Any better solutions?
I think you could do it like this:This uses the short-circuit behaviour of the  operator:The expression  or  first evaluates ; if  is true, its  value is returned; otherwise,  is evaluated and the resulting value  is returned.It also uses the "early return" technique, i.e. the failure case is handled first, and then the "normal" case can be done outside of any  or .
The best way to simplify this code is to select both classes in scrappy in the first place:
You might want to consider splitting the method into two (later on even three) ones. Because as I see it, the first lines are more of a preparation than of actual logic. Something like this:This way, imho, the code is a little bit cleaner, and you are able to see that you might want to refactor the  method, like the following: From my point of view this could be considered an improvement.Regards :)
