I build an app compatible between Python 2 and 3. In order to provide compatibility between those two Python versions, I use six library.My code uses sockets. Under Python 3 it is possible to create them using  statement, but under Python 2 it claims on missing  attribute.Is there any function of six providing disposable socket? If not, what solution would you consider as the most clear in this case?
AFAIK (by scanning through its docs)  doesn't do much in this case. In Python 2, you could wrap  up in a context manager with the  decorator and supply that:In both cases you use the  statement accordingly:
