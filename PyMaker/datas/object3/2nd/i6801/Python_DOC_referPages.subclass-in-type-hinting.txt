I want to allow type hinting using Python 3 to accept sub classes of a certain class. E.g.:Now when typing the following code:I get an PyCharm IDE hint 'Expected type A, got Type[B] instead.'How can I change type hinting here to accept any subtypes of A?According to this (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/#type-definition-syntax, "Expressions whose type is a subtype of a specific argument type are also accepted for that argument."), I understand that my solution  should work?
When you do , you're saying that  is going to an instance of type . To make it work with type or its subtypes use .From The type of class objects:Sometimes you want to talk about class objects that inherit from a  given class. This can be spelled as  where  is a class. In  other words, when  is the name of a class, using  to annotate an  argument declares that the argument is an instance of  (or of a  subclass of ), but using  as an argument annotation declares  that the argument is a class object deriving from  (or  itself).
I found the soluton. Use:And the desired behavior will be there as noted in the PEP above.
