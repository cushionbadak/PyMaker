Because your pattern ends in . Regex matches are non-overlapping, so the first match  matches the trailing space, making the rest of the string begin with  instead of .  does not match a pattern starting with 
The space is consumed by  after it is matched. Now the next search starts from . But now  does not have a leading space and thus does not match.If you want the space not be consumed then try a positive lookbehind search.
