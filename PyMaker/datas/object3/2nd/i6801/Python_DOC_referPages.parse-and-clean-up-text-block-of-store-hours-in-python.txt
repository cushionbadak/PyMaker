Natural Text
I'm currently scraping a website to pull store hours in the format like below:And I'm wanting to process it to end up like so:I'm happy to take a proposed pseudo-code solution for the sake of learning and building myself. I'm just not able to wrap my head around any sort of solution here.
I think this is a good use case for  - we can use it to group the consecutive days with the same time range. Something along these lines:Prints:Note that this would even work if every single day has a different time range.
Well, first we need to parse (day - opening time - closing time) out of those text blocks. Regex anyone?Now, we need to group days with equal opening & closing times together. defaultdict?Here's my output from opening times only:Now you could iterate over  and group opening times by day, then maybe sort so Monday is always on top?. And you're done :)
Create a class, like - 'WorkDay' or something. Use shorten dayname, like - Mon, etc, use day index - Monday 0, Sunday 6 Convert your input to array of WorkDay items Group the array items by thestarting and ending time Using grouped array, display: lower_idxWork Day - higher_idx Work Day and their start-end times
