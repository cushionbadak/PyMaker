Is there a Pythonic way to grab a property if an object exists on one line of code? Currently in the code below if someone passes in a None type object the code will break, so I need some clean way to check that it is not None, but on one line of code. C# has the  syntax that works really well, so looking for something like that.
You can use the built-in function . It allows an optional third argument that will be returned if the object passed in doesn't have the specified attribute. From the docs:getattr(object, name[, default])Return the value of the named attribute of object. name must be a string. If the string is the name of one of the objectâ€™s attributes, the result is the value of that attribute. For example,  is equivalent to . If the named attribute does not exist, default is returned if provided, otherwise AttributeError is raised.Bold emphasis mine.Here's an example pertaining more to your problem:As @juanpa.arrivillaga said in the comments, another common idiom when dealing with cases such as this is to use .
