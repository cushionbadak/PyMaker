I need to execute the following command in terminal for multiple filesso I created a python script that would take filenames as arguments and use call function to execute the command. But I don't know how to put those "" marks in call pipe.here is the codeI am pretty sure the  is wrong I hope to know the right way of writing it.edit:
Python treats both  &  as valid string delimiters, thus this is possible. Even otherwise you can escape the quotes. In fact you've used string with  delimits with  in your code.After looking at the errors you're getting I would try the below
According to the documentation, you can pass empty strings:args is required for all calls and should be a string, or a sequence of program arguments. Providing a sequence of arguments is generally preferred, as it allows the module to take care of any required escaping and quoting of arguments (e.g. to permit spaces in file names). If passing a single string, either shell must be True (see below) or else the string must simply name the program to be executed without specifying any arguments.You can also pass quotes: "''"
