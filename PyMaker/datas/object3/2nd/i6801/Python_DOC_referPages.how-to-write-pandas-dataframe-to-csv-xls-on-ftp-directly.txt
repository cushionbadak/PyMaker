How to create a .csv or .xls file on ftp directly from Pandas dataframe as I do not want to create one on local machine and then push it on ftp. Many thanks in advance :)
As the docs say:Store a file in binary transfer mode. cmd should be an appropriate  command: . file is a file object (opened in binary mode) which is read until EOF using its  method in blocks of size blocksize to provide the data to be storedâ€¦So, you need to give it a file-like object with an appropriate  method.A string is not a file-like object, but an  is. So:for reference you can refer Python write create file directly in FTP
