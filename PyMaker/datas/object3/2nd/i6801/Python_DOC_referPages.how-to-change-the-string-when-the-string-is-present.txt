On my code, it will find the string  to replace it with  which is wrong. It should be .Here is the code:What I am expect for the two special cases, when the program finds the , it will check if  is present then change the current hour to the next hour and make a new string with AM/PM label, example: change from  to  and replace  with  to make it to show . If the ending is  then I want to change  to  instead. I want to add  in the minute section and again preserves the AM/PM part. If the  have the string  then I want to change it to .Can you please help me with how to fix the  to make it to show  instead and add the next hour?
With Python, slice like  in the slice starting at  (inclusive), and finishing at  (exclusive).So:  is the slice from 0 to ind exclusive, which is the hours without the ":".And indexes are absolute index, not relative. So  is the same as , which correspond to the substring starting at index 2.What you want is:Example:EDITIf you want to do some calculation on time, you can use the  module.Is the format used to represent time like '09:30PM', where:%I Hour (12-hour clock) as a zero-padded decimal number.%M Minute as a zero-padded decimal number.%p Localeâ€™s equivalent of either AM or PM.How to add 30 min:If you want to set the minutes to 0, you can do:
Please don't use the wrong tool for the task. You are manipulating times, yet using strings to do it. Start with this to turn 11:30PM into 12:00AM:Adding  makes the intent perfectly clear.
