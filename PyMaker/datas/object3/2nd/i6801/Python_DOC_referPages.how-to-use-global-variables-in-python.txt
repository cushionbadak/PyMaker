I am using global variables but I can't do it with out any errors. I can't remember how to completely use global variables. If you have any tips please tell me.My code is below
The declaration of your globals is wrong. You declare your globals as a description of how they should be calculated. That will just not work. The global keyword in python is used to bring a variable in the local scope. Then you can alter it. Like this:However, I would put them your globals in a class and add functions that will update the variables accordingly. I think people call this the singleton design pattern, but maybe you don't need this in your little project.
