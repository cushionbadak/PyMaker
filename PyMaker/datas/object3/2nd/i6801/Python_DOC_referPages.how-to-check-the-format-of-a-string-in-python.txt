I want to check the format of a string such as a registration plate, but I have no idea where to start.I want the program to detect whether a string follows the format 'LLNN LLL', where L is a letter and N is a number.I have seen multiple other questions about checking a string's format, but they where for a different programming language.
Pattern matching such as this is solved by regular expressions.A regular expression – or regex – is a string defining a search pattern for use on other strings.In python, they are covered by the  module.As an example, the following uses the set-matching  to search for either an  or a , followed by a . It will return  in the first case, as it does not match . In the second case, one match is found: the  between the s and the s. It would therefore evaluate to  in an  statement.As the Python docs state, there are certain special sequences which match sets or certain conditions. , for example, will match any digit, and  will match any alphanumeric. All of the following find a match.There's a whole host of other features of regular expressions, including the ability to pick out matching groups, lookaheads, start- and end-of-string matching, and various ways of handling counts and multiplicity.
