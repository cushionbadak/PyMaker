I'm writing a quick application to edit Office files using python, however I can't seem to find a good way to repack them once I'm done. OOXML is a good library but is tailored towards unzipping and exploring them, and likewise Powershell and the Open XML APIs both provide compression functions but not in Python.I'm trying to avoid using C Types (I'd like to run this on Linux if I could) but the default zipfile module isn't acceptable to rebuild the applications with either.Is there some library or algorithm available to general-purpose python that I"m missing?
You can use shutil.make_archive to compress your directory:
