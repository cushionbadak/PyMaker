 isn't serializing the object; it's just encoding its attribute  as a JSON object. There isn't enough information there to reproduce the original object in it entirety; the most obvious indication is that nothing in the output of  records what class  was an instance of.The reason  is so much faster than  is that  has to do a lot more.
