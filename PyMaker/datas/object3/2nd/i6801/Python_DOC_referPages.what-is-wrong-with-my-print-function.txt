I am in an introduction to Anaconda class and I need to write a program to determine how many times a dice roll(s) land on a certain amount of faces. However, I cannot get it to print my answer correctly.
Your problem is your print statement. You try to print a string then something called  then another string, and so forth. I think you want that  to be an end-of-line character.Instead of printing something likeuseNote that  is the end-of-line character in Python. My code also uses a feature of Python where you can combine string literals by placing them next to each other. Let lets you see the individual lines more clearly. Your code failed because you tried to do this with a string variable, namely , and you did not even define that variable.
From Python docs: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#printAs you can see, the  is one of the parameters for the  function, and by default, . So to use it correctly, you just have to change the  variable (which may not be directly applicable to your code)Here are some examples:And also, if I am understanding your logic correctly, the same code can be re-written as such. P.S. Rather than attaching an image, please copy and paste your code next time, so that we can copy n paste to test.
