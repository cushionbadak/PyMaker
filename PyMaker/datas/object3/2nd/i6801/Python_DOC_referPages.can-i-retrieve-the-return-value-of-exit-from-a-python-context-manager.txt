I use context manager in python. In want to get some logs back from my  method. So my code logs something like this:So how could I access my_results which is returned from  after (or at the end) of my with block. Is this even legit to return something other the True in the  method?
Is this even legit to return something other the True in the  method?No, not really, but Python will just test for the truth value, so you can get away with it. In other words, if you return a truthy object here, any exceptions will be suppressed. If there was no exception, returning a truthy value is just a no-op. how could I access my_results which is returned from  after (or at the end) of my with block.You can't. The  expression machinery consumed it. You should make it available in some other way; set it as an attribute on the context manager object itself:The  name is available after the  block has completed.This is how the  context manager shares the captured exception, for example.
