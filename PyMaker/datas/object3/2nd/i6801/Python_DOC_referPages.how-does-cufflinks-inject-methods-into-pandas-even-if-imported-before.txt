Cufflinks provides an interface between Panda's  and plotly  in the form of . The first two output examples below do not surprise me, but the third does. Each is run in a new instance of iPython3.In the first we see pd.DataFrame does not contain  by default. When cufflinks is imported after Pandas in the second example, it could easily add an extra method to the  class to provide additional functionality. However, in the third method the  class will be defined during the  statement after  has been imported. How is the additional method still added? This is definitely convenient, as my understanding of how the middle example could work would require always importing the libraries in order, which is undesirable, so I would be interested to know the trick used here.
I'm fairly sure this is because python caches the modules it loads. For example, all of the below expressions are true:prints:
