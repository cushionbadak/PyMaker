I gave the input    , the answer should be  but it is not showing me ,help me out with the syntax
Your loop will run twice for i = 3, and i = 4.The first run:The second run:Now  is 2. It's not clear why you think it should be 5.
As per Python 3, print command syntax is Without semi-circular brackets print won't work.Refer: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html
I think this is what you are trying to do:Note that  i will be 2 then 3 and then 4. It will not be 5 (=c) it stops at c-1.Edit: if you just want the loop to run c times you can say . This way it will run for i=0,1,2,...,c-1.
