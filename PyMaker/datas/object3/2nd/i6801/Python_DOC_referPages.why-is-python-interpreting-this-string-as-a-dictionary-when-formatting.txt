This question already has an answer here:How can I print literal curly-brace characters in python string and also use .format on it?                    9 answers                Format: KeyError when using curly brackets in strings                    3 answers                I am having problems using  with a string which looks like a Python dictionary.I want to generate the following string: If I try to do it as:the interpreter throws a KeyError:I understand that the issue probably revolves around the fact that the string contains , which can be confused with 's .
