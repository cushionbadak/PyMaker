The function my_func gets one argument, that could be integer or a class:and I want to work with both types as one. Can I somehow explicitly tell Python, that evaluation of an object of type  SomeClass, should return the val field of the object, but not the object it selves.That means to get the following code work (somehow):
Not really, no, not in the broad sense that you seem to ask for.  You can overload many operations, not assignment. That's because variables are just references to objects and have no type attached. At any given time there can be many references to your object. It matters how you use the object, not what you assigned it to.Instead, I'd make your class convertible to an integer. You can do so with the  hook; your setter would explicitly call  on the object passed in:If you always use these objects in integer arithmetic, you could add hooks for those operations, such as  and ; again, it is the context in which the object is used that matters.
