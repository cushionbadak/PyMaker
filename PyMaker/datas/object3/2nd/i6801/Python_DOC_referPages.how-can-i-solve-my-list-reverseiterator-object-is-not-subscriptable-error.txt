I've found this bit of code from a user here and edited it to get my game board:This makes a perfect game board for me, 7 by 7:I can understand the code a little bit, I know that it uses a list generator and how it's reversing every other row.. But I would like to also be able to print the player's locations on the board. For example if Player1 was on position 6 on the board, I want to print out a new board but just replace the number 6 with "P1". I am running into the error How can I do this with the above code? Do I need a different solution to draw the board? 
The numbers are generated in the first list comprehension, in the  string:This calculates the number as , and formats it into a column of width 4. If you wanted to show something else here, you'd need to replace that with . That's easier if you first generate just the numbers with out any string formatting: is then a generator of generators that produces the numbers, and the first  expression then produces a list of lists from that, formatting each number or the string  if the number matches the player position.I added a  to the formatting specification; numbers are right-aligned by default, but everything else is left-aligned. The  overrides that and right-aligns everything, putting the  in the same position as the digits would be.Demo:
