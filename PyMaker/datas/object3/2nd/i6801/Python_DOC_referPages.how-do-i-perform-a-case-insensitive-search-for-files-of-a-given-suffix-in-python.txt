I'm looking for the equivalent of , and I don't want to do the kooky  thing. But I can't figure out how to combine the  stuff with the simple  approach. My goal is to not miss a single file, and I'd like to eventually expand this to other media/file types/suffixes.TIA for any feedback
You can try this :)Python's  will separate the string into a list, depending on what parameter is given, and you can access the suffix by , the last element in the list
Don't bother with . Learn to use the easier, awesome  instead. Like so:"One-liner", if you're into that sort of thing (multiple lines for clarity):
The regex equivalent of  is the  sign.To use your example above, you could do this;Though it might be more accurate to do this;which makes sure that the filename ends with  rather than picking up files such as .This is a pretty good example of a situation that doesn't really require regex - so while you're welcome to learn from these examples, it's worth considering the alternatives provided by other answerers.
