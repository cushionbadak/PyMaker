I'd like to form a piece of code that gives a print statement if there is a detection of a nonzero number in an array. The attempt I have is as follows:I also know of the numpy.nonzero command but I'd really like to get this if, else style of printed statements working and I'm not sure how to incorporate the python logic properly. I'm more interested in getting the logic working than I am finding zeroes. What I have seems to produced the "NonZero element detected!" statement regardless of whether or not there are non-zeroes in the array. Any there any ideas on how to implement this? 
You can use the  built-in:Return True if any element of the iterable is true. If the iterable is empty, return False.As a bonus, if the only elements that evaluates to  Boolean-wise is , you can simply do:
You can create a mask using conditionals:You can chain this with a  or  call, depending on your use case. If you want to check whether all elements are zero, you'd do:Or, And so on.You can do the same thing using  as long as you provide two additional arguments:
If you're looking purely for detection of non-zero element in array, why not doing something like this.. or am I missing something?
