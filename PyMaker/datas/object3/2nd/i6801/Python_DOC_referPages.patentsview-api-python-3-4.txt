I am beginner in python, currently working on a small project with Python. I want to build a dynamic script for patent research for patentsview.org.Here is my code:I think I got the right start for the dynamic URL - but the encoding seems to give me a HTTP Error 400: Bad request. If i dont encode, the url will be like www.somethingsomething.org/o:{....} which obviously produces an error.Here is the error:If I encode, i get the same error since all brackets get converted.The API of patentsview works as follows:For dynamic programming I had to come up with all the library names. If there is also a better solution, please help.Best Regards.
The api accepts and returns json data, so you should use  to encode your post data. Then use  on the response if you want a dictionary, or just write to file.  As suggested by Christian, you could simply use , it's much better than .As for all those variables in your code, they compose a dictionary like the one below:  I don't see why you would go through all that trouble to build a dictionary but i could be wrong. However you could wrap your code in a function with  and  as arguments.With  you don't have to use  on your data, just use the  parameter. If you want to save the response content to file you should use the  or  attribute.
