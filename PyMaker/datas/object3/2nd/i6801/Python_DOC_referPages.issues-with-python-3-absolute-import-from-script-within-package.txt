I feel that this is a rather basic issue, so I'm only more upset that I wasn't able to fix it for quite some time. Say I have the following folder structure:foo and bar being directories. In first_module.py I have an absolute import statement referring to second_module.py:Now, if run first_module.py as a script (foo being the working directory), I get this errorPlease, can anyone explain to me why this is the case? I've checked that foo is in sys.path. I've read the docs and a bunch of other stackoverflow posts. I think it might have to do with the interpreter not knowing that first_module.py is part of the package foo. But how can I fix this?
The problem is that trying  would require that your directory structure have a  directory as a child of your current working directory, i.e.:To keep your original directory structure and import successfully, simply change your  to use  instead.why this is the case?When ing, you should think of the dots  as analogous to path separators. Thus, using the following sample layout:If you want to  module  from , you must write . If you want to import  from , you can write  because they're both in the same directory.Note that you'd still need to write  if trying to import from .
