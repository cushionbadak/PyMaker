Natural Text
In case of a connection error, I want Python to wait and re-try. Here's the relevant code, where "link" is some link:Except I still periodically get a connection error. And I never see the text "Will retry again in a little bit" so I know the code is not re-trying. What am I doing wrong? I'm pasting parts of the error code below in case I'm misreading the error. TIA!TimeoutError: [WinError 10060] A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respondDuring handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.ProtocolError: ('Connection aborted.', TimeoutError(10060, 'A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond', None, 10060, None))During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:requests.exceptions.ConnectionError: ('Connection aborted.', TimeoutError(10060, 'A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond', None, 10060, None))
The second request is not inside a try block so exceptions are not  caught.  Also in the try-except block you're not catching other exceptions that may occur.You could use a loop to attempt a connection two times, and break if the request is successful. 
I think you should useSee this similar question, or check the docs.
