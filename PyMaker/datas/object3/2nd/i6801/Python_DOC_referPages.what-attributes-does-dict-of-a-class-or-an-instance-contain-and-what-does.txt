dict is interesting. What you need to understand is how Python looks up attributes, methods, etc. Thing like name are stored in dir(instance), which is not part of the standard getattr of your class. Only explicitly defined attributes and methods are part of A.dict, the other stuff is part of a complex look-up system, the rest is looking at the class, at the subclasses, etc, until you get to 'object'.
