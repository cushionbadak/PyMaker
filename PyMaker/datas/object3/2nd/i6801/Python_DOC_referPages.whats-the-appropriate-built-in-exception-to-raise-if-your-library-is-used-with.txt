Natural Text
I have a simple library distributed as a .py file.  I would like to raise an exception if the library is called from Python 2 instead of Python 3:What built-in exception should I raise? (How do I fill in the blank above?) The closest exception I can find among the builtin Exceptions is NotImplementedError. The DeprecationWarning feels close, but an exception is more appropriate in this case.
I'd use  for this; there is no more specific exception.
