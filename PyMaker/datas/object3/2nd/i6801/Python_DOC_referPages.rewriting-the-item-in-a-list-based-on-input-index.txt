Let's say I have a list:and i prompt the user to input an index and an item. The program will then look up the index placement in the list and replace the element in the list with the user input item. For example:the output will be:Here's what I've tried:I'm not sure why it isn't printing out anything and I'm pretty sure the logic is as written but I'm guessing my issue is within the while loop?
Your while loop never terminates because there's never any increment done for the value of  when  - therefore your while loop gets trapped in an infinite loop and it never reaches the end of the program to print out the list
As pointed out by @MosesKoledoye you can just use simple indexing:Remember that lists are 0-indexed.  If you want to use a 1-indexed list, just use .
