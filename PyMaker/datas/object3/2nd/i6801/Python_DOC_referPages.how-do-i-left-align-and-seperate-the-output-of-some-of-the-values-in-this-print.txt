I currently have the following code which produces the output shown below:Output:How do I make it so that all of the prices are in their own "column" of sorts and are left aligned?  I have tried some methods in answers posted here to similar questions but I can't achieve what I'm wanting to achieve.I've tried using methods I've found on here, but all that they do is extend the gap between the colon and the price by the same amount of each individual column, which of course won't make them all line up.I'm only just learning, so any help would be greatly appreciated!
You can look for the Pizza with the longest name and then fill in spaces for the shorter names between the name and the price:prints out:
you can use  to choose the spacing between each element of the line, which will create the columns you are looking for. The  means tells the string to be displayed 15 spaces to the right. However, the right column will still not be aligned but I'm working on a solution for this, will edit this answer once I find it, but you can try this in the meatime.
There are a couple of changes you can make to simplify things a bit.Using a similar approach to @Igle, finding the maximum length is probably the best way forward but using the built in padding rather than manually adding spaces is clearer.Pre Python 3.6For Python3.6 with fstrings, everything gets a bit simpler as you can add dynamic formatting directly rather than using two steps
