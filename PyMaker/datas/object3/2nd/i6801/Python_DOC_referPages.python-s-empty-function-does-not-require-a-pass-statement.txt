I stumbled upon an interesting and unexpected feature of Python:is a valid function? According to PEP 257, “A docstring is a string literal that occurs as the first statement in a module, function, class, or method definition” meaning that the docstring itself is considered a statement?I would have expected that at least a  statement is required here. The above example contradicts the Python Zen of “explicit is better than implicit” as  states an explicit intent, and a docstring does not.Can anybody shed some light on the intent?
A string literal is just like any other literal. It also works if you just put in an integer:However, it doesn't work if you only use a comment:Even though it's also added as docstring (saved in the  attribute) it's also a function level constant:So the presence of a string literal as only content of a function doesn't change how the function is actually "parsed" and "compiled" itself. Well, apart from the fact that it also got a not-None  attribute.It's actually very handy for s (see for example "Body of abstract method in Python"), where you don't need an actual function body.
