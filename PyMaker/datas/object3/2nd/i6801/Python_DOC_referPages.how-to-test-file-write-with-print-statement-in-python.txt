I would like to test the following statementI tried It complains that  is never called, which makes sense. In this case, what is the proper way to check the content for writing?I also tried to use  instead of the print statement, which passes the test. Is it just a bad idea to use ?
Python 3.6:If you inspect the mock object you can see that the thing you are looking for is there. is being called a second time with  because of the  argument you passed - you can verify this by playing around with that parameter.How to test?
