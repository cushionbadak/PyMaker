I am struggling to pass a list of functions with a list of corresponding parameters. I also checked here, but it wasn't very helpful. for example (a naive approach which doesn't work):Importantly,  cannot be used in , so each function consumes a unique set of parameters.
You could use the function's name as the keyword arguments. When indexing , you'd use  as the key.And now,
You could use  (I assume you use Python 2, you shouldn't use that function in Python 3 because it has been deprecated) to find out which argument names a function has and build a new dictionary based on those:But a better way would be to simply associate parameters with functions that doesn't rely on introspection.
If you want to keep the  function with that exact same declaration and you don't mind each function receiving the whole set of parameters you could do it like this:You just need to add to each  function the  parameter.Python automatically parses  setting the  parameters where it has the value.
Another approach can be like this:Output:I am sure that you can improvise your current code as it gets ugly in this way. 
I like @COLDSPEED's approach, but want to present yet another solution. Pass always 3 values: function, args, keyword args:Usage:Implementation (Python3 syntax):
An approach would be making the 3rd argument of  a positional argument and pass in a list of args with functions list: is used to map each function with the corresponding args.Output:
You can do it something like that, "close" each parameters for function in a list item and then let "foo" split it backwards:
