I've got a simple test where I run a Python asyncio event loop using the  method, and then immediately stop it in another thread. However, the event loop does not seem to terminate. I have the following test case:This test case prints:So, the test seems to block on , waiting for the event loop to terminate.If I dump my threads I get the following:I haven't looked to deeply at the Python code, but  seems to be waiting for work. I guess it's possible that this problem is occurring because I've called  while there is no more work for the event loop to so, but this seems like it could be quite a problematic limitation.Or maybe I've misunderstood something about how this should work?
Documentation says about event loop class:This class is not thread safe.And further:An event loop runs in a thread and executes all callbacks and tasks in the same thread. [...]  To schedule a callback from a different thread, the  AbstractEventLoop.call_soon_threadsafe() method should be used.  Example:Seems to be what we need:Prints:
