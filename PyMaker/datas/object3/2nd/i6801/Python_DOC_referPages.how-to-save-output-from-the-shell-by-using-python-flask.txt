To things to comment here:First, it seems that you'll be just fine by using , a highly recommended library for HTTP requests. With it you could do:Regards to the error you're getting , is because by  you're calling a method that's part of the  app . Another thing related to the error is that you never ran the  app. To do this, include this at the end of your code.But again,  is rather a web framework that it's useful to create web sites, APIs, web apps, etc. It's very useful, but I don't think you may need it for what you're trying to achieve.Further info about  and :http://docs.python-requests.org/http://flask.pocoo.org/
Since you only need to make an HTTP GET request and print the response, you don't need Flask. You can use the  standard library to send the GET request (https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html):
