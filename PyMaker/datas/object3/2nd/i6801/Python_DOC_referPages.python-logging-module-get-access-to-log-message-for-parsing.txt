I want a logging module that parses the log message and sends it to a database for later analysis (I'm using the Elasticsearch database). My current implementation uses the  module and has all the standard debug levels. To do this, I need access to the log message. Is there a method in Python's  module that would get me access to the message?I feel like this boils down to writing a log handler that fits within Python's  module. Any ideas?
Python 2Within , you could add a call to a function like , whose behavior you define.Python 3.2+You can write your own record factory, which you can use to store messages as they occur.You would add your call to  into your .Then, when you use something like , it will pass through , then resume its normal behavior by writing to its out-stream. You may want to consider renaming  to something more descriptive like .
