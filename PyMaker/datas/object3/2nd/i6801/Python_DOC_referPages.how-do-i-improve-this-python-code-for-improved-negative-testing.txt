I am a newbie to Python programming which you will most likely decipher seeing my code anyways. I would like to know how to improve my code to improve negative testing?The Problem with the above line of code is it works fine when I enter the proper value ex: 56 , 48 etc. in months.But if I happen to enter an invalid value, I get an error message shown below:I would like to know how to improve my code to add a proper error message for negative testing for invalid search criteria such as Strings, Special characters, floats etc.I am using Python 3.6 (32 bit version).
As Reut Sharabani mentioned, you could use a  block.You could do something like:Note that I'm just catching a ValueError exception, and not all exceptions.
As Reut Sharabani said, the way to do this is with try/except blocks. For example: Besides that, you're missing some basic concepts of error handling:Do your check before using data. Why are you taking int(ageinmonths), and then checking whether the data is valid?Check to see whether you have what you want, rather than checking whether you don't have what you don't want. There are lots of data types other than floats, ints, and str. What happens if ageinmonths is a list? You're confusing two issues: whether ageinmonths is an int, and whether it can be coerced into an int. If someone types "12", that's a str. int(ageinmonths) will work, because "12" can be coerced into an int, but type(ageinmonths) == str will return True. And "type(age) == str" will never evaluate to True in your original code, because if ageinmonths can be coerced into an int, then age won't be a str, and if ageinmonths can't be coerced to an int, then your code will fail before getting to "type(age) == str".Also, a side note: if two "if" statements have the same code block, you can combine them into one.
