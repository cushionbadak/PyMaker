I have two strings that contains values that should be joined together, that means value one in string1 with values two in string2. Here is the code that I have tried it:I have got this error:
You could use , it returns an iterator (in Python 2 just a list) which spits out tuples with values combined from specified sources:
To address what the actual problem is, this line:Does not mean what you intend.There are two things going on.Iterates over elements of , assigning them to .  in your case is:That is, a sequence of 2 elements, each being a list. So your loop would iterate twice with  being set to one of those lists each time.On top of that, you're also trying to unpack , effectively, trying to assign  with one of those lists, the same as this:This doesn't work because there are more values on the right, than names on the left.The solution is to construct a new sequence that has pairs of values from each list, and iterate over that instead, as other have said, using .
In case the number of fields in each string might be different you can use  for Python 3, or  in Python 2:Output:Otherwise, if you know for certain that the names are always paired, you can just use .
