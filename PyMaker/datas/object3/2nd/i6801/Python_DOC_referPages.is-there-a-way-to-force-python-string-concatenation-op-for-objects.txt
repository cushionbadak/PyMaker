I have some doubts about  having a class and an instance of that class and  concatenating them. The usual is:And this would go to the  method in  and successfully print the line, as I remembered from looking the python docs.But, it is not possible some operator overloading for making possible this?:I'm just curious, because I thought it could be possible but I can't find this in the python docs. I have an object in this circumstances and thought I could do this shorter, and also implement the operator overloading in the root of a class hierarchy saving the writing in the childs.I suppose I can't workaround the  call. Can I?
You can implement the  hook to capture being added to another object:Demo:You'd probably want to implement  too, for when your object is the left-hand operator.However, you should really use string formatting to put objects into strings:orThis calls the  hook on the object, which by default converts your object to a string.
You should adopt the  method for your code. It does that automatically and is far more pythonic then concatenating the string.
