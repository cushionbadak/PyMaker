We can test if two objects are the same, i.e. share the same memory location:by . "is" seems not a function from module . What is it, and where does it come from?I seem to see  in Python in a Nutshell, but now can't find  in Python in a nutshell. Which topic (section or chapter) is  likely discussed?Thanks.
 is a comparison operator, it tests if two expressions resolve to the same identity, so it is called the identity comparison operator:The operators  and  test for object identity:  is true if and only if  and  are the same object. Object identity is determined using the  function.  yields the inverse truth value.So in Python in a Nutshell, you find it in the Expressions and Operators section; search for identity test.
