I tried the below code to create a debug log based on write permission in the directory. If the directory has write permission create the log locally else create the log in home directory.But the code goes into loop 1 i.e. without write permission and checks for the log file in the current directory [/disks/desperado/hang_logs/home.list/$HOME/post_debug.log] instead of home directory as given below,Am I missing something? Share in your inputs!
