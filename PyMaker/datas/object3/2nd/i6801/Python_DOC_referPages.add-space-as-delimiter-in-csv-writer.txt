Natural Text
I am trying to output a combination from my_list 1 & 2Output without delimiter:I want to replace comma with space in the above output.I tried adding space using delimiter as below:Output with delimiter:Above output incorrectly writes quotation marks. This is because "+Lip +Stick" has space in between while defining my_list2. Sadly, i want that space there.Please help me to replace comma with space (as highlighted above in bold).
Why are the quotes 'incorrect'? You wrote a value containing a space, the writer uses quotes to make sure that space is not seen as a delimiter. If you don't want to have quoting, you may as well just write your values directly to the file. If you use the  function, you'll get newlines and spaces for free:You can't tell the  object to ignore delimiters in values; your choices are between quoting, using an escape character, or if you disabled both, an error being raised. Your other option is to split your columns on the delimiter, but that's just more work just to make the  module work, where you don't really need to use that module at all.
you're trying to lure  module into not quoting/escaping the space. Setting  to  and/or  to "empty" doesn't work, raising exceptions like:or has checks to ensure that it cannot happen, for reversibility reasons.So the best way would be to split each value and flatten the list of the tokens obtained with this generator comprehension fed to :full example:now I'm getting:You could also write your list without the  module at this point, since the main point of  is to easily escape chars that could interact with the delimiter and handle multi-line (see Martjin new answer for that).
