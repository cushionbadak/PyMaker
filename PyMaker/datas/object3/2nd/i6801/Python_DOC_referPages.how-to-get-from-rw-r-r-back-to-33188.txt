 has a helper function to go from the  (integer) as reported by  into the familiar "stringy" format (I don't know if this representation has a proper name).Is there a helper function to go the other way?  This is what I tried, but it's producing wrong results.  That's not treating the first character denoting file type correctly, and not handling sticky bits etc
Python is open-source, you can just read the source code for the  module and write the inverse function.See: https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/stat.py#L112Note that I'm being "naughty" and accessing private members of the  module. The usual caveats apply.Also note that the documentation for  is incorrect anyway, since  is technically not part of the file mode, it is the file type . From inode(7):POSIX refers to the stat.st_mode bits corresponding to the mask         (see below) as the file type, the 12 bits corresponding to the mask 07777 as the file mode bits and the least significant 9 bits (0777) as the file permission bits.
