I'm trying to use the pyrouge to calculate the similarity between automated summary and gold standards. When it process both summaries, Rouge works ok. But when it writes the result, it complains that "tuple index out of range" Does anyone know what cause this problem, and how I can fix it? The gold standards are BookRags.txt, GradeSaver.txt, GradeSummary.txt, Wikipedia.txtThe summary that needs to be compared with is automated.txtShouldn't either *.txt or [a-z0-9A-Z]+ work? But the previous one gives me "nothing to repeat error", the latter "tuple index out of range" errorI'm manually setting both directory. It seems like the Rouge package can process the txts in it. 
The problem is that the rogue library never accounted for the case where no matches are found for your regular expression. The line in the rogue source code  is the problematic one. If you look this up in the documentation it says the groups function . Because no matches where found, an empty tuple was returned, and the code is trying to grab the first item from an empty tuple which results in an error.
