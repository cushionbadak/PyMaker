What I'm trying to do is have a 2D array and for every coordinate in the array, ask all the other 8 coordinates around it if they have stored a 1 or a 0. Similar to a minesweeper looking for mines.I used to have this:But something didn't work well. I also had print statments to try to find the error that way but i still didnt understand why it only made half of the for loop. So I changed the second for loop to this:And got this error: It seems like I can't add on the grid coordinates but I can subtract. Why is that?
Valid indices in python are  to . the positive indices are accessing elements with offset from the front, the negative ones from the rear. adding gives a range error if the index is greater than  that is what you see. subtracting does not give you a range error unless you get an index value less than . although you do not check for the lower bound, which is 0 (zero) it seems to work for you as small negative indices return you values from the rear end. this is a silent error leading to wrong neighborhood results.
If you are computing offsets, you need to make sure your offsets are within the bounds of the lists you have. So if you have 10 elements, don't try to access the 11th element. Prints:
The error is exactly what it says, you need to check if the coordinates fit within the grid:Otherwise you're trying to access an element that doesn't exist in memory, or an element that's not the one you're actually thinking about - Python handles negative indexes, they're counted from the end.E.g.  is the last element, exactly the same as .
