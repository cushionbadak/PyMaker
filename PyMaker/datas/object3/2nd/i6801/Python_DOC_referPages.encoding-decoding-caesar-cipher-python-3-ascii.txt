I am learning to code through the introduction to computer science book written by John Zelle. I am stuck on exercise 5.8. I need to somehow modify this solution where the next character after "z" is "a" in order to make it circular. Any help would be great :)
Since you're dealing with -case letters, it's fair to know that their ASCII range is [97-122].A good way to make the shifting circular would be to represent each letter with the range [0-25], which is done by , and then add the key, then modulo the result with 26 so it becomes , we'll then have a result in range [0-25], adding 97 will then get it's ASCII code:
