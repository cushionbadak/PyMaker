I have two python programs.One is kind of data gathering program.The other is for analysis and prediction using Tensorflow.(on Windows OS. python3.5. local )The data gathering program requires 32-bit env because of API it is using.And as you know, the other program requires 64-bit env because of TensorFlow.SoQ : I just need to send a  data to TensorFlow and it sends one integer back  as a return.What is the most simple way to send data each other?thanks for your time.
The simplest way would be to have one program save the data into a file, and then have the other program read the file. The recommended way to do this is to use JSON, via the  module. However, depending on your use case, it might not be the best way. Sockets are a common solution. Managers are also very robust, but are overkill in my opinion.For more information, I recommend checking out the list that the Python team maintains, of mechanisms that you can use for communication between processes.
If you want to connect both programs over the network, may I suggest you take a look at Pyro4?    Basically what that does for you is enable you to do normal Python method calls, but over the network, to code running on another computer or in another Python process. You (almost) don't have to worry about low-level network details with it.
