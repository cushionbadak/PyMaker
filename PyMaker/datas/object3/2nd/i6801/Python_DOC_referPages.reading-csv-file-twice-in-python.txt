Here is my Python code:I can print something of "# Find order employeeID=5, shipCountry="Brazil"", but I got nothing for # Find order employeeID=5. I was thinking of how to reading(selecting) rows in the same csv files more than one time.
You're just reading right through your CSV file, but if you want to work on the data in multiple passes, you should read the contents into a variable. Then you don't have to re-read the file every time you need to do stuff with it.If your CSV file is too huge to fit into memory (or you don't want to read it all into memory for some reason), then you'll need a different approach. If you need that, please leave a comment.
What you can do is simply convert the reader object result into a list :The reader object is like a generator, once you have iterate the values, you cannot begin a second loop to read the values again.
if you do not want to store all your data in a list, this is a pure generator-based approach to iterate over your csv file twice. using :
It's better to read through files once because I/O is likely to be the slowest part of your program.If you need to re-read the file, you can either close it and re-open it, or  to the beginning, i.e. add  between your loops.
This a good case for using the pandas module (you need to install it: )After that, you just read the file once, and perform any type of fitering easily for instance, to read and filter the file more that once, follow this example: 
As @Nick T mentioned above, I/O is considered expensive comparing to RAM access, so if you need to iterate over your file more than once, it is better to save it to a variable.You also can combine multiple conditions in a single for loop, so it performs faster (single iteration):Note that this isn't scalable, you probably don't want to add any more  logic in this block as it becomes not readable
