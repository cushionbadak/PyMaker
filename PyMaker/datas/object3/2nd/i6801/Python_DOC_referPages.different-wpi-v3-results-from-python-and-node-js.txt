Natural Text
I am using Watson Personality Insights to get results from a body of text. The results I am getting from the Node.js Personality insights demo are different from the results I get when using the Python SDK.Python script:Python output: (adding only agreeableness scores to stay under character limit)Node.js script:Node.js output:The input file for both is the same:There is a mismatch in the values received from the two approaches. The values are the same for both the scripts when  the addition of the  attribute does not seem to make a difference in the results received through the Python code.
As you can see, when the params are set for text/plain, Watson API suggest to use the param:  because is the desired content type of the , you can choose  or  format.For example:Important: In your example with Python, you set just to  the , and not use the  for getting the basic pretty printing result like the Node return. I think maybe it is your problem with the return. So try to use  instead of I did the example from the API Reference with Python and Node, and I get the same result.Python example for using Personality Insight:Node example for using Personality Insight:Reference for JSON return with Python.API Reference for use Personality Insights.
