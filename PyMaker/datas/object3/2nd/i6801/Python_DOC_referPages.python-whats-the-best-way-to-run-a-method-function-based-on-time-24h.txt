I have been thinking to run a script/code on a time that I want. Like we say etc. I want to run a program at 00:00 (I enter it in the code that I want to start at that time) meanwhile it's 23:21. So it should wait until that time and then run the method/function or whatever it should do.What would be in that case the best way to run something like this in that case :) ?EDIT: Exemple - I was thinking like to do it through a code. Like etc. I have a code  with we say 3 functions. At the time 23:50 I want function nr 1 to  run. Then at 23:55 i want the function nr 2 to run and then 00:05 i  want the function nr3 to run and all that in the same py file.
You can use crontab.To edit:To add initial time:And it should be like this your file.
sched library is what you are looking for. No site-packages or another utilities like cron are required.
You can do something like this:Mind that it is a very crude solution, assuming in particular that none of â€¦ functions will run for longer time than the period left to the starting time of the next function. Also: you need to start your program and leave it running all the time. You kill it (or reboot your system), you need to start it again.
You are looking for a dedicated task scheduler like Celery.Or to do it simply, you can put a crontab to run a python script to run every minute.Store method name and time to run in a database. When the task runs, it sees if there is any task to be run for the minute,and executes the method specified in the database.
