I am trying to remove duplicated sublists from a nested list that looks like this: The output I would like is the following: Note that basically the last element ['MEMS', 'MEMS', 'MEMS', 'MEMS'] is no longer there. Similar questions have been asked and I adapted the following code from there: My problem is that I get the following output: Notice it also removes the duplicated elements within the sublist. I do not want this because my goal afterwards is to plot a histogram. Say for instance -> MEMS has 4 ocurrences. Therefore I want to keep track of the number of elements each sublist had initially.
If order does not matter, you can use a :Output:If order does matter, you can try this:Output:
Use a  to retrain unique items and order.
Sort the list then make a new list using the keys generated by itertools.groupby().
