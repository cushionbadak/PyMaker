You can use join with a generator, and replace the  with s and vice versa, while keeping any character that is neither (a space in your example) unchanged:Outputs:As commented by @AChampion, you could shorten and improve the above code using:
You can split the binary string and use bitwise manipulation, e.g.:It's simple enough to join this back up:
 is very useful, and efficient, for this:Output:This is also handy if you wanted to apply other transformations. For example the spaces could also be removed with this translation table:Output:Also, use  to create the translation table:or
