Have some array with nested dictionaries:Trying to return first  value where :   expected result: But having exception: What's wrong?
Your code works fine for me using your (slightly edited) sample data:However, if there is no dictionary containing a name that matches the target string:This is because the list comprehension will create an empty list because there are no dictionaries with  set to . Indexing an empty list results in the  exception. It's the same as doing this:A simple way to fix this is to check the list before indexing it:here it is assumed that  can not be used as the value for an .Another, more efficient way, again assuming that  is not a valid  is to use  with a default value:This uses a generator expression which avoids generating a whole list containing the matched dictionaries. Instead it will iterate over the  list only until the first match is found, or the  list is exhausted.
Above program will give outputMatching ID:--> 1Matching ID:--> 2
