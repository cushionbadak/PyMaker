What is the correct python syntax for searching by artist with Spotify's API? Maybe I'm missing something obvious (been staring at this for way too long)  Per documentation, header 'authorization' & param 'q' and 'type' are required.https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/search-item/ What I've tried:  Then I thought, maybe the parameters has to be sent as a list?:But:
A list is a list, not a hybrid of a map and a list, such as in PHP. The  builtin accepts either 0 or 1 positional argument, which should be an iterable. I'd highly recommend you go through the official tutorial.You're probably using the python-requests library. In order to pass query parameters such as the  parameter, you'd pass a  of parameters as the  argument:Note that the headers argument must be in its plural form, not "header".Finally, you might be interested in spotipy, a simple client for the Spotify web API.
@Ilja's answer is good. Alternatively, you can embed the params in the URL (since you have only two of them and both relatively short), example:
@Ilja's and @alfasin's answers provide good guidance but don't seem to work anymore as is. You have to change to the  params to  and add the string . This works for me:
