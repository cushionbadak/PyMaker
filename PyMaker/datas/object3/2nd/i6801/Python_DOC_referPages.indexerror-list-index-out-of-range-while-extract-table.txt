I am extracting data from multiple URL's and putting it into a PostgreSQL database. I am struggling when executing the following code. Any help would be appreciated.here is my complete source code:
Seems like some of the pages are missing your key information, you can use error-catching for it, like this:It will skip this URL if any error occurs, make sure you know what you're doing.
Adding on to the answer from @pythonist since I don't have the reputation to comment; the table in concern ,  will not have data in all pages which is why your code fails with .For. eg: The page http://tis.nhai.gov.in/TollInformation?TollPlazaID=200 has the table, but http://tis.nhai.gov.in/TollInformation?TollPlazaID=2 and many likewise might be missing the same.You could simply catch the error since as mentioned in the answer as it doesn't make any sense to parse the data which isn't' really there.----- edit ----Sharing code:Add rest of the code as it is
