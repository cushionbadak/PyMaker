It is said that everything is object in python, I am not able to understand why following codes work in different ways:Output: Output: Now if everything is an object, then why is  is not printing what  did?
 displays the string representation of an object by calling it's  method.   appears to have inherited the default , which returns a string showing the object's type and identity.  An  returns a string showing the decimal representation of its value.
When you are using  you are asking Python to display visual representation of the object so that we humans can see what it is. To print the object it must have a method  or . For simple objects like strings  or integers  the  method is used when you type .That method is set to display the integer value then.But for more complex objects and especially for objects created by the programmer (you) if you have not implemented your own  or  method Python will just print function's (object's) name and address in memory where that object is located.Once you get to deeper understanding of object oriented programming you will be able to create your own  and  methods which will override then the basic method used by Python and display whatever information you want for that object.Hope it helps a bit.Tomasz Kluczkowski
