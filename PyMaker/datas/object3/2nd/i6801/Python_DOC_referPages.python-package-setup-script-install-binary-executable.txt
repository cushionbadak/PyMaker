My solution was three-fold.I added the program, e.g. , to my package structure so I could add it via the  keyword:.This causes it to actually be copied into the same folder as the main init.py during installation.I made a python script similar to your step 2. However, instead of the relative path, I first import  and use  to get the absolute path to the installation folder for the package. This would look like:I also used subprocess instead of system, but the result should be the same.I added this script to the  keyword of
