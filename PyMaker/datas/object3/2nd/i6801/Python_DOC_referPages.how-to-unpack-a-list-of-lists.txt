This may be a duplicate question, but I want to find out is there a way to unpack a list of lists and make a variable from an unpacked result? I have a data in the file  like: So I open a file and make it a listOutput: This is the output I need for next step of my program. But I can't make this result  variable for using it further. It gives me a  if I try:I tried making it by using , but it gives me incorrect output, similar to what is described in the question zip function giving incorrect output.So is there any way to unpack a list of list and get an output like: if i use  itertools i get: that is not requiredSo the working option is https://stackoverflow.com/a/46146432/8589220: 
Here's a quick and dirty way to parse the string into a two-dimensional grid (i.e.: a list, which itself contains a list of integers):
Let's start with the raw output (I'm just manually going to make the string, but this is equivalent to your read method)This is now just one long string. Let's make it a list of stringsI did ',|' instead of just '|' because you'll want to get rid of the comma too.Now a looks like this:It's a list of strings that look like arrays. Let's turn those strings into arrays of integers. One way we can do that is with ast.literal_eval(). What it does is takes a string as the argument and attempts to interpret whatever is in that string as a Python literal. It doesn't like leading whitespace, so we remove that first with .What this does is it takes each string in , 's it, and puts those into a list.This should return the code you want.
