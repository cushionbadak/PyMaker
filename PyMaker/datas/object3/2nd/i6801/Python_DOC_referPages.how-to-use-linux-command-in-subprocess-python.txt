Your shell will expand the  in  when you call on the command line. Calling the function directly via  causes find to look for literally the directory . You could use the  module to expand the path before passing to : simply produces an array of path names which match the given expression by expanding any s and some other special characters.
You are getting this error because the specified file does not exist. If you run the command directly in a shell, you will get the same response.For example, the following works as expected:According to the docs:If the return code [from subprocess.check_output]  was non-zero it raises a CalledProcessError. The CalledProcessError object will have the return code in the returncode attribute and any output in the output attribute.I recommend you wrap your check_output call in a try..except, and catch the CalledProcessError.Alternatively, if you really don't want to deal with the exception, you could instead execute the command:This will never return nonzero and will only ever contain output if the file exists.EditAs Michael pointed out, the '*' is not getting expanded. However, if you set , it will. Try modifying your command as follows:
