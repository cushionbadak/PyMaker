I'm trying to follow this guide on pipenv and virtualenv: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/ . The problem is, I run into a problem when trying to  (which in my case I think should be  since simply  returns command not found.)Why is permission denied? I'm a terminal noob so bear with me.
Make sure you've added the UserBase's bin directory to your path (follow the Note box at the documentation you were following to see how to do this).The third command you mentioned should just be: .Longer version:I'll go a little more in depth for some of the command line concepts since you're getting started with the command line (and for others who would like a little more in depth reference).You show three commands:This is perfect, in installs pipenv as a user package (not avalible to the entire system)This doesn't do anything.  What you see returned is a "Usage message". It's saying this command expects some main.py program, options (optional because in parenthesis), a command (mandatory) and potentially more arguments. If you see a usage message it means you did not call that program the way its author intended.This should just be . But it won't work until you've added UserBase's bin to your path (you'll get a  error).Your  is where your shell will search for the command you've listed. See changing your path on Mac or Linux or Windows.As the documentation you were following mentions, you want to run , you'll get output something like the following:Now that you know where your  is, add a  onto the end and add it to your PATH.  Again see OS specific instructions but on OSX you can add  to your , run , and your shell will now search that directory when you enter the command .
I had the same symptoms:the problem was that I had a  in one of the parent directories and with different permissions (in my case, created by  while experimenting). Deleting this  resolved the issue. The same issue is discussed Pipenv issue.More details: when trying to install/create a new virtual environment, pipenv looks into all the parent directories to see if there already is a  in there. If there is a , and was created with different permissions (e.g. under  via  in my case), pipenv will not have permissions to write to this , creating a somewhat unclear error message.A tell tale sing is that  prints a different directory name than you'd expect (or prints a directory path when you're just creating a new environment instead of "No pipfile present at project home...")
