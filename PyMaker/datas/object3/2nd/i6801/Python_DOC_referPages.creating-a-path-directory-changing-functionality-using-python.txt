I am trying to create a cd (in terminal) type functionality using python program.here the root path is "/" and path seperator is also "/"Here Path is a class which has two methodsHow can i create a functionality such that i can useto change the directory just like the functionality we get when we use cd in terminal. When i print this i am gettingBut i need to get output asShowing the new path.
This should do the job:What my implementation of  does is it splits both the current and the new path into lists, using  as a delimiter. Then, for every  in the path, it removes the last element of the current path list, effectively going up one level in the directory tree. The  is also removed from the new path list. Finally, what remains of the two lists is joined together, and the result is the new path.Even better would be if you modified Path to store the current path as a list, instead of converting in :And whenever you need the path as a string, you call . A better but quite more advanced way to achieve that is by overriding the  and  methods of the base object. These are essentially hidden functions that every class has, but which python defines for us. The purpose of these two specific ones is to give string representations of objects. The default code for them doesn't produce anything meaningful:However, by overriding them, we can use  on instances of , and we will get a string representation in the exact format we want. The modified class will look like so:And you can print straight away without having to call anything:
You can try this: is now:

Compare to all other answers. Probably this is a better solution. It covered most of cases, but it is still not perfect, because what I do is just using  to cover more cases. my gist python path with test cases and results
