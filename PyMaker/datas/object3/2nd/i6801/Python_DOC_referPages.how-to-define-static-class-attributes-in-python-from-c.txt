I wonder how can I define a static class variable from C++ for Python? The equivalent Python code would be like:I tried to use tp_getset field when defining the type, but it turns out it doesn't work and returns a  in Python, and it doesn't work when called on instances (AttributeError). Furthermore, Python doc says directly manipulating  with C API is unsafe. But it doesn't tell what to use instead. (see here)I deliberately chose  in the example since I'm referencing some other class in it, if that matters.
The  defines descriptors for a type; descriptors are bound to instances when accessed via the  hook, so are not suitable to define class attributes.You can add attributes to a class by setting them on the  object for the type; do so in the module's initialization function (), for example, after finalising the type with  (which makes sure the  object exists):This is untested C code; I'm not familiar enough with C++ to confidently provide you with a C++ version instead.If you want to see a real-life example, see the  module, where the , , etc. class attributes are set.
