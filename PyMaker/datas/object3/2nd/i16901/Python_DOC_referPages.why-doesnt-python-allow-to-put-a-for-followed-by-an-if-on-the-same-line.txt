Why is this codevalid while the compound statement (I know that PEP 8 discourages such coding style)is not?
This is because python has strict rules about indentation being used to represent blocks of code and by putting an  followed by an , you create ambiguous indentation interpretations and thus python does not allow it.For python, you can put as many lines as you want after a  statement:as long as they all have the same indentation level, i.e., no , ,  as they introduce a deeper indentation level.Hope that helps
The reason why you cannot is because the language simply doesn't support it:It has been suggested many times on the Python mailing lists, but has never really gained traction because it's already possible to do using existing mechanisms...Such as a filtered generator expression:The advantage of this over the list comprehension is that it doesn't generate the entire list before iterating over it.
