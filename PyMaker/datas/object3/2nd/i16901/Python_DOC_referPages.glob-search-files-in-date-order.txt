I have this line of code in my python script. It searches all the files in in a particular directory for * cycle *.log. This works perfectly, however when I run my script to a network location it does not search them in order and instead searches randomly. Is there a way to force the code to search by date order?This question has been asked for php but I am not sure of the differences.Thanks
To sort files by date:See also Sorting HOW TO.
Well. The answer is nope.  uses  which is described by:"Return a list containing the names of the entries in the directory given by path. The list is in arbitrary order. It does not include the special entries '.' and '..' even if they are present in the directory."So you are actually lucky that you got it sorted. You need to sort it yourself.This works for me:Also note that this uses creation time, if you want to use modification time, the function used must be .
Using glob no. Right now as you're using it, glob is storing all the files simultaneously in code and has no methods for organizing those files. If only the final result is important, you could use a second loop that checks the file's date and resorts based on that. If the parse order matters, glob is probably not the best way to do this.
You can sort the list of files that come back using  or . See this other SO answer and note the comments as well.
Essentially the same as @jfs but in one line using 
If your paths are in sortable order then you can always sort them as strings (as others have already mentioned in their answers). However, if your paths use a datetime format like , it becomes a bit more involving. Since  does not support wildcards, we developed a module datetime-glob to parse the date/times from paths including wildcards. Using , you could walk through the tree, list a directory, parse the date/times and sort them as tuples .From the module's test cases:
