I have a csv file that doesn't include headers. How can I manually add the headers  i.e. add the headers to the top of the file
As Lutz Horn pointed out, you can use  if you're using py3.2+. If you're using py2.7 like me, maybe this might help:Note:  doesn't have an insert/overwrite row method, so you need to read & write the whole data. Should be trivial for small-to-medium sized filesEdit: Previous code would append repeated data to the end of the file
