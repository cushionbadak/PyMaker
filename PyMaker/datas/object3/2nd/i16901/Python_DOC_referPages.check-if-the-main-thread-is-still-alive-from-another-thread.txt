How can I check if the Main Thread is alive from another ( non-daemon, child ) thread?The child thread is a non-daemon thread and I'd like to check if the Main thread is still running or not, and stop this non-daemon thread based on the result.( Making the thread daemon is not good for my situation because my thread writes to  which creates problems when the thread is set as a daemon)Using python 2.7
For Python 2.7 you can try this:The usage of lower camel case in function names is deprecated and so you should  be using  instead of .If you like one-liners try this:Then call  to check if the Main Thread is active.For one time use, however, you could use this directly without creating a function.Check this page for more info about threading.In python 3.4 a dedicated function to return the main thread exists and so you can use this one liner to see if your main thread is still alive..Hope this helps you.
