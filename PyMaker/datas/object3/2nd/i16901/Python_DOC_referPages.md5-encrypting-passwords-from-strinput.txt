This question already has an answer here:How to correct TypeError: Unicode-objects must be encoded before hashing?                    9 answers                im trying to hash a password from a file and then match it with the password given by the user. it's not ment to be super safe just safe enought so that the password isn't plain text in the file.I get the error it works if i type hashpass = hashlib.md5(b'p').hexdigest()but then it only encrypts "p"How do i get it to encrypt my string inputs?PROGRAM
Encode your Unicode string before hashing and/or open the file in binary mode. Pick an encoding and stick to it; UTF-8 supports all of Unicode:You either have to do the same in  or open the file in binary mode and assume that the file uses the same encoding.
The expression  encodes the string literal  as bytes, not the value of the  variable.  Try . By the way, what you're doing is pointless. Since you're storing plaintext and collecting plaintext input from the user, hashing the two before comparing them doesn't add any security.The right way to approach this is to store the password hash (never storing the plaintext) and hashing the input for comparison. Better yet to hash the password with a random salt; store the salt and hashed password; and hash the input with the salt for comparison.
