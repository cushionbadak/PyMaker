Does there exist any library that can serve a WSGI application as a FastCGI server, for Python 3? (So that nginx could then proxy requests to it?)The Python 3 docs mention flup, but flup doesn't even install in Python 3:
There is now module called . Install it using 
You can use flipflop. It's a simplified fork of flup (contains only the FastCGI part) and works fine with Python 3.
You can use  to solve this problem, as :You may need super user privilge to execute this command.
I am aware of two optionsCherryPy - instructions for CherryPy from Digital OceanuWSGI - instructions for uWSGI from Digital OceanBoth support Python 3 and both can create WSGI workers based on other web app code and can be served to NGINX.As Graham Dumpleton mentioned, CherryPy talks to NGINX via HTTP protocol, while uWSGI talks the 'uwsgi' protocol to nginx instead of the HTTP protocol, although it does also support using HTTP as well. On the application side, both support hosting Python web applications via the WSGI API.
Use  instead is what did the trick for me. has an unresolved issue which has been standing open for a couple of years now.Do not forget to edit the import line in your  script to reflect this change towards using .
