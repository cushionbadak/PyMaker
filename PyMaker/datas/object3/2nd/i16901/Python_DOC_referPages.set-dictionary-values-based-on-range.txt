How can I make this more beautiful (and clear) way than just manually setting each value?like:
You can feed the results of  to the builtin : will return a list of tuples, where each tuple is the ith element from  and .  knows how to create a dictionary from that.Notice that if you give sequences of uneven lengths to , the results are truncated. Thus it might be smart to use  as the argument, to guarantee an equal length.
You can use a dict comprehension together with the built-in function  to build the dictionary from the keys in the desired order.Example:The output is:Note that with Python 3.4 the  module was added. It may provide the desired semantics more conveniently than a dictionary.For reference:http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0274/https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#enumeratehttps://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html
