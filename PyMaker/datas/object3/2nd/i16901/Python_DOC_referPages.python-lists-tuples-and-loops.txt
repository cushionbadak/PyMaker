How are array types (lists and tuples) and for loops related in Python?A. The for statement expects an array type as part of the syntaxB. For loops define an index that is used to iterate through the array elementsC. For loops always use the range() functionD. Array types and for loops are not related in PythonWhich one is it?
The main Idea of a For loop is to have a variable that you update after each iteration. That is very useful when you work with arrays, so this would be the relation you are looking for. However, keep in mind that it is not the only usage of For loops. They are not limited to arrays.
Read Python's documentation.Pythonâ€™s for statement iterates over the items of any sequence (a list  or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence.Notice that it says "of any sequence". This is just another way of saying "array type". 
A for loop can iterate over anything with a next () method. Lists and tuples are just two examples of data types with this next method. Thus, they work perfectly in conjunction with a for loop, but one could imagine another datatype (say, a tree) that could be iterated over with a for loop or a non-for-loop function that iterates over a list or a tuple. Therefore, I think that your closest answer is 'D' -- i.e. they are not strongly related, but clearly the language was designed so that they work well together.
There is no difference on how you go about looping Lists, tuples, dictionarys (iterate key to get values), etc, they all have indexes just like arrays.
