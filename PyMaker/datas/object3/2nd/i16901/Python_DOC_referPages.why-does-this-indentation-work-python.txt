here is my code:I don't understand why the last  works with the indentation. If I typeThen def is_prime(2) returns none? why?
Because in python, a -loop can have an -clause. This clause is executed if the loop exits normally. If the loop is exited by using the  statement, the  is not entered.I suggest you read up the official doc and if it's still unclear, this blog summarizes the concept fairly well.
 and  loops also know  clauses, not just  or  statements.The  clause of a loop is executed when control leaves the loop, unless you have used  to abort the loop.I must admit that this behavior puzzled me at first, as well, but it's actually quite sensible, and a useful feature (see this answer for a good example).
In the second example, the  is on the same indentation level as the , so they both belong together. So for the first item in the loop, you will either return  or  depending on that value; i.e. the loop won’t continue.Now in your original code, the  is on the same level as the . So it’s a  which is actually a special construct:When the items are exhausted, the suite in the  clause, if present, is executed, and the loop terminates.So basically, the else block is executed, if the loop naturally finishes (without calling ). So in your case, it’s the same as leaving the  out:
As others have said, a for loop can have an else clause. Read more in the docsWhen used with a loop, the else clause has more in common with   the else clause of a try statement than it does that of if statements:   a try statement’s else clause runs when no exception occurs, and a   loop’s else clause runs when no break occurs.
