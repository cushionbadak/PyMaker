I've just started learning python from the source .There was a "fun" code that goes as followsNow what it does is that at the same place in my console, it prints the different character one by one. (Try it yourself if you did not get what I said)Basically,it prints  in quick succession, at the same place. If I remove comma from the end of print statement, it prints each character in a new line.Now I want to know, why is it printing out at the same place? And not one after the other?  Thanks
That's because of the , which is the  character in ascii. It basically resets the cursor to the start of the line.The comma at the end of that line is because in python 2.7, the  statement adds a newline. Using the comma, the newline is not added.In python 3.x,  is no longer a statement but a function. You can provide the  keyword-argument to  to determine the ending character, which defaults to a newline, .
