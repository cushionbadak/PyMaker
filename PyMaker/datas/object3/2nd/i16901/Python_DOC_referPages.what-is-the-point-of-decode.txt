With decoding:Without decoding:It appears the difference is the  before the output, which I assume means bytes. Besides that, the output is exactly the same though. 
No, the output is not the same; one is a Unicode value, the other an undecoded bytes value.For ASCII, that looks the same, but when you load any web page that uses characters outside the ASCII characterset, the difference will be much clearer.Take UTF-8 encoded data, for example:That's a simple U+2013 EN DASH character. The bytes representation shows the 3 bytes UTF-8 uses to encode the codepoint.You really want to read up on Unicode vs. encoded data here, I recommend:The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!) by Joel SpolskyThe Python Unicode HOWTOPragmatic Unicode by Ned Batchelder
