Natural Text
I have a file that contains 9 columns and 14399 rows. I want, using Python3.3, to subtract first number in 4th column from the 99th on the same column, then subtract the 100th from the 199th and so one...all in the same column and save the corresponding numbers of the first two columns and the answer of subtracting in a new CSV file. Below are table example and my code attempt (I searched through the questions but didn't find any).Here is my code so far:The code is not working and I appreciate your help. Thanks!
Treat your file as an iterable and it becomes easy to skip rows; we can use  to skip rows we don't need:This also uses  to turn your 4th column into a floating point value. It also uses  (singular) instead of  (plural) as we are only writing one row at a time here.
Without commenting/changing any of the style choices, the reason your program doesn't work is that you access values in the list  that are not yet filled in. Additionally, you read the numbers from the file, but at that point they are still saved as a string.Assuming the rest of the code works as intended (I am not at all sure it does) the introduction of  and the  loop should solve some of your problems.
