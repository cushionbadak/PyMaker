I am trying to replace some  elements (class: method) in a long html-website using .replaceWith. For that i use .descendants and iterate over them to check if the dl-element is what i am looking for. But that works only for 0<= X <= 2  elements which are next to each other. Every 3rd to n'th element in a row is "ignored". Executing the same code twice results in 4 replaced dl-elements in a row and so on.The (very silly) solution for that is to find the maximum of dl-elements in a row, divide it by two and execute that often. I would like to get a smart (and fast) solution for that and (even more important) understand whats going wrong here.EDIT: html-website for testing is this one: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html and the error can be seen in chapter 4.7.1 string methods (a lot of methods available there)EDIT_2: But i do not just use that html-website, but parts of it. The html-parts are stored in a list and and i just want dl-elements to be "removed" if they are not the first html-element (so i want to keep the element if it is the head). All together this is how my code looks actually:
The idea is to find all  elements that has  and replace them with a  tag:UPD (adapted to the question edit):
