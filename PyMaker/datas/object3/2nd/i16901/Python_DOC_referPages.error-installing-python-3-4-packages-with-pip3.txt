I've banged my head many hours trying to solve this, any help would be much appreciated.I had Python 2.7.3 installed, and I never had any problems using pip.I installed Python 3.4 following the README with no errors, and now there are several packages that return errors when trying to install through pip3. For some packages it works fine though.Here's the error I get when, for example, I try http://pastebin.com/xTTK3zepand the log file:http://pastebin.com/23X8cmjUAlso happened when trying to install matplotlib, for example, with the same error:If there's anything else I could provide to help answer the question, just let me know.Is this a bug, or am I doing something stupid?Thanks!
pip doesn't check that the package has been updated for your Python version. It seems that pysqlite hasn't - from the log file:This is a SyntaxError because print is a function in Python 3, not a statement. The only solution to this is to use a package that has been updated, or to update this one yourself. You might consider whether the builtin sqlite3 module meets your needs. As far as I can tell, it seems to be the same module; it is certainly, according to the docs, originally written by the same person.
