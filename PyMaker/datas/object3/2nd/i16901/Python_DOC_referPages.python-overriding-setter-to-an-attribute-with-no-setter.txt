No, you cannot use  for anything other than class attributes;  is an instance attribute, and there is no inheritance mechanism for attributes.Instance attributes live in a single namespace; there is no 'parent instance' attribute namespace.You can still reach the attribute in the instance  object:A property is a data descriptor, meaning that it is looked up before the instance attributes are consulted (see the descriptor howto), but you can still access it directly.
