This is how far I have got with this but I am not sure how to call the procedure again:
A few comments: checks identity (whether the two things are the same object) not equality (whether the two things have the same value); you want .That still won't work, because , like everything you get from , is a string; you can fix this with .Your code doesn't actually change the salary in the dictionary ; to do that, assign the new value back to the dictionary .What values are you checking for? Should the value be updated if the new value is less than or equal to Â£200,000? If you get warned that it's ridiculous, should it be updated anyway? You need to think more carefully about what the logic is. For example, I think your first check should be , but then you never reach the check for .I think you want something like this:You can now call this repeatedly, like:Once you have that working, you might want to consider some input validation in  - i.e. does the user always enter an integer for ? Is  always a valid key? What if they only enter part of the name?
