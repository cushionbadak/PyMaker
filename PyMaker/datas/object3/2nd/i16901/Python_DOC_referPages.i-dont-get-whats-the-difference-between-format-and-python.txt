Confused newbie here. What's the difference between using:ANDBoth work. 
Actually there's a huge difference. The former use string's  method to create a string. The latter, pass several arguments to  function, which will concatenate them all adding a whitespace (default) between them.The former is far more powerful, for instance, you can use the format syntax to accomplish things like:It is similar to  style formats used in earlier versions of python with the  operator: (ie: ) Now  is recommended over the  operator and is the new standard in Python 3.
 allows to convert the same object into a string using different representations specified by .  uses  or  if the former is not defined.  may also use ,  if  is not defined.In Python 2 you could also define  method:There is also  builtin function in Python 3 that behaves like  but produces ascii-only results:See U+1F40D SNAKE. uses Format Specification Mini-Language instead of running various conversion to string functions.An object may invent its own  language e.g.,  allows to use  formats:
The former is more convenient. Imagine if you have lots of parameters, you'll end up with something like this:This is a pain to both read and write. So the format method is there to help you write cleaner and more readable strings.
