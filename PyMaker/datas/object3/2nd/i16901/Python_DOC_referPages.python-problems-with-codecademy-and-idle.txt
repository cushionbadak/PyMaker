IDLE is most likely running it using Python 3, where print() is a function. The below code should fix it.
You must be running IDLE for Python 3.x, in which  is no longer a statement but a function.  Thus, you need to call it as such:Your code worked in CodeAcademy because they are using Python 2.x.
