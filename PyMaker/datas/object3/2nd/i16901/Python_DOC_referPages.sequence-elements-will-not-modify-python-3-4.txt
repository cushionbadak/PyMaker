Okay, no more questions after this:I cannot seem to find what is up with why these sequence elements will not be modified. The index and the sequence are handled properly but the  line seems to be useless. It doesn't change anything in the sequence at all. I know I'm missing something but I've been staring at this thing for a long time now and just cannot see what I'm screwing up. I've changed the elements and it outputs everything properly it just won't change the sequence elements. Halps?
