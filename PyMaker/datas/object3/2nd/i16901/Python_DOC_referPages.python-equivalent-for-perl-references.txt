I am python beginner, so far I have read that python does not have references, if this is true what is the equivalent of following perl code in python?The output of above script is following:
Perl needs references for two reasons:Complex (i.e. nested) data structures in a backwards compatible way. E.g.  would have to keep assigning the array size to that entry, so using an array reference was an escape to use nested data structures: .This problem does not exist in Python. Arrays and other data structures already are reference types, not value types.Indirection. For example in Perl we can doThis can be faked to a certain degree using arrays, the important part is not to use value types. For example we'd need two levels to change some value through a reference.We need only one level if we just need a pointer that can refer to different things.It might be more readable if you use a  class:As your problem is centered around nested data structures, a translation of your code to Python would not require any “array references”. Plain lists will do.
