This question already has an answer here:Why can't I end a raw string with a backslash? [duplicate]                    4 answers                Why can't Python's raw string literals end with a single backslash?                    12 answers                Just a quick silly question. How do I write a trailing slash in a raw string literal?
You can't. A raw string literal can't end with an odd number of backslashes (langref; last paragraph of that section). You can, howerver, write a raw string literal without the backslash, and write the final backslash as an ordinary string literal:Adjacent string literals are implicitly concatenated by the parser.
Raw string literals are parsed in exactly the same way as ordinary string literals; it’s just the conversion from string literal to string object that’s different. This means that all string literals must end with an even number of backslashes; otherwise, the unpaired backslash at the end escapes the closing quote character, leaving an unterminated string.
