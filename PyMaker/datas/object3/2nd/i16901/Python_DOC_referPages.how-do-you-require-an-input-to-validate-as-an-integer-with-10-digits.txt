I am making an ISBN check digit program. However, although I have made my program so that it will only accept a value of length 10, if I input 10 letters it will crash. Does anyone know how to fix this?My Code:Help would be very much appreciated, thanks.
You can use  to test if a string is all digits:See a demonstration below:
Please note that there is not only ISBN-10, there is also ISBN-13 (in fact more commonly used worldwide).Also, an ISBN-10 does not have to be all digits: one digit is a checksum, which can evaluate to the letter "X" (when it would instead be 10, numerically).And while you're at it: check those checksum digits too; they are there for a reason.so I suggest you make some helper functions:and implement your input loop as follows:
You can replace the condition of your while loop with a richer one that checks for digits, for example:
With regular expressions, you can exactly test a defined format for given string.The regular expression here, is . The  means, you are looking for a digit, the  means, you need exactly ten of them. The  marks the beginning of the string and  the end of your string.Using regular expression is not always what you need, and if you're working with them the first time, you need some time to understand. But regular expressions are one of the most powerful tools for developing.
