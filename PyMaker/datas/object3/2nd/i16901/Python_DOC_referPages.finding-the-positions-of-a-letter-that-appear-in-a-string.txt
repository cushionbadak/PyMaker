This question already has an answer here:How to find char in string and get all the indexes?                    7 answers                I have a fairly simple question that I just can't seem to figure out. How would one find what I'm asking for in the title in Python 2.7? Let me explain better: Say you have a string:I know how you would find the position of a letter if it appears once in a string, for example:would return 0.Now if I wanted to find all of the places a letter appears if it appears more than once in the string, I have a problem. For example:would return 1, however, it also appears in slots 3 and 4 too.What I'm asking is how would I be able to determine which slots a letter appears in a string, even if it appears more than once? Thanks for your time. 
If you use a list comprehension and , you can get a list of the indexes at which a certain character appears:
