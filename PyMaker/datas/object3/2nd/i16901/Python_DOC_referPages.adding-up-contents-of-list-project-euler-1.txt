I'm trying to do Project Euler Problem 1 in Python (http://projecteuler.net./problem=1) and I'm using a while loop to loop to 1000:This works but the answer I'm getting is 1000 over. I get 234168 instead of 233168.I've tried checking for duplicates: (following How to find duplicate elements in array using for loop in Python?)but I don't think there can be duplicates can they? becuase I'm using if x % 3  or ...I know this isn't the most efficient method, but still... why doesn't it work?Can anyone help me find why the answer is 1000 over?Thanks
You include  in your loop, while the question ask for numbers below 1000.Here you increment after doing the boundary check, so when  you will still run the loop:This would be so much easier with a  loop:range does not include the last element.
You are including the number 1000 in your loop, because in the last iteration,  is 999 and gets increased once more.A better solution would be the constructwhich includes all x from 1 to 999 and doesn't compare to 1000 on each iteration.
