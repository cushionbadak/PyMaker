I have a file [ Name Age Marks] . I have stored each values of  Name in a list1 . Marks in list2. I have combined both lists using zip function in python:Eg:list3 = ((Steve,32),(David,65),(Ram,43),(Mary,87))Now I want to sort list3 in descending order of marks. So kindly help how to proceed with this. I am new to python.Thanks for your time and consideration. Awaiting response
