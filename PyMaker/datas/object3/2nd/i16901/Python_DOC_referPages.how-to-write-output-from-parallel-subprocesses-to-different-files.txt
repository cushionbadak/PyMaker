I have the following python script. How can I log the outputs of each command separately, i.e. one file per each command containing that command's output?
Just set  parameter to a corresponding file:To redirect stderr output from a child process, you could set  parameter. If  then stdout and stderr are merged. is used to close the files and wait for already started child processes to exit even if an exception happens inside the -statement e.g., if some command fails to start.
