so here is my codewhen I chose 2 - 4, it would output :(AttributeError: 'Television' object has no attribute 'volume',)I don't understand why but if I only write this codeand only choose "4", the code works. Can someone explain it to me why the first code won't work and the 2nd code works?If you don't understand my question, I will explain it to you in a more detailed way I can.
