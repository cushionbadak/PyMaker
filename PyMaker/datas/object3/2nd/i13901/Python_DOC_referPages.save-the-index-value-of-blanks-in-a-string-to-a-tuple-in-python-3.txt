Natural Text
How can I save the index position of spaces in a text sentence to a tuple  so I can reconvert the sentence back after removing the strings?For example in this text the are spaces which causes an error as there are no space in the ascii alphabet. So I want to remove the spaces, convert and then reformat spaces back to original position.
If you want to know the indices of all the blanks, I suppose using  could be helpful:(This gives a  instead of a , but it's not hard to get the  if you really need it...)With that said, looping over a string character-by-character, is not the best way to accomplish most tasks in python.  It's hard for me to tell exactly what transform you're trying to perform on the string, so I'm not sure how to advise better ...
