Given the following data received from a web form:How can I turn it into a dictionary like this?  It's eventually going to be used as JSON but as JSON and dictionaries are easily interchanged my goal is just to get to the following structure.Here's what I have managed so far.  Using the following list comprehension I can easily make sense of the ordinary fields:but I'm struggling with the members list.  There can be any number of members.  I think I need to separately create a list for them and add that to a dictionary with the non-iterative records.  I can get the member data like this:Then I can pull out the list index and field name:But how do I add this to my data structure.  The following won't work because I could be trying to process  before .This seems very convoluted.  Is there a simper way of doing this, and if not how can I get this working?
You could store the data in a dictionary and then use the  library.This will print a json string.Check out the json library here
Yes, convert it to a dictionary, then use json.dumps(), with some optional parameters, to print out the JSON in the format you need:The order of the key:value pairs is not always consistent, but if you're just looking for pretty-looking JSON that can be parsed by a script, while remaining human-readable, this should work.  You can also sort the keys alphabetically, using:
The following python functions can be used to create a nested dictionary from the flat dictionary.  Just pass in the html form output to decode().
