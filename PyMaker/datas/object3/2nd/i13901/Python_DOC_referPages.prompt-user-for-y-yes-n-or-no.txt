I need to make sure that all the conditions are met, with a special case. The student is still deemed 'eligible' even if either the 'before2010' or 'gerequirements' aren't met.However, I can't get the program to work properly. I want to be able to type 'y', 'yes', 'n', or 'no' for the answers to the yes/no questions, but it comes off as an error, because I didn't assign 'y' apparently.
This line will not compile.  If you're trying to match the character  you have to wrap it in quotes to denote a string.  Without quotes, Python expects  to be a variable.So the expression becomes:As the commenters have mentioned, there's several other problems with your code:Prefer  to .Never use , certainly not on user input; in your case you probably want .You should lower-case your yes/no inputs to allow users to type in upper or lower case.
Your full code would be:CHANGESLine 6, changed  to  safer this way, better practiceLine 9 & 14 added  to mrequirements[0] and gerequirements[0] so that even if the user typed a capital Y the test woud still pass.Line 9 & 14 Added quotes to  since it's saved as a string from the input() function in Python. Otherwise the  statement wouldn't return trueIt should run fine now.
