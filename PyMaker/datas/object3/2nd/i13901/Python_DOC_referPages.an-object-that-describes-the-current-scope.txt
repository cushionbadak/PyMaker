An API I use defines a method like this:What it's supposed to do is display the property on screen by calling  and allow the user to change the attribute, resulting in .There is no way I can change that behaviour but I want to use the API to show a local variable to the user and receive the normal feedback from the user?I thought of a builting variable describing the current scope and the variables available, kind of like a local  but I haven't found such thing.Is this possible to achieve?
No. Local write access can be done only directly in the scope or in nested scopes using  (Python3 only).Python doesn't have the concept of "pointer" and the only way to specify a writable place is passing a reference to the container and the "name" of the member (or the index of the array, the key of the dict).What you can do is however create a small object on the fly just for this:In Python3 would be possible to create a magic object instance that when written to the member will mutate the local on the fly (using the new Python3  keyword and either a property or a / catch-all). I wouldn't go for this kind of strange magic unless it's really needed however...For example:
