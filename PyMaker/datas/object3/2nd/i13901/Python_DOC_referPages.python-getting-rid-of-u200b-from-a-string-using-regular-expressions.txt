Natural Text
I have a web scraper that takes forum questions, splits them into individual words and writes it to the text file. The words are stored in a list of tuples. Each tuple contains the word and its frequency. Like so...however, some person on the forum used the character \u200b which breaks all my code because that character is no longer a Unicode whitespace.Printing it out does not produce an error, but writing to a text file does. I have found that  and  do not help, so I was wondering how to use the regex library to get rid of that character. I plan on parsing through the entire list of tuples to find it.
I tested that with python 2.7.  works as expected:and so does strip:Just remember that the arguments to those functions have to be Unicode literals. It should be , not . Notice the  in the beginning.And actually, writing that character to a file works just fine.See resources:The python 2 Unicode howtoThe python 3 Unicode howtoThe Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!)
