I'm a Python beginner and I am from C/C++ background. I'm using Python 2.7.I read this article: A Beginner’s Guide to Python’s Namespaces, Scope Resolution, and the LEGB Rule, and I think I have some understanding of Python's these technologies.Today I realized that I can write Python code like this:That is, var_x is still accessible even it is not define before the if. Because I am from C/C++ background, this is something new to me, as in C/C++,  are defined in the scope enclosed by if and else, therefore you cannot access it any more unless you define  before .I've tried to search the answers on Google but because I'm still new to Python, I don't even know where to start and what keywords I should use. My guess is that, in Python,  does not create new scope. All the variables that are newly defined in  are just in the scope that  resides in and this is why the variable is still accessible after the . However, if , in the example above, is only defined in  but not in , a warning will be issued to say that the  may reference to a variable that may not be defined.I have some confidence in my own understanding. However, could somebody help correct me if I'm wrong somewhere, or give me a link of the document that discusses about this??Thanks.
My guess is that, in Python,  does not create new scope. All the variables that are newly defined in  are just in the scope that if resides in and this is why the variable is still accessible after the .That is correct. In Python, namespaces, that essentially decide about the variable scopes, are only created for modules, and functions (including methods; basically any ). So everything that happens within a function (and not in a sub-function) is placed in the same namespace.It’s important to know however that the mere existance of an assignment within a function will reserve a name in the local namespace. This makes for some interesting situations:In the code above, with that line commented out, the code will print  as you may expect. That’s because  will look in the outer scope for the name . If you add the line  though, the name  will be local to , so the earlier look up to  will look in the local namespace of . But since it hasn’t been assigned yet, you will receive an  (“local variable 'x' referenced before assignment”). The  statement was added in Python 3 to overcome one issue from this: The situation where you want to actually modify the  of the outer scope within the inner function.For more information on name lookup, see this related question.
