Natural Text
I'm trying to analyse a text stream that includes unicode pictograms like these:I'd like to be able to look up the name of each of these characters, so for example any time I encounter the ðŸ’„ glyph I'd like to replace it with an alphanumeric symbol like "UNICODE_LIPSTICK".Is there a data file somewhere that lists the numbers of all of the unicode characters and their names? I'm after some kind of mapping (preferably in a plain text format that's easily imported). Does such a data set exist?I'm actually programming in Python 3, so if there's something built into the language that would do this, even better!
You can use the  function to look up the official codepoint name:
