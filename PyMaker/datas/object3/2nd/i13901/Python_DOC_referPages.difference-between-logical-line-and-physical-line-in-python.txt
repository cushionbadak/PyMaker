I was reading and i got these two terms and i am confused as in logical line it says "The end of a logical line is represented by the token NEWLINE".Newline means go to the next line which eventually ends the line.And in physical line its written "A physical line is a sequence of characters terminated by an end-of-line sequence". so the same thing happens when we use newline with logical line. so what is the difference?the link is 'https://docs.python.org/3.3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#logical-lines'
This is from the Python documentation regarding lexical analysis.Here is one logical and physical line:Here is one logical line on two physical lines:
Two or more physical lines may be joined into logical lines using backslash characters (), as follows: when a physical line ends in a backslash that is not part of a string literal or comment, it is joined with the following forming a single logical line, deleting the backslash and the following end-of-line character.Remember:A line ending in a backslash cannot carry a comment.A backslash does not continue a comment.A backslash does not continue a token except for string literals (i.e., tokens other than string literals cannot be split across physical lines using a backslash).A backslash is illegal elsewhere on a line outside a string literal.
When you write a program , what you see is considered to be a . refers to a single statement what python sees.An example of a logical line is a statement like print 'Hello World!'.
