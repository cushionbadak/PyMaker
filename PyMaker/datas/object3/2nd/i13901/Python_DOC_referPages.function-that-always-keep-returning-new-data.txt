I'm kind of a new to python and i'm trying to run a code for a program, but i'm stuck in this part where i need a Function that always keep returning new data, here's a part of the code that always keep returning a zeros!
When you call  and do  inside it, it returns from the function, and the next time you call  it will start from the beginning. What you want to use are generator functionsYou can use  for this (using  statement) to yield the values instead of  .Example - throws  exception if the generator has been exhausted, in which case we catch that exception and recreate the generator.
Your function returns immediately, and each time you call it you start at  again.You can do what you want with a regular function; use a global and keep incrementing that:but a better idea would be to use a generator function:and you can use that in a loop:The standard library already includes such a generator: the  function does just that. Together with the  function you can pretty much recreate your  loop:If you wanted to continually loop over the the values 0 through to 9999, then you'd write a custom generator function that does just that:and you can use that generator:
Try using a global variable to keep track of where the function reached inbetween calls:
