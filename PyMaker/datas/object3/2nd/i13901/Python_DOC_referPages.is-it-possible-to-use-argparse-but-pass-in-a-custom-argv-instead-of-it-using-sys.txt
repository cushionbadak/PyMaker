Is it possible to pass in a custom list of arguments?More out of curiosity vs. a real life use case, but for example, I might want to convert all parameters to lowercase before having argparse do its job.
Yes. Just pass in the list you want to .From the example in the documentation:
 uses  if you don't give it a list argument. You can load  yourself, and modify it.  If modified in-place it can still be passed implicitily.
