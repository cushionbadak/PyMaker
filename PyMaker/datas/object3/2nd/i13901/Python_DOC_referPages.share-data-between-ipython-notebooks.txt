If I have several IPython notebooks running on the same server. Is there any way to share data between them? For example, importing a variable from another notebook? Thanks!
This works for me : The %store command lets you pass variables between two different  notebooks.data = 'this is the string I want to pass to different notebook'  %store dataNow, in a new notebookâ€¦ %store -r data print(data) this is the string  I want to pass to different notebookI've successfully tested with sklearn dataset : in notebook to read data :src : https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tips-tricks-shortcuts/
IPython supports the  magic (here is the documentation). It seems to have the same constraints of pickle: if the file can be pickled it will also be storable.Anyway, it will work for sure with common Python types. Here's a basic example:Then on a different IPython notebook it will be sufficient to type:
If your data is in a single variable then have a try at saving it to a file using the  magic in one notebook and then reading it back in another.The one difficulty is that the text file will contain the data but no variable definition so I usually contatenate it with a variable definition and then  the result.
I believe that theoretically you should be able to do so with messaging, though I would have to dig a lot deeper to figure it out.Why would you need this capability though?
