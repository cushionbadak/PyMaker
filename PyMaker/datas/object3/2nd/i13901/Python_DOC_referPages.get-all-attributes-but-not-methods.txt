I'm trying to create a function which prints all attributes of my class. It seems to work good but there is a one problem - it prints methods too which I don't want to. Could you advise me how to avoid printing methods?
you can also use the keys from the class descriptor  e.g.
 returns True/False for whether or not you can call the variable like a function. This should even work if the attributes are properties, unless you're doing weirdness like...but you probably weren't doing that anyway.
