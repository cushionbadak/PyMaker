I just found out how to make random numbers in Python, but if I print them out, they all have 15 decimal digits. How do I fix that?Here is my code:*(this just continues down to 0)I know you can do like  but the random numbers Python creates with this method are not saved in any variables. At least I think so.I would also like to know if there is a way of letting a variable choose the amount of decimal points, like  but I tried tha out and of course  it failed.I really got no idea. Hopefully you can help.Thanks.
If you want to take whatever number you get from  and truncate it to the specific number of digits you can use the  function.It allows you to round to a specific precision. For example:
You can also handle float precision using :Where the  can be replaced by how many digits after decimal you want.
I'm not sure what you mean by "fixing it", since what you're talking about is pretty fundamental to how computers perform what's called floating-point arithmetic.However, that said, I am pretty sure you are looking for the decimal module:Best of luck!Edit:Taking a second look at your post, this feels wonky. Is this a homework assignment? Why have the  variable at all, if you're not doing anything with its value? Sure, you check it (over and over and over again), but you're doing the same thing each time.If you're actually doing something differently for each value of , then you should use if-elif-else:But that's ugly, and Python is supposed to be pretty ().I do encourage you to read the floating-point arithmetic link, since this is very important to understand, at least a little.
