I'm looking to do something like this:However, I'm getting the following error:Is there a way to only get the arguments for one argument group?
As your error message indicates, an ArgumentGroup is not a parser, specifically it doesn't have the  method.ArgumentParser objects and ArgumentGroup objects share a base ArgumentContainer class that gives them methods like .  But an ArgumentParser has a lot of additional code.  An ArgumentGroup is really just an aid in formatting the .  It does not affect parsing in any way.To add confusion, a  subclasses , but affects only the  part of the , and affects parsing by raising an error message.If you elaborate on why you want to do this, we could come up with some alternatives that might work.  For example there is a  mechanism, that lets you  one  into another.  Or  that pass parsing control to a subparsers via 'command' arguments.https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#parentsDefining each group in its own  parser, would let you control both the help display, and parsing.  Only problem with parents is that you have to use  at some level to prevent the duplication of the  option.You may also need to use  so the 'group' parser does not complain about arguments that it does not recognize.Here's a way of displaying all the  entries, grouped by argument group.  I'm including the 2 default groups, optionals and positionals.  It does make use of 'private' attributes of the parser.  There's a bit of risk in doing so, but this isn't the kind of thing that is likely to be changed in future patches.producingIf could be more convenient to work with , the dictionary version.   recreates a namespace from a dictionary.Of coarse you make your own  lists,  and .
