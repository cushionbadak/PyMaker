I am a bit new to python so I am wondering if there is a more efficient way of accomplishing something.  Basically I need to create an array of values which come from one of two other arrays depending on a random number (0 or 1)  Currently its pretty easy to implement using a for loop, however I am just curious if there is a more elegant/python-ish way to accomplish this, it seems too clunky for how python is designed:This gives me the correct output I would expect:Thanks!
You could use a pair of list comprehensionsIn the first list comprehension, you use  to randomly pick  or .Then in the second list comprehension, you iterate over your  list and sample (again using ) from the appropriate list.
