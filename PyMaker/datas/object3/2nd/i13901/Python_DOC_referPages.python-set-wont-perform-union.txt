I have a class with a member that is defined:When I perform , using an instance of my class, it works fine:  gives me {'item'} . However, when I perform , where  is not empty, it won't work;  still prints as an empty set. Why is one method () working while another () is quietly (no exception thrown) failing? Even  works, but  in particular won't. I'm using Python 3.
 does not modify the old set in-place, but  does.  returns a new set instead.This should do the trick. See the Python documentation on  for more information.
 doesn't modify the set - it returns a new set. This is clearer if you use the operators for union and intersection -  and  do the same thing (except that the method form can take the union of three or more sets without creating extra temporary objects). For an in place union, you can use the  method or the equivalent (for two sets) form .
