I'm using  to train a  with some "advanced" parameters. When evaluating  after an initial fit, the processing takes a long time, and having multiple cores available I was hoping to get some speed improvements.  (taking any length of a sample vector) should be simple to parallelize.Until now, I tried  to get things working. If I run my script (I'm using ) I get the error that an instance method is not pickleable.This is quite obvious, but using sklearn and relying heavily on instance methods, I can't change this behavoiur.Is there any way to have any sort of multiprocessing that works with sklearn (and instance methods)? I don't mind if python copies the entire memory belonging to the main process (that's manageable) or if I need to submit each block to  from a master program (not elegant, but would do the job).Any suggestions where I should look?
I'm just going to guess you're needing to store thread specific state and is why you were wanting to create a processing pool. I'm not sure if this will work with scikit but I'd use threading.local(). It sounds like you're pretty familiar with Python but here is a link https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#thread-local-data if it helps any.I took a look at sci-kit and there docs. Have you tried using joblib/joblib.parallel?
