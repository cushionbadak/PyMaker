I am writing a Java collection class that is meant to be used with Jython. I want end users to be able to manipulate the collection this way:What I find in the Python documentation is the following methods: and  methods should do the job for bracket operator overloading. method is the good candidate for the .How can I mix both to do want I want ? 
Note that  will really be interpreted something like:Therefore, to make this work you need to implement: and  on ; and (or , which Python will fall back to if  isn't implemented) on whatever  is going to return, not  itself - if it will return something that already implements addition, like the s in your example, you're fine.A quick demonstration:
Your original question had a list passed as the index, so I wrote this assuming that you wanted to access the th element of a 2D list. You can do that by defining your class with something like:Here you are overloading the  and  methods to retrieve or set the th element in your  list when you pass a list of indices . If your values are just numbers, then the syntax  will add  to .As stated in another answer, if you are not simply storing numbers in your object, then you may need to overwrite the  or  method on whatever class your data comprises to get the behavior that you want.Testing my example class:The documentation on special method names gives you everything you could want to know about special methods like this. It can be a good place to search if you are not sure what method you may need to overload.
