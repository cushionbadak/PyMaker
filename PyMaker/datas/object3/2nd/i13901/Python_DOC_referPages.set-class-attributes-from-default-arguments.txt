I would like to automatically set default argument as class attributes.For example, I have (with more arguments, like a dozen or two) :And I want define the attributes automatically, without having to rewrite  all the time in  body.I could use something like :But now I cannot give them default values.What I would like is some function that gives me a dictionary of the arguments with default values :With  being  (but not containing kwargs).Closest thing I managed to do is :But I don't know if there is not some potentially unsafe behavior in this code.
In Python 3.3+ this can be done easily using :Output:
You could define the defaults manually as a dict:
You could always set actual class attributes (you're referring to instance attributes) to hold the default values, and either get them explicitly:Or just leave them to be accessed normally (not recommended for mutable attributes):Either way,  will get you  and  will get you , and you can now easily refactor to a loop over  for the names of relevant attributes.
