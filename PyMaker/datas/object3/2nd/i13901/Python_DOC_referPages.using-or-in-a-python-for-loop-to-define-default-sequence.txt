I have seen somewhere this usage of a for loop:It seems that when using or/and when using the "in" keyword it will select the first/last "usable" sequence in order to run the for loop.I have not seen any official documentation and was wondering how it works and if it's commonly used.
In case of  (or  ) operator, when you do -It returns  if a is not a false-like value, otherwise it returns  .  (and empty lists) are false like value.From documentation -The expression  first evaluates ; if  is false, its value is returned; otherwise,  is evaluated and the resulting value is returned.The expression  first evaluates ; if  is true, its value is returned; otherwise,  is evaluated and the resulting value is returned.(Note that neither and nor or restrict the value and type they return to False and True, but rather return the last evaluated argument. This is sometimes useful, e.g., if  is a string that should be replaced by a default value if it is empty, the expression yields the desired value. Because not has to invent a value anyway, it does not bother to return a value of the same type as its argument, so e.g., not 'foo' yields False, not ''.)Also, in case of  loop,  is actually part of the  loop construct, its not an operator. Documentation for  loop construct here.Hence when you do -It would first evaluate -And returns the  list if its not none or empty, so that you can iterate over that. Otherwise, it would return [1, 2, 3] and you would iterate over that.
No! It's the operator priority!  before …Precedence, §6.15.So  is evaluated before entering the loop. And seq is .
