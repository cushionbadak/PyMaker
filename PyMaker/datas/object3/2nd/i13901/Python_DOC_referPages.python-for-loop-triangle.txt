I'm trying to make a triangle that looks like thisI am trying to use two for loops with one nested. Here is as close as I have gotten so far.I'm pretty sure I need to create a variable, but not really sure how to incorporate it into the loop.
Here you go:
How about short and simple like this:
Here is another single for loop based solution:Giving:
I like Maelstrom's short and sweet answer, but if you want to look at it mathematically, you might do something like this instead:
Use one variable to keep track of the current number and one to keep track of the tier you are on
You can change the triangle height by adjusting the  variable and the starting element by changing .
Just for fun. This is related to a common pattern where you divide a given sequence (here, the numbers from 10 to 54, inclusive) into non-overlapping 'windows', to do some analysis on, say, 10 values at a time. The twist here is that each window is one element larger than the last. This looks like a job for itertools!
Try thisOutput:Explanation:First loop controls the width of the triangle and second loop controls the content and hence the height. We need to convert an integer to string and concatenate. We create proper output in a string variable in each iteration of second loop and then display it once it gets finished.The key thing is to iterate second loop according to the first one, i.e. loop it as much as first does
You could write a generator:Or you could have an infinite generator and leave it up to the caller to control how many rows to generate:
No need for nested loop:
