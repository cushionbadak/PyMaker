This is my bit of troublesome code:I'm trying to print the numbers 50 through 150 separated with semicolons and spaces so it looks something like this: '50; 51; 52; 53;' and etcetera. I don't want to have the last semicolon at the end, but I can't figure out how to delete it. I've already tried the [:-1] and .rstrip methods, none of which I can think of a solution to, beacause they both delete all of the semicolons when applied like so: I'm not sure if I'm coding this incorrectly or if there's just some algorithm of functions I haven't thought of.
You can pass the whole range to  in one go:Note the ; it expands the values produced by the  into separate arguments to , which then uses the  argument between those arguments.The alternative would be to use the  method to join the integers into a long string and then print those values, but you'd have to convert them all to strings first:Here the  function converts each integer yielded by  into a  object.If you must use a loop, then you should loop to 148 and use an extra, separate  call to print the last value, and use the  argument to produce your separator:Using  would only work if you had already built the whole string and needed to remove the trailing  from that string. It won't work when using , as you don't have the whole string to operate on at that time.
How about
