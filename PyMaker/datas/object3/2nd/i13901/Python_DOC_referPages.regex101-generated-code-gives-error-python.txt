Natural Text
I used regex101 to test a simple regex (\D+\n*), but the code generated gives a syntax error. What's wrong? Using python 3.4.3.
The  prefix is not supported in Python 3. Use  instead. Python 2.7:Python 3:This is one of the least helpful Python errors I've seen, to be honest.
Use only  string prefix instead of .
If you import , and use , it seems to work.What exactly was wrong though I do not know.
