I know  object can be changed in place, but  should returns me an independent  object each time when it is called. Now I'm confused about the output:the required output should be:
The problem with your code is that the  constructor reuses the same value for each key. Thus  is evaluated only once.You can use either a dict-comprehension:or, if you know that you will always be using lists in your dictionary, use the  factory:
 is called once, and that same  is used as the value for all keys.Console transcript (you can see the same  for all values):
You could consider using a  from , it might be more suitable, and at the least it is worth learning about.This would print the following:
 is only called once. For older version of Python you can use the fact that you can initialise a dict from a list of key/value pairs:Starting with Python 2.5 you can use generators and leave out the list construction from the previous example:Starting with python 2.7 and 3.0 you can use the, initially rejected for python 2.3, dict comprehension from PEP 274:
