i'm trying to catch the output of airodump-ng, that has a continuous output, and process every line searching for a string. but that doesn't work. so i try the same thing with "htop" command that has the same kind of output, and it still doesn't work.i'm trying this with python 3.4 and python 2.7, both on arch linux and osx mavericks. here's the code (not every import is necessary but nevermind):and it gives me:seems like it crashes at proc.communicate() and doesn't execute the lines under that. i also tried to handle the exception but no way to make it work...[EDIT]ok so it's for 4 am, i learned the try - exception handling, and after a looong time a managed to make it work with htop, following the tips hardly found here (the 2nd solution doesn't seem to work):this is how it looksit works flawlessly. with htop.but not with airodump-ng. it prints on the terminal its output and every 1 second (the sleep() in the while loop) prints [No more data], like the stream is going elsewhere...EDIT 2:solved! the thing was just that airodump-ng dumps data to stderr, not stdout. pretty straight forward try ahah :D
From the documentation:The timeout argument is passed to Popen.wait(). If the timeout  expires, the child process will be killed and then waited for again.  The TimeoutExpired exception will be re-raised after the child process  has terminated.That seems to describe exactly the behavior you are seeing.  You will need to learn about exception handling using /.
