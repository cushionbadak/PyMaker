Natural Text
I am getting False while using isdigiti() or isnumeric() string method to verify an item value which is numeric string from a web-page [text attribute fetched from a web-element]When I am trying to print it got printed like numeric string. When tried to debug it is showing unicode value. If I assign a variable with same numeric string then it return false if I apply isdigit() or isnumeric() method to this variable.Code1:Result1:Code2:Result2:
Maybe the return value of  has some spaces or newlines in it. When the string has space of newlines in it,  returns False.Example -Try stripping the  , before doing the  check.Example -
You have the logic backwards. returns a boolean;  if the string contains only digits, and  otherwise, e.g.So you should write your  statement like this:Probably there is some additional whitespace in the string . This will now be displayed in the error message.If you do find unwanted whitespace, just call  on it:and you could add that permanently to your code before calling .
