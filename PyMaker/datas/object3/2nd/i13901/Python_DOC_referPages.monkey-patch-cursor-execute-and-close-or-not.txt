"Trying to unit test my code using unittest.mock python library". I have code which is running database queries very similar to this:app.py: I have mocked my g.db using the below method, but from here I am struggling with how to mock  and . Any help would be appreciated.On printing   I'm getting Mock name and id, which I believe that means g.db is mocked, but I have no clue how I should mock  and .Do I have to do monkey patching?If yes, please provide a hint how to monkey patch them?If no, then what is another way to mock them? 
You could use patch.multiple:
