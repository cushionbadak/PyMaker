I am learning the  module in Python.However, if I log like thisand interrupt the process with control-C event(or the process is killed), nothing I can got from the log file.Can I save the most logs whatever happens?————EDITthe question seem become more complex:I have imported scipy, numpy, pyaudio in my script, and I got:forrtl: error (200): program aborting due to control-C eventinstead of I have read this question: Ctrl-C crashes Python after importing scipy.statsand add these line to my script:then:Now, the script stops without any info if I use ctrl+C.  does not appear. Of course, no logs.SolvedA stupid mistake!I run the script when working directory is  and want to find log in the script's path.After I change the route like this, all is well.
When you log using , , ..., , you're using the root logger. I assume you're not doing anything to configure logging that you haven't shown, so you're running with the out-of-the-box, default configuration. (This is set up for you by the first call to , which calls ). The default logging level of the root logger is  (as mentioned in e.g. https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#logging-basic-tutorial). Thus, nothing you log with  or  will appear :) If you change  to  (or  or ), you will see logging output. For your code to work as is, set the logging level of the root logger to  before the loop:
For the CTRL + C event use a - to catch the  exception.
