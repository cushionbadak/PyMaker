My site has multiple posts per day.  I want to render a list of posts, but I want the posts grouped by date, not just sorted by date, so that each date has its own list of posts.I send a list of posts to the template, and  is the timestamp when the post was created.  How do I render the posts grouped by date?
You can use  to group the posts by day.  Sort the posts by  in descending order, then use  with a key for the day.  Iterate over the groups, and iterate over the posts within each group, to build sections with lists of posts.
