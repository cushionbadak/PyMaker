This question already has an answer here:Importing from builtin library when module with same name exists                    5 answers                I want to import logging https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html into a document named logging.py .   When I try to import logging.handlers though, it fails because I believe it's searching the document for a handlers function, instead of importing from the module.  How can I fix this so it will look for the higher level logging instead of looking inside the file?
You can do it by removing current directory (first in sys.path) from python path:test:
If you are using a module with the same name as a standard lib you could insert your standard lib packages directory first in your path using  to locate the directory, that will still enable you to use the any packages in your scripts directory:Output:If you want to set the path back to normal you can pop and the import will still work:Output:
