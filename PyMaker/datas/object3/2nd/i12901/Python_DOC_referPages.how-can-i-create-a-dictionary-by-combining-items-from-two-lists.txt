I want to collect elements in this pattern:How to do this in loop? 
 comes in very handy for this sort of thing:OutputBasically this works by unpacking  so that the individual items (themselves lists) are passed as arguments to the  builtin function. This has the affect of collecting the numbers and alphas together. That new list is then zipped with  to produce another list. Finally a dictionary is created by calling  on the zipped list.Note that this code does rely on the order of elements in . It assumes that the numeric value always precedes the alpha value. It also produces a dictionary of tuples not lists. If that is a requirement then using a dict comprehension (as per thefourtheye's answer) allows you to convert the tuples to lists as the dictionary is built:
You can simply  the values of the  and then  the result with the , with dictionary comprehension, like thisYou can understand this, step-by-step, like thisNow, ping this with  will give usNow, you can either use  function to create the dictionary, like shown by mhawke,or use the dictionary comprehension, as I have shown above.
