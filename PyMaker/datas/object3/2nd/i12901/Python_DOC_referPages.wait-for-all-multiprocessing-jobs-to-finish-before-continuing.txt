I want to run a bunch of jobs in parallel and then continue once all the jobs are finished. I've got something likeit works, but I'm sure there must be a better way to wait for all the jobs to finish than iterating over them again and again until they are done.
What about?This blocks until the first process finishes, then the next one and so on. See more about 
You can make use of join.It let you wait for another process to end.You can also use barrier It works as for threads, letting you specify a number of process you want to wait on and once this number is reached the barrier free them. Here client and server are asumed to be spawn as Process.And if you want more functionalities like sharing data and more flow control you can use a manager.
