I use IDLE when I'm coding in Python and really enjoy it's simplicity.  One thing I don't like though is when you need to navigate to a certain line and have to scroll around the place, haphazardly guessing how far you have to go to reach it.  So, my question is is there a way to jump to a certain line number in IDLE for Windows?
Kudos to @MayurKoshtiAs explained in the IDLE Documents, if you go Edit -> Go to Line, a box appears in which you can enter a line number to jump to.  The shortcut for this is Alt + G
Edit then go to line :Dor Alt + G
