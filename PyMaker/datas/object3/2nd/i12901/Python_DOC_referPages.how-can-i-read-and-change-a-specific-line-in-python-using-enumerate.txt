Natural Text
This question already has an answer here:Editing specific line in text file in python                    7 answers                I can go in to the file and read the line using  but I can't figure out how to change the line. The  method overwrites the file and the append method in  will only append to the end of the file. I want to append and overwrite to only a certain line in the file while keeping the rest of the file intact.I don't get any errors in the code above it just prints  in the terminal but it doesn't change the line of text in  to .test2.py will beI need to change 4 to 2
The "line = '2'" only means to change the variable in memory to '2'. The file content remains untouched. Then, you write the '2' to test2.py. It just appends '2' to test2.py.I thought it would throw an error when writing to a file opened with "r+", but it didn't. It just appended.Possible solution (though not so efficient):Before:After:
The fileinput method overwrites the file Therefore:1) For lines you don't want changed, write the original line.2) For lines you want changed, write something else.Or maybe you want to do this:Edit:
You can't change a line directly in a file. You should open file for reading , read all lines, make all the changes. close the file and re-open it for writing than write your changed data. 
I'd suggest use ,  and slice like this:
First, you open it in read () mode. Use write() instead.Second(and more important) here you overrides file contents with .So I'd do:
