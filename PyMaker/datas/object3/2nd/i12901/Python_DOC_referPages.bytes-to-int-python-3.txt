I'm current;y working on an encryption/decryption program and I need to be able to convert bytes to an integer. I know that:Yet I can not find out how to do the inverse. What am I doing terribly wrong?
Assuming you're on at least 3.2, there's a built in for this: int.from_bytes( bytes, byteorder, *, signed=False )...The argument bytes must either be a bytes-like object or an iterable  producing bytes.The byteorder argument determines the byte order used to represent the  integer. If byteorder is "big", the most significant byte is at the  beginning of the byte array. If byteorder is "little", the most  significant byte is at the end of the byte array. To request the  native byte order of the host system, use sys.byteorder as the byte  order value.The signed argument indicates whether twoâ€™s complement is used to  represent the integer.
doesn't work with me I used function from this website, it works wellhttps://coderwall.com/p/x6xtxq/convert-bytes-to-int-or-int-to-bytes-in-python
