I'm currently working on some code that shares some state between processes using a  object. The use case is a bunch of processes that have access to some read-only data in a shared mmap backed array. Part of this involves doing some arithmetic on the underlying memory representation, I'm using ctypes much like in this question to get a the underlying memory address.I have a situation where want to be able to open this mmap file as read only by the processes that only read data. However when I do that I'm not sure how to get the pointer address in that case. The following is as close to a minimal example of this problem as I can make:Running on Python3 this fails with this:While Python2 gives this:Given that I actually want to use a read only memory map how can I do this? I'll change to a writeable mmap if I have to, but I would rather not if there's another way to do this, so any suggestions or workarounds would be appreciated.
Using  I ended up with this:
To obtain a  pointer to your read-only memory map ( instance), which you can then pass to your C functions, the key is CFFI's  (docs).So, if you already have:To call a C function through CFFI, passing a pointer to the mapped memory, do like so:Your C function can now freely read from the buffer, using whatever pointer arithmetic you need, but of course not write to it.
