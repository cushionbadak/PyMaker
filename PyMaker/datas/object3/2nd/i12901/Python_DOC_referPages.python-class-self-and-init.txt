i have the following code and any trying to make a class that generates two random numbers in a list and returns them I get the error  the .Can anyone explain this, I've look at the other questions on self and init but its over my head.
I think you try to do this:To use class you have to create object/instance. Creating instance python calls  and reserves place in memory for . Then you can call its method  and it can use . is use only inside class - it is like words ,  ().
The line  is really strange and it is not clear what are you trying to do here. If you are creating the class, it seems that you want to instantinate it, i.e. create object of that class. To do so, you have to invoke constructor. In your case it will be like (copying from @furas's answer)This creates object  which is instance of class . Then you can call method  of your object. To do so, you have to prepend  with the name of your object.Note that despite the fact that  has argument , it is not given explicitly in this call. This is because Python will pass (a reference to) the object  to the method  as a first argument automatically just because it is method of this object. (Methods are functions that are associated with objects, like  for lists.)See the official tutorial for more details: python 2, python 3.
