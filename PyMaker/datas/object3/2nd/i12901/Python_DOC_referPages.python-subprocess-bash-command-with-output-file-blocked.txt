I have the following code that runs  program and writes the output into file . Right after that I have another function that reads and processes that file (). However, according to the function the file is empty, while in the file system it is not. I am guessing subprocess locks the file pointer until the whole Python program finishes (I might be wrong though). How can I avoid this problem?
 returns immediately as soon as the process is started. It doesn't wait for the process to finish. Call  instead:
