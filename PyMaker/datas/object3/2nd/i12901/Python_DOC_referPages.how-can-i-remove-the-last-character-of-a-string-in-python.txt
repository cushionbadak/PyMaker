This question already has an answer here:Is there a way to substring a string?                    13 answers                I have a file path as a string and trying to remove the last '/' from the end.I've been trying it with regex but it just keeps removing all the '/'. Is there any easier way to just remove the last character without regex?
As you say, you don't need to use a regex for this. You can use .If there is more than one  at the end, this will remove all of them, e.g.  -> . From your question, I assume that would be ok.
The easiest isas @greggo pointed out
You could use .
For a path use os.path.abspath 
The simplest way is to use slice.If x is your string variable then x[:-1] will return the string variable without the last character.(BTW, x[-1] is the last character in the string variable)You are looking formy_file_path = '/home/ro/A_Python_Scripts/flask-auto/myDirectory/scarlett Johanson/1448543562.17.jpg/'my_file_path = my_file_path[:-1]
To remove the last character, just use a slice: . If you only want to remove a specific set of characters, use . If you see the string as a file path, the operation is os.path.dirname. If the path is in fact a filename, I rather wonder where the extra slash came from in the first place. 
No need to use expensive , if barely needed then try-Use  pattern that is capture  last  and replace with  i.e. blank character.
Answering the question: to remove the last character, just use:.If you want to remove the last '\' if there is one (or if there is more than one):If it's a path, then use the  functions:although I would 'add' a slash in the end to prevent missing the filename in case there's no slash at the end of the original string:When using abspath, (if the path isn't absolute I guess,) will add the current working directory to the path.
