I'm currently writing a little script in python (2.x), and there's a portion of the code that I'd like to improve without knowing how to do so.I have a  of s that looks like the following:I need to get the sum of all the integers at the index  and the sum of all the integers at the index . To do so, I currently have:What could be a more pythonic way to do that? Maybe using  and a  function or something?
A more pythonic way to do that would be using the  function along with the  generator and do all the work in a single line, like this:
The most Pythonic would probably be list comprehensions:Summations:Which returns:
You could do  if you don't mind looping twice.or  if you want to do it both at once. This will return a tuple with the sum of [1] on the first element, and [2] on the second
You can use  and list comprehension Or use  and  class from  
Here's a one liner that doesn't use a generator expression. Use  plus unpacking to transpose the list, then run  on all the numeric columns using .Unfortunately it's a little wordier in 3.X since you can't slice a  object.
You can use  but, since the elements in your sequence are lists, you'll need to set an initial value of . In Example:
