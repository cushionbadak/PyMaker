Here is my code:   Error:I have no idea why the  object is not an iterator since it has already included  method in  class.
In short, "iterable" is the object I want to iterate over. It has .However, "iterator" is the object which is used for iteration. It has  or . As any iterator is iterable as well (being its own iterator), it has  as well.You can get an iterator for any iterable with .In your example,  (which should be written ) is iterable as it has an . The generator object created with this is an iterator (as every generator object).
I have no idea why the linehistory object is not an iterator since it has already included  method in the class.Wrong. See Iterator Types:The iterator objects themselves are required to support the following two methods, which together form the iterator protocol:  Return the iterator object itself. This is required to allow both containers and iterators to be used with the for and in statements. This method corresponds to the tp_iter slot of the type structure for Python objects in the Python/C API.  Return the next item from the container. If there are no further items, raise the StopIteration exception. This method corresponds to the tp_iternext slot of the type structure for Python objects in the Python/C API.However you can iterate over , that's because your  method is a generator function, see Generator Types:Python’s generators provide a convenient way to implement the iterator protocol. If a container object’s  method is implemented as a generator, it will automatically return an iterator object (technically, a generator object) supplying the  and  methods. More information about generators can be found in the documentation for the yield expression.
Iterator objects need an  method but they also need to have  implemented:The iterator objects themselves are required to support the following two methods, which together form the iterator protocol:iterator.__iter__()  Return the iterator object itself. iterator.next()  Return the next item from the container. Python 2.7 SourceIn Python 3.x these are the function names:iterator.__iter__()  iterator.__next__()Python 3.x Source
Actually,All these other answers are wrong (except for @glglgl who has an obtuse style of writing). Your generator function  would work as is if you called it with a  loop like soBut because you used  you have to first use  to get the iterator (I presume it just calls iter() on the object) like soas Mr.Beazley points out
