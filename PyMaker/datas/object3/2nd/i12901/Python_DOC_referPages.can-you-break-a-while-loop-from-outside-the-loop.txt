Can you break a while loop from outside the loop? Here's a (very simple) example of what I'm trying to do: I want to ask for continuous inside a While loop, but when the input is 'exit', I want the while loop to break!
In your case, in , you are creating a new variable called  and storing  in it. This will not affect the module level  .To fix this, you need to explicitly say that  is not a new variable, but the one declared at the top of the module, with the  keyword, like thisBut, please note that the proper way to do this would be to return the result of  and store it back in .If you look at the  loop, we used . In Python you either have to use  to compare the values, or simply rely on the truthiness of the value.  operator should be used only when you need to check if the values are one and the same.But, if you totally want to avoid this, you can simply use  function which breaks out automatically when the sentinel value is met.Now,  will keep executing the function passed to it, till the function returns the sentinel value (second parameter) passed to it.
Others have already stated why your code fails. Alternatively you break it down to some very simple logic.
Yes, you can indeed do it that way, with a tweak: make  global.(I also changed  to just  because the former is redundant.)
