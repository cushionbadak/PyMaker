I've written a Python script which should eventually shutdown the computer. This line is a part of it :It makes some sort of a shutdown but remains on the turn-on Windows control pannel (where the user can switch the computer users). Is there a way to fully shutdown the computer? I've tried other  methods with no success.Is there another method which might help?
This will work for you.
For Linux:or: if you want immediate shutdown without  prompt for password, use the following for Ubuntu and similar distro's:
The only variant that really workes for me without any problem is:
Using ctypes you could use the ExitWindowsEx function to shutdown the computer.  Description from MSDN:Logs off the interactive user, shuts down the system, or shuts down and restarts the system.First some code:Now the explanation line by line:Get the ctypes libraryThe  is provided by the  and needs to be loaded via Call the  function and pass the necessary parameters.Parameters:All the arguments are hexadecimals.  The first argument I selected:shuts down the system and turns off the power. The system must support the power-off feature.There are many other possible functions see the documentation for a complete list.The second argument:The second argument must give a reason for the shutdown, which is logged by the system. In this case I set it for  but there are many to choose from.  See this for a complete list.  Making it cross platform:This can be combined with other methods to make it cross platform.  For example:This is a Windows dependant function (although Linux/Mac will have an equivalent), but is a better solution than calling  since a batch script called  will not conflict with the command (and causing a security hazard in the meantime).In addition it does not bother users with a message saying  like  does, but executes silently.As  a side note use subprocess over  (see Difference between subprocess.Popen and os.system)As a side note: I built WinUtils (Windows only) which simplifies this a bit, however it should be faster (and does not require Ctypes) since it is built in C.Example:
This Python code may do the deed:
