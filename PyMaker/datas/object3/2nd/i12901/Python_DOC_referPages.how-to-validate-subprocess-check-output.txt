I am executing commands through subprocess.check_output() because i want the o/p of it to be stored in a buffer.Now, while doing this if command gets failed or if there is any error then it is causing problem for my whole application.What i want is, even if command fails it should just print and go on for next instruction.Can anybody help me to solve it?Below is the sample code.
One way to do this would be to use the  method on a  instance.
