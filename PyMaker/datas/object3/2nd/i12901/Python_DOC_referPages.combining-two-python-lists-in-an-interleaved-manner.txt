I want to interleave two lists. For example:I't like to get an output likeI have created the following script, but it's not working for some reason: Where am I going wrong? I am not looking for random shuffling. I am using python2.x
You can use  and  from the  module:You need to use  instead of  in python-2.x
I have figured out a different way to do this, without imports. 
if you actually want to shuffle them in a randomized fashion the key would be to combine them into one list and use shuffle().EDIT question was updated to reflect the order desired wasn't random.
