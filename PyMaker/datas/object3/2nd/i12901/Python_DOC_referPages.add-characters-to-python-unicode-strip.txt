I want to remove trailing whitespace and some other characters from strip. Here goes example input/output(tabs and newlines explicitly marked):Now I could theoretically solve my problem like this, :This should exhaust every combination that can happen in my database; however, I still would need to change the code if we had more levels of brackets and whitespace. I could solve this generically with loops, but it would be just as ugly and inefficient. Is there a better way, or a way to tell strip not to use whole string, but rather the characters I provided?
Here is a regex version with UNICODE support.Little bit elegant regex than the previous one(use  to handle UNICODE regex patterns):  
You only need to call  once: is a string containing all (ascii) whitespace characters.  will strip all combinations of ,  and whitespace characters.
