I recently ran into some unusual behavior.foo.pyConsole:Console:I'm inferring that  is actually creating two copies of  - one in the global namespace and one inside the  module which cannot be accessed.  Is this behavior explained/documented anywhere?  I'm having trouble figuring out what to search for.This seems like a notable and unexpected consequence of  but for some reason I've never seen it brought up before.
There is no such thing as a hidden namespace in Python and the described behaviour is the normal and expected one. You should read https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#more-on-modules in order to understand better how the globals do do work.
