This question already has an answer here:Is floating point math broken?                    28 answers                This is a part of the code that is relevant:This is the result that i get from the code above:How is this possible? As described in the code i want to compare if iD equals to electionMessage but it never entered that if statement so i started testing with outputs and subtracting and now i get this? Anyone knows why? 
From https://docs.python.org/2.7/tutorial/floatingpoint.html"Itâ€™s easy to forget that the stored value is an approximation to the original decimal fraction, because of the way that floats are displayed at the interpreter prompt. Python only prints a decimal approximation to the true decimal value of the binary approximation stored by the machine"So i guess the numbers are not really equal, they just seems to be on the promptI suggest np.isclose() from numpy
