ThanksYou can see my whole program at https://ghostbin.com/paste/ypdmd.    You can see that if condition should be pass but it's not. To include target list go to https://ghostbin.com/paste/pjuox and download target list and other information. 
You are mixing tabs and spaces. This confuses Python* and may cause unexpected behavior.Use only tabs or only spaces, not both. Spaces is preferable.(*well, not really. Python knows exactly how to handle tabs; it just does so in a way that is very surprising to most users. In particular, one tab is not equivalent to 4 spaces, or 8, or whatever it looks like in your text editor. See 2.1.8 - Indentation for more information.)
