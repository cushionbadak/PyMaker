Natural Text
so i'm trying to pull numbers from a file numbers.txt and add them together.  The program can currently pull the numbers one at a time and print them spaced out on one line.  I now need it to total all of the values. The numbers in the file are:9191517517The total should be 82 but it will only add the two number 17's and output 34def main():main()
You have two problems. The first is as other answers have said - you are reading in strings. You need to convert those to a numeric data type. This is either  or  (or if you are doing monetary values, I recommend using ).Very simply, this can be done like so:Second, you are resetting  to  each time you go through your  loop. Thus, at the end of your loop,  will equal the last value you read.To correct this, pull your  out of the loop:
convert the string to an int:
You'll need to convert  to an integer. At the moment, you're trying to add a string to an integer, which isn't possible. Simply wrap  in , like this:
The error tells you the exact problem: you're adding an  and a . The  is  and the  is . Everything from a file is of type . To fix the error, do .You will also need to initialize  before you start the loop, or it'll keep resetting to zero and leave you with just the final value.Overall, you can streamline the code as follows:This maps the file iterator to s, then adds them with , then prints it with .
You need to initialize  before the loop, not inside it. You're also doubling  instead of accumulating it. Try this:Note that  is modified once before the beginning of the loop and once inside the loop.
