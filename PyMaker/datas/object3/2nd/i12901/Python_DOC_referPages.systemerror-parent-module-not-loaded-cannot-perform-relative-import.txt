This question already has an answer here:How to fix “Attempted relative import in non-package” even with __init__.py                    12 answers                I have the following directory:mymodule.py:main.py:But when I run it, then I get this error:This works:But I get no auto completion when I type this in and there is a message: "unresolved reference: mymodule" and "unresolved reference: myclass".And in my other project, which I am working on, I get the error: "ImportError: No module named 'mymodule'.What can I do?
I had the same problem and I solved it by using an absolute import instead of a relative one.for example in your case, you will write something like this:You can see in the documentation.Note that relative imports are based on the name of the current  module. Since the name of the main module is always "",  modules intended for use as the main module of a Python application  must always use absolute imports.
I usually use this workaround:Which means your IDE should pick up the right code location and the python interpreter will manage to run your code.
if you just run the  under the , just import like if you want to call  on other folder, use:for example:main.pyrun.pySo I think the main question of you is how to call .
If you go one level up in running the script in the command line of your bash shell, the issue will be resolved. To do this, use  command to change the working directory in which your script will be running. The result should look like this:rather than this:Once you are there, instead of running the script in the following format:Change it to this:This process can be repeated once again one level up depending on the structure of your Tree diagram. Please also include the compilation command line that is giving you that mentioned error message.
