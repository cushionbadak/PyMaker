I'm trying to work with CIFAR-10 dataset which contains a special version for python.It is a set of binary files, each representing a dictionary of 10k numpy matrices. The files were obviously created by python2 .I tried to load it from python2 as follows:This works really great. However, if I try to load the data from python3 (that hasn't  but  instead), it fails:If fails with the following error:Can I somehow transform the ofiginal dataset into new one that will be readable from python3? Or may I somehow read it from python3 direrctly?I've tried loading it by , dumping it into  and reading it back by , but numpy matrices obviously can't be written as a json file.
You'll need to tell pickle what codec to use for those bytestrings, or tell it to load the data as  instead. From the  documentation:The encoding and errors tell pickle how to decode 8-bit string instances pickled by Python 2; these default to ‘ASCII’ and ‘strict’, respectively. The encoding can be ‘bytes’ to read these 8-bit string instances as bytes objects.To load the strings as  objects that'd be:
