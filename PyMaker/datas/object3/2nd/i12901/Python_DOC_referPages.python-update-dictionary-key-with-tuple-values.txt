I have a dictionary that has keys with two values each. I need to update the second value as pass duplicate keys. Clearly what I'm trying isn't working out. this just returned a diction with 1s for value 2 instead of incrementing by 1
The expression  doesn't increment anything, it's just the number 1Also avoid using  as a name because it's a Python built-inTry structuring your code more like this: There may be shorter or smarter ways to do it, e.g. using the operator , but this snippet is written for clarity
