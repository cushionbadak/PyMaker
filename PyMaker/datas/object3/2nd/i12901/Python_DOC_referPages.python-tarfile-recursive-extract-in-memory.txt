I have a tar file with that contains compressed tar files.  Like this:tarfile expects a string as the file to open.  Is there anyway to pass it a file object?Thanks.
the definition of tarfile.open looks like thisAnd python documentation says thatIf fileobj is specified, it is used as an alternative to a file object opened for name. It is supposed to be at position 0.so, instead of calling it with positional argument, you can call it with a keyword argument. Pass a fileobj instead of the name.
