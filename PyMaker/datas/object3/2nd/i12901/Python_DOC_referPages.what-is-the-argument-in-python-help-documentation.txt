What does the  mean in Python 3.4's  output for  before the closing parenthesis?
It signifies the end of the positional only parameters, parameters you cannot use as keyword parameters. Such parameters can only be specified in the C API.It means the  argument to  can only be passed in by position (), not as a keyword argument (), something you can do with positional arguments in pure-python functions.Also see the Argument Clinic documentation:To mark all parameters as positional-only in Argument Clinic, add a  on a line by itself after the last parameter, indented the same as the parameter lines.The syntax has also been defined for possible future inclusion in Python, see PEP 457 - Syntax For Positional-Only Parameters. At the moment the PEP acts as a reservation on the syntax, there are no actual plans to implement it as such.
