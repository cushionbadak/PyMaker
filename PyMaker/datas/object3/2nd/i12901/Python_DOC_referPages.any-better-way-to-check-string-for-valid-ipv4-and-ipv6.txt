I have the following task:Identify if the string has a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address using just the default modules. I've found an interesting method using socket module here it is:It seems ugly to have a try under a try in such case, is there a better way?Is there a different module that could accomplish the same in a better way considering the fact that I have to check about 100 IP's.
