I have tornado handler:but I have exception:I want to send my own status code (555), how to do it?
according to the documentation for :status_code (int) â€“ Response status code. If reason is None, it must be present in httplib.responses.you need to provide a reason for custom status codes.You can put an empty string for a reason:
555 is not valid status code, you must use the status code listed here:https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.html#http-status-codesOr, you can add reason when use set_status(555, "my custom status code").
