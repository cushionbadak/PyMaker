This problem has me scratching my head. I am pretty sure I am entering identical values into identical json serialize functions, but it works in one and doesn't work in the other.I am using Django. My full function is below:I first ran it without the print functions and test variables.  would break at the  variable and Django would report that:Exception Value: [{'artist_name': 'Toucan Sam', 'slug': '266697336'}, {'artist_name': 'Toucan Dad', 'slug': '131853573'}, {'artist_name': 'Toucan Bill', 'slug': '566827569'}] is not JSON serializableIt reports that it isn't "JSON Serializable"!So I copy the data directly and paste it into the test variables. When I run it again, the test variables serialize just fine and print just fine, but the final data variable does not serialize or print. The function breaks at that attempt, just like before. Below is my console output:Everything is being copied directly. It looks like it should work! What has gone wrong?
To clarify, this is what I needed to change to make it work:
