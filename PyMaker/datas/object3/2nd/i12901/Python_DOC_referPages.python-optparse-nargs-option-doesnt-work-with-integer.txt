I have a problem with the  option of .This is my code:I need to be able to use the code as:or or without -b flag (case default).The error is:Can someone suggest some solutions? 
The  module doesn't support specifying  as a valid value for the  argument. An integer must be specified, as implied by the official documentation: (default: 1)  How many arguments of type  should be consumed when this option is seen. If > 1,  will store a tuple of values to .However, the  module does support it:. All command-line arguments present are gathered into a list.Furthermore, since version 2.7 the  module is deprecated in favor of the  module:Deprecated since version 2.7: The optparse module is deprecated and will not be developed further; development will continue with the argparse module.The  module also supports specifying custom help and usage messages, relieving one of the need to print them himself.
