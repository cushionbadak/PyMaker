Consider the line from concurrent.futures example ( https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#threadpoolexecutor-example ):Don't get the idea what's exactly going on her executor.submit(load_url, url, 60): url. Evidently, it is set comprehension and executor.submit is applied to every url in URLS. But what technique is used to fix load_url and 60 parameters?? That is some kind of curriyng or partial apply using column operator, but what language feature is it??
Evidently, it is set comprehensionNo, it's a dict comprehension. The expression before the colon is each new key, and the expression after is the corresponding value.
 is a method defined just above ().I guess  calls at some point .So 60 is the timeout (probably because 60s=1mn). The dictionary comprehension applies  to every url with the same two parameters  and , and one changing parameter .
