I´m learning Python. Seeing the module struct, I found a doubt:Is it possible to convert a "string" to "bin" without giving the length.For the case (with chars length)I´m trying to do the same but with unknown length.Thanks a lot!
If you have the string, use  to determine the length of the string.i.e
The Bytes type is a binary data type, it just stores a bunch of 8bit characters. Note that the code with  ends up creating a bytes object:The length of this is 24 as per your format specifier. If you just want to place the bytes-string directly into the file without doing any length checking you don't even need to use the struct module, you can just write it directly to the file:If however you wanted to keep the 24 bytes length you could keep using :In the case of supplying a bytes that is too short  pads the remainder with 0's and in the case where it's too long it truncates it. If you don't mind getting the missing space padded out with zeros you can just pass in the bytes object directly to  and it will handle it.
Thanks to both...My new code:
