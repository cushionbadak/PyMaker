I am fairly new at python (and programming in general, just started 2 months ago). I have been tasked with creating a program that takes a users starting string (i.e. "11001100") and prints each generation based off a set of rules. It then stops when it repeats the users starting string. However, I am clueless as to where to even begin. I vaguely understand the concept of cellular automata and therefore am at a loss as to how to implement it into a script.Ideally, it would take the users input string "11001100" (gen0) and looks at the rule set I created and converts it so "11001100" would be "00110011" (gen1) and then converts it again to (gen3) and again to (gen4) until it is back to the original input the user provided (gen0). My rule set is below:I would greatly appreciate any help or further explanation/dummy proof explanation of how to get this working.
Assuming that  is a valid dict where the key/value pairs correspond with your state replacement (if you want  to convert to ,  would have ), you can do list comprehensions on split strings:where  is your previous state string. IE:you can then use this list comp to change a string itself by calling itself in the list comprehension:you have the basic flow down in your original code, you jsut need to refine it. The psuedo code would look something like:
The easiest way to do this would be with the re.sub() method in the python regex module, re. Regex is a way to match strings to certain regular patterns, and do certain operations on them, like sub, which finds and replaces patterns in strings.
