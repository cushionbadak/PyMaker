I'm using the  object by declaringin my code, and without initializing it, I wroteWhere  is another  that contains lots of numbers.An error happened at this line:How do I fix this?
You may want to try using  instead of using the operator.See this question for an extended discussion about adding two lists together: Python: take the content of a list and append it to another list
Getting 'referenced before assignment' after you initializing data can't happen if you are in the same scope.The possibility is that you are creating a function (creating a new scope) so when you say  it meansSo if you want to refer the global variable use already available (global) data you have to explicitly say  or pass that as a parameter to the funciton.
You have to initialize your array first. Here is a working example of how to fix this problem. 
If you use  in function you need or send  as argument
Your problem is covered in the docs herehttps://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.iaddFor instance, if  is an instance of a class with an   method,  is equivalent to  .So you see  is being rebound (to itself in this case), but it still counts as an assignment.Since  appears inside a function scope where  has not been declared to be , a local variable called  is assumed.
