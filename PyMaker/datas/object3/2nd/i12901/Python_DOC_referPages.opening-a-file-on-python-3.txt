You can also use This will close the file when it's done as well
 doesn't open a file in a text editor (which is what I'm assuming you thought it does). Instead, it prepares the data for access via python. As stated in the comment below your Question already: you have to do something with the file.Try:Read up on the documentation for open() here.Also, using the  statement will improve your codes readability, as well as handling the closing of the file for you. .
Add following print stmt to see detail about filewith open(fileName) as file:
