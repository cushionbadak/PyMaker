So this code currently takes the user input and says whether the user guessed the random integer, or if they should guess higher/lower. I want to edit the code to now say whether the user input is within 5,10,15, etc of the random integer. So if the random integer was 30, and the user inputs 20, the program would say something like "You are within 10; guess higher."Any advice? I'm extremely new to python, so please respond with more simple methods if possible.Thanks.PS: Oh, preferably without the use of modules, mainly because I'm still learning.
I think this does what you want, and it cuts down on the if chains a little:Let's look. at the last  statement a little further and the final  line.  We are checking to see if , defined above (line 15)  is less than 0 (negative).  If it is less than zero, then we make the variable  equal to the string "higher," because the next guess needs to be larger than the last one ( was larger than .  If  is not negative, then it is positive, because we already eliminated the we eliminate the possibility of 0 using:So, if guess_error is positive, we know that  was larger than  and we set  equal to the string "lower."  Finally, we print out everything that we have found:I am using an older version of formatting where  and  are placeholders for integer and string, respectively.  I then define what should be formatted there using , which simply means to put  in for the integer and  in for the string.  Keep in mind, we found  in  right above the if statement. I know that is all long, but I did not know how much detail you needed!
Update: I see you ask to do it without modules.  Here's a solution:-- original answer:You can do this with numpy's  function.For instance:
A solution using the modulo operator:
