Natural Text
I need to write data to a textfile as a table. Sort of like a database. The header has Drivers, Cars, Teams, Grids, Fastest Lap, Race Time and Points. When I try to write the data that goes under it the don't line up. As some drivers names are longer than others. It looks a bit like this: Only 2 of the names actually align with the header. I am only trying to solve the issue with Drivers for now once I figure that out I should be able to gets all the other headers lined up. Using a for loop through the array of dictionaries I set x to equal the len of the drivers name and 22 is the length of the longest name(18) plus a few spaces. Any way of making them line up?
You could use format string syntax:You can also change the alignment:and if you want more flexibility with your column size, you can parametrize that as well:
On top of the answer provided by Tim, you could opt to use Tabulate which is very easy to use and customise. This provides support for multiple different database styles too. I prefer this to simply using format because it allows me to completely change the output style by configuring the  argument.
