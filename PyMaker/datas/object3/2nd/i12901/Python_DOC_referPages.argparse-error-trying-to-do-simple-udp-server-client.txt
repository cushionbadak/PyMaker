I've been trying this code and getting this message from the console:I can't decide what's wrong, this is the code:
The program is using the argparse module's  class, which assumes by default that positional arguments are required, so you can't omit them as you have. The argparse tutorial offers a good definition of a positional argument: [A positional argument is] named so because the program should know what to do with the value, solely based on where it appears on the command line. This concept is more relevant to a command like cp, whose most basic usage is cp SRC DEST. The first position is what you want copied, and the second position is where you want it copied to.In this case, when calling , you've left out the positional argument named , which is defined near the end of your program:(Because the first argument () doesn't start with a  (like ),  registers it as a positional argument.)The  keyword argument to  requires an iterable containing the possible values to supply, so the author of the program passes , a dictionary defined as:This is actually pretty clever; iterating over a dictionary yields the keys, so argparse allows  and  as values for . So, to fix this error, you should pass either  or  as an argument to the program, thereby supplying a value for . Even better, you can check out the argparse tutorial. (I hate telling people to read the manual, but I think it might be helpful)tl;dr: instead of:you should try one of the following:
