Natural Text
I'm trying to create a sequence of lists with different variable names that correspond to different lines of a text file. My current code requires me to hard-code the number of lines in the file:In this case, I would have to continue up to 20, which isn't that bad, but I imagine that there's an easier way that I'm not aware of.This is for a ProjectEuler problem, but there aren't any spoilers, and also I'm looking for advice on this specific task, rather than my strategy as a whole. Thanks!
I am not sure why you need different variable names for each line when you can have an array with all lines at the end.You can now simply access the individual lines by line[0], line[1] and so on.
You can use  or  to define scope pointers names. Also  builtin function allows you to iterate through both index and value of collection. Knowing this you can do something like:
Why not use a dict and update the locals of the script?This way you will have  available within the scope of the script.For explaining:In python everything (almost) is an object, each object have a dict with the variables defining it, a class will have the  propertys in its dict, as well as functions for example. Even a module or script have its variables stored in a dictionary, you can access that dict by  for global variables that can be accesed by the outer scope or access by  for variables in the inner scope. As this are stored in a dictionary you can manage it just like it, calling any method available for any other dictionary object. So, for example:Is creating a variable  wich stores a  in the scope of the module. 
I assumed you want to read first 20 lines from the file-Try, -It is just for 3 lines extend this for 20 linesOutput:If you want just flattened list-Output-EDIT-To refenence lines into the content use .Output-
