It looks simple, but I could not find a solution.I display the problem below with the simplest example I could come up with.(My classes are quiet more complex ;) )file A.pyfile B.py don't match with import Awith  -> callback : cannot find _AIt only works when I do -But and logically A functions are executed 2 times.Thanks to all
There is no need to first , then . If you need Y (even if  is ) do just . This might be the cause of 2 times execution.Also why have cyclic dependencies between modules ? Maybe they should be in one file then?
Because of cyclic dependency you are facing the import error, you can continue your work as: File A.py:Also, you should either use  or  and if you use the later you should call the class directly as:  not as: , this calling convention will be used for former import style(), for better understanding of external use of classes and module, you can refer following link: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html
