I am using the Python 3.5  module with this code:I want to return . I have tried the following regex, but keep getting errors such as or the empty result  for:How can I accomplish this operation?
The problem with your regular expression is very simple, remove the  character in your second regular expression. You just need  that matches zero or more characters.  together means a lazy quantifier that matches as little as possible, so if you use , it means "zero or more any characters, but as few as possible". As for the first regular expression, the  does not have a preceding atom to which it could apply to, hence the error.In general case, you should rather use the  module as in kennytm's answer there.
You shouldn't use regex for this. Instead, use the  module (or  if you are sure the script will only run on Windows):
