I am in the process of developing a troubleshooting application in Python that will allow a user to input a query. This query would contain the brand of the device and the issue or symptom of their problem. I am in the process of writing a script which essentially dissects the query to find an appropriate solution following keywords and brands of the device.Current Code:    #Import Modules    import warningsCurrently, the script will identify a brand, but I am not certain on how to check for a wide number of keywords in order to follow a solution route. I would expect the solution to follow the pattern of having selected a brand a secondary array specific for the brand which would contain a number of potential errors. Each of these errors could have a solution defined.I would appreciate any insight,Thanks,Sam
Run this I hope this gives you some ideas. You need to fix your indentation for the  function.
