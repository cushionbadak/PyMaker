I have some strings with numbers inside like '0.9999965341102361' and '3.465889763814134E-6'. I know how to convert them to a float value; however, when I do, they become 9.99996534e-01 and 3.46588976e-06. How can I preserve the full length of the number while still converting to a float? In other words, I don't want to have to round off the original number. Is there a way to do this - can I set the float length equal to 20 or something?It's been a while since I actually took python in school, so I may be forgetting something rather obvious.Thank you.
Use the decimal module:decimal.Decimal objects in a numpy arrayLooks like a numpy array of type object will hold decimal.Decimal objects.  Depending on what you want to do they might work.
You can't get better than your machine float, which is 64 bit or 32 bit. My linux laptop has 64 bit words, and the number is preserved:
