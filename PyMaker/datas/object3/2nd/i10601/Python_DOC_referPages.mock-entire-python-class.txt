I'm trying to make a simple test in python, but I'm not able to figure it out how to accomplish the mocking process.This is the class and def code:And this is my test for the execute function:Since the execute method try to make a connection, I need to mock that, I don't want to make a real connection, just return something mock. How can I make that? I'm used to do testing in Java but I never did on python..
First it is very important to understand that you always need to Mock where it the thing you are trying to mock out is used as stated in the  documentation.The basic principle is that you patch where an object is looked up,  which is not necessarily the same place as where it is defined.Next what you would need to do is to return a  instance as  of the patched object. So to summarize this you would need to use the following sequence.Patch Objectprepare  to be usedreturn the  we've just created as Here a quick example of a project.connection.py  (Class we would like to Mock)file.py (Where the Class is used)tests/test_file.py
