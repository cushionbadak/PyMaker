The list can be deeper, or shallower, but say I have a list of depth 2 as follows:I want to write a function, , such that it would return the following new list:Essentially I am mimicking depth first search, where the lists are nodes. I want the function to work with depth=n, where n is any arbitrary integer. What is the most pythonic way to achieve this?My recursive code is as follows:How would I go about solving this iteratively? 
You can use itertools.product:This gives:
