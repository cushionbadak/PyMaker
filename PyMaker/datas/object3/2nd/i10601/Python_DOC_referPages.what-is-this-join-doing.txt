Natural Text
I just installed retext via pip. I have to download icons for it but I realise it doesn't work (no icons on the menu) unless i run "retext" in the folder of retext.I tried to fix it but my python skills are not very strong.At the moment, I force the icon_path to have the path I want.Can someone enlighten me how this line works?Thanks.

The return value is the concatenation of path and any members of  with exactly one directory separator () following each non-empty part except the last, meaning that the result will only end in a separator if the last part is empty. If a component is an absolute path, all previous components are thrown away and joining continues from the absolute path component.It is imported here:So, the line in question:The ... is a List Comprehension that builds a list of the results of  applied to each directory in the  list.So, if  contained:Then:Would produce:The problem with setting:Is that it's being overwritten in the  loop, so unless a proper path is not found, it will be overwritten.
