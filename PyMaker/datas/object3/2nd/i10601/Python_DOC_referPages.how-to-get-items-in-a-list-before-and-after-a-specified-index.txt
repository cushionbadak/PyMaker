Suppose I have the list  and index  -- I want to iterate over , excluding . Is there a way I can use  to split the list, something like , where I would be given a new list of  when ran with ?Code I'm trying to fit this into:
Use  in order to have access to index at iteration time.In this case you can escape the intended index or if you have a set of indices you can check the membership with :If you want to remove an item in a certain index you can use  statement:If you want to create a new list by removing that item and preserve teh main list you can use a simple slicing:
iterate y over the index:
Probably not the most elegant solution, but this might work:prints:
Well, it may seem scary but that's a one-liner that does the work:If you look at it slowly, it's not so complicated:The  give all the possible options to the  combination:You wrap it with  and  so you can get each combination together with the missing value:Then you convert  to a  so you can add the missing value:And finaly you use  to get the desired result.
