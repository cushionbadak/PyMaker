Natural Text
This works in Python 2.7 but not in 3.5.I'm trying to open this file, input_text is a path value from argparse.I get this error.I gather that Python 3.5 uses "open" instead of "file", but I don't quite get how to use open in a situation like this.
Your original code works in Python 2.7 but it is bad style there. The  for this use was deprecated long time ago in favour of using , and instead of calling the  passing the file as the argument you should have just called the  method on the returned object.The correct way to write the code you did on Python 2 would have beenThis does not work as such in Python 3, because  without mode would now default to reading unicode text. Furthermore it would assume the file is in native encoding and decode it with strict error handling. However, Python 3 actually makes working with text files easier than in Python 2, as you can pass the encoding and errors behaviour as arguments to  itself:
