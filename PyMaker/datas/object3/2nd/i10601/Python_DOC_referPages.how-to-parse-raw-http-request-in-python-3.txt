I am looking for a native way to parse an http request in Python 3.This question shows a way to do it in Python 2, but uses now deprecated modules, (and Python 2) and I am looking for a way to do it in Python 3.I would mainly like to just figure out what resource is requested and parse the headers and from a simple request. (i.e):Can someone show me a basic way to parse this request?
Each one of those field names should be delimited by carriage return then newline, and then the field name and value are delimited by a colon. So assuming you already have the response as a string, it should be as easy as:
You could use the  class from the  module in the standard library. By modifying the answer from the question you linked, below is a Python3 example of parsing HTTP headers.Suppose you wanted to create a dictionary containing all of your header fields:if you ran this at a python prompt, the result would look like:
