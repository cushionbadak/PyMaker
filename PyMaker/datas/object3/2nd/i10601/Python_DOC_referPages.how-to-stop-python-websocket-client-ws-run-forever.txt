I'm starting my Python Websocket using "ws.run_forever", another source stated that I should use "run_until_complete()" but these functions only seem available to Python asyncio.How can I stop a websocket client? Or how to start it withouth running forever.
In python websockets, you can use "ws.keep_running = False" to stop the "forever running" websocket.This may be a little unintuitive and you may choose another library which may work better overall.The code below was working for me (using ws.keep_running = False).
