I was making a function that recursively searches directories for files with a particular suffixes.TypeError: slice indices must be integers or None or have an index methodpointing to this line:if path.endswith('.',sf)==True: l.append(path).endswith() returns a boolean and is used to test Strings, why the hell is it giving me issues about non-integers?also I decided to just print everything and throw in a try/except statement if a file is not a directory or a file(cause that happend pretty quickly into the first run). it ran fine for a minute or two then started spitting out the except clausesomething went wrong with /sys/bus/cpu/devices/cpu0/node0/cpu0/node0/cpu0/node0/cpu0/node0/cpu0/node0/cpu0/node0/cpu0/node0/cpu0/node0/cpu0/node0/cpu0/node0/cpu0/node0/cpu0/node0/cpu0/node0/cpu1/node0/cpu0/node0/cpu1/subsystem/devices/cpu0/node0/cpu0/subsystem/devices/cpu0/subsystem/devices/cpu0/subsystem something went wrong with /sys/bus/cpu/devices/cpu0/node0/cpu0/node0/cpu0/node0/cpu0/node0/cpu0/node0/cpu0/node0/cpu0/node0/cpu0/node0/cpu0/node0/cpu0/node0/cpu0/node0/cpu0/node0/cpu0/node0/cpu1/node0/cpu0/node0/cpu1/subsystem/devices/cpu0/node0/cpu0/subsystem/devices/cpu0/subsystem/devices/cpu0 something went wrong with /sys/bus/cpu/devices/cpu0/node0/cpu0/node0/cpu0/node0/cpu0/node0/cpu0/node0/cpu0/node0/cpu0/node0/cpu0/node0/cpu0/node0/cpu0/node0/cpu0/node0/cpu0/node0/cpu0/node0/cpu1/node0/cpu0/node0/cpu1/subsystem/devices/cpu0/node0/cpu0/subsystem/devices/cpu0/subsystem/devices/cpu1/cache/powerwell I just Ctrl-Zâ€™d went back into ipython3 and tried again, which immediately brought up the same message, even though the specified directory was / . why did it start back at this same area?edit: code if it comes out looking weird I'm having some trouble with the formatting.
Take a look at the documentation for :So calling  checks the string  if it ends with  starting it's check from the indice , however  is not a valid indice, hence the error.To check if the string ends with  you need to add the strings together instead of passing it as another argument:
