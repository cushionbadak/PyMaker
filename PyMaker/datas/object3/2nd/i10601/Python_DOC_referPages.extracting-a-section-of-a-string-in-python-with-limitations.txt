Natural Text
I have a string output that looks like this:What I want to do is extract a specific set of data out of this block, for example only Distance AAAH like so:The measurements will always begin with Distance AAA*: with the star being the only character that will change.Complications:This needs to be generic, because I have a lot of different data sets and so Distance AAAH might not always be followed by Distance AAAI or preceded by Distance AAAG, since the measurements for different items vary. I also can't rely on .len(), because the last measurement can sometimes be blank (As it is with Distance AAAH) or can be filled (As with Distance AAAB. And I don't think I can use .find(), because I need all of the numbers following Distance AAAH. I am still very new and I tried my best to find a solution similar to this problem, but have not had much luck.

You could use  module. And making a function should be convenient.Output:
