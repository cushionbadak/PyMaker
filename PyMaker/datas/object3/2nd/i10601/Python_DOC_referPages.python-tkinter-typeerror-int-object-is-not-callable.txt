I am trying to take user input from main.py and then use that information to produce an output on runAnalytics. The problem that I am running into is that sometimes, the user input will produce a value of None (maybe null, I don't know) when the dividen_yield is not available and then my whole program will stop. It works flawlessly when there is a dividend-yield though.main.pyrunAnalytics.py[Error] Exception in Tkinter callback          Traceback (most recent call last):            File "C:\Users\MyName\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35-32\lib\tkinter__init__.py", line 1550, in call              return self.func(*args)            File "C:\Users\MyName\Documents\Python Projects\DataAnalytics\main.py", line 13, in               loadAnalytics = Button(loadApplication, text = "Load Analytics", command=lambda: runAnalytics.run(input1))            File "C:\Users\MyName\Documents\Python Projects\DataAnalytics\runAnalytics.py", line 21, in run              dividend_yield = Label(loadAnalytics, text = "Dividend Yield: " + ticker.get_dividend_yield()).pack()          TypeError: 'int' object is not callable
I tried to execute your code and got a different error than you got:So I was not able to reproduce the traceback you got, but I changed your  declaration in the  file using Python's Format Specification Mini-Language giving (double line indentation for direct copy and paste of the snippet):This made the code runnable without any errors on my system since the  statement does all type conversions to the desired string output if necessary:Note that there is a small typo in the Label's text which I did not fix ( should be )
