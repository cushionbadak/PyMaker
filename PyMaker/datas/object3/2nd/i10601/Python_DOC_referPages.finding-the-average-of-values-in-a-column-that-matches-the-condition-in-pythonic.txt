suppose i have the data like thisand my output should be like thisand so on
Calculating an average from a condition is easy with  and  after using a list comprehension to filter. For example, to calculate the average  where there are four , you could do:If you're using modern Python (3.4+), it's even easier with the  module:which is even more accurate than  approaches and more concise, in exchange for being slower.This is somewhat inefficient if you are calculating stats for all cylinders, not just one or two. You could improve on this by grouping them by cylinder as you go:Now you can get the averages for any given cylinder count without needing to search through the whole list of data to filter out the bits you want, you just do:which gets the pre-filtered  cheaply (having prefiltered all cylinder combinations in a single pass up front).FYI, Python can do a lot of the work for you more succinctly. The creation and population of  could be just: would be:with the same pattern for . Loops that do nothing but  values one by one are usually best replaced with the  constructor or a list comprehension (if the  already has values, you'd call  with the same arguments or comprehension as /listcomps).
