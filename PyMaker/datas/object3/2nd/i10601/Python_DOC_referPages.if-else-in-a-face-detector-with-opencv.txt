Note I am a beginner. I made a script that analyzes a picture and places a box around any faces found in the image, that part works, What i need it to do is change the "faces" in "if faces = True" to something to the effect of If faces found = true, though I don't know what that would be, faces does nothing.the code already works it just that the:doesn't work. Help would be appreciated - Thanks! Edit: now I have changed the code to look like this:When I run this, the XML file and the image without the face, it works, and says, "(0) Pamela(s) Found" as it should, but when I run this, the XML file, and the image with the face the window doesn't pop up, I believe this has to do with the waitkey under the if statement not functioning, help would be appreciated - thanks!
According to the documentation I found in OpenCV the faceCascade.detectMultiScale return a collection of objects.To test is a collection (, , , , etc.) is non-empty, just try:May be a duplicate of Best way to check if a list is empty
Use  as the condition:An empty list (or container) has a falsy value, while if a face was detected (i.e.  is not empty), the iterable,  will have a truthy value.P.S.  will raise a Syntax error and if you intended , that also reduces to, and is better written as .
