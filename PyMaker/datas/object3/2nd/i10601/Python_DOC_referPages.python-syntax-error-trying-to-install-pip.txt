According to its [documentation, I am trying to instal Pip running get-pip.py and I get the following error. My version of Python is 3.2.3. Any ideas of what I should do?  
Python 3.2 is an old version and I believe past its end of life. You should be using at least Python 3.4, but 3.5 would be preferable.The  prefix for strings didn't appear until Python 3.3 I believe though it may have been 3.4.
You are trying to install a version of pip that no longer supports Python 3.2. Support for 3.2 was dropped in version 8.0.0. Python 3.2 doesn't support the required  compatibility syntax for string literals.You could try to download version 7.1.2 (download the source distribution, the  link), unpack that tarball and install the package with .I would, however, strongly suggest you upgrade your Python installation instead. Python 3.2 stopped receiving support in February 2016, and 3.3 (first released September 2012), 3.4 (March 2014) and 3.5 (September 2015)â€“ have all been released before that point.
Try to use newest version of Python, especially when use Python 3.x.In this case you use latest command and pip but use old Python. I you have to use old version, read old documentation.
