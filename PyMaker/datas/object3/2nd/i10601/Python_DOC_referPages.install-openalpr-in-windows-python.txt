I am using Windows 10 and I want to install openalpr and import the library to python. However, after downloaded the Pre-compiled Windows binaries, I dont know how ti import alpr in pythonI follow the instruction in OpenAlprI downloaded the openalpr-2.3.0-win-64bit.zip here and unzipped it.Afterwards, I can run  in command line but I cannot import it.Can anyone teach me how I can import Openalpr in python. Thank you.
When you've downloaded the binary distribution, navigate to  subdirectory and run . This would install OpenALPR as package, so then you would be able to import it from anywhere, not just from ALPR's directory.Explaination:To be importable, it requires that the package you're trying to import been else:In current directory, from where you run Specified via  environment variablePart of standard librarySpecified in one of  filesLocated in  dirAdded to  by handAnd when you  run  script, it kicks distutils to properly copy package's distribution to , thus adding it to your libs. For more information, see setup.py usage and how import system works
I setted up the same environment as you:Anaconda 4.0 installed into OpenAlpr installed into So I can call  from the console () and get:The moduleAs the bindings are not shipped with the pre-compiled Windows binaries, you have to install the module manually:download the GitHub repo as ZIP;extract the archive to a temporary folder, let's say ;Python binding is into the  folder;open a console into this directory and type Voil√†, the Python module OpenAlpr is installed!.Call  from the OpenAlpr directory to see it works.UsageTo be able to import OpenAlpr module from Python, two solutions.Solution 1: you will need to work into the OpenAlpr directory where DLL files are located.Then, it should works as expected:Solution 2 (best I think): you update the  to include the OpenAlpr folder:
It looks like you need to add the OpenALPR to the system path (step 4 below) and install the Python bindings (step 5 below). This is how I got OpenALPR to work on Windows 7/Anaconda 3/python 3.5 x64:You should uninstall any previous version of ALPRDownload the binaries and the source code from https://github.com/openalpr/openalpr/releasesUnzip the binaries and the source code in some directory, for example Add the directory where alpr is located to your PATH. In my case Use Anaconda Prompt to install the Python bindings (they are in the source code directory). In my case:Test your installation in the same prompt:Output:Now there is a problem with the unload method of the DLL, but that is another issue: . BTW this problem only happen when using alpr.unload().
