So I got this code here:How can I add a function that tells the user that the file "file.txt" was not found in this directory? I get an error which is called  after starting my program. How can I show a message like "No file found here" instead of having this error appearing?
You use a  statement. This is called Exception Handling. See Python docs to learn more.
You need to catch the exception.
