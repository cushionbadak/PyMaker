What is the Pythonic/quick way to search for a partial string in an array and then remove that string from the array?(I can do it with a simple loop and IF IN and rebuild two array in the loop, Asking if there is a Pythonic way/function to do this)Example:

If you want to separate your items you can do it with one loop and by preserving the items in a dictionary:You can access to separated items by calling the values of the dictionary:
Seriously, just use a  loop, you're trying to create two lists so a single comprehension won't do (i.e the top solution so far iterates twice over the same list).Create two lists and append to them conditionally:
For list-of-strings  and thing-to-exclude :List comprehensions work:Or a generator comprehension for the same:( is effectively a contains operator, and  is the inverse.)Alternately, use the  built-in with a lambda:Either one returns a new object, rather than modifying your original list. The list comprehension returns a list,  returns a generator but you can wrap the call in  if you need random access.
You may use in-built  with  function to achieve this as:
