I have a function that gets some base information in my  file, and I'm trying to update the context of each page using it by having it return a dictionary. However, using  on the context dictionary in the  function doesn't seem to work.Here's what I'm doing:However, nothing is sent to my templates. Thanks in advance!Edit: I'm using Python 2.7.11
Firstly, if you wanted to use a base dictionary and add objects to that you should do so explicitly:However, there is no need to do this at all. Django already provides you a way of automatically providing shared context, and that is a context processor.In fact your  function is already almost a context processor - it just needs to accept the  parameter - so you just need to add it to the  list in your TEMPLATES setting. Then all your templates will automatically get the values from that function.
You should do something like this: Other option should be to make  a  for reusability and DRY purposes, or make the view class based template view and define reusable code as mixin. I prefer the latter, but it's entirely matter of personal choice.
