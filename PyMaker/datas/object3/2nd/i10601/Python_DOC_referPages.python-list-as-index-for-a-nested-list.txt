I have the following two lists:How can I use the first list as a tree index, in order to append an item to the second list, like doing
Do this only if you know what you're doing:
There is no standard way to do that, but this will work:As a bonus, the  function also works for dictionaries and any other mappings. For example:On the other hand,  will not work for assignments. This will not work:In order to assign to tree indices you need another function or partial indexing:
This should work
You could use  function:
For some strange reason, I immediately thought of a recursive routine, but essentially it does does what Kostas is doing, I just find it easier to follow :It will fail of course if l1 was [0] for example as l2[0] is an int not a list. You could test for that and turn whatever is about to have something appended to it into a list if that was likely to be desired.
