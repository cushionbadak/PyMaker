You can compile a regex that matches any of the words in . outputThe  is used to match word boundaries; this prevents "AdditionalInformation" from being modified. See Regular Expression Syntax in the docs. We need to write it as a raw string, , otherwise it gets interpreted as the ANSI escape code for backspace.

As kaasias wrote, just change the the elements of the list with this code:and make sure you create your query with the new elements of the list.
