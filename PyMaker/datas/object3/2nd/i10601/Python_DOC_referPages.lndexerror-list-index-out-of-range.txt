I need to generate a string from random letters given in list take_from. The first time the function was executed it generated a phrase but all my following tries prompted an error "list index out of range". I can`t understand this error in my case and I tried while loop instead of for loop but it did not work either. 
In Python, lists are indexed with integers ranging from 0 to 1 less than the length of the list. E.g., a list with 10 items in it would have indexes from 0 to 9. Your call to  attempts to get indexes from zero to the full length of the list, which will cause this exception. Change it to:
From the docs random.randint(a, b)   Return a random integer N such that a <= N <= b.  Alias for randrange(a, b+1).  Therefore you can get values from 0 to  - inclusive the endpoints - which in case of the upper bound would be out of list's index range as it is zero based and as such only has  elements
The reason this happens, is because the  returns the length, but the last index is always the length - 1 (since indices start from 0).So eventually, the random integer that comes up is the length, and of course, there is no element at that number.Here is a simple example:However, if you -1 from the length you will get the last item:
You should change your loop to say:You are currently experiencing an off-by-one error because you only have 27 elements in your list, not 28.
You could try something like this instead
