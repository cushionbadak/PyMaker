Assuming you want to keep the output of your function the same (a tuple), you can use use  to print the tuple separated by a space:Small note: I changed the method to just be , since the other two lines in the method did not seem needed in this case :)
The return value of  is a tuple of 2 items (a pair), which is passed to the  function as a single argument. And  converts each of its arguments to a string with implicit , and the  come from the string representation of this tuple.What you want is to pass each item in the pair separately.As this is Python 3, you just need to add one character:The  means "pass the elements of the following iterable as separate positional arguments", so it is shorthand (in this case) forPrint normally prints the values separated by a single space. If you want another separator, for example , you can use the  keyword argument:Finally, the  in your example seem unnecessary.
