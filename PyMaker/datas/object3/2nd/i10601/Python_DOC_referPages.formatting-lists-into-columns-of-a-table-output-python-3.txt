Each item index from the lists above is associated (i.e. entry[0] from the 4 lists is associated with the same item; bar, 0.05, 2.0, 40.0).  
Some interesting table draw with .ResultYou can install  with using this command .
Here is a small implementation that does what you want in basic python (no special modules). Output:
After visiting docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip (link provided by cdarke)  I managed to find the solution I needed:  using the zip method I created a new summary list of the associated data:Once I had the new summary list, I proceeded to sort and print out the table to the user (however, I will deal with the formatting later):output is as follows:Thanks to cdarke for the help :)
