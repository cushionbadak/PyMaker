I've quite enjoyed using Beautifulsoup for tasks like that in the past, although I've only been working with html. It does however handle xml quite well also, apparently.Specifically, you're probably wanting to look at things like .find_all. The most important thing to realise if you want to hit the ground running with this (other than how really nice the documentation is) is that the return value of a find_all function is an object which you can call find_all on again - so you can do something like:The docstrings in this module are also quite good so dir(object) and help(object), help(object.function) etc are, as always, your friends here.I'll admit that I've tried to parse html with regex in the (distant, but not distant enough that I don't still get bad dreams sometimes) past - as mentioned in the first answer here - it is a really bad idea. I don't know whether using regex on xml is less likely to "exti​nguish the voices of mor​tal man from the sp​here" or not - but do you really want to take that risk?
Another possible approach for finding the sentences could beReturns:
