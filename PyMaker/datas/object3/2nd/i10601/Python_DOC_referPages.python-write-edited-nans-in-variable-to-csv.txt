I'm trying to convert  values in a .csv to  and then save a file with these edits.  in the code below has the values in the correct location in the data. However, I am unable to save this as a .csv. the error is printed below the code.error:
 expects a sequence of sequences (a sequence of row objects), which a  is not, as it returns a sequence of column names when iterated over:This can bite you silently, as a sequence of strings is actually a sequence of sequences, so you'd end up with a CSV file that contains rows made up of the letters of your column names. In your case it fails because of how you tried to replace the 'NULL' strings, which ended up adding a column with the label  (a boolean value).To iterate over row tuples, you'd use :The easiest approach though is to simply use :Note that to replace the  values you have to use the equality operator instead of the identity operator :Using the identity will effectively add a new column labeled  with all values set to nan:because  evaluates to  instead of a new .
