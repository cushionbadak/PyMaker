This question already has an answer here:Interleaving Lists in Python [duplicate]                    4 answers                I have two lists:which I want to merge to one list which contains element nr. 1 of list a as first element, element nr.1 of list b as second element, element nr. 2 of list a as third element and so on, looking like this:What is the easiest way to do so, possibly without using loops?
Just  them into pairs and then flatten the list using :
Here's an answer comparing some of the possible methods with 2 differents datasets, one will consist of many little arrays, the other one will be few large arrays:import timeit    import random    from itertools import chainSmall sample with 4 elements -> f1=7.50175959666Small sample with 4 elements -> f2=5.52386084127Small sample with 4 elements -> f3=7.12457549607Small sample with 4 elements -> f4=7.24530968309Large sample with 100000 elements -> f1=0.512278885906Large sample with 100000 elements -> f2=28.0679210232Large sample with 100000 elements -> f3=1.05977378475Large sample with 100000 elements -> f4=1.17144886156Conclusion: It seems f2 function is the slightly faster method when N is big and the lists are litte. When the arrays are large and the number is little, f1 is the winner though.Specs: Python2.7.11(64) , N=5000000 on a i-7 2.6Ghz
