How do I allow the user to input values and receive the answer, whilst keeping the values of "x + xy + y" on one line?

Here,  means "one or more digits",  means "zero or more spaces", and  means "any of those four symbols. The parts within  can later be extracted.Alternatively to four , you could also create a dictionary, mapping operator symbols to functions:And then just get the right function from that dict and apply it to the operands:
Here's another possibility.
You can get input like this:Then you can process your input data.
