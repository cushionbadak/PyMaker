I'm trying to convert data from an excel file to a python dictionary. My excel file has has two columns and many rows. How do I go about adding this into a dictionary with Age as the key and name as the value? Also, if many names have the same age, they should all be in an array. For example:What I've written so far:What should I have done for the desired output? I'm very new to python. All help will be appreciated. Thank You. 
Just a simple indentation error and your code is incorrectshould beOtherwise you destroy previous data from .You should consider using  instead to avoid testing if key exists:Declare like thisUse like this:If the dict has no key , it will invoke the  method and will create an empty list for you. No need to test if key exists in the first place.
For this case, use  instead of a plain dictionary );  takes a factory function that is used to construct values for new keys. Use  to construct an empty list for each key:No s are needed.
