I am currently using selenium python to scrape linkedin data. I can parse through various webpages and scrape data but the process is interrupted after the first few pages due to the Unicode error. Here's my code:
You can use UnicodeWriter (from Python docs):
it is an improper encoding... you claim that a bytestream is encoded by UTF-8 and that is not trueat the referred position according to the UTF-8 implementation only ascii character(0-127) is allowed, so the UTF-8 decoding fails... I do not see at your code how and when that UTF-8 decoding fails, so you should trace the exact location by yourselfcheck the variables with type(), and please also note that python 2 and 3 got differences in this area
add it on the top of your code.also, u might need to preprocess your code to replace some nonenglish words
