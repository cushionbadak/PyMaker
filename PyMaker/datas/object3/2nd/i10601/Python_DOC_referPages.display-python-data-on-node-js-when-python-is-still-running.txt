I have a long running python script, and I want to use a node.js to display the data python prints(becasue I will make it a server and send data to somewhere else), I used python-shell, it doesn't display anything until the whole python finished, it there any way to display 'partial' output?for now hello.py is just running a time-delay loop and print something out. 
The easiest way is to setup a server with node js and just send requests with the data that is suppose to be printed. I am giving this solution of course in the prior knowledge that you have control of what is printed. ( You didn't mention if the output is coming from a script that you wrote or it is coming from another library or script of python.)
