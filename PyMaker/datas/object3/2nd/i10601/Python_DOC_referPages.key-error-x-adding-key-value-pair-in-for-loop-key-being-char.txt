I am a beginner in python and I am trying to solve a coding problem, got this error. Don't understand why ? I went through a couple of Q/A's here but they don't seem to solve my problem. Essentially what I am trying to do is iterate over a string, through its characters and fill these characters in a dictionary. With characters being the keys and values being the number of times these characters appeared. So I'm trying the following: and Im getting following error:File "xyq.py", line 3, in myfunc      if CharCounter[i]:  KeyError: 'h'Can someone please suggest, where am I going wrong ? And if possible how can I improve the code ?Thanks
You need to check if  is in  before you try to retrieve it:Or alternatively:
throws  if the key does not exist. What you want to do isuse  instead:Alternatively you could use  which gets the value if it exists, or returns the second (optional) value if it didn't exist:However this counting pattern is so popular that a whole class exists for it: : Example: is a subclass of dictionary, so it would behave in the same way that an ordinary dictionary would do with item access and so forth.
