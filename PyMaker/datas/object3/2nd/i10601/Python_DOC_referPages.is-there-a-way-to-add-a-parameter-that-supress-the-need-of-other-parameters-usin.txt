I am using Argparse on python to do a script on command line. I have this for my script:I am looking that if I call manageAdam -s it would work and don't ask for the positional arguments, something like the -h, which can be called without any other positional argument that is defined. Is it possible?
There is no built-in way to do this. You might be able to achieve something by writing some custom  classes that keep track on the parser about their state, but I believe it will become quite messy and buggy.I believe the best bet is to simply improve your UI. The  is not an option. It's a separate command that completely alters how your script executes. In such cases you should use the  functionality which allows to introduce sub-commands. This is a better interface then the one you thought, and is used by a lot of other tools (e.g. Git/mercurial).In this case you'd have a  command to handle the configuration and a  (or how you want to call it) command to perform the operations on the device:Used from the command line as:
No, there are no such way.You can make all arguments optional and set default value to  then perform check that all of them aren't  otherwise raise , if  provided skip check for other arguments.
