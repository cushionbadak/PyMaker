I was not able to fix that issue, but the framework seems really old. I can reditect you to the simplest HTTP server existant, and easy too:Python 3 (prefered) using http.server:Python 2 using SimpleHTTPServer:
After doing some research inside the framework code I have found the next:The HTTPServer inside the package is a custom one with a  built-in set that is rising exceptions when an attribute that is not "is_secure" is accessed.So in plain, any HTTPServer attribute (except "is_secure") which is accessed will irremediably raise an exception.I guess you have three options:Fix the test function in order to make it work properlyKeep going without using the test function and trying to make that framework workFollow the Tiger-222 solution and stick to the SimpleHTTPServer
