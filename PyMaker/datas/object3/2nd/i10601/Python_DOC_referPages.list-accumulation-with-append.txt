I want to generate or return an append-accumulated list from a given list (or iterator). For a list like , I would like to get, , ,  and . Like so:This works but is there an operation I could use with  to facilitate this? (I'm on Python2 but the pure-python implementation/equivalent has been provided in the docs.)Another problem I have with  is that it doesn't work well with , it outputs the entire  for each element in the list:Option 1:I wrote my own appending accumulator function to use with  but considering the LoC and final useful-ness, it seems like a waste of effort, with  being more useful, (though may fail in case of empty iterables and consumes more memory since  keeps growing):(and the first returned elem is not a list, just a single item)Option 2: Figured it would be easier to just do incremental slicing but using the ugly iterate over list length method:
The easiest way to use  is to make each item in the iterable a list with a single item and then the default function works as expected:
