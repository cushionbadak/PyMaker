I am trying in a Python script to import a tar.gz file from HDFS and then untar it. The file comes as follow 20160822073413-EoRcGvXMDIB5SVenEyD4pOEADPVPhPsg.tar.gz, it  has always the same structure.In my python script, I would like to copy it locally and the extract the file. I am using the following command to do this:The import works perfectly but I am not able to extract the file, I am getting the following error:Can anyone help me?Thanks a lot!
Try with the  option:From the docs:If shell is True, the specified command will be executed through the  shell. This can be useful if you are using Python primarily for the  enhanced control flow it offers over most system shells and still want  convenient access to other shell features such as shell pipes,  filename wildcards, environment variable expansion, and expansion of ~  to a userâ€™s home directory.And notice:However, note that Python itself offers implementations of many  shell-like features (in particular, glob, fnmatch, os.walk(),  os.path.expandvars(), os.path.expanduser(), and shutil).
In addition to @martriay answer, you also got a typo - you wrote "20160822*.tar", while your file's pattern is "20160822*.tar.gz"When applying , the command should be passed as a whole string (see documentation), like so:If you don't need , you can simply use subprocess.call:But I suggest you use more standard libraries, like so:
I found a way to do what I needed, instead of using os command, I used python tar command and it works!Hope this help.RegardsMajid
