I am preparing for my exam and I decided to start solving past exams. One of the requirements is to understand what a code does. But I am having troubles with this annotation.I do not understand which the structure of this nested loop and which loop is executed first.Can someone help me understand please?
As a rule of thumb, the innermost loops are going to be executed first.Having this in mind, let's break the problem down : is 3.xxx, so  is in fact range(2, 3), which is 2 (see range for more informations).So  is going to be 2, no matter what. looks pretty simple now, r will be between 4 and 10 (excluded), using a step of 2. The possible values are 4, 6 and 8.The problem becomes :Which is basically all odd numbers between 2 and 10 (excluded), plus the number 2.
It starts by evaluating:which boils down to:since  reduces to a list with a single element  that is used as the value of  in the  statement. So the inner list comprehension evaluates to .Then, the outer loop  is executed and it returns those elements from the list  that do not belong in the previously constructed list i.e  with:
This equivalent to :
If you're having a hard time understanding inner loops, run this code:Once you've understood this code comprehension lists become second nature to you, then just come back to your original code and you won't have any problems with it :)
