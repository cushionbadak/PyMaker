When I launch my CGI (common gateway interface) by using this code: I got an error:I try to change the path in environment variable but this work only in cmd. I installed anaconda i my computer and i can run the module sklearn.feature_extraction.text in Spyder but not from Apache. Do you know how to solve this issue please?
You should have a first line like  (called Shebang line) in your script. You have to change that line to point to the python executable you actually want. For Windows have a look at the docs but there also is the possibility to run ".bat" files via CGI so you could use a file (eg ) containing justwhich is a hacky workaround (I think) but should work, too.In my experience it is the best to use virtualenv if possible - this does not fix the path-problem directly but helps keeping different applications isolated.
