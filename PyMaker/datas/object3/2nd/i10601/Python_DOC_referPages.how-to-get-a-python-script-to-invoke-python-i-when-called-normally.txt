I have a python script that I like to run with , which runs the script and then enters interactive mode so that I can play around with the results.Is it possible to have the script itself invoke this option, such that I can just run  and the script will enter interactive mode after running?Of course, I can simply add the , or if that is too much effort, I can write a shell script to invoke this.
From within , set the  environment variable to any nonempty string. Python will recheck this environment variable at the end of the program and enter interactive mode.
In addition to all the above answers, you can run the script as simply  by making the file executable and setting the shebang line, e.g.If you want to use this with the  command in order to get the system default , then you can try using a shebang like @donkopotamus suggested in the commentsThe success of this may depend on the version of  installed on your platform however.
You could use an instance of  to get this to work:running this with  will launch an interactive interpreter as the final statement and make the local names defined visible via .Similarly, a convenience function named  can be used:This creates the instance for you, with the only caveat that  is named  instead.In addition to this, as @Blender stated in the comments, you could also embed the  REPL by using:which has the added benefit of not requiring the namespace that has been populated in your script to be passed with .
I think you're looking for this?
I would simply accompany the script with a shell script that invokes it.
