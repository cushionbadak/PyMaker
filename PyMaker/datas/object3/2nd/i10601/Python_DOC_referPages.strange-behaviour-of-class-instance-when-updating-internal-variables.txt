Let's say I define the following class in Python. Here I have two internal variables x and y. In the initialization I have set $$ y = x^2 $$. Now each time I call the method  it increments the value of x by 1 : . However when I print the values x correctly increments by 1 but y remains 0 always. (Should'nt it be x^2??) What's going wrong?
Your  is only assigned when you first create an instance of your class. It is not updated every time you call a function. The  function is only executed when you do, therefore the value of y is only assigned and updated once.Your code would need to be:
Python is not like a spreadsheet where updating one cell (variable) can automatically affect the values of others.Following initialisation, the code never changes the value of . You need to add some code to do that, e.g.There is a way to implement that behaviour though: use properties:If you wanted you can also implement  as a property and have it set  to its square root when it's updated. This would enforce the relationship that  is the square root of `y`` and vice versa.
The variable  is only set when it is instantiated and does not get updated in your code.You should have separate methods to update and/or increment  and adjust  as necessary, along with your method to check the values.
