I'm getting this errorTypeError: super() takes at least 1 argument (0 given)using this code on python2.7.11: The workaround to make it work would be:It seems the syntax is specific to python 3. So, what's the best way to provide compatible code between 2.x and 3.x and avoiding this error happening?
Yes, the 0-argument syntax is specific to Python 3, see What's New in Python 3.0 and PEP 3135 -- New Super.In Python 2 and code that must be cross-version compatible, just stick to passing in the class object and instance explicitly. Yes, there are "backports" available that make a no-argument version of  work in Python 2 (like the  library) but these require a number of hacks that include a full scan of the class hierarchy to find a matching function object. This is both fragile and slow, and simply not worth the "convenience". 
You can use the future library to have a Python2/Python3 compatibility.The super function is back-ported.
This is because of version of python. Check your python version with [python --version] it might be 2.7
