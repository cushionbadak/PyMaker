I have a  class extending  class, both class implemented  to list out all attributes in both  and  class. However, I am having issues with trying to do a print of  in the  function as below. When I execute the followingit would produce something like:When initializing , it's calling , and subsequently call  in order to bring back the name. Just wondering if there's a better way to build the the structure so it's more usable and inline with the OO concept. The result that I want is when I do the  for both  or , it would list out all attributes, such as:and when I do something like , it would still give me I know my code is duplicating it at the moment, but I can't figure out a way to make it work the way I intended... Help please. 
You may use the  function of  module to get the all the members of the class dynamically. Generic function to  attributes based on passed  or  can be define as:Now the demonstration, on HOW this will work:
Yes there is. Use  which calls "parent's" function realization. I'm quoting parent because it is little different than in other programming languages. There is awesome presentation by Raymond Hettinger on Pycon 2015 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiOglTERPEo.Here as you see when we need to call method of current class we just do , but if we need to call parent method we do And i would suggest using  for string formating because it is more clear and readable.
