using python 3.5.2 on windows (32), I'm reading a DBF file which returns me an OrderedDict.When accessing the first record all is ok until I reach a record which contains diacritics:Even if I don't print the record I still have the problem.Any idea ?
 failed to detect the correct encoding from your DBF file. From the Character Encodings section of the documentation: will try to detect the character encoding (code page) used in the file by looking at the  byte. If this fails it reverts to ASCII. You can override this by passing .Emphasis mine.You'll have to pass in an explicit encoding; this will invariably be a Windows codepage. Take a look at the supported codecs in Python; you'll have to use one that starts with  here. If you don't know what codepage to you you'll have some trial-and-error work to do. Note that some codepages overlap in characters, so even if a codepage appears to produce legible results, you may want to continue searching and trying out different records in your data file to see what fits best.
