I am writing a python script that performs an os.system call to wget and attempts to download a file from a set location. At the point of execution it does not know if the server has HTTP-AUTH or not but will attempt a wget of the default page. If not successful it needs to then run some alternative code. I have seen this question in Bash but not in python.if os.system("wget http://{}".format IP)elserun other code
You can use  to execute  then use the  to determine if it was successful. So it might look like this:You will need to look up wget's return codes hereFor more info on the subprocess look here
