I have looked at many possible ways to parse python times. Using parse seems link the only method that should work. While trying to use datetime.strptime causes an error because  does not work with python 2.7. But using parse.parse incorrectly recognizes the time zone.I parse both  and  and get the exact same timestamp in unix time. My version of python 2.7.10 My version of dateutil 1.5Here is my code that runs the test.OutputExpected output
This has nothing to do with the parser, you'll see the same behavior just from  alone, since  doesn't have any time zone offset information, and  is the inverse of . You can correct this by converting it to  before calling :Note that there is a chart on the documentation for  (python 2.x docs) that tells you how to convert between these representations:My personal preference would be to convert the parsed date to UTC, in which case  would be the appropriate function:
