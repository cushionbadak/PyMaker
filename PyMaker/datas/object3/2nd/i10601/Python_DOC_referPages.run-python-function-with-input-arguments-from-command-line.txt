New to Python, used to use MATLAB.My function convert.py is:How do I run it from the command line with input arguments 'a' and 'b' ?I tried:But got an error.I did try to find the answer online, found related things but not the answer:Python: Run function from the command line (Stack Overflow)Command Line Arguments In Python  (Stack Overflow)http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/python-command-line-arguments-argv-example/http://www.saltycrane.com/blog/2007/12/how-to-pass-command-line-arguments-to/Also, where can I find the answer myself so that I can save this forum for more non-trivial questions?
You could do:If that is all what should do the script, you dont have to define a function:If you want change your file (nonetheless you have to add the colon after the function definiton), you could follow your first linked approach:
There exists a Python module for this sort of thing called argparse, which allows you to do really fancy things around command line flags. You don't really need that - you've just got two numbers on the command line. This can be handled really naively.Python allows you direct access to the command line arguments via an array called  - you'll need to  first. The first element in this array is always the program name, but the second and third will be the numbers you pass in  and . For a more complete example:Of course you'll need some error checking around making sure they are actuall integers/floats. A bit of extra reading around sys.argv if you're interested hereTo be complete, we can give an argparse example as well:
