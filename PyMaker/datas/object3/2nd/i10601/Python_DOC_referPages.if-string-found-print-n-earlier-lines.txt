This is a great use-case for a .  Lets say you want to print the matching line and the 2 previous lines (that's what I think you want based on your example).  We can do this by packing each line into the deque and then when we find a match, we print the entire deque:This works because the  will quietly drop the oldest items when you try to add something beyond it's maximum length.
Use a  to store  lines () and print the lines in the deque when the keyword is found.
