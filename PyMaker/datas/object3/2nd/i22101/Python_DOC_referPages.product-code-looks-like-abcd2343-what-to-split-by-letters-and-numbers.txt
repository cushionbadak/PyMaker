Natural Text
I have a list of product codes in a text file, on each like is the product code that looks like:abcd2343abw34324abc3243-23ASo it is letters followed by numbers and other characters.I want to split on the first occurrence of a number.
Or, if you want to split on the first occurrence of a digit: matches 1-or-more digits. matches 0-or-more digits followed by 1-or-more non-digits. matches 1-or-more digits or 1-or-more non-digits.Consult the docs for more about Python's regex syntax. will split the string  using  as the delimiter.  If  begins and ends with parentheses (so as to be a "capturing group"), then  will return the substrings matched by  as well. For instance, compare:In contrast,  returns only the parts of  that match :Thus, if  ends with a digit, you could avoid ending with an empty string by using  instead of : 
This covers your corner case of abc3243-23A and will output  for the letters group and 3243-23A for Since you said they are all on individual lines you'll obviously need to put a line at a time in 
To partition on the first digitSo the two parts are always parts[0] and parts[1].Of course, you can apply this to multiple codes:If each code is in an individual line then instead of  use .
