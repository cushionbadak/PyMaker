I have a comma separated value table that I want to read in Python.  What I need to do is first tell Python not to skip the first row because that contains the headers.  Then I need to tell it to read in the data as a list and not a string because I need to build an array out of the data and the first column is non-integer (row headers).There are a total of 11 columns and 5 rows.Here is the format of the table (except there are no row spaces):Is there a way to do this?  Any help is greatly appreciated!
You can use the  module for this sort of thing. It will read in each row as a list of strings representing the different fields.How exactly you'd want to use it depends on how you're going to process the data afterwards, but you might consider making a  object (from the  function), calling  on it once to get the first row, i.e. the headers, and then iterating over the remaining lines in a  loop.If you're going to wind up putting the fields into a dict, you'd use  instead (and that class will automatically take the field names from the first row, so you can just construct it an use it in a loop).
