Natural Text
I'm using xpath in Selenium RC via the Python api.I need to click an a element who's text is "Submit Â»"Here's the error that I'm getting:
It is possible to write XPath expressions that contain any Unicode characters. For example:
I think you just need to changetoThat's because the error indicates Selenium is trying to encode the Unicode object into a byte string (using the default codec for Python, that is, ) and that's what is failing; by explicitly encoding it yourself first, with what's presumably the right codec (, the default encoding in XML), you should therefore avoid this problem.
Does sel_click() expect unicode strings or utf-8 (byte) strings? The dreaded UnicodeEncodeError usually happens when you try to pass in the first when the latter (or some other encoding) is expected.I can't try it right now, but you could try instead of your argument (which you get by using ) on it.
