Return all the members of an object in a list of (name, value) pairs sorted by name.I want to use this method, but I don't want the members to be sorted. I want them returned in the same order they were defined. Is there an alternative to this method?Use case:Creating a form like so:I want the fields to be rendered in the same order they are defined.
You can dig around to find the line number for methods, not sure about other members:prints:
The attributes (methods and other members) of an object is usually looked up through an object's special  attribute which is a standard Python dictionary. It doesn't guarantee any specific ordering.If an attribute is not found in the object's  the class's is searched instead (where methods usually reside) and so on until the whole inheritance chain has been traversed.Here is some custom inspection done in the interactive prompt to illustrate this (Python 3.1):Would I have put a constructor () in Klass and set an attribute through  it would've shown up in .You can circumvent this by using a custom metaclass. The documentation contains an example which does exactly what you want.See the bottom of this page for the OrderedClass example.Don't know what version of Python you have so I assumed latest.
I don't think Python 2.6 has a  method, so I can't swap out the default  for an ordered one. I can, however, replace it using a  and the  method. Instead of inspecting line numbers, I think its easier and more efficient to just use a creation counter.
In reference to Ned Batchelder's answer above, in Python 3 line numbers of a method m can be gotten with https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html
