In python if you write something likepython appears to return spam if the boolean statement is true and eggs otherwise. Could someone explain this behaviour? Why is the expression not being evaluated like one long boolean?Edit: Specifically, I'm trying to figure out the mechanism why 'spam' or 'eggs' is being returned as the result of the expression.
The operators  and  are short-circuiting which means that if the result of the expression can be deduced from evaluating only the first operand, the second is not evaluated. For example if you have the expression  and  evaluates to true then it doesn't matter what  is, the result of the expression is true so  is not evaluated. They actually work as follows:: If a is falsey, b is not evaluated and a is returned, otherwise b is returned.: If a is truthy, b is not evaluated and a is returned, otherwise b is returned.Falsey and truthy refer to values that evaluate to false or true in a boolean context.However this and/or idiom was useful back in the days when there was no better alternative, but now there is a better way:The problem with the and/or idiom (apart from it being confusing to beginners) is that it gives the wrong result if the condition is true but spam evaluates to a falsey value (e.g. the empty string). For this reason you should avoid it.
This is how the Python boolean operators work.From the documentation (the last paragraph explains why it is a good idea that the operators work the way they do):In the context of Boolean operations,  and also when expressions are used by  control flow statements, the following  values are interpreted as false:  , , numeric zero of all  types, and empty strings and  containers (including strings, tuples,  lists, dictionaries, sets and  frozensets). All other values are  interpreted as true. (See the   special method for a way to change this.)The operator  yields  if its  argument is false,  otherwise.The expression  first evaluates  ; if  is false, its value is  returned; otherwise,  is evaluated  and the resulting value is returned.The expression  first evaluates  ; if  is true, its value is  returned; otherwise, y is evaluated  and the resulting value is returned.(Note that neither  nor  restrict  the value and type they return to   and , but rather return the  last evaluated argument. This is  sometimes useful, e.g., if  is a  string that should be replaced by a  default value if it is empty, the  expression  yields the  desired value. Because  has to  invent a value anyway, it does not  bother to return a value of the same  type as its argument, so e.g.,  yields , not .)
The reason is that Python evaluates boolean expression using the actual values of the variables involved, instead of restricting them to  and  values. The following values are considered to be false:0 of any numeric typeempty sequence or set (, , , )user-defined types with  or  method that returns 0 or See the Truth Value Testing section of the Python documentation for more information. In particular: Operations and built-in functions that have a Boolean result always return  or  for false and  or  for true, unless otherwise stated. (Important exception: the Boolean operations  and  always return one of their operands.)
Try using parentheses to make the expression non-ambiguous. The way it is, you're getting:
