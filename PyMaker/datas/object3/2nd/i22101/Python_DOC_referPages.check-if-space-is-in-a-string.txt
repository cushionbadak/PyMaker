I'm writing a program that checks whether the string is a single word. Why doesn't this work and is there any better way to check if a string has no spaces/is a single word..
 takes precedence over , so you're actually testing .But you don't need  at all.  requires [something that evalutes to True or False] and  will evalute to true or false. So,  is just fine:
Write  instead of .Explanation:In Python, for example  is equivalent to .The same holds for any chain of comparison operators, which include !Therefore  is equivalent to  which is not what you want.
There are a lot of ways to do that :To be sure it matches every kind of space, you can use re module : 
You can try this, and if it will find any space it will return the position where the first space is.
You can say  to remove any leading/trailing spaces from the string - you should do that before your  statement. That way if someone enters input such as  your program will still work.That said,  will determine if a string contains any spaces. If that does not working, can you please provide more information?
This is more idiomatic python - comparison against True or False is not necessary - just use the value returned by the expression . Also, you don't need to use pastebin for such a small snippet of code - just copy the code into your post and use the little 1s and 0s button to make your code look like code.
