I need to strip the character  from a string in python. How do I do this?I know there is a simple answer. Really what I am looking for is how to write  in my code. for example  = newline.  
As for how to represent a single apostrophe as a string in Python, you can simply surround it with double quotes () or you can escape it inside single quotes ().To remove apostrophes from a string, a simple approach is to just replace the apostrophe character with an empty string:
Here are a few ways of removing a single  from a string in python. is usually used to return a string with all the instances of the substring replaced.In Python 2To remove characters you can pass the first argument to the funstion with all the substrings to be removed as second.In Python 3 You will have to use Regular Expressions using  are even more powerful (but slow) and can be used to replace characters that match a particular regex rather than a substring.    Other WaysThere are a few other ways that can be used but are not at all recommended. (Just to learn new ways). Here we have the given string as a variable . Using list comprehensionUsing generator ExpressionAnother final method can be used also (Again not recommended - works only if there is only one occurrence ) Using  call along with  and . 
Do you mean like this?
You can escape the apostrophe with a  character as well:
