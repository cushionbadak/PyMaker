I want a script to start a new process, such that the new process continues running after the initial script exits. I expected that I could use  to start a new process, and set  so that the main script may exit while the created process continues running. But it seems that the second process is silently terminated when the main script exits. Is this expected behavior, or am I doing something wrong?
From the Python docs:When a process exits, it attempts to  terminate all of its daemonic child  processes.This is the expected behavior.
If you are on a unix system, you could use os.fork:Running this creates two processes. You can kill the parent without killing the child.For example, when you run script you'll see something like:Stop the script with ctrl-Z:Find the process ID number for the parent. It will be the smaller of the two process ID numbers since the parent came first:Kill the parent process:Restore script.py to the foreground:You'll see the child process is still running:Kill the child (in a new terminal) with 
Simply use the  module:
