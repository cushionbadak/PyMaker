when i give ls -l /etc/fonts/conf.d/70-yes-bitmaps.conf so for a symbolic link or soft link, how to find the target file's full(absolute path) in python,If i use it outputs but i need the absolute path not the relative path, so my desired output must be,how to replace the  with the actual full path of the parent directory of the symbolic link or soft link file.
os.path.realpath returns the canonical path of the specified filename, eliminating any symbolic links encountered in the path.
As unutbu says,  should be the right answer, returning the canonical path of the specified filename, resolving any symbolic links to their targets.  But it's broken under Windows.I've created a patch for Python 3.2 to fix this bug, and uploaded it to:http://bugs.python.org/issue9949It fixes the  function in I've also put it on my server, here:http://www.burtonsys.com/ntpath_fix_issue9949.zipUnfortunately, the bug is present in Python 2.x, too, and I know of no fix for it there.
http://docs.python.org/library/os.path.html#os.path.abspathalso joinpath and normpath, depending on whether you're in the current working directory, or you're working with things elsewhere. normpath might be more direct for you.Update:specifically:
The documentation says to use :The result may be either an absolute or relative pathname; if it is relative, it may be converted to an absolute pathname using .
On windows 10, python 3.5,  where "C:\Users\PP" is a symbolic link (not a junction link) works.It returns the absolute path to the directory.This works on Ubuntu 16.04, python 3.5 as well.
I recommend to use  library for filesystem operations.Documentation for : make the path absolute, resolving any symlinks. A new path object is returned.
