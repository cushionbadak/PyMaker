I wrote a simple HTTP client and server in Python for experimenting. The first code snippet below shows how I send an HTTP GET request with a parameter named imsi. In the second code snippet I show my do_Get function implementation in the server side. My question is how I can extract the imsi parameter in the server code and send a response back to the client in order to signal the client that imsi is valid.Thanks.P.S.: I verified that the client sends the request successfully.CLIENT code snippetSERVER code snippet
You can parse the query of a GET request using urlparse, then split the query string.You can confirm this by using 
BaseHTTPServer is a pretty low-level server. Generally you want to use a real web framework that does this kind of grunt work for you, but since you asked...First import a url parsing library. In Python 2,x it's urlparse. (In Python3, you'd use urllib.parse)Then, in your do_get method, parse the query string.Also, you could be using urllib in your client code and it would probably be a lot easier.
 module contains  class which is supposed to be used in CGI context, but seems to be easily used in your context as well.
