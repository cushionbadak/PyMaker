I want to write Python code to send a file from client to server. server needs to save the file sent from the client. But my code have some bugs which I cannot fix. Below is my server code:And the client code:But then I run my code, the client returns the following error (this is on Windows):I have some questions:How to fix the above bug?My code needs to transfer some big files sometimes. Since my method is so simple, I doubt that it is efficient for moving big data. Could anybody please suggest a better method to move big files? (Of course it is better to use XMLRPC on Python)
Server side:Client side:This worked for me.
