I have the following error: from this code : output of sys.getdefaultencoding : I'm using a Chromebook with crouton - if that makes a difference (I've a feeling that it might). I'm not sure if there's some way of 'forcing' the output of strings like this or just ignoring any chars that are problematic. terminal or console o redirect cannot handle UTF-8; what environment are you trying to print in.I'm trying to run this using iPython within SpacemacsIn the shell, what does the command locale output?In the shell I'm running this within (iPython within Spacemacs) the command is undefined, on the default shell brought up with  the output is 
On a POSIX host, Python determines the output encoding from the locale, a set of environment variables that communicate how the environment is configured for various language settings. See the  function, or more specifically, the  function.The output of that function is used to set , which is then used to encode any Unicode text printed.Your locale is set to , which means that the default encoding is ASCII. You'll need to configure that locale to use an encoding that supports all of Unicode. How to do this for Chromebooks, I don't know. On my Mac, the locale is set to , mostly, so all of the Unicode standard is supported by my terminal. You could force the issue by setting .You can override Python's choices by setting the  environment variable.Note that on more recent Python 3 releases,  and  use the  error handler, which replaces any character your console can't handle with the standard ,  and  escape sequences; so instead of an exception you'd see:
Ah, after search and search, I found this. As it says maybe you could try:Edit (create it first)  file.Write the following text in it:Maybe try reboot the Chromebook.And then check the  command's output.
