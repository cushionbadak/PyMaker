I'm spawning a process from a script using . My  takes a JSON input and performs some operations and should return some real time data to the main process. How can I do this from ?I'm trying something like this. But it is throwing an error. Following is may main process "main.py"Below is my  "handler.py"But it throws an error.Am I doing something wrong here?? 
 reads all the output from a subprocess and closes it. If you want to be able to read from the process after writing, you have to use something other than , such as . Alternatively, just use the output of ; it should have what you want https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#popen-objects.
 does not return until the process is dead and it returns all the output. You can't read subprocess' stdout after it. Look at the top of the  docs:Interact with process: Send data to stdin. Read data from stdout and  stderr, until end-of-file is reached. Wait for process to terminate.emphasis is mineIf you want to send data and then read the output line by line as text while the child process is still running:If you need code for older python versions or you have buffering issues, see Python: read streaming input from subprocess.communicate().If all you want is to pass data to the child process and to print the output to terminal:If your actual child process is a Python script then consider importing it as a module and running the corresponding functions instead, see Call python script with input with in a python script using subprocess.
