This question already has an answer here:Split string with multiple delimiters in Python [duplicate]                    5 answers                I have this simple file:I want to parse the file to get the following output:I tried to split by "|", but the problem I am facing is how to split by "A=" or how to make the program recognizes "A=" and prints what is after it.The algorithm that I have in mind is to iterate through each split item and check if the item contains the character "A=".  Not sure how to translate that into python code.  Any pythonic idea? 
You can use regular expression, : will match  or . The first  was escaped because  has special meaning in regular expression (meaning OR).
