I am looking to write unit tests to existing functionality, and I came across to the below:I have a function that spins a new process when bringing up a service or list of services, the code looks something like this:What I am trying to figure out is if there is any value adding a unit test to this function, and if yes, what would it look like... I am using unittest.
I think it's valuable to unittest.  I especially think unittesting the except condition is valuable, because it looks like an infrequently executed code path.  What happens if  errors for some strange reason? then you have another exception being thrown.To unittests this without changing anything you could use  https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html to patch the  import, to provide a mock implemenation that doesn't spawn a process.Another option would be to inject the  module as a paramter into your function, so that the production code could use  and your test could code provide a mock object
