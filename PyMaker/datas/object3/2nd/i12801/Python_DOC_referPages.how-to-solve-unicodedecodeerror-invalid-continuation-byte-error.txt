Natural Text
I ran some code in Python and received the following error, using f = open(file) and f.read() commands:Firstly, how do I find position 62475 in the source file to see what the characters are? I tried opening the file in pluma and in notepadqq, and both display the line and column numbers, but there doesn't seem to be a way to search by position number. Once I find the problem area, is there a quick guide to what the character types are and how I can solve the problem? 
In open encoding=latin-1 – Padraic CunninghamThank you, the code worked perfectly! No error message, so I suppose the encoding was actually latin-1 and not UTF-8, so whatever was at position 62475 is probably moot. – user2144412
