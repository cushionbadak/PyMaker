So I'm pretty new to Python and coding in general, however I was messign around with some bisection stuff and I came across a problem. I have this code:The problem is that when I run it, the 'c' variable changes but 'fc' stays the same and outputs -2, when it should output 4 instead. No matter what I've tried, fc alwas stays the same and updating c does nothing to change fc, even though I believe it should?
Python stores the outcome of the expressions in ,  and , not the expressions themselves:If you wanted to re-run an expression for changing variables, create functions. For a single expression, you can create a function object by using a  expression:These 3 functions expect ,  and  to exist in their parent scope. Now changing  and then calling the function will re-run the expression:Demo:
