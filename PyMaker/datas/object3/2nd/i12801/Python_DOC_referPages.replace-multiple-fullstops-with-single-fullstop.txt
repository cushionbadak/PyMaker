How do I replace multiple full stops with a single fullstop such that the NLTK sentence tokenizer can differentiate them as 2 different sentencesFor e.g.If i useIt gives me But what I want is How do I do this?
You can do this by using a regex and substitute the occurrences of multiple dots by only a single one as shown below:Giving you:In addition I'll give you a small explanation about how this works.  accepts a regex pattern which should be replaced. In our case, this is .So let's have a deeper look at this pattern. Since you're looking for dots  we need to catch them. However, normally the dot sign  is used in regexes to match any character which is not what we want to achieve. In order to match the dot  and not any character we need to escape this character by adding the backslash in front of the dot giving . Since we want to find any occurrences of dots and we don't know how many dots there would be we are just looking for 'one ore more' which we achieve by appending the  to our matching group .And there we are, having a working regex:  which we pass as  to show Python that this is a regex and not a normal string. Next, as stated in  docs, we need to specify a string which we want to put instead of our regex pattern. This is a single dot  only, since you want to replace several dots with a single one. The third parameter we passed is your string  in which we need to do the desired replacements.I do not want to advertise anything, but for a quick overview on regex in Python I can suggest this cheat sheet.
You could also use  for this purpose. It returns you a list as wellYou getCheers!
