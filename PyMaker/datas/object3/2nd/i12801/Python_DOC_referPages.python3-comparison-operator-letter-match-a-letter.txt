This question already has an answer here:python-re: How do I match an alpha character                    3 answers                Ok so basically this is what I know, and it does work, using Python3:What I need is that when I call any position, (which inputs any single character Lower or Upper case in the comparison), into the brackets "color[ ]" and compare it to match only with "Lower or Upper case letters" excluding all numbers and characters (.*&^%$#@!). in order words something to the effects below:Of course what I just listed above does not work. Perhaps my syntax is wrong, perhaps it just cant be done.   If I only use a single letter on the "right" side of the equals, then all is well, But like I said I need whatever single letter is pulled into the left side, to match something on the right.First off I wan't to make sure that its possible to do, what I'm trying to accomplish? 2nd, if it is indeed possible to do then have this accomplished "Without" importing anything other then "sys". If the only way to accomplish this is by importing something else, then I will take a look at that suggestion, however I prefer not to import anything if at all possible. I'v searched my books, and a whole other questions on this site and I can't seem to find anything that matches, thanks.
For the case of looking for letters, a simple  check:will work.For the general case where a specific check function doesn't exist, you can use  checks:If the "random letter set" is large enough, you may want to preconvert to a  for checking ( membership tests are roughly , vs.  for , but  tests are optimized enough that you'd need quite a long  before the  makes sense; possibly larger than the one in the ):Alternatively, you can use regular expressions to get the character classes you were trying to get:
This is where  is helpful.There's also , if you need numbers.
Not really sure why you'd require not importing anything from the standard libraries though.
