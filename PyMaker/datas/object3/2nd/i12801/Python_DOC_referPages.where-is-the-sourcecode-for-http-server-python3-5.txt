Where is the sourcecode for http.server python3.5? Is there a git repository for this?
You have a copy on your hard drive:This assumes you have Python 3.5 installed and run it.
Documentation page has a reference to the source code.
Python doesn't use Git, they use Mercurial--partly because Mercurial is written in Python.It's here: https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/3.5/Lib/http/server.pyUpdate: Since this was originally answered, Python has switched to using Git and GitHub.  The code is now here: https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.5/Lib/http/server.py
