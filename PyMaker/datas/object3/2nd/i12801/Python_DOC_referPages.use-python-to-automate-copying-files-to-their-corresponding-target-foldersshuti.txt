I wanted to automate the process of copying files (in their target folders) to their corresponding source folders (which has the same folder structure as the source) located in a different directory on computer...I tried to use python's shutil.copytree, but that will copy all the target folders into the source folders and the Python documentation said that "The destination directory, named by dst, must not already exist" (which, in my case, break the rule). So what I wanted to do is to only copy the target files to the corresponding folder, so that the source and target files would end up staying in the same folder...Is it possible to do by using python?Here I attached to the question a screenshot to further explain what I meant. Thank you so much for your help! At the meantime, I'll try to do more research about it too!
Here's the modified version of  which does not create directory (removed  call).Using  (or  in Python 3.x), you can temporarily disable  by replacing  with a Mock object (See ):
I just found a rather easy way to make it happen.We can use ditto command to merge the 2 folders together.
