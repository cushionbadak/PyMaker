So i'm currently learning Python and I code it on the Pycharm IDE. I was trying to write a function but for some reason Pycharm wont accept the 'end=' statement saying something like its not defined.Here is my code It gives me the following error:It's only doing this on Pycharm. When I tried it on the dafult Python IDLE it worked just fine. Can anyone help me fix this?
