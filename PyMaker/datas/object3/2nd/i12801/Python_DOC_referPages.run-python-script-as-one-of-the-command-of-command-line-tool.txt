I am new to Python, could someone please let me know if we can register our python script to work as one of the command of cmd.exe, I am not asking about parsing or accepting command line arguements using argparse, etc..Lets say I have a SearchDir.py file, to run it from cmd prompt I have to do "python SearchDir.py", so is there any way to simply do "SearchDir" and it should act as one of the command of cmd.exe
Yes, it is possible (if I have understood you correctly. The question was a bit unclear)The first thing you need to do is to add a shebang to the top of your script: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix). I see you mentioned cmd.exe so I assume you need this to work on Windows? In that case you should read https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#shebang-lines as wellOn unix hosts, the second thing we need to do is set our file as executable with . I try to stay away from Windows, but from what I remember this is not relevant on Windows.Last you need to place the script in a folder referenced by your $PATH-variableThe script will now be accessible as SearchDir.py from cmd.exe or a unix shell. If you want to omit the ".py"-part you simply rename the file to just "SearchDir"
