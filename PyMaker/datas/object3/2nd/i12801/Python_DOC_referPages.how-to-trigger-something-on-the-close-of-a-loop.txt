Is this possible? I want to print lines in my file 5 at a time (to send to an API in a batch). But when I get to the last few lines they never print because there are less than 5, never triggering my if statement to print. SO I figured one way to tackle this is to print the remaining lines when the loop closes.The current code is messy and redundant but this is the idea:Also - Generally speaking, is there a better way to tackle this?
What do you think ofwith an input file of it produces
You can group them into sets of 5 lines at a time with the  grouper recipe.
