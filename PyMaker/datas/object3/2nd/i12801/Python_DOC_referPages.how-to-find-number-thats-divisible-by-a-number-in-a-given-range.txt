I have this code:Which is checked at 100 FPS â€” as I move right/left  is changed. However this code does not work. Can someone help me with that?
You can't use a generator expression in an  statement like that. This is because initially a generator expression yields a new generator object and instances of most types are generally considered  (see Truth Value Testing in the documentation). To do what you want I suggest you instead use the built-in  function. Doing so will be fast because it will stop soon as a  boolean sub-expression value is encountered. Here's what I mean: will return  if  is evenly divisible by any number in the open-ended range (assuming that's what you're trying to determine). By open-ended I mean that the value  will not be considered because  only covers the values from  to .
I think you're misunderstanding the  method. It doesn't create a random number, it creates a list of numbers in a particular range. E.g.,  yields I think you were trying to have an assignment in the conditional, e.g., , but mistakenly ended up using list comprehension, which always validated as . I'm kind of amazed that didn't give a syntax error.Python does not support assignment within a conditional, you'll need to assign before the if, or don't assign at all, like in the above code.
