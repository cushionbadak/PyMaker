I'm looking for help. Below is a program I have recently created.When the code executes it changes the format of the input file and then outputs this to an output file.I now want to bring this code further. I want to create a program that will run this program but only make changes to a file which ends with a digit. For example, I have a folder of files in this orderI want to be able to create a program, or if it can be done, to modify my current program to only make changes to a file in a specified directory ending with a digit. Just wondering if anyone has any advice or help as to how I could go about this?Thanks.UPDATE I have created some code which looks like the following. It runs with no errors, however it does not make any changes the file.In the "ex09" directory there is a file called "file_1", is my code sufficient to make changes to file_1 by executing my previous python program?
To do that, you will need to use regex for your code to know that each file will be called with a  pattern.  where x is the number of the file. Therefore, your code will identify your file name by the number. 
You can create a list of all files ending in a digit using glob:
