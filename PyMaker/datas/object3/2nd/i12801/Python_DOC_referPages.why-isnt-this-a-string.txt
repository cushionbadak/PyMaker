Can anyone explain why its printing ?  is a string but it keeps jumping to the .
When you sayyou are checking if the  is the same as the  function.If you want to check if the input is a string, then you can use the  function, like thisBut  function, in Python 3.x, always returns a string only. So, you don't have to check if the input is a string or not.Note: In case, you are using Python 2.x,  is actually a statement, not a function. You can read more about that in this question.
