This question already has an answer here:Convert floating point number to a certain precision, and then copy to string                    7 answers                The first gives 10 digits after the decimal point, the second gives 8. Does "precision" mean total digits? How do I control significant digits after the decimal point only?
You need to include the type  (for float) to control the number of digits after the decimal place:Without specifying the type, Python falls back to the general number type and the number is rounded to the specified number of significant digits. From the documentation:The precision is a decimal number indicating how many digits should be displayed after the decimal point for a floating point value formatted with 'f' and 'F', or before and after the decimal point for a floating point value formatted with 'g' or 'G'.
