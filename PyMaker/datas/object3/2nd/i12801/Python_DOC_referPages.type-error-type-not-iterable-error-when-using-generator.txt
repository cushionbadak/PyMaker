I added an generator function to be able to iterate through a predefined BinaryTree class, but when I run it with the testing code I get a TypeError saying that the BinaryTree class isn't iterable and I'm not sure why. Here is the provided code along with the generator function to traverse the tree as well as the testing code:Here is the error that gets printed out afterwards:I know that for generators you don't need to create an iterator class as the generator will iterate through the items in a similar fashion. When I change the name of the "traverse" method to iter I don't get any errors, but when the name is changed I do. 
 itself is not iterable, no. Only the result produced by the  method is:However, you'd need to adjust the method itself to use the  methods of the child nodes too:If you want to make an instance itself iterable, you need to implement a  method that either returns an iterator (a generator function produces this, for example) or returns  at which point you also need to provide  or  method, depending on your Python version.Here, renaming  to  suffices:Demo:
