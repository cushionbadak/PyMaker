I have a sentence: "Am/V I/NN good/Adj enough/Prep for/Prep 1/2/NUM" and I have to split into words and tags and create two different dictionaries - for words and for tags. I saw a thread here but there wasn't a word about splitting this thing - 1/2/NUM.So I suppose I have to do something like this:but then I get this:How do I solve this issue?
 on the spaces first:Then for each item  on the  character:Or if you prefer more concise code:
As noted in the comments on shuttle87's answer, here is a simple example showing split with regex in case you need to split on multiple characters, which you can't do with the string split method.['Am', 'I', 'good', 'enough', 'for', '1/2']  ['V', 'NN', 'Prep', 'Prep', 'Prep', 'NUM']Regex demo here.
