I'm new to programming, and I'm having trouble relating my functions in such a manner that the variables I'm using are defined. For example, I initialized the following board for a game I'm developing:This produces a board with all 'none' values except at two random positions, where there is a float value. Now I need to write a function that checks for possible matches in a row. A match is found when two identical elements ('None' values are ignored) are next to each other or only separated by 'None'. For example [2, None, 2, None] would count as a match. I now want to write a new function  that checks the indices of the initial elements (the float value '2.0') in each row, and then compares if they are next to each other or separated by 1. The function would return  if this is the case. I wrote:I'm not sure if this is correct, since Python keeps saying the variables are undefined, so I cannot check my program. How can I use the variables I defined in other functions? Also, I want to print the result somewhere (i.e True or False). Should this be done inside the function?        
I recommend using a Class here.  This will eliminate the need to constantly pass around your  variable, and make it much cleaner to write more behaviors of boards into class methods.  Note that the class's  method doesn't need to return anything explicitly.Then simply instantiate a Board by doing:
if you want to use a variable defined in a function in an other function. You best have to pass it in argument.There's still a possibility to use nested function or global variable. but when i can i prefer to use the option i describe above..so to use global variable you can do :
