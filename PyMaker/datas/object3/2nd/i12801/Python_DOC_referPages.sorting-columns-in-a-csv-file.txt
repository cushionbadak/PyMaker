I have a .csv file which I want to sort.I currently have two columns, 'Name' and 'Score'. I'd like to use SQLite to sort these two columns in Python 3. I want to sort 'Name' by alphabetical order and 'Score' by score highest to lowest.
You don't need to use sqlite3 to sort it.You can use  or  with a key function:  after loading the csv file as a list.
