Consider a python package that has multilanguage support (using ). How to compile  files to  files on the fly when executing ? I really don't want to distribute precompiled  files.Thanks in advance!
I know this question begins to be a bit old, but in case anyone's still looking for an answer: it's possible to add a function to  that will compile po files and return the  list. I didn't choose to include them in  because 's description looked more appropriate:configuration files, message catalogs, data files, anything which doesnâ€™t fit in the previous categories.Of course you can only append this list to the one you're already using, but assuming you only have these mo files to add in data_files, you can write:For your information, here's the function  I use. I don't pretend it's the best implementation possible. I put it here because it looks useful and is easy to adapt. Note that it's a bit more extra-complicated than what you need because it doesn't assume there's only one po file to compile per directory, it deals with several instead; note also that it assumes that all po files are located in something like , you'll have to change it to fit your needs:(you'll have to import  and  to use it)
I could share my version of  files compilation process:@edit Comment:  For example  translation file: function  creates compiled  file and then on package build this  file is copying to
