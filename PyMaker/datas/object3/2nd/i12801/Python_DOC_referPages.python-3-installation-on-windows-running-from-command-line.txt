Just curious, is there a particular reason why Python 3.x is not installed on Windows to run default with the command line "python3", like it does on Mac OSX and Linux? Is there some kind of way to configure Python so that it runs like this? Thanks. EDIT: Just to add, the reason I am asking is because I have both the Python 2 and 3 interpreter installed on my computer, and so it is ambiguous, as both are run using the command "python".
the reason I am asking is because I have both the Python 2 and 3 interpreter installed on my computer, and so it is ambiguous, as both are run using the command "python".To run Python 2 executable:To run Python 3  executable:where  is a Python launcher that is bundled with your Python 3 installation. recognizes the shebang (e.g.,  causes Python 3 executable to be run), it respects virtualenv (if you run  without specifying the explicit python executable version) i.e., run:and the correct python version is used automatically -- you don't need to specify the Python version on the command-line explicitly.is there a particular reason why Python 3.x is not installed on Windows to run default with the command line "python3", like it does on Mac OSX and Linux?OSX and Linux have  executable installed by default as a rule and it refers to Python 2 version in most cases at the moment that is why you need a separate  name there.There is no Python on Windows by default. And therefore any version that you've installed is just  (I guess). The recommended way to manage multiple python versions is to use the Python launcher.Is there some kind of way to configure Python so that it runs like this? If you want to type   instead of  or even just  (assuming  is in  and Python launcher is configured to run Python scripts (check  and ) -- the default) then create a bat-file e.g.,  and put it in :
You have to add the python bin folder to your path. You can do it manually but when you install python i remember you have an option to do that.
You likely missed the checkbox at the bottom of the installer. Full documentation here: https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.htmlThen, I think you just run , not  from the Command Prompt. The reason Unix systems have  is because  defaults to Python2.x in many systems. 
I work with multiple Python 2.x and 3.x distros on Windows.  Some of them are "portable" - i.e. not recorded in the Windows registry, and therefore not accessible by the version-selector  delivered with Python 3.3+.  To save my sanity, I wrote  which is available on bitbucket.  It configures the ,  and  variables according to the target you give it (a relative or absolute path to the parent directory of ).  You can do so in a way that is sticky for the rest of your command-line session:or transiently, i.e. to call a particular python command without otherwise affecting the environment of the shell you're calling it from:You may find it helpful.
