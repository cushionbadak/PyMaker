SOLVED!How i can return komanda to next function ?I have very bad problem with function return, if someone may provide me some tut with good explenation of functions in python
You should not call the function in circles. Just return  back to the caller in :
First, explain CLEARLY what you're asking.It's difficult to understand.Second, your code will enter in an infinite loop.In  you're calling function, and in  your calling  ... you'll never end.You have to explain what you want.Anyway, what I guess is that you want an argument to your function unos():And then call your function with an argument .None of these will work though as thery are, you'll have to rewrite your program.
I'm not very good with this, but it seems to me that  is a local variable.You could try making komanda a global variable, something like thisor you could try using  and  to do everything in
