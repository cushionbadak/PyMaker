You don't need a regex.
I think you are using the wrong datatype. Consider trying to build a list of dicts if you want to extract any more information from these strings. If you insist on keeping your list items strings, try this:The magic is in the regular expression. It matches ' &' or the beginning of a string, then only space characters until 'count_', then anything else and finally a finishing '& ' or the end of the string. '*?' is to make sure it makes a match as small as possible.
 == So  will check if the string is starts with , not search in in the string. So you should use  instead of :Output:But  will remove the string if there's  in it. I think you should use:Demo:
