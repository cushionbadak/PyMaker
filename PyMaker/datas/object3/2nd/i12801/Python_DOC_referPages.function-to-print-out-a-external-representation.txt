my problem is in creating a function, that receiving a tuple, prints out a representation like the following, where the empty spaces(corresponding to numbers in the other lines) are filled with empty strings. The number of lines is given by the tuple with the most entries, for example if all tuples only have 1 entry there is only one line, if one of the tuples has 2 entries there will be 2 lines.Can anyone tell me an efficient way of doing this? the image of the representation I want is in this picture.If there were for example 3 entries in a certain tuple there would be 3 lines and so on.the picture looks like this:
