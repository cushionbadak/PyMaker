I have this code in a django template pageI want a value for every option tag that increases in each iteration. If I have 10 option tags, then their values will be from 0 to 9.  does not fulfill my need as the inner loop counter initializes to 0 when outer loop finishes once.
How about passing  a  object to the template?Template:View:
Reviving this post to provide solutions using only the template language.If you know you only have one  in between the counter (as in example above), use forloop.parentloop. You can chain many of these together, but the number of loops separating the desired loop must be known, and using it becomes less desirable after a few ().If you have an arbitrary number of for loops between the two (say in a template you can't control, or django-crispy-forms), save the loop variable with a with statement:Falsetru's solution is a best fit for a counter that lacks a for loop, or one that keeps counting after one has ended. This feature isn't really possible with only the builtins, so the itertools from falsetru's answer is necessary.
