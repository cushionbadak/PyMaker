findall/search should help youfindallsearchThe reason match fails is because it tries to match it at beginning of string re.match documentationre.match(pattern, string, flags=0) If zero or more characters at the  beginning of string match the regular expression pattern, return a  corresponding MatchObject instance. Return None if the string does not  match the pattern; note that this is different from a zero-length  match.Note that even in MULTILINE mode, re.match() will only match at the  beginning of the string and not at the beginning of each line.If you want to locate a match anywhere in string, use search() instead  (see also search() vs. match()).
 does not have  attribute. Try  instead-Or try  that returns a regular list-  means find  that does not have  after or before- and split the text by it-
Actually you don't need regex in this case,  is enough:
