From the error, I infer that  is a dictionary. A dictionary cannot be hashed and therefore cannot be used as a key to another dictionary. It seems that your  query is returning a a set of dictionaries.
You are trying to store a dictionary as key for another dictionary and that is not allowed because dictionary is not hashable. See below A dictionaryâ€™s keys are almost arbitrary values. Values that are not  hashable, that is, values containing lists, dictionaries or other  mutable types (that are compared by value rather than by object  identity) may not be used as keys.Basically you have And below code tries to store dictionary  as key of nodi Because  is a dictionary (as shown below) you get errorif you replace the followingWith Then you won't get an error because  is hashable (just like string unlike list and dictionary). You might then need to change the way you add node to G, so something like:  where  is nothing but
