This question already has an answer here:How can I read inputs as numbers?                    19 answers                so I just started Python today. Tried a basic program, but I'm getting an error "can't convert int object to str implicity"When I do enter int(age)+factor, instead of age, it works perfectly. But the author says that python auto detects the variable type when you key it in. So in this case when I enter age=20, then age should become integer automatically correct?Looking forward to any help!!
From the docThe function then reads a line from input, converts it to a string (stripping a trailing newline), and returns that.As you can see, the  function in python 3+ returns a string by converting whatever input you are given, much like  in python 2.x.So,  is clearly a string.You can't add a string with an integer, hence the error. can't convert int object to str implicity converts  to an integer, so it works in your case.What you can do:Use:To cast your input to an integer explicitly. 
Your problem is that input returns a string (since in general, input from the command line is text). You can cast this to an int to remove the error, as you have done. Python only automatically detects the type of your variables in your program if they don't already have a type - it does not automatically convert typed variables to different types.
Python does not know what operation you're trying to make, provided the '+' operator can be used both to concatenate strings and adding numbers.So, it can't know if you're trying to doorYou need to explicitly convert your variables so it won't be ambiguous.In your case, int(age) returns an integer, which is the proper way to get what you want.
