I am trying to  make a vector out of two different ones as shown in the piece of code below.However, I get a list out of range exception on the 5th line the first time the code goes in the for loop.What am I doing wrong?
You can't use a Python list this way. It's not like a C array with apredefined length. If you want to add a new element, you have to use the method or something.Aside from that, you're also using a second index, implying that theelements of  are themselves lists or dicts or something, beforethey've even been assigned.It looks like you want to convert  and  to atwo-dimensional list. So, first, here's how to do that with a loop. Notethat I've removed the fixed-size assumption you were using, though thecode still assumes that  and  are the same size.Now, the Pythonic way to do it.
