This question already has an answer here:What is the difference between re.search and re.match?                    8 answers                In Python I can doand I get the expected result:But it only works if the pattern is at the start of the string:gives .  There is noting about that pattern which requires it to be at the start of the string - no  or similar.  Indeed it works as expected on regex101.Does Python have some special behaviour - and how do I disable it please?
From the docs on :If zero or more characters at the beginning of  match the regular expression , return a corresponding match object.Use  to search the entire string.The docs even grant this issue its own chapter, outlining the differences between the two:  vs. 
 matches from beginning of string.So you need to give it a way to match the start of string if  is not at start of string.
