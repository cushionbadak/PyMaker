I am not sure how to do this. I tried:Essentially I want len(x) slope_x values.
You could use a list comprehension to collect all the  return values: is a list of 5-tuples. To collect all the first, second, third, etc... elements from each 5-tuple into separate lists, use :
You should be able to do what you're trying to, but there are a couple of things you should watch out for. First, you can't add a string to a variable name and store it that way. No plus signs on the left of the equals sign. Ever.You should be able to accomplish what you're trying to do, however. Just make sure that you use the  data type if you want string indexing.should work just fine. Otherwise, you can store individual values and put them in a list later.
