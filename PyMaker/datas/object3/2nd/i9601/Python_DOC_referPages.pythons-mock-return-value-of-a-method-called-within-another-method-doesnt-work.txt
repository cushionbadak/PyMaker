I would like to mock a method for unit testing like this:get_tree_test.pyget_tree.pyI do see that  is created as a mock object, but when I debug  method I see that get_fb_data is a function and not a mockWhat am I missing?      
You need to patch the right place. Inside , you created a global name , which the code uses directly:You need to patch that name, not the original  name; patching works by replacing a name to point to the mock instead:See the Where to patch section of the  documentation.
