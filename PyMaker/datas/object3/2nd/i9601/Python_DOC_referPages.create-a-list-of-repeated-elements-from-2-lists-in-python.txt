Being new to python, here is my problem. Given two lists:  I want to create a new list which consists of items of first list repeated n number of times, where n is the corresponding element in second list.  So I would like an output like:Where 3 is repeated 5 times, 4 is repeated 2 times and so on.My current code looks like this  which gets me:  I am trying to figure out how to get from my current stage to the output that I want. Any help would be appreciated. I was also thinking that maybe this could be done with list comprehension but I could not come up with the python code for it.
You can use list comprehension like this:The above line is equivalent to the following nested for loops:Output:
A simple list comprehension would work:If you are concerned on the memory efficiency (e.g. for large ) then you can use  to avoid the intermediate lists:
should do it.  Add to the list one element at a time, and then print all at once at the end.   is a -element list() of , and  adds the contents of the list you provide to the list you call  on.
You just need to use extend

Something a bit different
You said you were new to Python, so here's a simple way to do it, just using basic loops:
