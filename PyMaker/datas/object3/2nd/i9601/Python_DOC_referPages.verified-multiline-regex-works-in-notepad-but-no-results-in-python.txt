I'm a python noob, and I'm having a bit of trouble with regex results.  I've written out my regex and verified it works in notepad++. What must I consider when I'm transferring a regex from notepad++ to python?  I get the feeling that the \r\n within the regex is the trouble, but all I get is a "None" result for my printed results.  What is happening?  Thanks for the help!  
I'd suggest turning  into an optional subpattern and optimize the Group 2 subpattern as follows:See the regex demo. Note that the commas inside  are meaningful, if you used them as range delimiters, consider removing the commas. I left the spaces inside  only because it might be handy if you plan to use  flag that will make all whitespace in the pattern (outside character classes) meaningless (used for formatting purposes only).Note that  flag is redundant because it only redefines the behavior of  and  anchors, and does not have any affect on the input string parsing.Pattern description: - Group 1 capturing  - an optional CR followed with LF - 1+ regular spaces - Group 2 capturing a sequence of: - 1 or more ASCII letters, , space,  - one or more occurrence of:  - a space - 1 or more ASCII letters,  or .
I figured it'd be something that related to \r\n, but why is \r included in notepad++, but not in the python file?See Reading and Writing Files:Normally, files are opened in text mode, â€¦In text mode, the default when reading is to convert platform-specific line endings (\n on Unix, \r\n on Windows) to just \n.
