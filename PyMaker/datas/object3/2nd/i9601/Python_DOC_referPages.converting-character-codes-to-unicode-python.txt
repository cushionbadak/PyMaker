So I have a large csv of french verbs that I am using to make a program, in the csv, verbs with accent characters contain codes instead of the actual accents:être is Ãªtre, for example (atleast when I open the file in Excel)Here is the csv:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ianmackinnon/inflect/master/french-verb-conjugation.csvIn Chrome and Firefox atleast, the codes are converted to the correct accents. I was wondering if once the string is imported in python into a given a variable, ie.if there was a straightforward/built in method for printing it out with correct unicode to give "être"?I am aware that you could do this by replacing the Ãª's with ê's in each string but since this would have to be done for each different possible accent, I was wondering if there was an easier way.Thanks,
You can use unicode encoding by prefixing a string with 'u'.
It all comes down to the character encoding of the data. Its possible that it is utf-8 encoded and you are viewing it in a Windows tool that is using your local code page, which gives a different display for the stream. How to read/write with files is covered in the csv doc examples.You've given us a zipped, utf-8 encoded web page and the  modules is good at handling that sort of thing. So, you could read the csv with:
You have a UTF-8-encoded file.  Excel likes that encoding to start with a byte order mark character (U+FEFF) or it assumes the default ANSI encoding for your version of Windows instead.  To get UTF-8 with BOM, use a tool like Notepad++.  Open the file in Notepad++.  On the Encoding menu, select "Encode in UTF-8-BOM" and save.  Now it will display correctly in Excel.To write a file that Excel can open, use the encoding  and write Unicode strings:
