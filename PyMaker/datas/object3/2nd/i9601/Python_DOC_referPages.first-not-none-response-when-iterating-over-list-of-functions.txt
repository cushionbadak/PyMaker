I've got a list of functions, each of which can return  or a valid value. I want to take the result of the first  response:This works, but I don't like that I've had to execute the function twice to perform the test and generate the result. Is there any way to only execute  once and maintain the solution?PS. I know I can do this in a  or traditional loop (that's how the code currently is), I'm looking for a nice one liner :)
Use the  function to remove any falsey results (including ) as you iterate:To make sure you use the iterator version of  in Python 2 as well I used the  function from the  module.Just a demo to show that this won't execute more functions than needed:
