The R  could be replaced with a list comprehension, but fair enough a list comprehension doesn't strictly avoid the writing of a loop. In addition to  you should take a look at Pandas, which provides Python alternatives to several of the functionality that people use in R.The above code results in a new list with the square values of the imput:Here, I passed the vector to a series constructor  and apply an anonymus function . The output is a pandas series which can be converted back to a list if desired . Pandas series have a lot of functionalities and are ideal for many data manipulation and analysis tasks.
You can use function map that receives a function to apply to an iterable. Documentation to map map: hereFor example, you cans pass an anonymus function (using lambda) to apply to each element to the list by this way:
