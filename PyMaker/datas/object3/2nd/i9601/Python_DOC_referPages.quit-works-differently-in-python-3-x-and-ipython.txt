The built-in function  behaves differently in Python-3.x and IPython 3. The following code prints  if executed in IPython, but does not print anything in Python:What is the purpose of  in IPython? What was the reason for changing its behavior?
It looks like 's / "function" simplifies to just setting a flag to say "you should exit when this is next checked". It doesn't raise  itself, so it's presumably dependent on an intermittent check that, if you queue both commands at once, isn't performed until the second command finishes.You can check it yourself at the IPython prompt, first run  to see that it's a callable class whose  delegates to . Next, run  and you'll see that  just sets a flag,  (and it's a plain attribute if you check it, not a  with hidden code execution).You're welcome to track down where  is checking that; I'm guessing it's done after any given line or cell of  completes.Fundamentally, the difference is that  in IPython has never been the same as  in regular Python's interactive interpeter; / as a built-in is intended to be replaced for alternate interactive interpreters, and needn't behave exactly the same. If you want a consistent exit behavior,  and run , which is also the correct way to exit early inside a script, and is not intended as a hook for the interactive prompt.
