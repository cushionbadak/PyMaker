I am an intermediate Python programmer. In my experiment, I use Linux command that outputs some results something like this:My goal is to collect the value of parameter  which is variable from time to time (In this case it is just 1). I use the following slicing but it does not work:I think I am using slicing wrong here but I tried many ways but I still get nothing. Can someone help me to extract the value of  parameter from this string?Thank you very much :)
How about regex?
1) Use regular expressions:2)  returns the highest index in the string where substring is found, it will find the rightmost  (of ), that is not what you want. 3) Simple slicing won't help you because you need to know the length of the active value, overall it is not the best tool for this task.
