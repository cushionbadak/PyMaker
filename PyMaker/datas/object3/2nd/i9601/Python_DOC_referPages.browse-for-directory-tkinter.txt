I want to create a browse button with tkinter to browse for a directory that contains certain files. I am making a program that is supposed to copy files and run some controls on these files in a certain directories, but the directory can vary from time to time. The browse button will be on the start page, and you should be able to choose a directory and then click another button to run one of the controls in the program and the files of the directory will be used during the control. I have also added an entry where it should state what directory is chosen. Does anyone know how to browse for a directory and store the path of it for later use? And how to tie together an entry and the directory chosen through browsing?My tkinter script looks something like this (work in progress):NOTE: I have more code for the rest of the control etc., I just added what is relevant for the question. Working in Python 3.4.1. Thankful for answers!
Try reading through the  module. It has some interesting things on the finding of paths, you can just store these as string variables as they are absolute paths. Another useful thing is,  or , they give the near same thing, a path to the current directory. The first give which directory the file was executed in and the second is which directory the file is in.
