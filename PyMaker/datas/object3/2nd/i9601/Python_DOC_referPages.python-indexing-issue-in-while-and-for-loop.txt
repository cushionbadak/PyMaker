I am adapting Schorsch's answer in While loop inside for loop in Matlab to use in Python 3.5 for my problem.I want to iterate over values in my  array. For each value, if the result of my calculation  converges (or doesn't converge after a maximum no. of iterations) I copy this to an array. Then I plot the results.I get an error: Does this mean I have to change how I index the  or  loops, and if so how should I do this?
The issue is related with the lines  and . As you are trying to access non-integers indexes.Those indexes were generated on the following line:To solve the issue, there are several ways to do it, but the easiest is simply to access the same index the value from the  variable is on.Using the while loop to iterate the maximum times a value, while it doesn't converge
