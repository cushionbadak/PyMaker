I have the following object:How to add a new element to FILES?I tried: I use this example and need to add to tuple all files from directory: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/google-appengine/QOMzUhZ2b3Q
and just like what Moses Koledoye says, tuple object is immutable.If you want to add or remove to ,try:If you want to change the name of the file or the value of T/F, use  instead of .But I think these codes are so ugly. I prefer to create a class instead of using the list.There's also a simple way if your file only have 2 attributes (name and flag).
You are using here tuples. There are immutable and you can't add something after they are created.The best way is to use here an another data Structure: Lists!now the append function can do its jobmore about different data structures here:https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.htmlIf you need a more difficult and performant structure read about "Dictionaries".
