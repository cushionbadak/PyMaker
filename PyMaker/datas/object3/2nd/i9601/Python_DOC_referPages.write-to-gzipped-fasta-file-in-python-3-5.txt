I have just migrated all modules in my tool from python 2 to python 3. I run into a problem I just could not solve - I don't know how to write to gzipped fasta file.This code works in python 2 but it does not work in python 3, it raises:TypeError: memoryview: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'How should I fix the problem?
The  function, unlike the regular  function, defaults to binary mode, not text mode. You have to explicitly pass a  as part of the mode string to open in text mode (which accepts/expects ):To avoid line ending conversion, you may also want to pass  (the empty string) so that, on a system like Windows, it doesn't convert  to  when it writes.
Try converting the string which is returned from  to a  object. returns the record as a . converts the  to a  object.
