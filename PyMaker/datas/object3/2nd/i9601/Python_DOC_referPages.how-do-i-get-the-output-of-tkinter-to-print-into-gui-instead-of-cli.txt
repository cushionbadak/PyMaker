I have been working on with this code and I get my output to the terminal. How do i get the output to print in the tkinter GUI window insted? Here's the code:
Use subprocess instead of os.system. There are many functions to work with external command.I use  to get result of executed command. Command has to be as list . Command can be single string if you use .BTW: because  takes some time so  will freeze for this time. If you need non-freezing version you will need other functions in  or  module.
