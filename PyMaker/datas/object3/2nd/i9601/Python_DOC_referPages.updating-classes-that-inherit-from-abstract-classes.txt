You can't just define a new class named  and expect the subclasses to find it magically.Normally, if you wanted to monkey-patch  after creation to add new methods, you could just do something like:But unfortunately, s for s are an explicit exception to this rule:Dynamically adding abstract methods to a class, or attempting to modify the abstraction status of a method or class once it is created, are not supported.You must either define the abstract base class completely up front, or redefine the entire class hierarchy later if you want to add new abstract methods to the base class.
