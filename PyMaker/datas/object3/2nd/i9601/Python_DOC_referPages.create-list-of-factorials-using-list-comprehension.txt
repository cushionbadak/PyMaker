I'm trying to build a list of the first ten factorials using only list comprehension. Is that possible?I don't know generators or .Here's my attempt, but I absolutely know why it's wrong:
Just for fun:One-liner mega-hack using list comprehension and an auxililary accumulator to reuse previously computed valueresult:note: The  answer is the way when elements are random. Here it's faster because we can reuse previous results.There's also another drawback: the need to store all elements in a  because python does not allow  and assignment like C does. So we have to append to a list and negate the  it returns so  test is As I said: fun, but still a hack.
You can use :Output:
Your attempt does not work because the list comprehension works element-wise, you cannot refer to  like that. There is a  function in  module, however, since you mentioned generators, you can use one like this
