I am using gunicorn to run my Flask application, however when the Flask application exits because of an error, gunicorn will create a new worker and not exit.sample Flask application:I tried using gunicorn's worker_exit server hook:But this just throws an error and continues to spawn workers:Edit: modified the exit code for my application to:  as per https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/blob/master/gunicorn/arbiter.py#L37. This time the application does not infinitely restart but when there are 2 or more workers, this throws an exception:How can I make the application exit without any exceptions being triggered.
This exits gunicorn:
Look at the preload_app option in  configuration. This will load your application in the parent. It should then be able to raise an exception and  will not start.
For the sake of completeness use standard errcodes:https://docs.python.org/3/library/errno.html#errno.EINTRso:
