This question already has an answer here:Comparing two identical objects in Python (2.7) returns False                    1 answer                I am looking at simple python code like belowand output is That's the advantage of OOP concept, I understand. But what makes it different like when two different objects are reference to same class they almost have same properties but something is different and I want to know that property which is different. EDIT: I think this question is not duplicate to given question below. I want to see each object more deeply something like skeleton structure. They have different ID's I can understand that because object ID concept in python is something similar to variable ID's concept , only ID's assigning concept.  Thank you.
It is called identity and you can get (a numeric representation of) it by using the function .The only thing which is necessarily different in two objects is the identity (the result of calling  on them, if you want to be pragmatic). Everything else can be the same.
