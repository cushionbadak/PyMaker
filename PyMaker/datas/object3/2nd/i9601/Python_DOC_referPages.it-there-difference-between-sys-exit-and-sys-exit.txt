I am aware of some facts about . However, I have seen some usage of , is there any differences between them?
One would be use to exit out and display a message on the console, so if you are for example running a game and let's say you have a menu:Option 1 - PlayOption 2 - OptionsOption 3 - Exit If the user selects option 3 you could then call sys.exit() but what if you wanted to show a nice message to engage them say sys.exit('Thank you for playing I hope you come back soon') basically that will be displayed after the player selects option 3.
