This question already has an answer here:Does Python have a ternary conditional operator?                    28 answers                I ran into this expression in a question here about knapsack problems:When I try to write out line two  in a more general form I get an error:
I feel it is important to point out that what you describe () is not a conditional expression per se, but it does include one:  is a conditional expression is a compound statement which comprises a simple  statement with a conditional expression.So, if the first  evaluates to , then the conditional expression will be  evaluated and the appropriate element (in this case  or ) returned to the preceding statement (, here).
You have found the ternary operator, which is known as a Conditional Expression in Python. The expression  means that if the condition (which can be a complex statement or function) evaluates to True, the expression returns , and if the condition evaluates to False, the expression returns .It works like the following if-statement:Your error stems from not wrapping the print function arguments in a parentheses. This is a change made to Python 3, whereas in Python 2, your syntax would have been fine. Rewrite it to look like:and your error will go away.
It is an if-expression:  means: if condition is true, then the expression has value a, otherwise bYour problem is unrelated, Seems you are using python 3, you got the example from python 2. In python 3 print is a function, so just add parentheses 
if you are using python of version >3, then print should have parenthesis i.e ()
