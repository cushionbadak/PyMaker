So I have a set of test cases which give me two lists with numbers. My task is to calculate the euclidean distance with the given lists. However, I am not getting the right results. I am instead getting 3.7416573867739413, 3.0, 2.0 and 2.0. This is what I have so far, and I am not sure what I am doing wrong.
The problem is here:So for each point in , you are visiting all points in . For example, for  and , this loop would generate pairs  But what you want to do is to look at only . This can be achieved with the zip function. If you iterate over , it will iterate over those points. You can confirm this by executing So if you change the nested loops with a single loop over zip, it will calculate the correct distance.
