Here is a small sample how to realize a client counter with the select.select function. I actually took it from the great article select â€“ Wait for I/O Efficiently on pymotw.com and added a client counter. Basically you look for readable sockets and try to receive data from them. If a socket returns nothing it means it has been closed and can be removed from the client list.
