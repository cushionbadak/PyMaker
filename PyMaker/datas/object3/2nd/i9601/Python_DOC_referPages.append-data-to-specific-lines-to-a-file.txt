Natural Text
Lets say i have a file called text.txt with the dataAnd i have a list in python lets call it myListHow do i append the first item of the list besides the Name in the txt.I tried doingBut by doing this, every value of i gets on the last line in the txt file, and i have no idea how to do it so just the index[0] gets on first and so on.Would appreciate some help here!
You can do that, if you get each line, you can append whatever you like at the end of it and rewrite it to a file. In addition, you should check if the number of line match the number of element in your list, etc. to make it safer. 
this code isn't right. get items from MyList and write MyList again?MyList is  not file.so try this code'a' mode will always be at the end of the file.more information found https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open
