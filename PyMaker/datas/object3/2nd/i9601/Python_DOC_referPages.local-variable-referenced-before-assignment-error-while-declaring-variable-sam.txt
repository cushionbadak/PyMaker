I keep on getting this variable unbound error but i do not seem to understand why.Importing it seems fine. I am using django 1-10
The problem is that you just redefine Document inside SaveDocument() function.Just rename local variable to  instead of :
When Python parses the body of a function definition and encounters an assignment such as Python interprets  as a local variable by default.Hence, when you mentioned:The  you imported was no longer accessible within your  function. In order to make this work, change it to:and use the referrence of  in rest of your code.You may verify this via telling Python to use the  reference of  (which will let you execute your current code) as:As per the Python's The  statement document:The global statement is a declaration which holds for the entire current code block. It means that the listed identifiers are to be interpreted as globals. It would be impossible to assign to a global variable without global, although free variables may refer to globals without being declared global.
