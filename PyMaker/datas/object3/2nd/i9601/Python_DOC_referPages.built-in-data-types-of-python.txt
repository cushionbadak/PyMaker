These are the main built-in data types that I know in Python:NumbersStringsListsTuplesDictionariesBooleanSetsMy question is, are integers and float numbers considered to be the same data type? Or are they two separate built-in data types?Thanks!
Quoting the python library reference:There are four distinct numeric types: plain integers, long integers,  floating point numbers, and complex numbers. In addition, Booleans are  a subtype of plain integers. Plain integers (also just called  integers) are implemented using long in C, which gives them at least  32 bits of precision. Long integers have unlimited precision. Floating  point numbers are implemented using double in C. All bets on their  precision are off unless you happen to know the machine you are  working with.
According to the Python documentation:The principal built-in types are numerics, sequences, mappings, classes, instances and exceptions.Numeric Types: , , Sequence Types: , , Text Sequence Type: Binary Sequence Types: , , Set Types: , Mapping Types: â€” Other Built-in Types:Modules, Classes and Class Instances, Functions, Methods, Code Objects, Type Objects, the Null Object (), the Ellipsis Object, the NotImplemented Object, Boolean Values ( and ), Internal Objects.Answering your question:Are integers and float numbers considered to be the same data type?There are three distinct numeric types: integers, floating point numbers, and complex numbers. Floating point numbers are usually implemented using double in C.Probably you are a bit confused because mathematically speaking any number of type  and any number of type  belong to the set of the real numbers. The  module defines a hierarchy of numeric abstract base classes: , , , , and . However, none of the types defined in this module can be instantiated.You can use these classes to check if a specific number is an instance of them:
