So I have been sitting on this problem for a while, and after searching through multiple other questions cannot find the answer I need.I have been set a task to make a 4 digit random number generator then the user has to try and guess the number. Each try they have it says how many numbers they got right and which position they are in.Also the number needs to be in the correct positioning.This is my current code.Thanks in advance :)
This is my take on it.The code has been restructured a bit to loop around until the user actually finds the secret number. This is just a framework upon which you can experiment a bit and try to optimize it further in terms of user interaction or whatnot.If anything is unclear, let me know. Cheers!
You can  the random number and the user's choice and compare the pairs:To get the total number of matching numbers, regardless of their position, you could feed both the number and the user's choice through a  and get their intersection with :
I think the key to this is using a string of digits rather than a numeric data type. Here's a working example. You can do it by comparing numbers but, in this case, we don't care about numeric value so much as the pattern of characters.
