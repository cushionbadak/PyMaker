I was expecting:If I use the  method instead of , the effect is OK.Can anyone clarify this point, please?
It's about mutable or immutable type and value or reference parameter. Python pass "reference" but not really ( here for for details : https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2012/11/13/is-python-callbyvalue-or-callbyreference-neither/)Python documentation :https://docs.python.org/3/faq/programming.html#how-do-i-write-a-function-with-output-parameters-call-by-referenceA similar question : How do I pass a variable by reference?
This line , creates a new local variable  inside your  function, that's why the outside one is not changed. Take a look at these examples:Inside , we have 2 different ids:  for the param  and  for the local variable . In  function the same id is printed, which means the same param  is changed inside the function.
In n = n*2 creates a local variable inside test function, return n and assign it to n with the resultsOutput:
In python, generally it is confusing to refer to arguments being passed to function as either pass by value/pass by reference. n=[9]The above statement binds n to a List object containing single element of value 9. (i.e. [9] in this case) When n = n * 2 This creates a new List and bound to a variable which is local to the scope of the function.
