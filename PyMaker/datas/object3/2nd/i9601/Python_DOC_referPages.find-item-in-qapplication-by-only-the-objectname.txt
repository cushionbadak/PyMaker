i want to find any object by a objectname  string name inside of the QApplicationSomething likewhich should return a list of widgets with this classname that i can iterate over if there is more then oneI have read this but it requires a object and i want something like This is something i came up with for testing:It doesn't even find the 'InfoFrame' which is clearly there:â€©{}
I came up with this which works quite well
In Python, this can be done for any class using the gc module. It provides a method for retrieving the references of all objects tracked by the garbage-collector. This is obviously a quite inefficient approach, but it does (almost) guarantee that any type of object can be found.Here's a function to get a list of all  instances either by class-name or object-name:This is only really a debugging tool, though - for a large application, there could easily be several hundred thousand objects to check.If you only need objects which are subclasses of , use this function:
It is not possible to find all  instances in general. Qt does not keep track of them since objects can be used in multiple threads and the overhead of tracking them would be unnecessarily high.Qt does keep track of all widgets, though, since widgets can only exist in the main thread, and they are fairly heavy objects so tracking them has comparably little overhead.So, you could search all widgets you get from , and all of their children. You can also look through children of objects you otherwise have access to. But if a given object is parentless, or is not owned by a widget, then you won't find it that way.
