This question already has an answer here:How to return multiple values from a function? [closed]                    14 answers                I have a simple script that checks various Linux processes and, finding one of them, logs a particular message ("particular" in terms of referencing the service's name).My question: what is the proper, Pythonic way to have a multi-conditional function return a boolean and a string (for use in a printed message)?Here's a stripped-down version of my current solution (using tuples):This works, but I care about doing it correctly (stylistically, in particular, but if you glean incorrect logic in this brief sample, please feel free to comment there, too. Appreciate your assistance!
An empty string in Python is "falsey", so it's somewhat redundant to return (False, ''). I might do this instead:(See 4.1 Truth Value Testing)
I think this would be pythonic too (but may be it's just me)
