I'm trying to print the output of an astronomy simulation so that it looks nice in my console. I generate 4 numpy arrays called Amplitude, Mass, Period and Eccentricity and I want to put them in a table. The first index of each array are the values for planet 1, the second for planet 2 etc.So my arrays look like (values are all float numbers, eg 'a1' just a placeholder):I'd like my table to look like:I've tried using tabulate and something like:but I get an error of 'numpy.float64' object is not iterableAny help would be appreciated!
Use  like this:Instead of using , you can use  like below:Output:
tabulate.tabulate() takes a list of lists (or arrays) as its main argument, you've given it a list of floats (and a '1').So you want to put in all your data at once.You'll need to create new lists where each is one horizontal row of the new table. You'll also need to add the row number at the front.First build new lists/arrays where:And then try:
You can combine the usage of zip() with tabulate to create a nicer looking table:Output:
You can use .For example:output:
