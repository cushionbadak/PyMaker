Using python 3.4.3 or python 3.5.1 I'm surprised to see that:returns:Worse part is that this specific use case works with float.Is there anything I could do to make sure the maths work and 0 multiplied by anything returns 0? 
 actually is  (it's short for ; since the coefficient is 0, that's still 0),  just provides the  bit to indicate the "confidence level" of the . What you've got will still behave like zero (it's falsy, additive identity, etc.), the only quirk is in how it prints.If you need formatting to match, you can use the formatting mini-language, or you can call  on the result, which will turn  into  (the method's purpose is to strip trailing zeroes from the result to produce a minimal canonical form that represents all equal numbers the same way).
Even though  is not visually the same as , there is no difference to python.The notation 0E-12 actually represents: 0 * 10 ** -12. This expression evaluates to 0. 
You may quantize your result to required precision.For more info (eg. about rounding modes or even setting up a context for all decimals) refer to https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.htmlEdit: I guess your best hit would be using  method as mentioned by ShadowRanger.
Do the multiplication with floats and convert to decimal afterwards.returns (on Python 3.5.2):
