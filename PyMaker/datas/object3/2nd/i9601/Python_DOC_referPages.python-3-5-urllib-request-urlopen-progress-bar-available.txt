I'm trying to search the world wide web for this answer, but I feel there answer may be no. I'm using Python 3.5 and a library called  with a method called  to open a link and download a file. It would be nice to have some kind of measure of progress for this, as the file(s) are over 200MB. I'm looking at the API here, and don't see any kind of parameter with a hook. Here's my code: Can anyone provide insight if they think I can potentially have a progress bar or would the only way be to use a different library? I'm looking to keep the code quite short and simple, I just need some indication of the file being downloaded. Thanks for any help provided!
If the response includes a  you can read the incoming data in blocks and calculate percent done. Unfortunately, web servers that "chunk" responses don't always provide a content length, so it doesn't always work. Here is an example to test.
