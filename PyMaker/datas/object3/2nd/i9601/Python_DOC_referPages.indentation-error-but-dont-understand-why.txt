I wrote a python programm and when I lauch it, it says that there is a IndentationError, I know what is it but don't understand why. Everything seems legit to me :/Don't mind about the french part, it's not important. The important part is with the  functions.PS: I use python since 6 months so I know what I'm doing but I'm not a proThanks :D
You cannot leave something below a ':' blank.If you don't want to do anything then write:
You can not write something like:This raises  exception, so if you want to implement that later you can use  like below:From  documentation:The pass statement does nothing. It can be used when a statement is  required syntactically but the program requires no action.
