Natural Text
I need some help with code in a text based game I am trying to make. My game uses health, and the code starts off with "while health>0:", and in another point in the game, when health eventually =0, the loop still continues. How do I make the loop end when health=0, without finishing the whole loop. Here is an example:Should the code not be stopping when health=0, and not print "test"? How to I get it to stop when health=0? The code I wrote deducts health based on  the users actions, so the times when health=0 can vary. I want to end the code whenever health=0 Any help would be appreciated.
The condition is only evaluated at the start of each iteration. It does not get checked in the middle of an iteration (e.g. as soon as you set to  to zero).To explicitly exit the loop, use :
The  statement, like in C, breaks out of the smallest enclosing  or  loop.  
You should use 'break' statement to come out of the loop
