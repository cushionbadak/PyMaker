This is my code:The problem is that when I debug I saw that the program reads only one character values (this line  and I need the first value (there are multiple values).Any suggestions what is the problemThank you very much for your help
Could you please format your code like this:You do that by typing enter two times, then for each line of code indenting four spaces. To type normally after that, start a new line and do not type the four spaces at the start of it.If I understand what you are asking, you want to swap the key and value of the dictionary, and you are getting an error while doing so. I cannot read your unformatted code (no offense), so I will provide a dictionary swapping technique that works for me.This code works by having the original dictionary,  and the uncompleted reversed dictionary, . It iterates through , which only provides the key, and using that key, it finds the value. The value that we want to be a key is assigned to  and the key that we want to be a value is assigned to . It then updates the reversed dictionary with the new key/value. The final line prints the new, reversed dictionary. If you want to set  to the reversed dict, use . I hope this answers your question.
As has been pointed out in the comments, the values in your  are strings, thus iterating over them will produce single characters. Split them into the desired tokens and it will work:
If what you want is the reverse your dictionary values (separated by commas), the following may be the solution that you're looking for: used to remove spaces at the beginning / end of each value used to split values (using  separator) used to reverse the resulted list used to form the final value for each key of Output:
