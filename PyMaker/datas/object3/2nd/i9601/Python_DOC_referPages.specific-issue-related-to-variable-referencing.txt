Now, I want to make it clear that I do not want to include the variable  as an argument of the function . Is there any other way I could go about rewriting this code, given that g is called recursively? Even mentioning b = 0 and calling it as a global does not seem to help with the reference assignment error.

 is used when you explicitly want to use and update a  variable. So you need to use  inside your function instead of outside:Because you use  inside your  function you need to declare  as . Otherwise you get a :UnboundLocalError: local variable 'b' referenced before assignmentSee also the Python FAQ:What are the rules for local and global variables in Python?In Python, variables that are only referenced inside a function are implicitly global. If a variable is assigned a value anywhere within the function’s body, it’s assumed to be a local unless explicitly declared as global.Though a bit surprising at first, a moment’s consideration explains this. On one hand, requiring  for assigned variables provides a bar against unintended side-effects. On the other hand, if  was required for all  references, you’d be using  all the time. You’d have to declare as  every reference to a built-in function or to a component of an imported module. This clutter would defeat the usefulness of the  declaration for identifying side-effects.
It might make people's hair stand on end but you could add  as an attribute to .
