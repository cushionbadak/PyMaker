Please go through the below code and explain me how I am able to achieve the output for the code which I have shared:Output:
The allocation for the objects just happens to use the same memory location, this isn't something that isn't allowed.Since you create instances which immediately get collected due to no references existing for them, chances are that Python has the opportunity to re-use the same memory which results in some of them having the same address, see in the documentation for the  function:Return the “identity” of an object. This is an integer which is guaranteed to be unique and constant for this object during its lifetime. Two objects with non-overlapping lifetimes may have the same  value.(emphasis mine)
