When I execute this code I get the following error: AttributeError: 'function' object has no attribute 'labels_'I understand that this message is triggered by the method:clusterWithFewestSamplesby lines like: minSamples = len(model.labels_)Any hint on what's wrong or what's lacking?Many thanks in advance.Jordi
Where does  come from?In  nothing ever gets assigned to , I'm surprised it doesn't throw a NameError exception.  Maybe it should be An  object does have a  attribute.You expect  to have a  attribute but you have defined  as a function that returns When  is called, it returns the function named So the statement  does nothing:Neither the function, , or its return value,  have a  attribute.
