Here is the description of the old style string formatting, within which octal and hexadecimal values conversion are prescribed.I've experimented with the syntax, however something unexpected occurred.Code  and  had the similar format of results, which were '0x004c7' and '0o02307' respectively. However the associated description about octal values mismatched with the behavior.The alternate form causes a leading zero ('0') to be inserted between left-hand padding and the formatting of the number if the leading character of the result is not already a zero.All code are executed within the Interactive interpreter of CPython with the version . 
I had reported the issue to the Python communityï¼Œand the bug was already fixed.The previous description has been changed into the correct one.See the Notes section,row 1.
