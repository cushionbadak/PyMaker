I have a  which stores IP addresses. The IP address could be a unique IP or a subnet. I have overloaded the  and  methods. The  works fine.Question is : When I am trying to add a duplicate element, is there a way to show the original element?I cannot use the  operation because it will take a long time since there are about 100,000 IP addresses and I could create only like 5 different buckets for the . An exampleI added the subnet 10.0.0.0/8 to the .I then tried to add the unique IP 10.10.10.10 to the .The  won't add the unique IP because it is a duplicate of the subset 10.0.0.0/8. At such a situation I want to show the user:10.10.10.10 duplicate of 10.0.0.0/8P.S : I just went through the definition of  operation. It just shows if the element is already present or not. It won't show the original element. (I am not a python developer).P.P.S : I am reading a firewall ACL list. I am adding lot more than just add IP address to the set. That is why I can't show the code here. The code works.
You could look at the intersection of the IP address set and a new set containing just the item you want to add to the set.In the case of a new item not being in the set you will do two lookups.Edit: Intersection will always return the member of the smaller set see here. Therefore you could use this method instead:
