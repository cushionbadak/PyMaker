I want to add a tuple (called pointer) to another tuple, then apply a clamp function I created to each of its elements, then finally return the new tuple.I am sure there is a better way to do this:[OUTPUT] pointer: (2, 3)
One way would be to use  to create a clamping function with mixed limits, and then map that over the map object you get after the adding operation.outputAnother way would be to combine the adding and clamping into a single function. In the code below I use a function  which returns a function that does the adding and clamping using the limits passed to .
You can partially apply  manually:So define a new function...And finallySome people find comprehensions/generator expressions more readable, though. And there is no need to define a new function.
you can use itertools.chain, The itertools.chain() method can be used to simplify this task. It takes a list of iterables as input, and returns an iterator that effectively masks the fact that youâ€™re really acting on multiple containers. To illustrate, consider this example:
