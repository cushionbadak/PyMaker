Natural Text
I basically want to create a new list 'T' which will match if each element in the list 'Word' exists as a separate element in the list 'Z'.ie I want the output of 'T' in the following case to be T = ['Hi x']I tried the following code but it gives me all sentences with words having 'x' in it however I only want the sentences having 'x' as a separate word.
Just another pythonic way

if you want to print all strings from  that contain a word from :Notice the . Without the break you could get some strings from  twice, if two words from it would match. Like the  in the example.The  expression splits  to words on spaces.

If you would store  as a  instead of  you could use  operations for check. Basically following splits every string on whitespace, constructs  out of words and checks if  is subset or not.In above  is same as .
