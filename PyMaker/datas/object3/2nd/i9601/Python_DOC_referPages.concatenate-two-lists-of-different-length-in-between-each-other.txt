I have two list of different sizes, n and n-1. I have to concatenate two lists that look like thisThey have to be concatenated to get s.th like thisI have tried to figure out an elegant way to do this but only managed to come up with this solutionwhich prints I am looking for a nicer implementation or how I can get rid of the final dash ()EDIT: To clarify, the lists will be dynamic and list2 can contain arbitrary characters. e.g: 
Try following:    Update add izip_longest version:
You might use the Many posibilities, e.g.
Try this,Just add a black () element at end of . Then just apply  and .Tried with another example, 
Assuming your lists always correct, you can do:Iterate on the two lists simultaneously, and add an item from  and then from . When the loop terminates, you have one more item in , which you append manually.Another solution would be having a separate counter for each list:
You can use NumPy arrays, as their indexing tools are very useful for the purpose of the OP:The result will be:
Borrowing from this answer regarding interleaving lists:
You can slice the first list to get a sublist with the same length as the second list, then apply  to the result.  is used to add the other elements of the first list:
There are several external packages that have builtin functions for this kind of "interleaving" of iterables, just to show one of them:  (note, that I'm the author of this library):The  is just a wrapped  call.Just to name a few alternatives:These are generalized solutions that work on an arbitary number of sequences and iterables. With only two iterables and if you don't want to use external packages using a  or  approach (see other answers) is probably easier.
