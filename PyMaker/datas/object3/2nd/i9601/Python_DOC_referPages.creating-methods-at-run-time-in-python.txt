I am quite new to python and I am trying to write a simple implementation of REST api calls. My goal is to be able to create methods of a class at run time and to be able to use method names as basis for API calls. For example list_virtual_networks will turn into GET to http://localhost:8080/virtual-networks, etc. I'd also want to practice at some more advanced object oriented techniques. Here's my approach:Here's what I see in logs:2016-12-08 23:05:03,034 - AgentLogger - INFO - Returning method with name function wrapper_function at 0x1073c8d70>2016-12-08 23:05:03,034 - AgentLogger - INFO - Returning method with name NoneI hope I made myself clear enough to explain what I wanted to achieve. Is there a way to solve it at least roughly in a way I am trying to do it?
When writing function wrappers, a good tool to use is the  function in the  library provided by the Python's stdlib: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.wraps (particularly the "renaming" stuff you wanted to do)
I found a solution for that. I added a decorator, that is used to rename functionsThen I apply this decorator to the handler function, defined in __getattr__ in addition to the decorator that I already applied:Now when a method that is not defined in class is called, it gets assigned a decorated code defined in handler function.
