I'm trying to import the "run" module in subprocess.Is this only for python 3.5?I'm trying on python 3.4 and it says it cant import.
That is correct. From the Python documentation1:The run() function was added in Python 3.5; if you need to retain  compatibility with older versions, see the Older high-level API2  section.
