As an example:  is considered a function but,  is known as the  method. Why is  a function? Isn't the dot access indicative of methods?
Because  is a module*, not a class.  is a function defined inside the module . You can access objects that have been defined in a module by normal dot  access on the module object. With modules though, no transformation of the function object occurs during that access, the object returned as is.Specifically, since functions are descriptors, their  isn't invoked when accessed through the module. is a function that's defined inside the  class. When you invoke it on a  instance using dot access, it is transformed into a method which implicitly receives the instance as a first argument.Specifically, when accessed through a class, a function object's   is invoked which, in turn, transforms the function into a method type.*Okay, I hate to do this, because it is confusing, but modules are also classes. They are special in that they don't do the transformation as described previously. Specifically, their getattribute function that is invoked when an attribute is requested, doesn't act like the default for classes.
