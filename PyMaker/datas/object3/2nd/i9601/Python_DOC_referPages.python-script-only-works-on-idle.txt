This question already has an answer here:When do I need to call mainloop in a Tkinter application?                    4 answers                I have had this script for some time. However, it only runs if I start it from IDLE; if I try to run it from the desktop it doesn't start. It is a clock made with Tkinter.
You need to start the Tkinter mainloop. Just addto the end of the script after your call.The reason that your script works in IDLE is that IDLE itself is a Tkinter program, and it already has an event loop going as mentioned in this answer.BTW, that  statement in  is pointless.FWIW, here is your program with the mainloop call added, and a few other minor changes. It's better to avoid "star" imports because they clutter your namespace with the imported names, eg  brings in over 130 names. This can cause collisions with names you define yourself, unless you're intimately familiar with every name that Tkinter defines, but it's especially problematic if you use a star import with another module that happens to use names that Tkinter uses.As Bryan Oakley mentions in the comments, it's better to just update the text string of the Canvas Text item, rather than trashing the old Text item and building a fresh one every second. So here's a new version derived from your code. I use  to build the time string because it gives nicer output than simply slicing the  object returned by : it always uses 2 digits for the hours, minutes, and seconds components, and you can easily add colons (or whatever) to the format string. Please see the linked docs for all the format options that  provides.I've also put the GUI into a class. That's not really necessary for such a simple GUI, but it's a good habit to get into because it makes the code more modular.
