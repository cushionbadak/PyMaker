Consider the following function:a. If x is 3 and y is 4, what will be the values of i for each loop iteration?b. What will be the value of z at the end of each loop iteration? (What is z after the first iteration? What is z after the second iteration?) I have the answers:a. 0,1,2b. 4,8,12I know these are super simple questions but I just started this and I don't know how to read functions and stuff. I would love some explanation on why the answers are what they are.
Ok, I'm trying to explain you this program as simple as possible.You need to call this program somewhere in Python by . you can use any int instead of 3 and 4.After the function call, value of x and y in python would be 3 and 4. So,  would be  which is . Hence i value changes from 0-2. (0 in first iteration and 2 in last). value would be incremental, as you are doing addition on  and  itself.So, it is like this,1 iteration. z = 0 + 0  2 iteration. z = 0 + 1  3 iteration. z = 1 + 2and the function returns 3.
a. If x is 3 and y is 4, what will be the values of i for each loop iteration?  It's easy to test this out with adding print statements inside the loop:Range is a function that takes two parameters, beginnig (included) and end (excluded). If there is only one value, then it is the end and beginning is set to 0 by default. Therefore, if x is 3, the values in loops would be 0, 1, 2. but not 3 as this is excluded in Python 2.x. (In Python 3.x, range is replaced by xrange, and there the last value is included, and then the values are 0, 1, 2, 3.)b. What will be the value of z at the end of each loop iteration?(What is z after the first iteration? What is z after the second iteration?)  Again, use print statements:The values of z in each loop are 4, 8, 12 respectively.The answers are calculated in the following way:1st iteration: z is 0 and 4 is added to it. The value of z is now 4, as it is overwritten.2nd iteration: 4 is added to 4, therefore the end result is 8.3rd iteration: 8 + 4 = 12.Hope this helps.
1a.if you provide single value to range(). It is treated as stop value.Therefor range(3) will iterate upto <3 i.e 0 1 2.1b. because z = z + y therefor at first z = 0 + 4 , z = 4 + 4 and at last it will be z = 8 + 4.
