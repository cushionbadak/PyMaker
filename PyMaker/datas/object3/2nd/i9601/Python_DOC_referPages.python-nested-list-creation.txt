An Example result from this code would be How do I make the result 3 nested lists like [['B3', 'B2', 'C3'], ['C2', 'B3', 'A1'], ['C2', 'B2', 'C1']]I feel like there is a pretty fundamental thing I'm not understanding here and that this question has certainly already been answered but I don't know how to frame the question better to find it by searching myself.I tried append(self.hand) and extend([self.hand]) but both created more problems than they solved resulting in an example output ofThanks for any help.
You can use  to add the copy of the  to . The problem with just appending the  is that you're modifying it later with  which will be reflected to the printed results as your example shows. If you change  to  you get following output:
You can also keep your code like what it is right now, and split only the results.For example, i assume that your output is:So, you can do something like this:Output:So, in order to edit your code, you have only to edit one line: to So your  will be:Output after the edit:
