I am trying to open a csv file and load it, however it states that it cannot find the file, when it clearly exists in the file path i wrote it to be. CodeError
Try like this:Make sure your file name is not  sometimes windows takes .csv as part of the filenameTested using Python 2.7.12Checkout http://shortcode.pro/code/open-csv-file-with-python/
Posting this since it's a likely cause of problems like this, if not necessarily in this specific case.  (along with most other user folders) is a pseudo-magic folder, and you can't rely on it always being found at . In particular, just because you see a file on your desktop doesn't mean it's actually there. It could be in the   folder, and either of those could be redirected by the Windows Library folder redirection magic.If you want to get the correct path to the user's desktop dynamically, you can use the  extension to do so:(hat tip to this answer), or to get the common  folder for all users:(hat tip to this answer).Both approaches above might be replaceable on Vista and higher with code that calls  (either with  if it supports it, or directly through a  wrapper) using  and  for the user specific and commonly shared  folders.
Edited- try this
