source.xmlthere are many among pppI want to extract it to single  files :1.xml:2.xml3.xml and so onI know it can be achieved by xml.etree.ElementTreepls kindly give me an example for this, the confusing part is it has double ppp.
The solution using  module: - finds all matching elements by path - writes the element tree to a file, as XMLThe above code will parse the needed elements and write them into files  and  respectivelyhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html
In the docs (https://docs.python.org/2/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html) I found the following sentence:Children are nested, and we can access specific child nodes by index:>root[0][1].text      '2008'So you should be able to simply call them by Index after getting them out of your first big xml. Hope this is somehow helpfull :)
