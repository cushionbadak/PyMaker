I'm using this method to send data from a Java client and receiving it on a python server. The data sent is a simple string of length 10 but I'm not able to receive it on server side. It shows a blank output for received data even when the connection is established properly. I've checked this question and so I've reprogrammed my server to first receive 2 bytes and then receive the string but it's not working. Can anyone explain? I've put some comments to explain the output.Server.pyOutput
As the rest of your code on the sende side is unknown, I cannot identify the problem for sure, but there may be two possible reasons I can imagine:Sender sideYou use the code as stated in your link. If you do not receive anything, this may indicate that the  is bufferedand nothing is send, yet, although you called . Try to  it and see if you receive something.Receiver sideIn Python 3  returns a bytes object as stated in the documentation:The return value is a bytes object representing the data received.In Python 2, you get a string, as stated in the documentation:The return value is a string representing the data received.Now, as you send your strings from a Java client, which encodes in , you should decode the bytes or string again at the receiver side with  to get a Unicode string.
