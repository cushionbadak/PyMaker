So I have to create code that validate whether a password:Is at least 8 characters long   Contains at least 1 number   Contains at least 1 capital letterHere is the code:I'm not sure what is wrong, but when I enter a password that has a number - it keeps telling me that I need a password with a number in it. Any solutions?
You can use  module for regular expressions.With it your code would look like this:
 does not check if the password contains a digit, it checks all the characters according to:str.isdigit(): Return true if all characters in the string are digits  and there is at least one character, false otherwise. does not check if the password has a capital in it, it checks all the characters according to:str.isupper(): Return true if all cased characters in the string are  uppercase and there is at least one cased character, false otherwise.For a solution, please check the question and accepted answer at check if a string contains a number.You can build your own -function (Copied from linked question):and a -function:
this code will validate your password with :min length is 6 and max length is 20at least include a digit number,at least a upcase and a lowcase letterat least a special characters
You are checking isdigit and isupper methods on the entire password string object not on each character of the string. The following is a function which checks if the password meets your specific requirements. It does not use any regex stuff. It also prints all the defects of the entered password.
 checks the whole string is a digit, not if the string contains a digitReturn true if all characters in the string are digits and there is at least one character, false otherwise.  checks the whole string is in uppercase, not if the string contains at least one uppercase character.Return true if all cased characters in the string are uppercase and there is at least one cased character, false otherwise.What you need is using the  built-in function:  will return True if at least one digit is present in  will return True if at least one character is considered as uppercase.
Maybe you can use regex expression:Check uppercase letters.Check digits in password.
Python 2.7The for loop will assign a condition number for each character. i.e. Pa$$w0rd in a list would = 1,2,4,4,2,3,2,2,5. Since sets only contains unique values, the set would = 1,2,3,4,5; therefore since all conditions are met the len of the set would = 5. if it was pa$$w the set would = 2,4 and len would = 2 therefore invalid 
Or you can use this to check if it got at least one digit:
