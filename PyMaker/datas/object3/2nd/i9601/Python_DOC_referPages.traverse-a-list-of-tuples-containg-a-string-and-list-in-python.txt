I have a list of tuples which contains a string and another list. It is as follows:I want to traverse such that comparison is done as follows:and so on...That is the  written below will call the values for  and . I have implemented the following code:I know the first condition is wrong. I am stuck a little as to how to traverse to get above comparison. Any help will be appreciated.  
You could write a generator yielding pairs:Output:In above  will yield items from  as pairs. Since first parameter is longer than second one on last iteration  is used as fillvalue. Then the loop will first  generator that returns  tuples and finally yields current and next key.Update For Python 2 minor modifications are required since it doesn't have  and  is known as :
So this is very specific kind of traversal, which can be done through a generator.Update: initially tried with a complex generator expression but missed the tail so had to end up with a generator function similar to @niemmi but with a slightly different approach.
