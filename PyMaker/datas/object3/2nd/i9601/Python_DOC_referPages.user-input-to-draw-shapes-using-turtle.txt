This is supposed to be a menu-driven program with user input. I know very little about . I do know how to have the shapes drawn, but the info that I have is not given as input by the user. It's just me saying how each shape would be drawn.I am supposed to import a module and have a menu with 4 choices:Draw a circle. Draw a rectangle. Draw star.Quit.I don't know how to create or import the module, I don't know how to add the user input, and I don't know how to create the menu... So far all I have is the code pasted below. Is it completely wrong or does it just need adjustments to fit the above criteria? 
Use Tkinter.Use this template:Also you do not need to:1. import turtle more than once2. create a new turtle(just use "turtle.forward(100)" for example)Make sure to write different pieces of code inside the functionsComment back if it worked
You do not need to use a module like Tkinter to implement a menu, it can instead be done using one of the graphic input methods that are new to Python 3 turtle:Here's a skeletal example:A better approach would be to eliminate the inifinite loop  and instead use something like a timer event to bring up the initial menu, and subsequent menus after each drawing finishes.  This would let  execute and allow other types of events to fire off.If you want to allow text input instead of simply number choices, you can use  instead, but parse the user input carefully!
