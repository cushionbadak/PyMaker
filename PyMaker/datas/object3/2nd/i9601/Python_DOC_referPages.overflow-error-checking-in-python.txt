This is a factorial function. I don't understand "if n+1 == n:", then it indicates a 'too large integer' exception. Why is it that?
Python has a limit to the size of a number that it can use. Conceptually, if Python's max number is 10,000 and you enter in the number 10,001, Python will truncate that number to 10,000, thus .Here's a better answer for more details: What is the maximum float in Python?.
First off, I don't know why this program exists, because python has no limit to the highest integer (https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesnumeric). However, as the previous person says, this guards against truncation, with values like "1e300" where the difference between 10^300 and 10^300 + 1 is so small relatively that it ignores small values.
