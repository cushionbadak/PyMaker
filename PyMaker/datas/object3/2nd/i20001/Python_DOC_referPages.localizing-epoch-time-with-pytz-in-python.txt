Im working on converting epoch timestamps to dates in different timezones with pytz.  What I am trying to do is create a DateTime object that accepts an Olson database timezone and an epoch time and returns a localized datetime object.  Eventually I need to answer questions like "What hour was it in New York at epoch time 1350663248?"Something is not working correctly here:This prints the same hour, whereas one should be 3 or so hours ahead.  Whats going wrong here?  I'm a total Python beginner, any help is appreciated!
 returns localtime that shouldn't be used with an arbitrary timezone.localize(); you need  to get datetime in UTC and then convert it to a desired timezone:Or a simpler alternative is to construct from the timestamp directly:It converts from UTC implicitly in this case.
For creating the  object belonging to particular timezone from a unix timestamp,  you may pass the  object as a  parameter while creating your . For example: You can get the list of all timezones using  which returns exhaustive list of the timezone names that can be used.Also take a look at List of tz database time zones wiki.
Working from memory, so excuse any syntax errors, but that should get you on the right track.EDIT: Missed the part about knowing the hour,etc. Python has great Time/Date Formatting. At pretty much the bottom of that link is the table showing how to pull different attributes from the datetime object.
