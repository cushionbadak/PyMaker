Does Python have something like below?I mean Python 2.7 and Python 3.3 both together.
You can combine the loop with a generator expression: (py2) /  (py3) is another option:
You mean something like this: -Or, you can use  expression, that will not create a new list, rather returns a generator, which then returns the next element on each iteration using  method: -
There isn't a special syntax like the  in your question, but you could always just use an  statement within your  loop, like you would in any other language:or a guard clause (again, like any other language):Both of these boring approaches are almost as succinct and readable as a special syntax for this would be.
You could use an explicit  statement:Or you could create a generator if you need a name to iterate later, example:Or you could pass it to a function:It might be matter of taste but I find a for-loop combined with inlined genexpr such as  to be ugly compared to the above options.
Python 3 and Python 2.7 both have  function which allows extracting items out of a list for which a function (in the example below, that's lambda function) returns :Omitting function in  will extract only items that are , as stated in
