I'm trying to write python code to print the powerset of a string, but am running into some bugs. Here's what I've got:My expected output would be:My actual output is:Can anyone help me figure out what's going on? Is this some nuance of python, or is there a bug in my code? I think my code should be ok -- I'm going off the fifth edition of Cracking the coding interviewThank you!
You're overthinking itThis part is trying to do too muchSee how simple it really should beNow you should be able to make the code look a lot nicer with a little refactoring
Is this what you want?
There are a method for permutations:
Here's a refactored iterative solution without the  module:
Have you tried tracing through what your algorithm actually does?So, there's no nuance of Python here; your algorithm returns the empty list in O(N) steps, and you've coded that algorithm properly in Python.(Instead of tracing it by hand, of course, you can add some more useful print statements and see what each step is actually doing.)It probably wasn't the algorithm you wanted, but you'll need to tell us what you were trying to do. Are you, e.g., porting some pseudocode from Hoare into Python? If so, what's the pseudocode?
Use  from :This  is a convenience function directly implemented from the  recipes.
