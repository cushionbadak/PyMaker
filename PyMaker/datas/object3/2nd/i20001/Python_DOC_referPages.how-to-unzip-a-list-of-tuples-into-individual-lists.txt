Possible Duplicate:A Transpose/Unzip Function in Python I have a list of tuples, where I want to unzip this list into two independent lists. I'm looking for some standardized operation in Python. I'm looking for a succinct and pythonic way to achieve this. Basically, I'm hunting for inverse operation of  function. 
Use :The  function pairs up the elements from all inputs, starting with the first values, then the second, etc. By using  you apply all tuples in  as separate arguments to the  function, so  pairs up  with  with  first, then  with  and . Those happen to correspond nicely with the columns, or the transposition of . produces tuples; if you must have mutable list objects, just  the tuples to lists or use a list comprehension to produce a list of lists:
If you want a list of lists:If a list of tuples is OK:
