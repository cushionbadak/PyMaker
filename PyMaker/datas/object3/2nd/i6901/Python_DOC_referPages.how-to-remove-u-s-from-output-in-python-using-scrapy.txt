when i run my command im getting output like shown below. how to remove   getting every time?
You can use  to encode individual elements of list.
Your new full script for complete encoding process:
When you want to break down a nested list like that and just convert to string so you can output the list... you just need to strip and then join... which is a much more pythonic way... But if thats not the case ... when you yield as item... it wont show up... but what I was mentioning...This will make your "strings/list" into and actual string of which you can then us to write... if thats the purpose...?
