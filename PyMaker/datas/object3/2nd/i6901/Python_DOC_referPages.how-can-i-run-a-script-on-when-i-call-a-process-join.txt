I have a few processes that are meant to run in a while loop. I basically have some processes collecting data, and before they stop, I want them to save the data to a csv or json file. What I have right now is using the super function to override the join method in the multiprocessing.Process class. Is there a better way/correct way/more pythonic way to do this? 
I suggest you'll take a look at  module.if you can describe your job as list of tasks to be done by a pool of workers.Task Based multiprocessingwhen you have a sequence of  (e.g. list of filenames) and you want them to be processed in parallel - you can do so as follows:outputs:Not Task-Based MultiprocessingWhen you just want to run multiple subprocesses that not consuming jobs like the first case, you may want to use . you can use it similarly to  in a procedural fashion as well as OOP fashion.Example for procedural fashion (IMHO more pythonic):outputs:Waiting for Processes to Finishif you want to wait using  (more info on  &  on this SO answer) you can do it like this:this outputs:
