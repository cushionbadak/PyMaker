I'm receiving an error of  in the code below after finishing the  section. The Element object has is being returned in the  and it has  defined, so I'm baffled.
The value of expression after  keyword must be a valid context manager. That means the value of the expresion must have attributes  and  and these must accept parameters described in docs With Statement Context Managers. You can easily verify that the part  would be acceptable, but the value of whole expression is  and it has no necessary attribute. A difference between Python 3.5 and 3.6 is that one fails on missing  and the latter on missing . Nothing unexpected.You also forgot  in the line  that would be a problem if you will use args and it is a pythonic pattern also with unused args.
