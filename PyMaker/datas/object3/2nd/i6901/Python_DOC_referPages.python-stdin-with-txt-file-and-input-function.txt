Natural Text
I have a input.txt file with the following content.I want to use this as a standard input by using the following command in the command line.In the a.py script, I am trying to read the input line by line using  function. I know there are better ways to read the stdin, but I need to use  function. A naive approach ofdid not work. I get the following error message.
That way is ok, it works:but you are just reading one line.From the input() doc:The function then reads a line from input, converts it to a string  (stripping a trailing newline), and returns that.That means that if the file does not end with a blank line, or what is the same, the last nonblank line of the file do not end with an  character, you will get  and the last line will not be read.
You mention HackerRank; looking at some of my old submissions, I think I opted to give up on  in lieu of  manipulations.  is very similar to , but the latter will handle EOF just fine.By way of example, my answer for https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/maximize-it/
