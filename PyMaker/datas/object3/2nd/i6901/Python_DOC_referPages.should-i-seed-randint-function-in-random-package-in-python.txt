I want to check if the  function is already seeded. Should I manually seed it? If yes, how can I do that?
There is no need to explicitly seed, unless you have very specific requirements. The internal  instance is automatically seeded the first time you import the module.From the module documentation:The functions supplied by this module are actually bound methods of a hidden instance of the random.Random class.and the :so the instance calls  when the module is created.  means 'best available source of a seed' (which may be ), see :If a is omitted or , the current system time is used (together with the PID of the process). If randomness sources are provided by the operating system, they are used instead of the system time (see the  function for details on availability).
