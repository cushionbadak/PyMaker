I have this C SDK that I'm working on creating a Python extension for. The C SDK documentation says that it expects a  executable in it's working directory. My current project structure is:My setup.py:My question is, how do I package a executable dependency ( in this case) with my extension? The executable file was provided with the SDK.
I think  can be used for this: is a dict. Keys are submodule names; an empty string means the root of the package. Values are lists that list file patterns for named submodules. See the docs.
