I have the following data in a list of dictionaries. How can I effectively compare these two according to the following rule, and conclude who the winner is? if any value in a list turns out to be more than all the other values  of the other list , The list with bigger value will be declared the  winnerMy Attempt was : 
If you just want to see which list has the biggest number, you can use the builtin max function:
I assume that you consider the sequencing relevant. Your existing solution would compare every value in s1 against every value in s2. You probably want to use  to marry the two sequences together. If you expect the sequences to have different lengths, use  instead.For example:Edit:Based on your comment:if any value in a list turns out to be more than all the other values of the other list , The list with bigger value will be declared the winneryou should probably use  and then just compare the two maxima:
Perhaps you were trying to break out of the nested loop? In which case, I suggest you wrap your code in a function so you can simply use  once you find an element in s2 greater than one in s1.Anyway, assuming this is the strict definition: s2 is greater than s1 because one of the values in s2 turns out to be  greater than in s1One linear solution is to first get the minimum of s1, then iteratively compare that with the elements in s2.Note that if you have s1 values of [0,1,2,3] and s2 values of [0,1,0,0] that would still result s2 > s1 because at least one of the values in s2 is greater than at least one of the values in s1 (which i think doesn't really make sense as a definition of greater than :P )EDIT: added key parameter in  function
