I am playing around with the structures 2.0.2 package to create data structures in Python3.  If I write the following code it will ensure that the variable  is an Integer when defined at a later time.This will yield 4 for the first two print statements and an error for the third because I tried to change the data type to something that could not be rounded to the correct data type.However, lets say I want the variable  to be a list or a bumpy array populated only with integers.  I try the following;and I get an error telling me that I cannot turn the variable  into a list.  If I try the following;The code will execute and create a list, but the values are not constrained to an integer.  How can I get the structures package to constrain the data types within lists and bumpy arrays to a static type?
That is not possible using structures. You will have to build your own custom type. The list type just do a list() cast before assigning the value, so if you want beside do a list cast do an int cast to each item of the list, you will have to implement it ;)
