I have a file which contains input like below:Expected Output:Code:I just want to return list of hostname and IP which will be used to send to the specified email address returned from the list. Can any one help me how it can be done easily? Thanks.
First install the validate_email module with:Then:OUTPUT:
Hope this helps. It will be wise to use a dictionary where the keys can be either  or  (if matched by the email-regex). For each iteration we firstly set the  variable to  and only change it if a matching email is found. The  variable is accordingly set to grab the portion of each line with only host and ips, i.e. stripping off the email address when a matching email is detected. In case a email is detected we see if the same email is already in our dictionary , if yes we just update with the host and ips else we will properly initialize a list for the email(as a new key).The function will give a dictionary looking like this:You can easily access the list of host and ip for a particular email id simply as: which will return back a list of host and ips. 
I use the third-party library,  to facilitate implementing the  itertools recipe.  This can be installed via .OutputThe  recipe aids with re-chunking the (host, IP) together afters each line has been split by spaces.  You can optionally implement this recipe by without installing .From the itertools recipes (in Python 3):
One approach is to split each line and determine if the first entry has an  character in it. Then use slicing to extract the remaining entries:This will display: stores the entries in the form If your file has multiple lines for the same user, it would be necessary to use a  to store all entries for the same user in the same place.
