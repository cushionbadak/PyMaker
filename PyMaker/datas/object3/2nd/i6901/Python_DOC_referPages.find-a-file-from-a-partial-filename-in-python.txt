Try something like this:
I would search with a regex using Python's  module. Here's a sample expression:This will match a filename starting with , followed by any digits, and ending with . For a deeper explanation on how this regex works, check it out on Regex101, where you can test it, as well.Note: Your question did not specify, but as a bonus,  also support recursive searches.
As others have suggested in comments, glob and other options are available,however, personally i find listdir more comfortable.
