I have a list and I want to put its elements inside a for loop string like this:The output should be like:How can I loop the indices for string interpolation as well?Thanks!Edit: The loop is a bit different. It's more like this:I need to put the strings of lists into the 2nd layer of nested loop. Can't use zip here.
I believe you are assuming that  is the same lenght as .  If so, you can use  to iterate over the two containers in parallel.
You can use the built-in function .  allows to process each list in parallel:Make an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables.Returns an iterator of tuples, where the i-th tuple contains the i-th element from each of the argument sequences or iterables. The iterator stops when the shortest input iterable is exhausted. With a single iterable argument, it returns an iterator of 1-tuples. With no arguments, it returns an empty iterator.If your list are of different size, you can use :Make an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables. If the iterables are of uneven length, missing values are filled-in with fillvalue. Iteration continues until the longest iterable is exhausted. 
I hope this can help you.
