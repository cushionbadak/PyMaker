I use  to perform  script.Such as:The default  lib installed in my  is .What I intent to do is that access IXIA and automatically configure it by script.The problem is the APIs provides by my IXIA (with ) only can be accessed by  lib, newer versions are unacceptable.I knew it might be easy in Unix-like system by using  and something like that.But how could i re-build my  with  lib when i  on my  machine?Thanks in advance.
The simplest way may be to run the code to access the IXIA as a subprocess so that it can use Tcl 8.4 without disrupting the version used by Python (which would have a lot of other consequences). Now Tcl 8.4 is no longer supported at all, but the most recent version of Tcl is 8.4.20, and came out only a few years ago so it is largely compatible with current build systems. (You can get the 8.4.20 source code from SourceForge.)When you are building Tcl, assuming you are targeting Unix, you can configure where it will install using the  option to ; the default location is  (e.g., the  binary goes in , the support libraries go in , the documentation goes in , â€¦). If you have Tcl packages elsewhere that you want to use, the  environment variable can be used to say where they are. Also, if you are running as a subprocess, you may want to tune the level of buffering used on standard output:In general, you will probably be substituting  in your Python code for printing the code to run to the subprocess pipe and reading the result back. There's going to be a need for a bit of work to make that work neatly, but that sort of thing has been discussed in other questions here. The only major complication is really that you're working with an unsupported version of the code for your subprocess.
