I'm quite new on this Python world (i worked in the past with java, c++... but I never used Python). Well, let's go with the question. As I know, when I needed to export a java project, I just needed to create a .war (automaticly if I used Eclipse) and use it whenever and wherever I need it...Now, I need to export a python project created in pyCharm and use it in other computers (it's a linux program created for getting information of the system and display it through sockets in a server), but I don't know what steps should I follow to export this project and use it on other machines.My project looks like this:Maybe is a stupid question, but I researched through manuals and other questions but I don't find the answer...Any idea?Regards!
Generally speaking, if you just want to work on a different machine you just have to copy your Python project's , create new project in PyCharm, add the folder to it and install all dependencies.This is however made easier by:a) setting up your project as a python package (see my comment) as this allows you to define dependencies which will automatically be installed andb) the use of virtual environments which can be exported and installed on a different machine, see https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.htmlPersonally I use  (https://conda.io/miniconda.html) to manage my environments: https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html
