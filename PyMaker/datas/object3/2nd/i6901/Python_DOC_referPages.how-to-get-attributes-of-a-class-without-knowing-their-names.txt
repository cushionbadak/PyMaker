I have the following class:Examplary use:How can I iterate on this structure without knowing the names of the attributes? Python provides us with the built-in method , but I still need to know the name of the requested attribute:
The  attribute holds what you want.The class has it:And any instance has it as well:You should access this attribute through the  builtin function.Calling  will return .See this related post: Use  or ?.Documentation for :vars([object])Return the  attribute for a module, class, instance, or any other object with a  attribute.Objects such as modules and instances have an updateable  attribute; however, other objects may have write restrictions on their   attributes (for example, classes use a  to prevent direct dictionary updates).Without an argument,  acts like . Note, the locals dictionary is only useful for reads since updates to the locals  dictionary are ignored.In addition, I tried and wrote a decorator that might interest you.This is a class decorator, that adds a  to the class it decorates.Besides, it wraps the  method of that class as well, so as to have it append the  dictionary it receives to the class'  attribute.Demonstration:I find this approach much cleaner that using , because you know what you're accessing since you define it yourself.It gives you more control on the class' behaviour.
