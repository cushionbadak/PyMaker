This question already has an answer here:What is sys.maxint in Python 3?                    8 answers                Maximum and Minimum values for ints                    8 answers                Maximum value for long integer                    7 answers                I checked maximum size of the integer Python holds using  and it returned me . Then why I can still store a value greater than this range?How many bytes are required to store an integer and do Python changes number of bytes depending on the size of an integer?I am using Python 3.6
If you check the docs for , you'll see  An integer giving the maximum value a variable of type  can take. Itâ€™s usually  on a 32-bit platform and  on a 64-bit platform.There's nothing in there about Python s! It's talking about , an internal C API thing with no practical relevance to working with Python s.Python s use an arbitrary-precision representation that will use more bytes of memory to represent bigger integers. They are not limited by the values of s.
