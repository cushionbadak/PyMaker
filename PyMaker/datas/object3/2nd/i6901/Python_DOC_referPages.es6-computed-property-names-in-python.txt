I'm trying to find an equivalent ES6 feature in Python.In JS, I have something like this:I want do be able to compose a dictionary key in a dict constructor in Python as well, something like: should result in a dictionary key of the return value of that function. Or if it's variable, it's value, etc...Is there anyway to do this in Python?I've tried doing  but that threw errors.
Just like you use an object literal in JavaScript, you should use a dictionary literal in Python for this. This would be the exact equivalent in Python:Or in your actual case:As Jon highlights on the comments, the big difference between a JavaScript object literal and a Python dict literal is that Python’s behavior for the keys is basically JavaScript’s behavior with  by default.So to translate a  in JavaScript, you would write  in Python. But when you just write  in JavaScript, you have to understand it’s essentially a  which makes it equivalent to  in Python.The reason why you need a string literal for string keys is simply because Python dictionaries can have almost arbitrary key objects and are not limited to string keys as JavaScript objects are.
