Python's  module doesn't seem to be able to inspect the signatures of "built-in" functions, which include functions defined in C extension modules, like those defined by Cython. Is there any way to get the signature of a Python function you have defined in such a module, and specifically in Cython? I am looking to be able to find the available keyword arguments.MWE:andyields:In Python 3.4.5 and Cython 0.24.1
I've retracted my duplicate suggestion (saying that it was impossible...) having investigated further. It seems to work fine with reasonably recent versions of Cython (v0.23.4) and Python 3.4.4.gives the outputAlso mentioned in the documentation is the compilation option "" which apparently makes this detail more accessible (although I didn't need it).I have a feeling that this may depend on improvements to  made relatively recently (possibly this fix) so if you're using Python 2 you're probably out of luck.Edit: your example works if you using the  compilation option:I suspect that  adds it automatically (but the code to do  is sufficiently convoluted that I can't find proof of that either way). You can also set it as a file-level option.
