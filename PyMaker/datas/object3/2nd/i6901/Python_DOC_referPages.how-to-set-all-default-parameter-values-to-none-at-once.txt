For a plain function, you can set :
If you literally want to add  as default to every argument you need some sort of decorator approach. If it's only about Python 3 then  can be used:However that way you will loose introspection for the function because you manually altered the signature.But I suspect that there are probably better way to solve the problem or avoiding the problem completely.
