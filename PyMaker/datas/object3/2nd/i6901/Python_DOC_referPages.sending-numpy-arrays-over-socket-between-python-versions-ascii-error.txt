I need to send numpy arrays between Python2 and Python3 programs which run simultaneously. After doing some research, I've decided to send pickles over a socket connection.I'm able to establish a connection and send strings back and forth, but trying to send numpy arrays results in a ascii error. Here is what my client/server are doing:I trying searching for related questions, but couldn't find anything relevant except the solution suggested here, which doesn't work for me since I need to use Python2. I'm not sure how to continue. Any ideas?
I reproduced your error running the server on Python 3 and client on Python 2. The following code is an example that can run the server and client on any combination of Pythons.   on Python 3 defaults to decoding strings with .  To leave them as the original bytes sent, add  as a parameter.My protocol is "read everything from the client until the client closes the connection, then deserialize it".  If you want to keep the connection open and send more than one serialized blob, you'll have to define a protocol that indicates the length of the serialized blob.client:server:Output:
