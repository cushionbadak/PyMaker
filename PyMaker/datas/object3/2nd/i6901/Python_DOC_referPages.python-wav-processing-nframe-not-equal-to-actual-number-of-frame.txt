I'm trying to use webrtcvad to detect speech in wav file, to do so I must provide 30ms of 16bit pcm at 32Khz.what I'm trying to do is to cut my wav in packet of 30ms but take this file for example (https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/91396766/recording000001.wav) :-why is len(w.readframes(w.getnframes())) = 356352, it should be 178176 because 1/32000 = 0.00003125 secondsand 0.00003125*175176 = 5.568 secsThanksEdittest script :output :
After w.rewind()I triedlen(w.readframes(0))0Which is different from your results, where you got 1.Interestingly however, len(w.readframes(1))2But this makes sense, in a convoluted fashion, since there are indeed 2 bytes. (16bit audio frames imply that there are 2 bytes per frame. Since you are calling len on a binary object, I think it therefore makes sense that it would return the number of actual bytes.)If you want to work on your audio data, perhaps you should investigate a library like numpy to do further analysis or processing of your audio.import numpy as npc = np.frombuffer(w.readframes(w.getnframes()), dtype="int16")c.shape(178175,)c[0] = 100c[1] = 122c[100] = -132This is the raw waveform data. It is on the range of (-2^15, 2^15) or, -32768 to 32,768. Since the first portion of your audio file is quiet at the beginning, small values in the first few hundred frames makes good sense.
