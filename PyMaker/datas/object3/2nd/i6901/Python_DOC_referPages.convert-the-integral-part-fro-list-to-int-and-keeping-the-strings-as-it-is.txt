I have a list . I want to convert the numbers that are int type and keep the rest as is.Desired output:I tried it in following wayord(m['rt4'])it gave me the following error"TypeError: ord() expected a character, but string of length 3 found"
it should works:
You can use the built-in  function to convert a string to an integer. This function will throw an exception if the input string is not a valid integer, so you can just return the unmodified input in that case using the  statement. might however accept more formats as valid integers than you want, so you could also validate the integer explicitly.
making function which checks for int.  OR just using isdigit() built-in function.
