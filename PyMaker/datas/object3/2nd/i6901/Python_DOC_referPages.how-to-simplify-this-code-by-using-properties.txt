I read the documentation and am not sure how to simplify the following code with Python properties:
You could override  and  which are called when you access a property with .Usage example:A note: you've defined  on the class, if you want it to be instance variable create it on  in .
If you're just learning Python, this may be too advanced—however by using it you can largely automate the process of creating any number of classes like this by using a metaclass (a class whose instances are other classes).Although doing so requires some non-trivial code, it makes defining the target classes extremely simple. Plus, as a bonus I added optional type-checking.The defined metaclass makes it very easy to create a class with exactly the desired properties:
You can use  and  to treat your dynamic fields as if they are properties of the object itself, rather than of the internal  object.The sample above will allow you to access the properties like so.
