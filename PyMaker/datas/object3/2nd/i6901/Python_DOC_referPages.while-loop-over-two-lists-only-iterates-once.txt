I have a function that is supposed to merge two sorted lists into a combined sorted list.  I know there are other ways of accomplishing this, but can someone explain why this code doesn't workFor some reason the  loop only seems to run once.  For example if I use  and , the print line at the end of the function results in From debugging this seems to be due to the while loop only executing once, but I'm not sure why that's happening...it should go until either  or  is empty
That's because a function breaks after it returns something. You need to un-indent your return statement:Alternatively, if for some reason you would like a list of all the steps your function produced, you could actually use  instead of  in the exact same spot you used your return at:Then running it:And of course you'll see that the last list yielded is the sorted list :).
