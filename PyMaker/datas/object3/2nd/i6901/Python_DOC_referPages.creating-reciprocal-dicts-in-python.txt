I have a common requirement to look up a code from value, and also a value from a code. For example, I have a dict of colours that enables me to derive  a code for the colour. On the other hand I may have a code and wish to derive the colour. I solve this by creating what I call reciprocal dicts.If I know a code I can look up the colour in codes and if I know a colour I can look up the code in colours.Is this the best data structure to tackle this problem? Is there a more pythonic way?
Use an  instead:You can then go both ways:In code, just use the members directly:
