Natural Text
I am a newbie to Jquery and my script below doesn't produce any output on the HTML page. Problem:Within my script, I use the  library to send a GET request to a Flask URL that returns a JSON object. This object then needs to be sent to the JQuery which would then output the JSON object on a webpage. If I send the data using  it works fine, but if I send it using  it outputs nothing. However I would need it to be sent as a JSON object so that I could then extract all the data out of it and put it on the HTML elements. getajaxtest.py:the HTML and JQuery:
You are printing a Python data structure, not JSON.  decoded the Flask response to Python dictionaries, lists, strings, numbers, booleans, and perhaps . That's not JSON data.Just keep your data as JSON data, and print the text you received. Your script is nothing but a proxy, there is no need to interpret the JSON data.If you must decode (perhaps you wanted to apply some transformations to the data contained), make sure you encode back to JSON again. Use  to produce a new JSON-encoded string when you do.
