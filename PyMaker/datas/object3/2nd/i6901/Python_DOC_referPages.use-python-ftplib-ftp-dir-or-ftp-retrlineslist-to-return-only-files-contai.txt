I am accessing a government website from Python 3.6 like this:Then, I go to list the contents of the directory, both  or  seem to have the same effect, listing out an enormous directory into the Jupyter output. I tried to assign the output of these commands to a variable but it contains nothing, which is anyway in line with the docs. I just wanted to find the names of a few files containing a certain string, not a huge list. Does anyone know how to accomplish this?
In general, there's no other way, than retrieving list of all files and filtering them locally.See Python: How to get list of file and use wildcard in FTP directory?But many servers support non-standard/proprietary filtering of the listing.If you are lucky and your FTP server do support this, you can use a file mask to retrieve only a subset of files. In your case the mask would be a simple  pattern, which is supported by most major FTP servers.For a partial list of supported patterns of common FTP servers, see my answer to FTP directory partial listing with wildcards.
