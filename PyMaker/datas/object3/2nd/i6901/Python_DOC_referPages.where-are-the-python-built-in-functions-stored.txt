Like we have python modules in the standard library from which we can import methods and use them, is there also a module where all the built-in functions are defined?If yes, how can I view that module?
The  (Python 3) or  (Python 2) module provides access to them.This is even useful sometimes if you rebind the name of a builtin, eg . You generally shouldn't do that, but if you do you can still access the builtin list constructor as .
On python3,  or  for older versionsYou can check any modules content with the  function
