Natural Text
New to python, intermediate at VB7I have been trying to create a program which will reach out and log news articles based on the text in the url. I have encountered many difficulties no doubt due to my unfamiliarity with the language, and I was hoping I might find some help here on this problem as I have others.Here is an example block of webpage code I am working with. (I'm sorry, I know its ugly.)I have Beautifulsoup, request, and at this point feel confident enough to handle any other module that I may need.What I am trying to do figure out now is recording the time and date on the webpage, or perhaps checking it against today's date so that I don't read old news.Thank you for reading.
You need to use datetime module.If you already parsed the string with date and time ("Aug-29-17 09:05AM" in your case) use datetime.strptime() to create datetime object. Than you can compare it with today's date - datetime.now().
You can use the time module:it might look frustrating, but its syntax is actually very easy and comprehendable.I hope I've helped!
If your question is how to scrap time and date with their responsive content from site's source code then you can do it using  like so:This will give as a result:
