I'm working on simple project looking like this:When I run , against my venv,  works. when I run , against my venv,  returns me an exception:Why? Python version is 3.5.1
 installs your package as sort of a pseudo-symlink to your development directory, so stuff like  is visible there.  then imports the folder as an implicit namespace package, a feature introduced in Python 3.3. Implicit namespace packages don't require . doesn't create the pseudo-symlink. It only installs what it's configured to install, and apparently, it wasn't configured to install .
Resume: Python 3 can import a submodule without  (only the top-level directory of a module requires ), Python 2 cannot. Try to find out where Python 2 has creeped and crippled your installation.
From the docs:The __init__.py files are required to make Python treat the directories as containing packages; this is done to prevent directories with a common name, such as string, from unintentionally hiding valid modules that occur later on the module search path.There must be something about the fact that  just points your interpreter to the local directory that allows for the import of  that fails when you try to actually  it into an environment.
