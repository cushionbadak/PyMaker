I'm coming from a Ruby/Rspec world where it is very simple to mock and setup tests/expects() statements to test static methods.I was wondering if there is a simple way to test same things in Python.  Please disregard what the code is actually doing (i have changed many names in it) I have the following code:I have looked at unittest and unittest.mock but it doesn't seem to be eloquent solution if I have many static methods in my method. In other words, I would be doing a @patch within a @patch, etc. etc. 
You may want to take a look at the python unittest module. It has mocking and patching modules
