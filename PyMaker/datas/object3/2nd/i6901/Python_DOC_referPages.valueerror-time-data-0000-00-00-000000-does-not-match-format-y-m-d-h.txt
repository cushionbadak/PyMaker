I am trying to convert my WordPress site to a static site generator using the program exitwp. But during the conversion process, I always get the following error message:I am not a Python programmer but I looked up what the time data format means and it seems to me that '0000-00-00 00:00:00' DOES MATCH the format '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'.Any idea what is wrong? Help would be very appreciated!
 matches years in the range  through to , see the table in the module documentation:  Year with century as a decimal number.  0001, 0002, …, 2013, 2014, …, 9998, 9999Your year  falls outside of that range.The same issue applies to  and  (the acceptable ranges are  through to , and  through to , respectively). That's because  objects have the same range for their attribute values, there is no  object.  is set to  (so ).Presumably  means 'no date available'; you'll have to alter the input to replace those dates, or handle that value to replace it with something else (perhaps  would be acceptable?)
