I have a script that has to run on many files. In each file there are the execution of external commands that generate different files or I need to operate in the same file however in different folders.I would have something like this:So I would have in this example a total of 5 processes, however for example  and  can run at the same time.Also I would need to restrict the number of processes that run at the same time, mainly for the  and  because the external commands are very memory intensive, so running more than 4-5 processes at same time may result in very low memory.Sorry for this question being so generic, but I don't know where to start and how to solve this problem. As if I have to run every process sequentially it would be too much time consuming.So, I think that I may need to use a queue. I have been limiting the execution of the external commands using a list and wait like for example here:It would be part of a function that runs the first process. However this makes to wait that a command end to run the next, so it makes sequentially, and I would like to run each process in parallel, and run sequentially each process, first proc1, then proc2...Thank you and sorry for this so generic question.
not sure that you need a process.. but just in case have a look here:https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutoror maybe you simply need threads?https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutorkeep in mind that if you spawn 3 threads they will run in the same CPU, and if their task is computationally intensive they will each use 33% of that CPU.
