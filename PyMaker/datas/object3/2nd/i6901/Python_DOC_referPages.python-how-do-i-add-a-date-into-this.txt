I got this, but how to insert a date into it,  the date i want is one month from current time whereby the Y is one month later from the current time
Hint: To get the current month of the year, use the  module:Where  gets the current time as a  object, and the  attribute prints the current month (as a number)
ORAlso see: Get month name from numberhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.htmlhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html#calendar.month_name
Often the easiest way of manipulating dates and times in ways like this is to use the arrow library. In this case, you can get what you want with this code:
If you want to print datetime one month later from current time,you can use  and  in combination.then you can use the datetime attributes like  to get the next month.and if you want names of the month, use a list like in below answerwith little tweak, so the 0th will be empty and you can get the Month NamesThen use these values as you would normaly do using format
