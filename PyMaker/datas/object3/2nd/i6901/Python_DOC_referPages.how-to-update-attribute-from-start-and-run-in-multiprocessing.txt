I create sub-class from multiprocessing.Process.Object p.run() can update instance.ret_value from the long_runtime_proc, but p.start() can't get the ret_value updated though long_runtime_proc called and ran.How can I get ret_value with p.start()?
Calling  directly does not start a new process, i.e. the code in  is executed in the same process that invoked it. That's why changes to  are effective. However, you are not supposed to call  directly.When you start the subprocess with  a new child process is created and then the code in  is executed in this new process. When you assign the return value of  to , this occurs in the child process, not the parent and thus the parent  is not updated.What you probably need to do is to use a pipe or a queue to send the return value to the parent process. See the documentation for details. Here is an example using a queue:With this code  will end up being assigned the value off the queue which will be 1234.
