I looked up dump in the Jinja2 API:Dump the complete stream into a file or file-like object. Per default unicode strings are written, if you want to encode before writing specify an encoding.I am unable to find a file-like object that I could dump back into a string. Does anyone know a workaround for this?Edit: I normally put the output in a file--but in a separate case I am appending the output to an e-mail.
I'm not sure why you are looking at the streaming API for templates. Just render the template directly. From the Basics section of the API documentation:To render it with some variables, just call the  method:The method returns a Unicode string. From the  documentation:This will return the rendered template as unicode string.The  method only applies to template streams, objects produced by the  method; you shouldn't need to worry about those when all you wanted was a single string.Even so, if you wanted a string from a stream, just join the chunks:Last but not least, if you still need an in-memory file object, look no further than :Internally,  is implemented as a loop over , writing each chunk to the file object.
