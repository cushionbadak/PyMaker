I'm trying to combine 2 lists that have different data and size into 1, and have the smaller list "wrap" around. I'm looking for a clean way to do this, e.g.Input:Output:Notice that for , we went back to  and wrapped around list2.The obvious (and ugly looking) solution is to just start with an empty list, have 2 indexes in a loop, each iteration append a new list item, and the smaller one 'wraps' to the beginning when it reaches the end. Is there a clean way of doing this in Python 2.7?
You can use  to wrap the second list:
You could use a generator that avoids appending to an empty list:However  (see the other answer) is probably much better.
You can merely use  for simplicity; however, a cleaner solution would involve :Output:
