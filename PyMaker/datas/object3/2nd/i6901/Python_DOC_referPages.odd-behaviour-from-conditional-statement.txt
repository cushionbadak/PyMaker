I am trying to check through a list, identify if a variable's position in the list is within a specified locale. Now, despite the fact that [0] IS 1, (i verified this by the following):Which returned 1; I am confused then as to why the conditional statement is stating otherwise.
 is a separate test from ; you chained the comparisons, and Python executes the test as:Both tests fail. There is no  integer in , only a  string object. And  is not the exact same object as the list produced by the  expression; the latter will always produce a new list object so the  identity test always fails.You can't make an assertion about the  test; you can't test what index the containment matched. Just test the index explicitly:or if  could be an empty list, add a test to make sure it is not empty:
