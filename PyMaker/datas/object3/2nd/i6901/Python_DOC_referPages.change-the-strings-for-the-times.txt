I'm working on my code as I'm checking on the  to see if the strings is valid. If the strings is valid, I want to change the strings for the time to go 30 minutes backward in each time when the  strings is valid. Example: The  strings show  so I want to change it to 30 minutes backward to make it to show . If the  strings show , I want to change it to 30 minutes backward to make it to show .Here is the code:But the problem is the  strings will only show 12 hours time.I'm wondered if there is a way if I could be able to reduce the code to make it to go with something like in 6-7 lines instead of 97 lines?
How about this?Except for the two special cases, this program finds the , checks if  is present, if it is then it keeps the current hour and makes a new string with / label and hour intact but with  instead of . If the ending is  it turns the hour portion into an , subtracts 1, turns it back to a string, adds  in the minute section and again preserves the / part. 
Yes, there are easier ways. You might be interested in the built-in time module. It lets you parse strings and perform operations on them. You could also do something like:And then you could figure out how to subtract 30 minutes. For validating you could use regex.
