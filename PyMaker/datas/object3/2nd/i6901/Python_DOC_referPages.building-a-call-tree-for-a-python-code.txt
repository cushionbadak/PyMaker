I've been given a Python code, together with the  modules it imports. I would like to build a tree indicating which function calls what other functions. How can I do that?
you can use the  (abstract syntax tree) module from the python standard libraryparsing the file using :outputs:
You should begin from the main function of the program and at the first layer link all functions that are called from the main this would provide a start point and then you can link all the functions below it.
