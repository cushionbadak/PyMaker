I want to use the name of variables as file names. Are there any cases in which this might not work? example: Here "my_var" is both a part of a file name and the name of a variable. So basically I'm asking if python allows any characters in variable names, that would make trouble in filenames. 
This may vary for other OSes, but under Windows, all the reserved (forbidden) characters for file names are also not allowed within Python variable names:< (less than)> (greater than): (colon)" (double quote)/ (forward slash)\ (backslash)| (vertical bar or pipe)? (question mark)* (asterisk)However, there are a few different problems: Certain names are not allowed as Windows file names, specifically:So, you can't name a file  under windows even though  would be a perfectly valid variable name in Python.Then, there is a length limit for filenames, so very long variable names might cause a problem. Lastly, Python variable names may be comprised of a wide range of Unicode characters, not all of which may be available for filenames. 
Since Python variable names can only contain underscores, letters, and numbers they could all be used as file names.The one issue that could come up, although hard to imagine, is that you could have a Python variable name longer than some file systems allow.  (260 characters in Windows)
