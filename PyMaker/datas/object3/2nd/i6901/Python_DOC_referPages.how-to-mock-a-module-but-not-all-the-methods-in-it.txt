I am newbie in mocking. I've looked at the mock module and understood how to mock a specific method or module using patch decorator.In order to mock a single method in a module, one way of doing it is:In order to mock multiple methods in the same module, I can do this:What I want is to mock a few methods in a module and keep the others as they are. If I mock the entire module, then every method or attribute in that module is mocked. So, instead of mocking multiple methods individually like I've shown above, is there any way I can mock an entire module (by only keeping certain methods un-mocked)?
You can subclass the class under test and mock out all the methods in the constructor.  Then under test you only use the mock class and not the real one.
