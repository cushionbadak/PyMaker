I have a List of List (tableData) and I want to return a new List (cloneTable) that outputs the length of each string in the original List so I can find the longest string using the function longestString. I also want to keep the values in the original List. The problem is that after my function runs, the original List has been converted to lengths. I am sure the code can be better (I am still learning) but I also want to understand WHY there is this problem. I did not Assign tableData I am passing the values from tableData to assign to cloneTable. Thanks for the help!
