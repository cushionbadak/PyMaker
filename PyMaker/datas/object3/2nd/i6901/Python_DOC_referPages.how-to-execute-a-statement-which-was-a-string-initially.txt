My question is about how to make the compiler treats my string as an executable statement, consider my string mystr='1+2+3', now the question is what's the code to put in function  so when I execute the following command  I get 6 on my screen.
.Documentation here.
Using exec() for more than just expression strings:
You can use eval(mystr).gives you 6
