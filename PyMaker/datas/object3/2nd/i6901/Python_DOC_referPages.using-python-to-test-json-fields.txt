Is there a way to use Python in order to test all possible field value combinations for JSON data? For example, I have some JSON data and have included possible field values for each of these of fields in parenthesis:I am really just trying to figure out a way to iterate through all field possibilities and print out the full JSON structure with each of these field combinations. Hopefully, this makes sense; I appreciate the help. Thanks. 
You can use  to generate a bunch of combinations.Then use the generated tuples to build the desired dicts/JSONs.
To expand on @FMc's approach, you have 8 fields that need to be modified, i.e. assuming  is not changed. Using  is a compact way of achieving multiple nested loops in a single simple iterative way. Each iteration will result in one combination of values for all of the fields. This first iteration would give you the following tuple of values for your fields:Next you need to update your JSON object with all of the new values. One way would be to use  to assign new values as follows:    So this first iteration would display the following:
