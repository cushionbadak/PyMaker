Natural Text
I am trying to make a nested loop to check if a user's input should be an integer or a float.In my calculator, rate per compounds is stored in an integer based on text input, however I want to add the functionality for the else statement to check if the input is a whole number or if its decimal. If its a whole number, I want the text to produce the number without a .0, but if its a float, such as 6.5, I want to keep that variable as a float.This is where I think the check should beSo if a user inputs 1 for rate, which would fall in the else statement as it is not one of my predefined words, the "Your account balance......" should display compounds as an int.If a user inputs 1.5 for rate, which would fall in the else statement as it is not one of my predefined words, the "Your account balance......." should display compounds as a float.Can anyone offer me some input on how I can approach this? I have tried writing it out using remainders, subtracting and adding numbers to check if compounds is > than a whole number, but I cant seem to get it to write correctly.
Just use  initially, then check if  and handle accordingly:Or even better, use the  format specifier:General format. For a given precision p >= 1, this rounds the number  to p significant digits and then formats the result in either  fixed-point format or in scientific notation, depending on its  magnitude.The precise rules are as follows: suppose that the result formatted  with presentation type 'e' and precision p-1 would have exponent exp.  Then if -4 <= exp < p, the number is formatted with presentation type  'f' and precision p-1-exp. Otherwise, the number is formatted with  presentation type 'e' and precision p-1. In both cases insignificant  trailing zeros are removed from the significand, and the decimal point  is also removed if there are no remaining digits following it.
