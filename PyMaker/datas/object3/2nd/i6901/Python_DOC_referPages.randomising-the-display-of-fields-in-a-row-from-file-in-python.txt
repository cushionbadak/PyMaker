I have the following file structure File structureThe code I have is as follows:At the moment, the program reads the file, inserts the right answer into the mix, but what I want it to do is:insert the correct variable into the mixI will need some help with randomisation within this file handling structure, and how to not duplicate the correct answer. I did think about reading all into a list, and then producing a random output, but it seemed terribly complex. Is there an easier way?Update:One suggestion is to use a different file format, but I want to, if at all possible avoid that, although please feel free to make these suggestions in your answers:My other idea was to create a list: Search for duplicates in that list, and then delete the duplicate, if any, from that list. I have this so far, it doesn't work quite yet and nor does it include randomisation of the resultant list:
This may not be the prettiest solution but it definitely works:
The method you want is  below. It uses  to choose n-1 unique items from the answers list.Remember to break your code up into functions to make it easier to read and work with. Also, when you find yourself writing an  block like your  and each of the choices looks almost the same as the others, that's a great indicator that you need to refactor that code into a single function.
I did think about reading all into a list, and then producing a random output, but it seemed terribly complexIt is not and can lead to less repeatable code. And you can use random.shuffle to shuffle answers in list. Take a look at a code below: Don't forget to set  variable and increase  variable. I assume it is done later in your code somewhere.
