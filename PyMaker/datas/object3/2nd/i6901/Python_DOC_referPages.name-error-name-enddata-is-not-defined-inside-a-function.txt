When I try to run this it says "enddata" is not defined, even though it is a list containing formatted data from the document. Is there a better way of coding this part?
As others pointed out, you have to call the  function: The code could be like this:Another way to do it a little more short and pythonic could be:Worth it to explore the csv Python module:
You have to call  for it to initialize (and create, for that matter) the global name . However, you should not be using a global variable. Have  return the value you are assigning to  and assign it to the the variable in the calling scope.A few other tips:Your function doesn't just open a file, it reads it and returns some data.Use a  statement to manage opening and closing the file.Don't read the entire file into memory at once; read it line by line.You are iterating over  twice, in some sense: once using the  loop, and again with . It appears that  during each iteration. The entire iteration could be handled with a single list comprehension.Use the  module for reading CSV files.Putting it all together:
This is a slightly more advanced way of writing your code.I use the weatherData` becomes the alias for the file. becomes the name for one line in the input file.It's important to note that each line in a file will have a so-called 'line-end' which has to be stripped off; hence the . Then I can do the  on commas.Because each input line can contain more than one value, I use  to add them to .I've written  to see the results. Alternatively I could have written ..Output:
