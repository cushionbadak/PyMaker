I have the following example in which the next method of a class is supposed to return the values from two generators:However, when I call  for this class, the values are not incremented.What is wrong? Is there a more eloquent way to write this class?   
Your code doesn't work because it recreates the generator functions every time  is called, which effectively resets them back to their initial state before their next  values are returned:You can fix that by adding an  method and initializing them in it:A more eloquent and slightly more concise way to do it which likewise will avoid the problem would be to use the builtin  function to create an "iterator of generators" that will return pairs of next values from each generator every time it's called. Another advantage is it's very easy to extend to handle even more generators simply just changing the  method.Here's what I mean:Output:
Although I have no idea what you are trying to accomplish, here is a cleaned up version which (I think) does what you want.
