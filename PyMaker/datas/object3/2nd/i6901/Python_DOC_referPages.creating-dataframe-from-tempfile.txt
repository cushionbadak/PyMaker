Trying to load a temporary file into a pandas dataframe and throwing an error.  Not sure how to get the parsed data from the temp file into a dataframe to use later on.Traceback (most recent call last):File "C:/LAS Load.py", line 42, in ...       return func(*args, **kwargs) TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'
I think you wanted to prepend 'file://' to temp.name. After un-indenting the  assignment by two tab stops. The  is odd, it seems just like , and  has no side effects. Maybe another copy-n-paste hiccup?
You didn't show us what  contains, in particular what type it causes  to have. If possible, would you please run this under python3? If not, show us some details like , and do a trivial  so it's clear the file descriptor is writable. It's still not obvious what side effects line 41 has:The '%s' % i is essentially taking str(i). Perhaps what we're looking for is , or passing in a temp file encoding.
