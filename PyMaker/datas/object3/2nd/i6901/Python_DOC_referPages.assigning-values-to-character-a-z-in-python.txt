Natural Text
I am noobie. I am trying to assign values from A to Z. This is very long. What is the best way to do it?
You can do it like that:And access your variables like .Note that the values you have in your example correspond to the lowercase letters but you are naming your variables with uppercase. If you actually want the uppercase, instead of looping through  loop over 
Instead of hard-coding every letter you can use . For example  will return the number  which stands for the letter  in ASCII.EDIT:I used the code of Ev. Kounis for producing the dictionary because mine was wrong. If there's any problem I can delete it.
