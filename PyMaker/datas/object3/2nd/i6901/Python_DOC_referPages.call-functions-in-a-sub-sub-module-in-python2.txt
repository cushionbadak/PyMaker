This is legal in Python3.But I have to change it to this for it to work in Python2.Is there something wrong with Keras or is this a new feature in Python3?This question has not been asked before to my best knowledge. Sorry if this is a dumb question but I don't really know what key words I should use to search for this...
This is something that depends on the module. If the submodule's name is included in  in the module's , you'll be able to access it in the way you expect. You can see how  works in my answer here. Or read the documentation on packages:The  statement uses the following convention: if a package’s  code defines a list named , it is taken to be the list of module names that should be imported when  is encountered. It is up to the package author to keep this list up-to-date when a new version of the package is released. Package authors may also decide not to support it, if they don’t see a use for importing * from their package.In the case of , it seems that the module's  either: does not define does not include  in
