I could not find any information about mathemtical constants in the Tensorflow APIneither in Basic Math functions nor in Math Ops.I was able to get it byHowever, this would mean to include another library, - so I wonder if there is this functionallity for mathemtical  constants like , or  already provided inside tensorflow? 
 is in the Python standard library, not a third-party module.I don't see why using it is a problem whatsoever.
As I know NO, and there's a reason for it. If each library define it own pi will be lots of code duplications!You did it right
