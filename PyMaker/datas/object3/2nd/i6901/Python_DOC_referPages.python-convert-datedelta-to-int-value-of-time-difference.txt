I want to change time delta to integer value .My code is as below.But, I want to get just  with integer.How can I solve this problem?Thank you.
Just reference the  attribute of the  object you have there:There are also  and  attributes, modeling the complete delta state. 
 is a timedelta object  - use   to get the number of days as an integer, or  to see the number of seconds between the two datetime objects.
