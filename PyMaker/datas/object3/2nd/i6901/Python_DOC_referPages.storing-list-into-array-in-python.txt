I'm new to python and trying to split a list and store as an array.I have a csv file which I'm reading and store each row as a list. Each of these rows are separated by comma and I want to store each of those values into an arrayThis is my current code that retrieves the rows in csv file. I'm stuck in trying to parse each row to store into an arrayThe output of  would be  . Now I want this ouput to be easily accessible as array for further calculations. For instance - I should print  when I 
The output of print(csvFileArray[0]) would be  ['11043299,1,2,1,true'].I don't think so; that's a list of one string, not five elements For example.  Is this what you are trying to do?
I think that your method can be written as:orif you need close the file descriptor ASAP because the wait for the Python GC will impact your performance. See my comment about it.To convert a string of comma separated values into a list of values just do:Could be useful for you take a look of what Python Standard Library have to offer here
Have a look at the CSV module. The csv.DictReader class will plop the CSV file rows into a dictionary with the header row fields as dictionary keys. However, note that the CSV module reads your data as strings, so you may have to do some type conversion.Which puts the contents of the CSV nicely into a dictionary.Alternatively, if you truly want each row to be a list, you could use csv.reader() instead:Which gives you a list of lists:Here is the documentation for the CSV module:https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/csv.html#csv.readerYou mentioned an  in your question. I'm not sure that's what you really want here. Python arrays must all contain the same data type. The example given does not. Here is the documentation for Python arrays:https://docs.python.org/2/library/array.htmlHope that helps!
