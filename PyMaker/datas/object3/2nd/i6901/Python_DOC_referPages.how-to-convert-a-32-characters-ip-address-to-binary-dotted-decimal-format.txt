This is because the 1st 8 bits  will be converted to 3, the 2nd 8 bits  will be converted to 128, the 3rd 8 bits  will be converted to 255 and the last 8 bits  will be converted to 255.How to write a function  that accepts an IP address in binary format and converts it into its dotted decimal format ?
You could use the  module from the standard library:Otherwise, it's pretty easy to do it manually:As far as the logic: you convert the binary string to an integer, split that to individual bytes, convert those to strings, and join with .
When you convert to  you can also specify a second argument that is the base (in this case  for binary). Then you can stride through your string 8 elements at a time, and lastly  with  characters
