Hello :) How can I run a thread in a class method? For example:I need to run func1 and func2 simultaneously. func1 is reading data from some stream and write it to global varaible val and func2 is doing some work and reading val. I wanted to run func2 in func1 in a different thread. How can I do that?
how about reading these docs?https://docs.python.org/2/library/threading.htmlhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.htmlhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html
