I have a log file that looks like this:I want to write a python code that will read the txt file and create a list of lists and print the list file after each for loop.This is the code I have written:The output of the code is:But if you look at the output, it prints everytime it appends a string in the list. I want to print the final output of the list after every for loop. Like this:Can anyone please tell me how should I achieve this?If I put the print command outside of the loop like this:It prints the following output:Also another issue is, when a new list is created inside that list, here in my code it should be created in this sequence:But if you look at my final line of the log, you will see that the lists sequence is:How can I maintain the sequence of the lists?Further clarification of the question:I am actually going through a XML file of an application and I want to create a new list every time the string "list" is found on the XML, and immediately after that will be a set of "values" which I want to append in that list and then print the final list. And then when it's done, it will continue looking into the file and when it finds another "list" string in the XML file, it will create another list and so on. Isn't there any way to achieve that?
Let me see if I understood this correctly: you want to execute a print statement only after a group of 'values' is parsed. Here is my take:Which produces:I used  since you need to preserve insertion order.
There's no way to print after each list has ended because your input is not ordered, so there is no way to know if a particular list has ended or not.All you can do is print the list after the whole file has been processed; to do so, place your print statement outside the loop.
