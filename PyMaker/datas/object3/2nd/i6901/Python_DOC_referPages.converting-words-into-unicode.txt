Can anyone please explain this block of code to me? I don't really understand. Why do I need to declare  what is the use of it here? Sometimes when I code I realise that I need to declare it beforehand but sometimes I don't need to. Why I need to use  and also convert the user inputted word into ? Isn't  is like ? I don't see the impact of  here why can't I just use . And if I thought that the user inputted message is already a string? Why do I need to convert it into  again?Also it is not necessary to convert  into integer isn't it?
Important clarificationThe code is not a real Unicode encoding/decoding because is supposing that the Unicode characters you will input have just two decimal digits. You can test that yourself if you enter  as input, those characters have 100, 101 and 102 ASCII code.(1) needed because you are using it the first time as a right part of an assignment operator.is "equivalent" to:and in Python a variable need to be declared before used and the  operator evaluate the right operant first.(2)  is just syntax sugar, so yes, you can use the , but some people would say that is less pythonic and "harder" to read ;) I recommend to use  when you can. You have to convert to string using  because you are before converting user input to a number using . ord(3) Is necessary because  is a string, a string full of digits characters, but still a string.
That code might intend to convert characters into their internal number representation and back to a string. But that code just fails for 8-bit coded characters below line feed (typically 0x0A = 10dec) and above "c" (0x63 = 99dec). Besides that, in Python every string is a Unicode string with a UTF-8 encoding. Using other encoding is possible (), however, will yield "bytes"
