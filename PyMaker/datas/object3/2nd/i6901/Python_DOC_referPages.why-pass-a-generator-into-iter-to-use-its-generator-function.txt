If we consider the following generator and the generator function:Why does the built-in iter function have to be called onto the generator in the generator function? The code still runs and prints the correct value without it.
 does not know whether it receives a iterator (such as a generator) or a container (such as a list/tuple/set). In the latter case, containers do not have a  method associated with them, so your code will fail. Your code is playing it safe rather than taking a chance, which I'd consider good programming practice.An example (in python3):In the latter case, the  is redundant, but it the code works in both cases. However, consider:It should be clear why the  call is needed.
If you pass a  or  to your  function, they won't have a  method.Using  on a  will give you a , which does have a  method.
