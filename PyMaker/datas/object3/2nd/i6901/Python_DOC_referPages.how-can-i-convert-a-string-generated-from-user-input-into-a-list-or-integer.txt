This question already has an answer here:Taking multiple inputs from user in python                    13 answers                Read two variables in a single line with Python                    7 answers                I need to create a script that calculates the distance between two coordinates. The issue I'm having though is when I assign the coordinate to object one, it is stored as a string and am unable to convert it to a list or integer/float. How can I convert this into either a list or integer/float? The script and error I get is below. Script:
You have to convert the entered string to int/float by first splitting the string into the point components, then casting to the appropriate type:To keep the entered values as a single custom datatype, named  for example, you can use a :Demo:
Convert the input into the specific type as int or floatInto a list:or into variables:
After this  the variable one contains a string that looks like this  which cannot be converted to  as is. You need to first split the string using  which will yield a list  then you can iterate through the list and convert each of  and  to  using  which applies the  function to every element of the list . In code, you can do it as follows:As a side note, you should consider wrapping the user input with a  clause to handle the case where a user inserts non-int input:
