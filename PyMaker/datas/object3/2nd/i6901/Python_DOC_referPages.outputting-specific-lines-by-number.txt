I want to read lines 25 to 55 from a file, but the range seems to be only outputting a single number and 6 lines, when it should be 30 lines.Output:
Use the builtin  function:
You could read the file fully then slice to get the list of lines:if the file is big, though, it's better to skip 25 lines, then read, then get out of the loop to avoid reading the thousand other lines for nothing:also note that if you're comparing the line numbers with a text editor, there's a 1 offset (python starts at 0, editors start at 1, so you can use  to fix that properly.
So your  in the code above is printing the last line. To read all the lines from 25 to 55 you need to print the data inside the loop.
