hey i want to be able to change my string being split at say the third full stop or the 2nd  here is my codei want to split the string after the 2nd full stop so it will look like
orThese use  (2/3),  (2/3), and slices (2/3). There's no reason to use loops or regex for this.
I would do something like this:Basically you store the line in a and split it on "." and then use a subsequence which you can use however you like.e.g. a[2:3] gives u the secound and third line while a[:3] gives you all three.
A rough way to do it would be to use a counter and loop through the string, adding every character until the stopping limit is reached.
