I created the following to unit test: Someone mentioned that there is no need to mock  without an explanation. Is there other way to verify the call to  without mocking ? How would I change the following assertion to verify the call?
If create  is not a issue (i.e. db connection or network access) you can do your test without mock it. You have follow alternatives:Use 's  attribute if you are not interested to check how your method call Use  if you would like to check that  has called by  keyword arg but you are not interested about what is the valueUse  to extract  call arguments and by calls as tuple extract  valueThe first one isThe second one isFinally the third one isLast option is quite the same to mock  but I wrote it just to show all possibilities.
