I am a new user in python.  I have the following code that should per a professional tutorial that I'm using.  I have python 3.x and fairly certain the use of urllib.request and urlopen is correct so I'm confused as to why this is not working. If someone can explain why this does not work please let help me.  I put the traceback error code below the code snippet.The error message was as follows:ImportError: cannot import name 'urlopen'

I just wanted to close the loop on my open questions.  I downloaded the python .msi file again and reinstalled.For whatever reason, the program appears to be working just fine. I honestly do not know why but I wanted to at least say that the matter is closed.Thanks everyone for you help and consideration.
Don't use Instead of the above code, use this
