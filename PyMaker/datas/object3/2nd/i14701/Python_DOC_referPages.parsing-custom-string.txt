I'm working in a alphabet soup and i need to parse strings like this:where the letters can be from A to T and numbers from 1 to 20. My idea in general was to get something like this (with A1 A10)maybe any ideas or code?
Very simpleUse the str.split() function transform your alphabet soup, then split the single elements further by directly accessing them.For example:prints:
Well , i solve this (For the moment is working i guess!), maybe isn't the best way to do it , but is the only way i can do with my knowledge. any better idea will be really accepted ! (Please , if you're reading this because you need something like this , i only posted this because is the only way how i know to do it , maybe someone wish to post a better code down!)The idea base was receive a string "A[1-20] B[1-20]" A and B can be any letter from A to T, store each word splitted to access it:Ex: "A14 B16"[0] = "A"[1] = "14"[2] = "B"[3] = "16"Sorry if I expressed myself incorrectly and no one understood me!
