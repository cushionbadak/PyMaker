I'm working on making a PDF Web Scraper in Python. Essentially, I'm trying to scrape all of the lecture notes from one of my courses, which are in the form of PDFs. I want to enter a url, and then get the PDFs and save them in a directory in my laptop. I've looked at several tutorials, but I'm not entirely sure how to go about doing this. None of the questions on StackOverflow seem to be helping me either.Here is what I have so far:Originally, I had gotten all of the links to the PDFs, but did not know how to download them; the code for that is now commented out.Now I've gotten to the point where I'm trying to download just one PDF; and a PDF does get downloaded, but it's a 0KB file.If it's of any use, I'm using Python 3.4.2
