I'm trying to use the  module in python to match a string with regex. What I'm trying to get is  from an IP address (so missing the last byte).I've tried out my regex in a regex editor and it seems to work. The variable  contains  in it already, so that's where I'm trying to extract the first 3 bytes plus the  from.What I'm trying to do is get those  from  and have it return a string.Code:error codes:
The issue with your code is that you are not rawing your regex string:This makes  act as a word boundary, instead of the character representation of backspace ( means backspace and if you try to match the regex  with the string , you get  as the matched string).But it could be done simpler with split and join:
