Is there any prettier way to write this if-statement:I've tried this, but it didn't work.Or maybe the first one is the prettiest?
You can use  and a generator expression:Or, if you prefer  instead of :The first solution seems to read a little better though.As for why your attempted solution did not work, the  operator in Python does not behave as you think it does.  From the docs:The expression  first evaluates ; if  is true, its value  is returned; otherwise,  is evaluated and the resulting value is  returned.So,  was only passing the first truthy value to the  method, not all of them.
An empty list in Python is false.You can produce an empty list with a comprehension and a conditional like so:
You can use a tuple or set: Extending this idea a bit further: Or using the fact that an empty list or set or whatever is false: I guess it all depends on what you consider to be "pretty".
