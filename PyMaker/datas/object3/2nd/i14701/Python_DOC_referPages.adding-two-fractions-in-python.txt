I am trying to add two fractions in pythonif input 1/4 + 1/4, I am expecting 1/2 resultI built a fraction class with an  method for additionHowever I am getting 2,4 as output, which is actually 1/2, just not simplified. How could I fix that problem ?
The general approach to simplifying fractions is to find the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator and then divide both of them by it
