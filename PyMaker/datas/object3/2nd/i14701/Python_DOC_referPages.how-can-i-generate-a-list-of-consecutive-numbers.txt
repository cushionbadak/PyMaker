Say if you had a number input  in python and you wanted to generate a list of consecutive numbers up to  likeHow could you do this?
In Python 3, you can use the builtin  function like thisNote 1: Python 3.x's  function, returns a  object. If you want a list you need to explicitly convert that to a list, with the  function like I have shown in the answer.Note 2: We pass number 9 to  function because,  function will generate numbers till the given number but not including the number. So, we give the actual number + 1.Note 3: There is a small difference in functionality of  in Python 2 and 3. You can read more about that in this answer.
Using Python's built in range function:Python 2Python 3
Just to give you another example, although range(value) is by far the best way to do this, this might help you later on something else.
Depending on how you want the result, you can also print each number in a for loop:So if the user input was 7 for example:You can also delete the '+1' in the for loop and place it on the print statement, which will change it to starting at 1 instead of 0. 
Note :- Certainly in python-3x you need to use Range function It works to generate numbers on demand, standard method to use Range function to make a list of consecutive numbers is Also if you want to make an function to generate a list of consecutive numbers by using Range function watch this code ! Good Luck!
