To access elements in a list, you have to use numeric indexes, or process all of them.The best thing probaly is to use a for loop in there, that will guarantee you will iterate over  all entries on the list:that will give you a list with only the desired URLs
Supposing that you have that JSON structure I will use this code to solve your problem:You need to pay attention to the dictionary structure in order to access to the field correctly. Before using this code, please pay read about dictionaries in the Python3 documentation.
