Write a function that helps answer questions like '"Today is Wednesday. I leave on holiday in 19 days time. What day will that be?"' ...So the function must take a day name and a delta argument — the number of days to add — and should return the resulting day name:
Clearly you need to translate the day name into a number, e.g with a global list:(replace the  with the other day names:-).To translate the day name into an index in the list (a number from 0 to 6 included), use the list method :that raises a  if  is not a valid weekday name, which I'm guessing is OK or else you would have told us your specifications for such a user error!  (I'm assuming  is the name of the argument your function accepts).Next, you add  to the  and take it modulo 7 so it's again a number between 0 and 6 included:finally, you use this to index the list and return the result:I hope you can put these together into the function you need so you get at least a little learning out of the exercise (as opposed to none if we gave you the needed function ready to copy and paste!-)Edit: I see the  you're passing is actually a string -- any reason for this very peculiar choice...?  If it's part of a really, truly, very remarkably strange specification, you'll also need to make into a number, of course -- i.e, at the very start,A suggestion to preserve the sanity of anybody reading your code: do not name  a variable that is not a number -- like the well-known psychological test where you have a bunch of color names each printed in a color different from the one it's naming, this kind of thing really throws people's brains for a loop!-)
You could make an index of the days in a dictionary:And an inverse of that:So now you have:Then you can get one from the other:
Start with the list of days:You can use the index method of a list to find out the array index location for a provided day:Add to that the number of days from now and you will get the day at that index position in the DAYS list:This will, however, work for up to 6 days from Sunday.  Setting days_from_now to 7 will obviously break things and cause an IndexError.  However, if you calculate the modulus 7 of days_from_now, you can ensure that you'll never exceed 6:The resulting function would look like:
