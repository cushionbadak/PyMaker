If I print a  object in python with a simple  (or  in python3), how can I recover the  object from the resulting string?I could have asked "what is the python  format used by "?ps: There are many questions about conversion of strings to python datetime objects. In the spirit of using stack overflow as a repository of quickly available, useful programming tips, I'm asking this since none of those questions answer this rather specific and oft needed query.
By definition,  is . There is no method that would parse the ISO 8601 format back; you have to provide the format to  explicitly: supports  but it doesn't support  that is why the  call is used here. is available since Python 3.2. For older versions, see How to parse ISO formatted date in python?Convert timestamps with offset to datetime obj using strptime.
