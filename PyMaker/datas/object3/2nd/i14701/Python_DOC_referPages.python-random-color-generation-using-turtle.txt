I need to generate a random color using r g b values to fill in these rectangles for a python school assignment, I'm getting a bad color sequence error even though I'm fairly sure I'm formatting it just as the Python documentation suggests.I'm quite confused as to why t.color(r, g, b) is not producing a random color?
turtle.colormode needs to be set to 255 to give color strings in Hex Code or R G B. adding no longer returned an error.
Your variables r g and b are not global. You either have to add a global declaration at the top of your function or add them as parameters. Or...
