I have several mathematical algorithms that use iteration to search for the right answer. Here is one example:I want to count how many times the algorithm goes through the loop to get a and b. However this is not a  function and it isn't a list, so I can't clearly indicate what objects do I want to count if I use . Is there a way to count those loops?Note: I am not trying to change the code itself. I am really searching for a way to count iterations in a  loop, which I can then use for other cases.
The simplest answer if you need a counter outside of a  loop is to count manually using a simple variable and addition inside your  loop:There is an alternative case - if each step of your iteration has a meanigful value to , you may want your loop to be a generator, and then use  loop and . This makes most sense where you care about which step you are on, not just the count at the end. E.g:
For a counter I use  from :and so on...SyntaxDocsMake an iterator that returns evenly spaced values starting with  number start.Ref. itertools.count
