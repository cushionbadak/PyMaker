How can I conditionally call the orignal method in a mock?In this example I only want to fake a return value if . Otherwise I want to call the original method.I know that it is a bit strange. If I want to fake  in side  it should be condition-less. All (not some) calls to  should be mocked.In my case it is an integration test, not a s tiny unittest and  is a kind of dispatcher which gets used very often. And in one case I need to fake the result.
If you need just replace behavior without care of mock's calls assert function you can use  argument; otherwise you can use  that take a callable. I guess that  is a object method (instead of a ) so you need a reference its object to call it. Your wrapper should declare as first argument the object and your patch use  to use the correct signature for  case.Final trick is save the original method reference and use it to make the call.
