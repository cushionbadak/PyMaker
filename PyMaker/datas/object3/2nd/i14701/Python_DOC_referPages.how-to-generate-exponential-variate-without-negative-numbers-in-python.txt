How to generate exponential variate without negative numbers in Python?I tried to use this code but it generates negative numberI thought about using if statement, but it'll affect my randomness and my final result.
From the documentation of :Exponential distribution. lambd is 1.0 divided by the desired mean. It should be nonzero. (The parameter would be called “lambda”, but that is a reserved word in Python.) Returned values range from 0 to positive infinity if lambd is positive, and from negative infinity to 0 if lambd is negative.If you want non-negative results, use non-negative arguments.
