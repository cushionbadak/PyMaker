I have a list of lists of strings similar to this one:which I need to convert to a list of concatenated "columns", i.e.:I came up with the solution of rotating the entire array 90 degrees clockwise, then joining all items in each rows in reverse order:This works as long as each row has the same number of items. What if that's not the case, though. Say I have an array like this:and what I expect is:I could pad the shorter rows with empty string items prior to using the solution above:But surely there's a better way?
If you have lists of different lengths, you could make use of  which allows a fill value to be specified:The shorter lists are padded using this fill value up to the length of the longest list.In Python 2, the function is named .
