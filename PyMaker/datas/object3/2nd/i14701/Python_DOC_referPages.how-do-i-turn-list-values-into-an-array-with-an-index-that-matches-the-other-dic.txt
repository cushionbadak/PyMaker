Hoping someone can help me out. I've spent the past couple hours trying to solve this, and fair warning, I'm still fairly new to python.This is a repost of a question I recently deleted. I've misinterpreted my code in the last example.The correct example is:I have a dictionary, with a list that looks similar to:I'm using  for both , and , which adds the  values into two new lists:I need to split the item value using  as the delimiter, so I've also split the values by doing: is used in case there is no value. This provides me with a new list for , with the delimiter used. Disregard the fact that I used '_' split for names in this example.When I use this, the index for , and  no longer match. Do i need to create the listed items in an array to match the  index, and if so, how?Ideally, I want  (which is john), to also match  (as an array of the items in the list, so pants, shirt, socks). This way when I refer to index  for , it also grabs all the values for  as index . The same thing regarding the index used for bob , which should match his items with the same index.@avinash-raj, thanks for your patience, as I've had to update my question to reflect more closely to the code I'm working with.
I'm reading a little bit between the lines but are you trying to just collapse the list and get rid of the field names, e.g.:Now the data is directly related vs. indirectly related via a common index into 2 lists. If you want the dictionary split out you can always
You need a list of dictionaries because the duplicate keys  and  are overwritten:Alternatively, you can do this in one line with the built-in  method and generators, like so:
From Looping Techniques in the Tutorial. That will work if your dict is structured
In the loop body ofyou'll probably want to access  (to which the items in  will be assigned in turn) rather than .
