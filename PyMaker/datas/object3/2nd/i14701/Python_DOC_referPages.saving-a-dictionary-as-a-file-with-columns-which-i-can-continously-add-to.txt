I have a dictionary of currencies here in . I will give a sample for simplicity:And I wish to add them to a file where i can continuously add different sets of currencies at different times. The file should have a column for the code name of currency (e.g. "AED") and another column for name.I really don't know where to start. Help to point me in the right direction will be very much appreciated.My code for the dictionary is as follows:
You could simply save your data in  with one line per currency:To do that, you might want to transform your dictionary into rows, but in this case, it's trivial, since it's just the pair :Note, however, that the items will be in a random order, if you want the entries sorted, you can sort them before writing to the file:In the end, using the  module:Putting it all together:
You can use  to handle easily the save file process. As  handles with dictionaries and the result of  is dict,  do the job simpler.
