I have a string variable res which I have derived from a pyodbc cursor as shown in the bottom.The table  has a single row with data  whose unicode codepoint is .The Result I get is Whereas the result I should have got is.I tried adding charset as utf-8 to my pyodbc connect string as shown below.The result was now correctly set as a unicode but the codepoint was for someother string  which could be due to a possible bug in the pyodbc driver.Actual codeAdditional detailsDatabase: Teradatapyodbc version: 2.7So How do I now either1) cast  to  (is it possible to do this without unintentional side-effects?)2) resolve the pyodbc/unixodbc issue
This is something I think is best handled with Python, instead of fiddling with pyodbc.connect arguments and driver-specific connection string attributes. is a Latin-1 encoded string representing the unicode Ã¤ character.To explicitly decode the pyodbc result in Python 2.7:Python 3.x does this for you (the  type includes unicode characters):
For Python 3, try this:After  Place this:oretc...Python 2:etc...
