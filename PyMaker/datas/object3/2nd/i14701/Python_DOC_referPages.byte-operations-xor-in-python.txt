If someone could enlighten me on how I could accomplish this I would be very happy. Very new to the whole data-type conversions so yeah...reading through the python wiki is not as clear as I would like :(.
It looks like what you need to do is XOR each of the characters in the message with the corresponding character in the key. However, to do that you need a bit of interconversion using  and , because you can only xor numbers, not strings:Note that  just converts a string to another string (though possibly with different encoding).Your approach, and my code above, will only work if the key is at least as long as the message. However, you can easily repeat the key if required using :To address the issue of unicode/multi-byte characters (raised in the comments below), one can convert the string (and key) to bytes, zip these together, then perform the XOR, something like:
Comparison of two python3 solutionsThe first one is based on zip:The second one uses int.from_bytes and int.to_bytes:Simple tests:Performance tests with  and  being 1000 bytes long:The integer approach seems to be significantly faster.
