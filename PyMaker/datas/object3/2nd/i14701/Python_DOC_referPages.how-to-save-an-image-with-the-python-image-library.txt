Natural Text
I am a beginner in Python, so this question might be stupid but unfortunatly I can't figure it out on my own.With the following script I want to create a black image and save it under the following path: C://Users/User/Desktop/black.pngThe point is now that I want to pretend the path, the filename and the filetyp with the function like that:And there the struggle begins: I cant find the exact Syntax how I can deliver the path (filename, filetyp) to the img.save functionI got errors by using a different filetyp than png. The line  works fine but when I try to use  instead for example, the program I run the script with (Blender) crashes or get stucked in an endless loop).
I think what you're looking for is this:Then you can call it like this:Pass whatever arguments (with keyword) you want, and it'll use the default values for all the others (just as you were already using the default values for  and ).Notice that you always need quotes around string literals in Python. You can't just write ; that says the default value for  is whatever value happens to be in the global variable  (and you probably don't have one, so you get a ), not the string .Next, to combine a base filename like  and an extension like  into a complete filename, Python doesn't have a function to do that, so you have to do it manually, like . But to combine a directory name like  and a filename like , Python does have a function, â€”and you should use it, because there are some tricky edge cases you might get wrong otherwise.Your problem #2 seems to be completely unrelated to your problem #1, so I won't answer it here; create a separate question for that.
