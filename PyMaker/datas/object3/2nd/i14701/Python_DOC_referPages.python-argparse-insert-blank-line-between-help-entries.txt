Natural Text
When using argparse, passing  to the program generates help text. Unfortunately, it's hard to read because there are no blank lines between options. Here's an excerpt to illustrate:Notice that in some cases, such as between  and  or between  and , it is difficult to tell at a glance which help text applies to which option. There should be a blank line between entries. For example:How can I accomplish this? Several other questions recommend using . The problem with that is that if I use it, I have to write my own logic to wrap the help text as the raw text help formatter does no formatting. The obvious answer would be to append  to the end of the help text and use the default formatter. But inexplicably, newlines get stripped.What's the way forward here? I'm using Python 3.4.
You can create your own help text formatter that does this. Note that this requires you to be very specific to the implementation detail of the . So consider this warning that is included in every help formatter type description:Only the name of this class is considered a public API. All the methods provided by the class are considered an implementation detail.Once we ignore that, creating our own help formatter that adds a blank line between the entries is very simple:And thatâ€™s it. Now when you create the  object while passing  to the constructor, blank lines will appear between each argument in the help text.
 approach is good.  Note that  also modifies this method, simplifying it to: method could be tweaked to give you more controlWith this:displays:For reference, the default  is:This removes final \n and reduces all interior whitespace to one blank.
