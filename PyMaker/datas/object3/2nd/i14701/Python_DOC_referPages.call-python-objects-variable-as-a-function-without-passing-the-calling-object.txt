I have a structure something like this:This doesn't work because the original foobar function can't handle  being passed to it -- it wasn't part of any class or object to begin with. Python won't let me add the  decorator either.I have no control over the definition of , and I may have to override the value of  in subclasses. How can I call foo, without passing the object calling it?
Decorators are plain functions, you should be able to call  explicitly in the class definition
The approach from user2357112's comment seems to work, too:If return values shall make it through, you need  statements on all levels, though:
