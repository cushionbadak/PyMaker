First of, I'm sorry if the title is not entirely fitting, I had a hard time finding an appropriate one (which might have also effect my searching efficiency for already asked questions like this :/ ).The problem is the following. While it is comparably easy to solve coupled ODE's in python with Scipy, I still have to write down my ODE in the form explicitly. For example for a coupled ODE of the form d/dt(c_0)=a(c_0)+b(c_1) and d/dt(c_1)=c(c_0) I would set up sth like:However, now I have coupled ODE's of the rough formd/dt(c_{m,n})=a(c_{m,n})+b(c_{m+1,n-1})+k(c_{m-1,n+1})with c_{0,0}=1 and I have to include orders with m^2+n^2-mn smaller than a max value.For a small max, what I did, is using a dictionary to use a notation with two indices and map it on a 1D listand then I entered the ODE for each orderNow I basically have to do that for some 100 coupled equations, which I ofc do not want to hard code, so I was trying to figure out a way, to realize the ODE's with a loop or sth. However I couldn't yet find a way around the fact of having two indices in my coefficients together with the condition of only including orders with m^2+n^2-mn smaller than a max value.As I am running in some deadlines, I figured it is time to ask smarter people for help.Thanks for reading my question!
I had a similar problem. If you fill you dictionary you can just redeclare the function more times inside the loop. This is a silly example of how it works:If you need to use more functions together you can use anonymous functions and store them in memory. Another example:You can use a list or a generator too. For example you can write down the value on a txt file and read that with the readline function each time.As pointed in the comments below, if you use lamda functions you should pay attention to references.
