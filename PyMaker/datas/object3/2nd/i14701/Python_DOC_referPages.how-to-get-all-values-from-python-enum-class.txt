You can use IntEnum:To get list of the ints:
You can do the following:
To use Enum with any type of value, try this:Updated with some improvements... Thanks @Jeff, by your tip!As result:
So the  has a  dict. The solution that @ozgur proposed is really the best, but you can do this, which does the same thing, with more workThe  dictionary could come in handy if you wanted to insert stuff dynamically in it... in some crazy situation.[EDIT]Apparently  is not a dictionary, but a map proxy. Which means you can't easily add items to it.You can however do weird stuff like , and then you can use the new key like .... but this is just an implementation detail, and should not be played with. Black magic is payed for with huge maintenance costs.
class  is a class that solves all your enumeration needs, so you just need to inherit from it, and add your own fields. Then from then on, all you need to do is to just call it's attributes:  & :
Based on the answer by @Jeff, refactored to use a  so that you can reuse the same code for any of your enums:Produces:
