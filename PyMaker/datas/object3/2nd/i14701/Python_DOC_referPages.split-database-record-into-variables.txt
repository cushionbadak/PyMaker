Assuming you're using , it has a nifty row factory built in that lets you access the rows as if they were dictionaries, with the column names as keys:I know this isn't exactly what you asked for, but it's usually what you actually want. Creating variables dynamically is a bad idea. If you really want to, though, the answer is the same as dumping any mapping into the local scope, which you can search for if you must.If you'd prefer attribute-style access (like ) to dict-style access (like ), that's pretty simple. (But remember that not every valid SQL column name is a valid Python identifier!)The most efficient way to do this is probably to create a  out of the :If you're using MySQL, I don't know if any of the MySQL libraries provide the equivalent of , but it's not hard to build yourself by using the  property of a cursor, the same way we build a  out of it. For example:Unlike the special  factory, which is specific to ,  is required by the DB-API 2.0 spec.
