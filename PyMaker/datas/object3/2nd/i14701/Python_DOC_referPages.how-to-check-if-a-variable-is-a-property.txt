This question already has an answer here:Determine if given class attribute is a property or not, Python object                    2 answers                Suppose there is a class with a  defined:Normally, to check whether an attribute is a function, I can use  from the  module.How can I check a ? There appears to be no  function.
Simply check the type against the  object:You don't really have to retrieve it from the class dictionary here; looking up a property on the class as an attribute also returns the  instance.
You could use :Return true if the object is a data descriptor. ... Examples are  properties (defined in Python), getsets, and members....CPython implementation detail: getsets are attributes defined in extension modules via PyGetSetDef structures....CPython implementation detail: Member descriptors are attributes defined in extension modules via PyMemberDef structuresData descriptors are just types that have certain methods. See 3.3.2.1. Implementing Descriptors:If the descriptor defines  and/or , it is a data  descriptor; if it defines neither, it is a non-data descriptor.Non-data descriptors include  and  (that is, they're not functions, they're types). For example,  would return .On the other hand,  is a data descriptor:The downside of using this function is that it may return  if  is .A better way is to check for object type directly:
