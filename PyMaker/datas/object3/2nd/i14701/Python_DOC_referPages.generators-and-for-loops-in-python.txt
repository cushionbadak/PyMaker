So I have a generator function, that looks like this.After I load up this function and call "next" a bunch of times, I'd expect it to yield valuesBut instead it just yields 0 all the time.  Why is that?
 initializes new generator object:Then  gets the first value from the newly created generator object (0 in your case).You should call  once:Note:  was removed from Python 3 (PEP 3114) - use the  function instead:
With each call of  you are creating a new generator object:Create one generator, and then call the  for subsequent items:
I posted it in the comment, I think if you look at this in parallel with the question you see the mistake:Instead of making a new generator object each time, you have to make it once and then use it until it has been depleted:
