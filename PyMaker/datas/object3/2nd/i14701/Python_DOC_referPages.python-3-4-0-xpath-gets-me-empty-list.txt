Trying to retrieve some data from the web using urlib and lxml, I've got an error and have no idea, how to fix it.The error itself:I'm using Ukrainian in API this time, but when I use API (without any Ukrainian letters in it) here:it gets me the data in Ukrainian and everything works just fine.
URLs can only use a subset of printable ASCII codepoints; everything else must be properly encoded using URL percent encoding.You can best achieve that by letting Python handle your parameters. The  function can convert a dictionary (or a sequence of key-value pairs) for use in URLs:This will first encode the parameters to UTF-8 bytes, then convert those bytes to percent-encoding sequences:If you did not construct this URL yourself, you'll need to 'repair' the encoding. You can split of the query string, parse it into a dictionary, then pass it to  to put it back into the URL using  and :This splits the URL into its constituent parts, parses out the query string, re-encodes and re-builds the URL afterwards:
I believe you can do something like belowI think urllib.quote will transform  into something like which should be accepted just fine
