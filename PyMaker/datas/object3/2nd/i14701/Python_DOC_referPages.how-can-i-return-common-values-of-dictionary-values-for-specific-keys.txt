I have a dictionary, which contains:where  corresponds to a word and  are the set of files that contain that word.Suppose I have a dictionary:and my query is . How do I compare values in such a way that I return only  and ?
Iterate over the keys in the query and aggregate the result in a :
You can use the  to create the common elements, like thisHere, we are creating a generator expression, which gets all the files corresponding to the word and converts that to a set. We then unpack the genereator expression over the  function, which finds the set intersection of all the sets.Edit: If your values of the dictionary are really sets, as you mentioned in the questionand files are the set of files that contain that wordthen, the solution can be even faster, since we don't have convert the lists to sets.  You can simply skip that and doImportant EditWhat if the dictionary had only  and  is not there and the input is ? If you wanted to return an empty set in that case, then you just have to slightly modify the generator expression, like thisHere, we use  method to return a default value if the key is not found in the dictionary. So, if  is not there in the dictionary, then we return an empty set which makes the result an empty set (because when you intersect any set with an empty set, the result will be an empty set).
Here's a simple way, by constructing a mirror or reverse map of the given . The keys in this reverse dictionary, that have all the items in , as their corresponding values would be what we want.
