I'd like to count the number of leading spaces in a string.What's the most Pythonic way of doing this?(update) Here are timings of several of the answers:
If you need to find length of leading whitespaces, you can just remove ' ' from lstrip, which is now limited to spaces only
Using  moduleUsing The brute force way
Use  to iterate through the string . As soon as you hit a non  item in , print that index, which is what you are looking for.
looks for the first character that doesn't match 
Through  module. and using  function.This would remove all the chars from the first non-space character upto the last. Then the len function applies on the resultant string giving you the length of leading spaces.ORThis would match only zero or more leading spaces. ORUse re.match function's  attribute. Thanks to Adam
Ooh one more that no one has posted yet.This is almost certainly the fastest way to do it
A simple map and then sum:
Code:
Strip the string on the left side using the first character:If you want to make it work for empty strings, simply add a check:
sorry for not being explicit enough....initialize a counter...you just iterate through the string and set a condition to check if each variable in the list a whitespace and the counter increment by 1...i am sincerely sorry i dont know why my script keeps showing in this lousy format..i am kind of new here
