In python strings have a method  and .I was under the (wrong) impression that  and  would return  for strings such as  and false otherwise. I'm running the following version of python:And I found that  and  return true if all characters in the string are integers, but false if a  (dot) is present. What causes this behaviour? Shouldn't  return ?
As defined in the Python documentation,  returns  if all characters within the string are numeric, otherwise . A dot is not considered to be numeric.
