I want to send out a bytearray using serial module. Elements in the bytearray are float data types that are rounded and converted to integers, for this reason I use numpy for speed efficiency rather than pythons native data type conversion functions. Problem is numpy is incorrectly representing decimal integers 9, 10, and 13 inside bytearray. I'm using python 3.4.2 and numpy 1.9.2 on Windows 7 x64. Here is example of problem:decimal integers 9, 10, 13 become t, n, and r when they should be represented as 0x09, 0x0a, 0x0d
The values are actually correct. What you are seeing is how the printing which calls  on the object formats those as bytes as escape sequences.  is the same as  as  is .  is chosen over  as it is shorter and more easily recognized.Now if you want to print the bytes as hex as in  rather than  use the  function to convert before printing.
