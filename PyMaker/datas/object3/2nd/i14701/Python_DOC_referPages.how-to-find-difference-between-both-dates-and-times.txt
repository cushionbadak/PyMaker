This is what I've been working with... I've tried for ages to get this to work properly but I can only get an error saying:I'd appreciate help please. 
The problem is exactly what it says:  objects don't have a  method. If you want to format a , you have to do it manually. (Or use a third-party library that provides more features.)Also, note that the specific output you're looking for doesn't even really make sense. Time deltas don't do months and years, just days and secondsâ€”because months and years wouldn't make sense. 35 days is 35 days no matter when you start counting, but 1 month and 5 days may be anywhere from 33 days to 36, so it's not a consistent time delta.
You can use :If you don't have it installed you can install it with pip:
In case, you don't want to use , you need to write a custom  like  and as @abarnet suggested with only (days, hours, seconds) ifro
http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/time_strftime.htmtime.strftime(format[, t])time.strftime("%b %d %Y %H:%M:%S", diff)  (or try time.gmtime(diff) like shown on the link)You are using diff.strftime, and diff doesnt know strftime, the imported time does, so try time.strftime
