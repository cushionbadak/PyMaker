I'm new to Python and I keep getting this error:when I try to run this code:What am I doing wrong?
This line is your problem:Python interprets what's in those square brackets as a key to get an item from what's just before themâ€”in this case, getting the item with key  from . And, of course, the  class isn't a container and doesn't have any items!Remove the leading , and you get a list literal, which is probably what you want.See the documentation on s for more information on how to create them.See also the official Python style guide, which statesnames that would otherwise collide with keywords or builtins (like ) should have single underscores appended rather than being mangled ( instead of  or ), except in the case of container literals and function calls should have spaces after the commas ( instead of )
To define a list,or but  is a type, which you can call with parenthesis but you can't get an item from  using the square brackets.
