Natural Text
I have this code:And I get an UnicodeDecodeError in the line :How can I fix this? 
 enables text mode. The subprocess output (bytes) is decoded using  character encoding as @cdosborn mentioned.If it doesn't work, provide the actual  that is used by . And/or specify the error handler such as ,, etc  as  parameter:
The  setting results in an additional encoding that is the source of your error. results in an encoding based on the output of: Python threw an error when it expected your input to match the encoding above, but instead processed a byte clearly in a different encoding.More info about python 3.4  here.
If you're using Python 3.6 or later, you can fix the error by changing this line:to this:I used UTF-8 above, but you can substitute it with whatever encoding you need.
