I am doing homework assignment and I wrote the following code, which does what I want it to do:However, when I change  to , I get an error:I understand that it looks like a stupid question, but I searched for it and couldn't find an answer. I am relatively new to Python, so don't quite understand what is going on. I am trying to iterate through a generator object that is produced by using  and that one is definitely not of type .
 takes an iterable as a parameter. You should do the following:If you only have two elements, stick to the  operator. The  function adds some noise and a small overhead compared to a simple  which is more intuitive.
 is a function to compute the sum of an iterable; if you want the sum of 2 elements, just use  as in your first case, or put  and  in an iterable (tuple: , for instance).
Use map:Using List Comprehension:
 takes iterables and returns an iterable of tuples containing -th element from each argument. In your case, that'd be the equivalent ofBy writing you are unpacking the tuple into two bound variables with names  and . Now  and  are s because the elements of  and  were ints. Use a plus operator to add those two ints together or if you want to sum the whole tuple without unpacking explicitely.
