Can someone please explain why my enter method in the following class is returning two values? I'm learning python and in the process of creating a simple game to grasp OOP and classes. Anyhow I need the enter method to return a random snippet from the snippets list. But I keep getting two snippets instead of one. Can someone explain why? 
Generally, you'll create a class and then describe the behavior and contents of an instance of that class. An instance of a class is an object whose type is that class. For example,  would create a  object, sending  and  to the object's  method (a constructor).The following sticks to instances of a class by making use of the word .  is not a keyword (like ); it's just the word that an object's description uses to refer to the object itself. You can use any word (like  in ), but  is preferred.
Why don't you just use 
Im going to take a guess and say its because you have something like thisbut its really a stab in the dark ... since you have not provided enough information to actually answer your question. ... (really I guess this question should be closed until OP provides sufficient datas)you can test this by just running and if you see a print that is almost definately your problem
