Natural Text
I have a list in python with 4 elements that are all themselves lists of lines ( text)I want to save those elements in numbered filenames.I get the error message :Any hint what i can do to fix it ?
If you are iterating through your  with , then  will take the value of each item in  (so  is a ). Then if you try and get , then you are trying to use the list  as an index.You can just have:Don't try and close  -- it is closed automatically by the  block.If you want to use the index in the file name, I think what you want is something like this: will give you the index and the items as you iterate through the list.
You can use Note will take care of . gives  in each .No need of 
Let's clarify your data structure. It sounds like this:So let's use python's iterable for loop structure to traverse the outer list.But we want to write the contents of each  to a file, using the position of the  in the . Let's use the built in  function to get the position.Let's examine writing the  to a file.All together that would be:EDIT: There is one more step needed here, as pointed out by @mhawkeThe  method requires it to be passed a string. We can convert our inner_list to a string quite easily. My preferred method would be to use the  method. We can specify that we join each string in  with a new line character, so that it will print nicely, i.e.Therefore our final solution would be:
If you want to write lists of lists use the csv module:
