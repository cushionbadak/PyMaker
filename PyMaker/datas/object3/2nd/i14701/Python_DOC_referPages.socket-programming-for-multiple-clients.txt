I'm trying to write code for a chat server using sockets for multiple clients. But it is working for only a single client. Why is it not working for multiple clients? I have to perform this program using Beaglebone Black. My server program will be running on beaglebone and normal clients on gcc or terminal. So I can't use multithreading.       
Use an event loop.Integrated in python like asyncio : Echo server exampleor use an external library that provides the event loop like libuv: Echo server example.Note: Your code is not working for multiple clients simultaneously beacause you are blocked in the receive operation and you are not handling new accept operations.
