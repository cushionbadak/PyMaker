I'm new to Python and trying to write a simple poker playing game. If I have five cards, , , , ,  and want to check if any of them match (are a pair), then I think I could write a line like:But I think there is a tool whereby you can effectively ask if any of  match, then...However I don't know how to write it.
You can use  to get all the pairs of cards within the hand. To use a simple example:Then you can use  to see if any of these pairs are a match to each other:You should be able to adapt this to your representation relatively easily; if you have  objects, for instance, this will call . Note that I've used a sequence (tuple, or a list would also work) of five "cards", rather than five separate identifiers (, , etc.); this makes the code more readable and flexible (the size of the hand is now irrelevant, so you can easily add seven-card stud to your poker game).
Use a generator expression to pass into the  built-in: 
I'd use the fact that  does not contain multiple same elements, for example:
