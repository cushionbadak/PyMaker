So I am bit stuck thinking over this - I have a file which contains many character lines - one after the other. They are not in paragraph but rather in this form - The idea is to find the number of lines which has the most common size (or number of characters). In the above example - 4 lines would be the answer I am trying to do this in python, since the rest of the code is written in it.Any help would be greatly appreciated. 
The  module has a dictionary subclass named  that will could be used to keep track of the length of each line encountered. This make solving the problem very easy. If the files aren't humongous, you could use it like this:Otherwise you could avoid reading it all into memory at once by using a generatorÂ expression in conjunction with a  function:
Use a list of lines lengths, then maximize the number of occurances:
Here's a way to get the most common length:
You can use a counter and then use counter's  method:Result:meaning length 3 is the most common with 4 occurences.
Well, starting from reading the lines, there are a few approaches which you could take:or maybeThen, you'd need to somehow store each line lengthNow, you only need to find the most recurrent lengthFinding the greatest value from a set should be trivial, but just in case:
