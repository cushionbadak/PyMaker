This question already has an answer here:How do I pass a variable by reference?                    24 answers                So basically i've observed that in python3 if i do something likeThe output will be "10 5" since a is not changed by the function.However the same does not happen for lists:When i run the function it changes the actual list. Now to my Question: Why does this happen, where can i read up more about this(Honestly have no idea how to word my google search) and how can i avoid this. Please feel free to redirect me to other articles as this could be a common problem but I honestly couldn't find anything similar. Thanks in advance :)
Use the  module.This prints
Each element in a Python  is a location in memory, so when you modify an element, you're actually modifying that reference in memory. So if you're familiar with C++, passing a list into a function in Python, is similar in concept to passing by reference.
