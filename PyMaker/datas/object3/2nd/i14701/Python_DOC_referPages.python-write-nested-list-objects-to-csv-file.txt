I'm trying to write data from a list of lists to a csv file. This is a simplified version of what I haveBecause of the way the data is set up, I store the points in a nested loop. If I wanted to access the first point objectâ€™s BMI, I would typeI want to write each point's BMI to a CSV (delimited by a comma). How do I do that?Here's how I thought but it isn't exactly straight forward:It doesn't return any error however it doesn't actually create the CSV file either. Also I want to write the values in  to file. I don't have a problem with permissions because I use Spyder (python IDE) as root. Right now I'm just running the script through the Spyder console but it should still work and output the CSV file.
 expects a list of list of strings or numbers. You should start by creating a list with the BMI values so that they can get written into your  file: 
There are three issues:The nested lists must be flattened.  To accomplish this, use itertools.chain.from_iterable. The row data for the CSV must be customized.  To accomplish this, use list comprehensions.output.csv is not being created.  I suspect that the output.csv is being created but being placed in an unexpected location.  You could try hardcoding a full path for testing to see if this is the case.  Here is code that demonstrates #1 and #2:
You can do this with , as it expects a list of  - each  should be formatted as per the  parameter to , which can be ignored in this case without fear of any backfiring.So  can take a structure that looks like . The problem is that you need to access all the points and grab their BMIs (this can be done in a list comprehension)To illustrate how writerows can be used (and to add a number to each point, so that all your rows don't have just one entry (which would be frustrating), I added the call to enumerate.Therefore, you no longer need complex loops or any such.
