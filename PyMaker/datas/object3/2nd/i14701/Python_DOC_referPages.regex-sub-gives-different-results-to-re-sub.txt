Natural Text
I work with Czech accented text in Python 3.4.Calling  to perform substitution by regex on an accented sentence works well, but using a regex compiled with  and then calling  fails.Here is the case, where I use the same arguments for  and I believe that the reason is accents, because for a non-accented sentence  and  work identically. But it seems to me like a bug, because passing the same arguments returns different results, which should not happen. This topic is complicated by different platforms and locales, so it may not be reproducible on your system. Here is screenshot of my console.Do  you see any fault in my code, or should I report it as a bug?
As Padraic Cunningham figured out, this is not actually a bug.However, it is related to a bug which you didn't run into, and to you using a flag you probably shouldn't be using, so I'll leave my earlier answer below, even though his is the right answer to your problem.There's a recent-ish change (somewhere between 3.4.1 and 3.4.3, and between 2.7.3 and 2.7.8) that affects this. Before that change, you can't even compile that pattern without raising an .More importantly, why are you using ? The  mechanism does not mean "use the Unicode rules for my locale", it means "use some unspecified non-Unicode rules that only really make sense for Latin-1-derived locales and may not work right on Windows". Or, as the docs put it:Make , , , ,  and  dependent on the current locale. The use of this flag is discouraged as the locale mechanism is very unreliable, and it only handles one “culture” at a time anyway; you should use Unicode matching instead, which is the default in Python 3 for Unicode (str) patterns.See bug #22407 and the linked python-dev thread for some recent discussion of this.And if I remove the  flag, the code now compiles just fine on 3.4.1. (I also get the "right" results on both 3.4.1 and 3.4.3, but that's just a coincidence; I'm now intentionally not passing the screwy flag and screwing it up in the first version, and still accidentally not passing the screwy flag and screwing it up in the second, so they match…)So, even if this were a bug, there's a good chance it would be closed WONTFIX. The resolution for #22407 was to deprecate  for non- patterns in 3.5 and remove it in 3.6, so I doubt anyone's going to care about fixing bugs with it now. (Not to mention that  itself is theoretically going away in favor of  one of these decades… and IIRC,  also deprecated the  flag unless you're using a  pattern and -compatible mode.)
The last argument in the compile is , if you  actually use  in the  you will see the same behaviour:The fourth arg to  is  so that is why you see the difference.re.sub(pattern, repl, string, count=0, flags=0)re.compile(pattern, flags=0)
