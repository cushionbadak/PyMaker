I am trying to implement a simple idea of passing a data from stdin to a coroutine:This code works fine, however a simplified version of it with a variable instead of an  object works too:My questions are: is the approach with  correct? Or is there a better way with another asyncio objects to handle this kind of problem? Then, if the approach with  is fine, is using a variable is fine as well? Thank you. 
I think  is much better suited for this kind of producer/consumer relationship:There's less logic involved than with an , which you need to make sure you set/unset properly, and there's no need for a , wakeup, check, go back to sleep, loop, like with the global variable. So the the  approach is simpler, smaller, and blocks the event loop less than your other possible solutions. The other solutions are technically correct, in that they will function properly (as long as you don't introduce any  calls inside if  and  blocks). They're just a bit clunky.
If you want to wait for an event, you should probably be using  instead of polling .
