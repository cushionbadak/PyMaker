I am trying to call a variable defined in a function, inside another function of the same class, but with  doesn't work.python says: .I don't know very well how to use classes. I didn't use  'cause I do not have anything to put, is there maybe a way to add it even if I do not need it formally?Thanks for your help.
Your  and  variables are local. You can only use these variables in the method scope. If you want a class attribute (shared with all the class) you have to set the like  and .In python is not necessary create a constructor method  neither initialize these attributes.But in your example if you call  before  it will crash because you are using one attribute that doen't exist. Then is recommended initialize the attributes.You can initialize the attributes like this:More things to keep in mind:1. The variables are in lower case and snake case: 2. Your prints won't print anything because your functions don't return anything. You have to return something like:or if you need to set a and print:
What you need is:Within ,  is a local variable as someone stated, whereas  is an attribute attached to your current object.
In  you need to change  to . In your original code you were creating a local variable , you need to explicitly use  to attach the variable  to the instance of the object and stay persistent across function calls.
