How to print a certain part of a line after it had been "re.searched" from a fileHere is the initial code, based on the accepted answer to the linked question:I was able to find the requested IP address in text file.My goal is to somehow convert the string  to a format that would allow me to use it in mathematical formulas. For example, I want to get another address  by subtracting 1 from the last octet of the original address.
You can use the  module for Python 3:The  class allows for arithmetic operatorsDocs: https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#operators
