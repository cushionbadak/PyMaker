You need to import the Python CSV library and then create a  object. (See the Python documentation on how to do this - it's fairly straightforward). When you create the  you give it a list of the column headings you require. Then for each record you want to write to the CSV file you simply create a dictionary with keys corresponding to the column heading and call the DictWriter's  method. There's an example of exactly what you need to do here.
