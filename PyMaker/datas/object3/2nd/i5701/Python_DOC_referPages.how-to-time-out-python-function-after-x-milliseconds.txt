I'm calling a function  in python . I want it to be terminated if it executes for more than X milliseconds. I've looked at some ways of timing out including , but they all take the time in integral seconds. I want to do something like: How do I do this? 
Aside from the solution I linked as a possible duplicate, you could also use  to use  if your system supports it.For example, on macOS:
singal.settimer requires unix.Else you can use time.time()you can use a decorator, put your function under the while loop or raise an exception when timer ends (and probably others).You may have to thread the timer.
