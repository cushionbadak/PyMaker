Apparently there are other questions about reading the last lines of a .txt file but I really did not understand the answers and don't know how to apply them in my code. I've created a simple program that writes a sequence of numbers on a .txt file, a new line for each number. Then you can choose how many of them to print.For some reason, it misses the last 3 lines, for example:I choose to write 100 numbers on the fileIn the next step, I choose to print n lines.It only prints n-3 lines!I could "solve" this by adding 3 to the numbers of lines I want to print, but that's just not right. I don't understand why this is happening. There isn't any empty lines on the .txt file. It's literally just a file with one number per line, from beginning to end.The code is this:Thanks in advance!
The argument to  isn't the number of the line, it tells how many characters the  method is allowed to read at most. Use , not .Otherwise for input , this will happen: The contents of the file areNow, the first iteration reads maximum of 0 characters, returning the empty string . This is printed with a newline. The second reads a maximum of 1 characters, which now will contain the digit . This is printed with newline. The third read will read maximum of 2 characters but meets a newline right away, and returns a string that only has one newline. This is printed, with the extra newline from . Now read 4 will read maximum of 3 characters, and this will now return the string  which is just 2 characters. This is printed, with an extra newline. Finally, the last read will read maximum of 4 characters, returns , which again is printed with extra newline.Finally, no one writes the actual Python code like that. Try the following instead:
