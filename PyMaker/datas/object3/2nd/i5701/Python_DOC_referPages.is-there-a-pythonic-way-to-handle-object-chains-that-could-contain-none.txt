My Django codebase has foreign key references that are a few objects deep and it feels like a code smell to have to check for truthiness at each level.Is there a way to check for this kind of thing in a more pythonic way with less boilerplate?Take this simplified example:If  is optional and it doesn't exist it will return  and throw an exception saying, rightly, that  doesn't have an  attribute.The obvious fix isBut this will get repetitive and verbose.  I suppose you could use  to do something like I'm after but it's even uglier:Is there a concise way to do this without all these conditional clauses?
