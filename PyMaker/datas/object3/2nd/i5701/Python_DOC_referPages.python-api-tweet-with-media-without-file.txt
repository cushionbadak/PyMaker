I'm using twitter from  in an environment where I can't store files.I get a HTTP POST with a text and an image and want to create a tweet from this data without writing a local file (it's  on AWS api environment).Tweepy only allows filenames, which does not work for me. seems to have something like that, but I can't find a doc for this.Should I just send POST requests to twitter for uploading the images? Is there a simpler way?
Try passing a io.BytesIO to tweepy's API.update_with_media as .filename – The filename of the image to upload. This will automatically be opened unless file is specified...file – A file object, which will be used instead of opening filename. filename is still required, for MIME type detection and to use as a form field in the POST dataEdit: It looks like you have the image data base64 encoded. You can use base64.b64decode to decode it before creating the io.BytesIO:
