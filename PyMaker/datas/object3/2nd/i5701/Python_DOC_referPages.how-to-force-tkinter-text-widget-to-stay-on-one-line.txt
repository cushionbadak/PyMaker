Natural Text
I want to create an object akin to Label, however I want it to also be selectable for copy-pasting. I have done so using the Text widget:I end up displaying this widget with a grid. However, I randomly find the last 1 or 2 characters not showing. When investigating this, it seems the Text widget is splitting those characters off to a new line (when selecting the text, it is possible to drag down to see this second line). The biggest problem is the unpredictable nature of this splitting (I tried doing width = len(text) + 2, but I still occasionally get this line splitting behaviour). Is there any way to remedy this behaviour?EDIT: setting wrap = 'none' fixed the line splitting behaviour, but the text is still getting cutoff. Now I have to scroll horizontally instead of vertically to see the text, but I guess that is a different question from what I posed.
What you're experiencing is called wrapping and can be disabled modifying Text widget's  option, as in :or
