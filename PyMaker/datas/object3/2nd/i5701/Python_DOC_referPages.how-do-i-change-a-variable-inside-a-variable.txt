Here's my code :This is what it prints :Why doesn't the hp1 change inside the health?
To do what you wish to do, you must use a class. This is the closest form of a pointer you will encounter in python.Here is an example :Your question is also a possible duplicate ofPointers in Python? .What is happening here in your program has been explained by the others.
To automatically change the output with any mutations of , you can use a class:Output:
The following line:Is creating a  with two values:  and  (Note that the value of  is copied, and not referenced). It's then assigning this  to a new variable named . has nothing to do with . If  get overriden, deleted, thrown away, or anything happens to it,  doesn't care.If you are so eager to pass this variable a reference, you can create a wrapper class around the  type:
Because you defined  - a  tuple - as  was still 100 and didn't change it since then. This is not a pointer in C/C++ sense, just a copy by value.
In your code you have done like this,In this code, You defined  as , let it be stored in a location You made a tuple names  as . It will be stored in a location say You subtracted 50 from  making  50, this will make no change to  variable because it is stored in different location. But it will change the value of Hope this helps.!!
