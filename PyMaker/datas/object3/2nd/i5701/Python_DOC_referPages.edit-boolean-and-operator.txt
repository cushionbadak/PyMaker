So I've been messing around with the standard operators in classes to try and see what i can make, but i haven't been able to find how to edit the boolean  operator.I can edit the bitwise operator by defining , but not the way that  behaves. Does anyone know how I can change the behavior of  where  and are instances of the class I'm making?Thanks in advance!
In Python 2,  and  access :In Python 3,  has been renamed to .Note that short-circuit evaluation might suppress a call to  or .Another speciality to be aware of is that Python is trying to access  if  /  is not defined and treats the object as truthy if  returns a value other than . If both methods are defined,  /  wins.Is there any way i can have this return something other than a bool, like, say, a list of bools? Unfortunately, no. The documentation states that the method should return  or  but in fact you get a  if you let it return something else.
The  operator converts the first operands to boolean using , and then does a predefined action to the booleans (if  is , return second, else return first). There is no way to change this behavior.
