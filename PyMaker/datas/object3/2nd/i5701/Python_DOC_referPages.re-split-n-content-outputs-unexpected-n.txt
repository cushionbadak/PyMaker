Natural Text
Suppose such a following textThe result I'd like to achieve isMy first try is:Nevertheless, when I tried The output is out of my expect.I cannot understand it.In the example in 6.2. reâ€”Regular expression operations
This is quite obvious:  matches anything starting with a newline character followed by one or more characters of any class but  will not match control characters such as newline. So a match starts with the  and ends one character before the next . Therefore, your split's separators are all the visible characters and such a split will produce empty strings because those empty strings are in between the separators.Your input string starts and ends with a newline hence the first and last empty string after split with . Modify the pattern to to NOT match the leading and trailing newlines. This uses negative lookbehind and lookahead to exclude those first and last ones.https://regex101.com/r/A2vIbu/1
I think you might be a bit confused by the regex example from the text.  in a regex matches one or more non-word characters. So spaces, punctuation etc. are matched. Therefore  returns a list of words.For your example to work, you just need to remove the .e.g.Also, if you know that you're going to start and finish with , you can just slice the blanks off:
as mention by Garbage Collector, the problem with your first try is that your original text is surrounded by , so at the moment of the split you get an empty string as your first element to signal this fact, likewise for the end.to solve this, you first need to remove those, that can be easily accomplished with the .strip method:also for this task as described you don't need the  module, the str class come with a plethora of method to handle a variety of common cases, for this one the .splitlines method would do it too
Given:You can do (I formatted this to look like your desired example...):Same method works for  as well:Or, you can capture what you want vs splitting on what you don't want. In this case, use a look-behind to find the text after a :
