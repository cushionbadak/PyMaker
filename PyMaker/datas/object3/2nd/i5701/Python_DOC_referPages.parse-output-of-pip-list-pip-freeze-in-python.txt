The accepted answer doesn't work anymore with the latest version of pip (> 10.0)All those methods are now in private packages.For example the freeze module is in _internal/operations. You can still use it but personally I don't think it is a good idea to use internal packages. They might be moved or changed easily in a new version.What you can do is to keep using pip cli version, use the  option to have formatted output and parse this in python.
