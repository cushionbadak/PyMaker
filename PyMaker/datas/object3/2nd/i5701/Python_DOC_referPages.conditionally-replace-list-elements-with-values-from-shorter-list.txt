I am new to python and trying to simply replace the values of a list when they meet a condition with values from a shorter list.For example:The output I want is:I can use a loop with a counter:But this seems inefficient for something so simple, so I'm guessing there might be a way to do this with a list comprehension, something like:(although this fails due the lists being different lengths).Is there any other concise way of doing this in base python, perhaps using  or ?
You can use an iterator made from the short list and just call next on it in the comprehension:Note that you can provide a default value to next if there are not enough filler elements:
Try something like:Note this removes items from .
If you want to use , you could try this:Which outputs:Note: I used a stack/queue data structure,  to allow a   from the front, instead of using , which is . If you don't wish to use this library, you can just reverse  beforehand, and call , which is also . 
You can try this:Output:
