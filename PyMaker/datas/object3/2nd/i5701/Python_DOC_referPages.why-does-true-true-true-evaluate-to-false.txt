In Python,  is , and  should be . However, shouldn't the result of the evaluation then be , as well?
This is because the two checks are preformed independently.  is equivalent to , which evaluates to , as neither of the operands evaluates to  (in fact, it doesn't even evaluate the second  comparison, due to short-circuiting).The relevant documentation:Comparisons can be chained arbitrarily, e.g.,  is equivalent to , except that  is evaluated only once (but in both cases  is not evaluated at all when  is found to be false).
