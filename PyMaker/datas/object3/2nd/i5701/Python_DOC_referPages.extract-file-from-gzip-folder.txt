I am trying extract the XML file from the gzip that comes out of clicking the button "SEC Investment Adviser Report" at the website here (FYI, this links to the SEC website). Below is my (minimal) code. I continue to get "embedded null character" or "embedded null byte", depending on whether I feed   or  from my request. Can anyone help me get this file loaded so I can access the XML?
gzip.open takes a filename, not compressed data. You could use gzip.decompress.The archive from your question looks malformed. Specifically, it has HTML appended for some reason.The following works by only using the content before the beginning of the HTML:
