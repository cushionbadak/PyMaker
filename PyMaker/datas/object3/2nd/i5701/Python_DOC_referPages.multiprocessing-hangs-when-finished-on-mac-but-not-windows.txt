I have two dev environments... a Windows computer and a Mac for when on the road. The script runs fine on the Windows computer and will cycle through all of the pools. But on the Mac, it just hangs. It does work, however, when I manually set the process count to 1.This hangs...This works...The function the pool calls inserts data into a database and sure enough, the data goes is fine. So it's the "shutting down" of the pools that seems to be the issue.
Credit to Antti Haapala in the comments of the original question, but the spawn start method worked.
