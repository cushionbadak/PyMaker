I am generating a string and appending it to a list. I am looping that action to make a list of 40 elements. I want to print them like so:here's my listi tried thisand many other variations. i want it to print like thishow can i do this?thank you for your time
Printing 2 values on a list is as simple as creating a for loop that skips over every other value. When you create a for loop, you can use  to accomplish this. Then you can just fill in the two print statements using the for loopI hope that this will work for you:replace  with your list's name
Firstly, you shouldn't be using  as a variable name, as its already a built-in function. Secondly you can get every odd indexed item by slicing , and every even indexed item with [, which is show below:Then you can just  the lists together and print them: Which outputs:
this is pretty straightforward.  you write a for loop.  go through the list.  for every odd number--if line number mod 2 == 1; then, print a newline.  print("\n")unless there is something special about the list that you aren't telling us.
You have to write a loop and iterate the list.Since you have 40 elements it's easy
