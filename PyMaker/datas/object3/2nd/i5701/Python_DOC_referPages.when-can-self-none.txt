I am looking at a snippet  in an answer to another question which implements .This gets me wondering: apart from  returning  or the trivial local assignment , are there other situations, in which the conditional  is true?
According to Python's documentation on truth value testing:Any object can be tested for truth value, for use in an  or   condition or as operand of the Boolean operations below.By default, an object is considered true unless its class defines  either a  method that returns  or a  method  that returns zero, when called with the object.In the code you reference,  is the Python 2 equivalent of Python 3's .So, an alternative to the  method in your question could be something like:Note: None of this has anything much to do with the title of your question: "When can self == None". Equality (whether to  or to anything else) is a different concept from truth value, and is defined by the  method:
