In Python 3 I have a tuple: I want to split the tuple into two tuples. The tuples must be divided at the . The index of  is not static.Expected result: What's the most efficient way to split a tuple in two using a divider?I know tuples are immutable, but circumstances require me to be a little pragmatic. Edit:In my case, there will be 0 or 1 separator ().The data in the tuple will have a length of more than 1. 
As suggested in comments, you could use  to subdivide the tuple into "not a separator" and "separator" groups and then pick those groups that are not separators. This works for arbitrary numbers of segments, but can also be unpacked into two variables if you know to have exactly two groups.This could also be generalized to allow for different separators, using e.g. .Regarding comments: The time complexity of this should be O(n), just as when using , which also is the best you can expect if you don't know where to split and the tuple is not ordered in any way. Note, however, that  presents some overhead which makes this solution about 4-5 times slower than using  tuple slicing. It's still more versatile and easier applicable for unknown numbers of groups, though.
You can find the '|' using , and you can slice the tuple using slices.
