I need a program to divide a each PDF page in two (left,right). So I made this code, but for some reason it doesn't catch the image for the title. When trying with other books it didn't work either.where is the error ?I want to divide the PDF in two.
Consider the following minimal document (called ) that contains 6 pages, each exactly split in half by colour and number:The idea is to split these back into a 12-page document. Here's the code for LaTeX:It's not necessary to read in every page and establish its width (stored in ), but I wasn't sure whether your pages may have differing sizes.
As mentioned in the comment, I'm not quite sure, if I understand your problem correctly. Since I can execute your program and it includes only the left part of the initial document, I modified the code a bit.
