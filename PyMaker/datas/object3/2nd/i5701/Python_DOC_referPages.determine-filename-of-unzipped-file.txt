Say you unzip a file called  with , which yields an unzipped file saved to a known path. However, this unzipped file has a completely random name. How do you determine this completely random filename? Or is there some way to control what the name of the unzipped file is?I am trying to implement this in python.
By "random" I assume that you mean that the files are named arbitrarily.You can use  which unzips the file and returns its contents as a string of bytes. You can then write that string to a named file of your choice.This will write each file from the archive to a file named  in the current directory. The names of the files contained in the archive are obtained with . I've used  as a simple method of generating the file names, however, you could substitute that with whatever naming scheme you require.
If the filename is completely random you can first check for all filenames in a particular directory using os.listdir(). Now you know the filename and can do whatever you want with it :)See this topic for more information.
