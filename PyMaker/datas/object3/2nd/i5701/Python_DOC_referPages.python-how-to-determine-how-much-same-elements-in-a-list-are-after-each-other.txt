For our lecture, we need to create a program. Now we are at a point where we need help. LetÂ´s assume we have this following list:Now, every letter  ('W', 'B') has a specific value Just when there are two letters after each other, a player will get the points. Example: In the list above, player 'W' would not get any point, but Player 'B' would get 5 points. 2 Points since the second element and the third element are after each other, and 3 points since the fifth, the sixth and the seventh element are after each other.I hope it is clear what i am talking about :)So, how do i determine, how much elements after each other are of the same value? Thank you very much!
You can use  to iterate "groups" of equal elements in a list. Just determine the length of those groups and increase the scores accordingly:(Note: The solution is intentionally incomplete and using a slightly different input.)Update: Assignment seems to be over; added full code.
