Scikit-learn often uses  to parallelize with calls like .This helpful question and answer indicate that this double-parenthesis business means the second set is passed to whatever is returned by the call involving the first set, which makes a lot of sense if the thing returned is a callable.But here the thing returned by  should be a  object, right? And then we're passing it a  object given by the loop in the second parenthetical. You shouldn't be able to directly pass a generator to a class after construction like that. There should be some function call between the object and the input. Or in python is there  that works with this syntax?What is this syntax doing, exactly?
The "special function" is probably just a  method. An instance of a class with that method can be called just like a function. In this case, Parallel presumably defines  to accept a generator.(Note, that's not to say it's a good idea to write code like your example. It's needlessly confusing.)
