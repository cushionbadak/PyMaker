I am currently writing a speed camera check program that records the time taken for the driver to pass two sensors.I want to find the user's average speed by using speed = distance/timeWith a speed camera, the distance is known but the time isn't. Here's some of my code.This is to record the user's time.One of the outputs is    '0:00:00.451445 seconds'I have tried But it doesn't workIs there anyway to make this work?Thanks in advance
I'd use a dedicated precision timer for that:
The difference between start and end gives a timedelta object. You need to access the time difference using one of the class fields of the timedelta like this.
This should help:Dokumentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#module-datetime
