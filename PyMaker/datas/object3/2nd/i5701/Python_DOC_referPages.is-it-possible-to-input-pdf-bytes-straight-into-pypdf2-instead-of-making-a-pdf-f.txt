I am using Linux; printing raw to port 9100 returns a "bytes" type. I was wondering if it is possible to go from this straight into PyPDF2, rather than make a pdf file first and using method PdfFileReader?Thank you for your time.
 defines its first parameter as:stream â€“ A File object or an object that supports the standard read and seek methods similar to a File object. Could also be a string representing a path to a PDF file.So you can pass any data to it as long as it can be accessed as a file-like stream. A perfect candidate for that is . Write your received raw bytes to it, then seek back to , pass the object to  and you're done.
