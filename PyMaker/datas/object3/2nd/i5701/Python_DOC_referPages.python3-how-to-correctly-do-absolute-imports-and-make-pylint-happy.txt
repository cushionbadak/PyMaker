I am having a huge trouble trying to understand Python 3 imports (I'm using Python 3.5). This seems to be a million-dollar question and I know it has been answered everywhere. However I don't manage to really get a good understanding of how things are supposed to be done; answers on the Internet vary a lot. So sorry in advance if this is a nearly duplicate answer. I would really appreciate references to good reading material.So I have the following dummy project:If possible, I would like to:Be able to run my program as , having  as current working directory.Not modify the  at any time.Make pylint happy.Use correct Python3 imports. contains:And  is accordingly defined in With that configuration, I get:I can get around the error by importing like:But then 1) this is not a Python3 absolute import, right? 2) Pylint complains: The next thing I tried is to add a , and import like this:In this case pylint is happy but then I cannot run as: :Then the only way I can run it is from the parent directory as a module: .So my question is: is it possible at all to do the imports in a correct way, while still being able to execute it as ?Thanks a lot!
I would do something like:Assuming you have something like  in  and things like  in  (same for bar, you got the idea).In :But, it needs you to use it as a python and not a script (which is right, because that's what it is): Pylint seems happy about that.
