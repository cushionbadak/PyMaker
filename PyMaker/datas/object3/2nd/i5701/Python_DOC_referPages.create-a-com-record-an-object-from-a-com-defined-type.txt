I am just starting to play around with win32com.client module to try and write a Python program that uses a COM interface to control MicroStation, much in the way I used to control MicroStation from Excel.The problem I have is to create objects of a type defined in the COM library, a com_record, namely in my case a Point3d. The Point3d is basically a C structure of 3 double X,Y,Z.In Excel after referencing the MicrostationDGN library I had access to the Point3d datatype and could easily define new variables with How can I do the same in Python?Thanks,PS. I have tried creating a C struct but that gives me an error
You're looking for named tuple.Quoting (roughly) from the docs, you want:
I found this from the library author:where "RecordName" is the name of the record, and 'object' is &any*  COM  object defined in the same type library.https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2003-August/214888.htmlI could not find an object of that type to instantiate a com_record as described, but I managed to find a function that returns the object i need.
