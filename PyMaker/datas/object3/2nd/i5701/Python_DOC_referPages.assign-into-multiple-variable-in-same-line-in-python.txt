This question already has an answer here:Python Assignment Operator Precedence - (a, b) = a[b] = {}, 5                    1 answer                I am using Jupyter Notebook for Python and also using Numpy Lib.Here is what i have tried Output is :But I thought slice_arr would be  as i am getting first 5 element from arr and assigning  to all 5 elements and then assigning to slice_arrHow this statements would executed and How slice_arr value is ?Does  is assigned separately to arr[:5] and ?  If the assignment if from right to left then  should be Thanks in advance
Multiple assignments like this are not common, and not encouraged (without good reason):Assigning an immutable object like a number to several variables is fine:Assigning a mutable object like an array or list should be done with caution:The simple interpretation of [216] is that the same list is assigned to both variables.  While I haven't seen your expression before, it makes sense to me that  would be , the value on the RHS.The  is executed as , that is, a method call on .  Conceivably the interpreter could also execute  , but it would be simpler (and less ambiguous) if it is executed .  That is, assign the same thing to both objects, rather than chain the action.Another way to look at this, is that the replication of  is done within , or as part of the process of mutating .  It isn't replicated before the assignment.   operates within Python.  The Python interpreter parses the code, translating it into function and method calls.  Here's a list exampleThe documentation says the  assignments are done left to right.  I think this illustrates that: first gets the value , and then a slice (the last element) is replaced by the same list.A somewhat artificial array example of the left to right assignment: is assigned the value before being used in the  expression.  This only works because the assignments are executed left to right (after the RHS has been evaluated).From the  docs, the formal language expression is:https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#assignment-statementsassignment_stmt ::=  (target_list "=")+ (starred_expression | yield_expression)
https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#assignment-statementsAn assignment statement evaluates the expression list (remember that this can be a single expression or a comma-separated list, the latter yielding a tuple) and assigns the single resulting object to each of the target lists, from left to right.To get what you want, maybe do this:slice_arr = arr[:5] = np.zeros([5])+6
