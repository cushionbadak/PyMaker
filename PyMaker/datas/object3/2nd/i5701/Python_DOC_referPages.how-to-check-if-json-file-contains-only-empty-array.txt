I need to check if my JSON file contains data or only empty array. I am doing it in this way:But my JSON files can be really huge and I do not want to load them all.Can I check if file contains nothing but empty array in other way? Check if my file's weight is 2 bytes (isn't it lame?)?
You have to use  to find file size of a file.You do not have to read file at all.If JSON file is just 2 bytes, "[]" or "{}", it is an empty JSON object.Based on some JSON usage principles, in this particular case it is sane and safe to presume that a 2 bytes long JSON string is an empty string, array or object ("", [], {}). A two digits number may be a valid JSON string but it is not what JSON is used for (you can use JSON library to load a single value like you can use a big crane to lift an egg).If this [file size] does not fulfill your requirements you have to read the first 2 bytes and check if they are equal to '[]':
