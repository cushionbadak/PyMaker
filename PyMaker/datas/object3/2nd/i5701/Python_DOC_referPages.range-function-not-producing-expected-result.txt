I'm sorry if this question seems basic. I'm very new at this (this is my first semester with Python) and I just want to understand what I'm doing wrong. People have already called me "lazy" for not understanding the concept, but I don't, I have no one else to ask, and I just want to learn.I have a program:I walked through what it does, marked it up, and expected it to produce this result:PREDICTED OUTPUT: res = [ 12, 3, 5, -2, 1 ]Instead, when I did this in a Python interactive session:It produced this output:I got the  right, but where did the  part come from? I'm very lost and confused.Please help. If you don't want to answer because you think I'm being lazy, please just don't answer; I don't need to be told (again) how lazy I am for not understanding what I'm doing wrong.Thanks in advance.
The values you expect from the range function are a bit flawed. There are three possible ways you can use the range function:range(x): Generates an array with values from 0 ~ x-1. So range(4) = [0,1,2,3]range(x,y): Generates values from x ~ y-1. So range(1,4) = [1,2,3]range(x,y,z): Generating values from x~y-1 in steps of z. So range(1,10,2) = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]Walk through your code with these values of range and it will make sense to you.
