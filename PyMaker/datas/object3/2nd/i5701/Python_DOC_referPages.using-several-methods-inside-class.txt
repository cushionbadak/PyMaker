Currently if I input  it is calling . How do I get it to call another method with this input? If my input is  how do I tell the program to call the method ? It is currently calling . I tried to make a method "Matrix" inside the class "Matrix", but the program didn't change, it keeps using the  method.  
Python has no way of knowing that it's supposed to use your  method to print a Matrix instance. The way that special method names are handled is an internal language feature, you can't just add new special method names or change the way existing ones are handled without modifying the Python source and compiling your own version. And it's generally not a good idea to do that unless you really need to. ;)As I mentioned above,  should return a string that's suitable to display to the user, so it's probably not a good idea to return that sequence containing  and  via . I guess you could return it via , but that's still a little odd, IMHO. I strongly suggest that you give it a new name, like .Just for fun, I've implemented a relatively simple  method for you class. This special method gets called by the  built-in function and the  method. It also gets called by the new f-string syntax.My  method determines the minimum width required for each column of the matrix, you can supply a numeric format_spec to set a minimum width for all columns. An extra space is added to stop columns running together. You could enhance this method to handle an initial '>' or '<' in the format_spec to indicate alignment.output
you can just call the functionand it should workif you just print the object it automatically call the built in function str
