Why does  evaluate to  in Python, while both  and  evaluate to ? What operator precedence is used here?
This is due to the operators . The Pydoc explains it as :Comparisons can be chained arbitrarily, e.g., x < y <= z is equivalent  to x < y and y <= z, except that y is evaluated only once (but in both  cases z is not evaluated at all when x < y is found to be false).And if you look at the precedence of the  and  operators, you will notice that they have the same precedence and hence applicable to the chaining phenomenon.So basically what happens :
A chained expression like  where  are comparison operators is in contrast to C evaluated as (https://docs.python.org/2.3/ref/comparisons.html):Thus, your example is evaluated aswhich results to .
