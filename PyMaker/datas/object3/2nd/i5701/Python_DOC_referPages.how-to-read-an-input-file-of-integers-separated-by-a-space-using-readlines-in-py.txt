Natural Text
I need to read an input file (input.txt) which contains one line of integers (13 34 14 53 56 76) and then compute the sum of the squares of each number. This is my code:If each number is on its own line, it works fine. But, I can't figure out how to do it when all the numbers are on one line separated by a space. In that case, I receive the error: 
You can use  to get a string and then use  to split by whitespace.You'll need to convert each number from a  to an  first and then use the built in  function to calculate the sum.As an aside, you should use the  statement to open and close your file for you:Output:
You are trying to turn a string with spaces in it, into an integer.What you want to do is use the split method (here, it would be , that will return a list of strings, containing numbers, without any space this time. You will then iterate through this list, convert each element to an int as you are already trying to do.I believe you will find what to do next. :)Here is a short code example, with more pythonic methods to achieve what you are trying to do.
You could try splitting your items on space using the split() function.From the doc: For example,  returns .
Just keep it really simple, no need for anything complicated. Here is a commented step by step solution:Which outputs:
