I have a string url, it might starts with  or  or  etc.First I need to check if the string indeed starts with the header using  then I need to remove the header. For example, if input is  the function will check that the url starts with  and return . So how to write pythonic code for this task (don't really want to use a for loop)? Or should I just use regex?
Regex would be a bit of an overkill if that's all you want, just split your string on  and check if it starts with any of your approved protocols:This, however, doesn't guarantee the validity of your URI so if you think your string might contain an invalid URL you'll have to use something more complex.
According to the docs, you could pass  a  of strings to test for:Return  if string starts with the , otherwise return .  can also be a tuple of prefixes to look for.
