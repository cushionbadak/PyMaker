You may want to set your thread as daemon.A thread runs until it ends by itself or it is explicity killed.A daemon thread runs with the same conditions and if at least one other non-daemonic thread is running: this means that if you end your main thread and no other threads are running, all daemonic thread will end as well.if you're using threading module, you may set the thread as daemonic by changing his boolean:if you're using thread module, it should be one of the kwargs
