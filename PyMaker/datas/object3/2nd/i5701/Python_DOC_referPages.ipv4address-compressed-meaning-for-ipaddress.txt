When I read the ipaddress docs:https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv4Address.compressedWhen I read the , I find there is no explain for the .Who can tell me what is it mean ?From the source code, there is only  explain, I am not well understand the . 
 and  are properties defined by the base class , so every ip address instance has them. For IPv4 there is no difference between the two, as historically there was no need to have a shorter representation:The difference is with ipv6 addresses:Here leaving out groups of 0s is a big help for usability.Since all addresses have both properties you don't need to care what type an address object is. If only  objects had an  property it would be more cumbersome to use it when processing mixed address types.
I find there is no explain for the compressedIt's actually documented together with the exploded property:compressedexplodedThe string representation in dotted decimal notation. Leading zeroes are never included in the representation.As IPv4 does not define a shorthand notation for addresses with octets set to zero, these two attributes are always the same as   for IPv4 addresses. Exposing these attributes makes it  easier to write display code that can handle both IPv4 and IPv6  addresses.The property itself is defined in the base class for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses as follows:For an  object  would return a string in decimal-dot notation, e.g. .
