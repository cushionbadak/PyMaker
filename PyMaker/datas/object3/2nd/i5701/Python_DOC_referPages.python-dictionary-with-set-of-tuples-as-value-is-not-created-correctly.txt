I have read this but it does not seem to work for me -I was expecting also the first one to look like a tuple - why is that splitted?I want when doing :to have 2 items printed not three.
 takes the values from an iterable and adds each value separately. You passed in a tuple, which is an iterable with two values.If you wanted to add the tuple itself, you need to wrap that in an iterable, like a list:In Python 3, you can instead use a set display to create a new set:A set display takes elements separated by commas, and  is one tuple element here.In the other post, the set was created with a set display (so ) and the answers used either an  function or a generator expression to produce the sequence of tuples for the  function to process; a  both produce an iterable type.
You have got your answer but I will advice you to use defaultdict instead. All these type of cases like this set([("1111","test1")]) are properly handled. You don't have to worry about initialize too. Try This.And please note this, I have assumed all your values opposite your keys are sets.if this is not the case, go with the first one.
