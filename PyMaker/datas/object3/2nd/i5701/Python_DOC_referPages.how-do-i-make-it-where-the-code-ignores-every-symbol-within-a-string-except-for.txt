Natural Text
I was trying to make a program that could be used for one-time pad encryption by counting the number of characters and having a random number for each one. I started making a line that would let the program ignore spaces, but then I realized I would also need to ignore other symbols. I had looked at  How to count the number of letters in a string without the spaces? for the spaces, and it proved very helpful. However, the answers only show how to remove one symbol at a time. To do what I would like by using that answer, I would have to have a long line of  character's, and symbols that I may not even know of may still be copied in. Thus, I am asking for a way where it will only count all the alphabetic characters I write down in a list. Is this possible, and if so, how would it be done?My code:
Use Regex to find the number of letters in the input:
If your desired outcome is to clean a string so it only contains a desired subset of characters the following will work but, I'm not sure I totally understand what your question is so you will probably have to modify somewhat.
Filter the string:the count would be:
