I'm fairly new to web scraping, but I collected a large amount of data which I wrote to file using file.write() since I was unaware that json.dumps() existed. I'm attempting to remedy this by reformatting the data so that it can be loaded back into Python 3 as JSON.I need to be able to replace all of the single quotes (with double quotes) in a string without replacing any of the ones that come immediately after the backslash. For example: Would become:Any other advice on reformatting would also be greatly appreciated.
If you wrote the data to a file without actually encoding it as JSON, it was most likely "encoded" as the  of your object, which should be valid Python code for simple data types. You can parse it again with :

This can be done fairly easy using regex with the  module. If you can load the data into memory as a string then you can simply execute:What this does is it matches all single quotes not preceded by a backslash and replaces them with double quotes. You can find more of the gory details about how this works here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html
