The key corresponding to each item in the list is calculated once and then used for the entire sorting process. The default value of None means that list items are sorted directly without calculating a separate key value.Alternate solution using  based off of this answer that points out that  serializes attributes in the order they are set (unlike ):Note: This will remove any child (immediate descendant) of  that is not a .
