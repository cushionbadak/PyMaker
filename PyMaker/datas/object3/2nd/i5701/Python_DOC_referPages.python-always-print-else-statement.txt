Natural Text
I have code like this: And text file like this: If I use use only  statement it works "fine", but if I input nonexistent movie, then program just stop running, obvious.In case I use  and  it will always print  statement (except for first line in text file)Question is: How to print only finded and also movie and how to print message if movie is not found?
You could make use of python :the  will only be executed if the  loop was not broken. This way, you can add code afterwards that is run regardless of whether a movie was found or not (rather than immediately returning)
Use :
You must make sure to iterate over all movies () until you can decide if the movie was found or not. So: iterate over all movies, print the movie and return from the function if you find it. If you haven't found the movie after iterating over all them then ask the user to try again.I would suggest just printing "Nothing found" and then return instead of calling the function recursively though.
Every time you hit 'else', you restart the search by calling .  Unless your search matches on the first entry of , you'll be in an infinite loop of else-clause.Remove the else and do that block if the for loop completes without finding a match.
