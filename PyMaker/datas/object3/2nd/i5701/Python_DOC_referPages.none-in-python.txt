So, I have this pretty simple function (I'm a novice still).And it goes like:So my question is, when I notice that if there is no third variable, then it is accepted. So does "None" mean basically mean that it is ok to have no value attached to a variable if "variable=None."  Just confirming!  Thanks! 
So does "None" mean basically mean that it is ok to have no value attached to a variable if "variable=None." Just confirming! Thanks! No.  When you define a function like this: and  are "positional" arguments, and they are required, while  is a keyword argument.  Keyword arguments have default values that will be used if you don't provide one when you call the function.  Instead of None, you could just as easily have written:Or:Etc. In either case, you are setting a default value for  if it is not provided in the function call.Note that if you have multiple keyword arguments, like this:That you can provide them with values as positional arguments, in which case the arguments need to be in the matching order:But you can also specify keyword arguments in an arbitrary order by providing their name in the function call, like this:And you don't need to provide values if you are happy with the default:
Try this: is common to use here, but it's not intrinsic to default arguments.
I ought to take a look at the python tutorial. Especially Default Argument ValuesThis chapter explains how to define a function with default arguments.The next is about Keyword arguments: Functions can also be called using keyword arguments of the form kwarg=value.There are two kinds of argument:keyword argument: an argument preceded by an identifier (e.g. name=) in a function call or passed as a value in a dictionary preceded by **. For example, 3 and 5 are both keyword arguments in the following calls to complex():positional argument: an argument that is not a keyword argument. Positional arguments can appear at the beginning of an argument list and/or be passed as elements of an iterable preceded by *. For example, 3 and 5 are both positional arguments in the following calls:Arguments are assigned to the named local variables in a function body.
