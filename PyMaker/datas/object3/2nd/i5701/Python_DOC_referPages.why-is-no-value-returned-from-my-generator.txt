I've come across some surprising behavior with Python generators:Why is no value returned from the generator in the first two cases?
Because generator  statements don't return anything, they end the execution (python knows this is a generator because it contains at least one  statement). Instead of  do EDITafter raising this with the python core devs, they pointed me to the python docs where it says In a generator function, the return statement indicates that the generator is done and will cause StopIteration to be raised. The returned value (if any) is used as an argument to construct StopIteration and becomes the StopIteration.value attribute.So you can doif you really, really wanted.
 does not generate . use  and then
