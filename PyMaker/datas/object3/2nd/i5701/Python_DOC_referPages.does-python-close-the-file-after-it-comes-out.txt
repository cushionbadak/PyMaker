I tired two code examples , one with close and the other with out close, strace says both code has called .close()is it safe to understand python3.6 does an automatic close:Eg1: the lines in the file is :The corresponding strace o/p is Similarly  in the second file:The corresponding strace o/p is 
See this part of documentation Reading and writing files its fully answers your question, so "read the docs". I will provide a quote from there:If you’re not using the  keyword, then you should call   to close the file and immediately free up any system resources used by  it. If you don’t explicitly close a file, Python’s garbage collector  will eventually destroy the object and close the open file for you,  but the file may stay open for a while. Another risk is that different  Python implementations will do this clean-up at different times.Another part of the same section advocates to use  block, because in this case it is guaranteed to properly release the resources even if an exception is raised at some point (I think except ):It is good practice to use the  keyword when dealing with file  objects. The advantage is that the file is properly closed after its  suite finishes, even if an exception is raised at some point. Using  with is also much shorter than writing equivalent  blocks.Eventually to answer your question - yes it is safe to assume that Python does an automatic close, but it is not safe to implicitly rely on.
