I am learning Python3 and as I can see in the past, with Python2, it was possible to create a list of numbers with range() by just passing a single argument, which would be the  in the list:and the  and  values were defaulted to 0 and 1. But in Python3 for some reason, it is no longer possible to omit those 2 arguments and for the same result we would need to wrap the range() function with the list() function:Question(s):What is the reason behind that? Why was the functionality changed this way? Is there a good reason for that?P.S. or maybe I am doing something incorrectly. Here, I am talking about range() function in general, whether it is being used in for-loops, just to create a list or for any other purpose
You've unfortunately been misled by the repr of range:It is actually the same interface, but this is returning a lazily-generated sequence now, as opposed to a list.  You may iterate a range instance to consume the values:See Python range() and zip() object type for more details about this change.
