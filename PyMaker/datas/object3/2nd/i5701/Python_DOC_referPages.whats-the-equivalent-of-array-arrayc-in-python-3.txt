My old code with python 2 hasIn python 3, this chunk of code gives error E   ValueError: bad typecode (must be b, B, u, h, H, i, I, l, L, q, Q, f or d)What would be the equivalent in python 3? How to make the code work for both python 2 and 3?
Just check the manual: https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.htmlSo you'll probably need  (but we can't be sure - it depends on the rest of your code, I guess). This is also compatible with Python 2.x.
