I have 2 lists I want to iterate over them such that I get a final list (in the same order) I was trying to iterate over  and my logic was to divide by %2 to find whether it is odd or even, but it's not working.  
you mean this?
Use  and .Those elements are tuples if that reeeally matters then we can add a stage to map them to list.To explain it a little,  creates an infinite iterable of the values passed to it. So by itself that would go on forever yielding 'w1', 'w2', 'w1', 'w2' and so on. Then we can use zip, to combine it with  which has finite length and so allows the sequence to end.
You can try this:Output:Or, for a more generic solution:Output:
Try this:
output:Use my code:you don't need consider the length of W,D. it's more effieient and elengent
Why not just use the modulus itself?
You don't need to import any module , Here is recursive approach :output:
You could try this solution:Which obtains the index of each element in  and mods it. This is the most straightforward approach, with different variations shown in other answers. Another approach is to create an iterator with , and alternate between  and  consecutively with :The benefit of the second approach is that it uses Lazy evaluation. You also don't have to worry about any indices, just the lists themselves. 
 enough copies of  to cover  with , unpack into sublists
