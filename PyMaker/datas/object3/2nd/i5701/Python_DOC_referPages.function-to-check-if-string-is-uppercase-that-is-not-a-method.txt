I'm writing a program that checks if a given password has at least 1 upper case letter and 1 lower case letter. I could easily check that like this:But this code is repetitive. I want to only write the logic in checking the letters for a certain kind of letter once. My idea is to write a function that takes the  or  function as an argument. The problem though, is that the  and  methods exist as a method on the strings themselves. If I could only get a function that takes the string that I want to check as its argument, my problem would be solved. Is there such a thing? Feel free to post better solutions to my problem.
You can use , or you can use ; either can be used to call a method dynamically: calls the named method on anything you pass to it: objects also accept additional arguments to pass in, so  would call  on any object you pass to it.The  function is just a (much more compact) way of writing your  loop with  test and ; it loops through the iterable you pass in and stops the moment a  result is produced; if no  result is ever produced,  is returned. lets you access variable attributes; methods are just attributes you call:You can also pass in an unbound string method, so  or ; passing in a new string value is like binding the method to that string:So the following also works:
You can pass a lambda expression:Or, pass the desired string method to the function:Output:
A different approach to this problem would be to use a regular expression.  The following code will validate a password with the rules:Password must be between 8 and 16 characters Password must contain upper and lower case lettersPassword must contain a digitCode:Output:
