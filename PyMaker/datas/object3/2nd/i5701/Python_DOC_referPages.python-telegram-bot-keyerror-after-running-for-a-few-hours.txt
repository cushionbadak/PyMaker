Natural Text
I wrote a Telegram bot in Python, which is running on my Raspberry Pi (Raspbian). I eventually see an error after the bot has been running for a few hours.Before I post the complete code, could someone please help me understand the error? I would like to run the bot indefinitely, or at least for multiple days, before I need to restart it.The error is as follows:Edit:Following code is used:Might this code solve the problem?
Error says there is no  key inside  dict. Maybe it's some special telegram message that has no text or there is a bug in you code that delete  key in some cases. You could useTo get  when there is no text. OrTo get empty string (i.e. ) when there is no text.You could also check that there is a  inside  or not with  operator:If you want to your service to be always up you should add some mechanism for automatic restart. like in Python to restart after any error:I also suggest to log errors in a file or services such as Sentry to investigate why there is no text afterwards.
A  is raised when a value is requested from a  but the key does not exist in the dictionary.So, in your case, the  dictionary does not have the key .You should inspect your code to ensure that the  dictionary contains a value associated with the key . Or, if you expect that  will sometimes not contain the key , you should instead access the dictionary with the  method, which never raises a . See the docs for more information.
