I'm trying to write a unit test for a method that calls .  All I want to test is that  argument sent to  is as expected.  I don't actually want  to run.  Is this possible without mocking the  list?e.g.Then, to test.The issues I'm getting here is that, first the binary is called (which I don't want) and second,  is empty.
When using  you must point to the object where it is importedSee the documentation  and this article that explains it well.For example, in your case:code.pytest.py (Assuming both file are in the same folder, you need to patch  and not  in the test)
