I have class in which I want to implement list-like or dict-like behavior through a class variable.I want Property when it is called with some list methods, like append(), pop(), index() to work with self.data variable as list.Same here, I want it to work directly with self.data variable with dict-like methods.Is there a way to do so with something like ?
You want the UserList and UserDict classes from the collections module.  You can't get the behaviour you expect by inheriting directly from the builtin list and dict types because they're implemented in C (in CPython at least), so these classes were made for this purpose. You need to do some more work on your dict class but I think you can figure that out.It's also worth noting that you could use an OrderedDict for Node data, which gives you the ordering you want.
