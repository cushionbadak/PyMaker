I am trying to assign new values to an array based on whether or not the stored value is <3. Coming from an R background this is how I would do it, but this gives me a syntax error in Python. What am I doing wrong, and what is the Python approach?GOAL:
This is "too much R". A pythonic way would be to use functional filtering:Or just a simple for-loop with a few ifs:In general: don't try to guess the syntax. It's very simple, just read through some tutorials (e.g. https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#first-steps-towards-programming)Edit: the  conversion hack works as follows: you know you can convert bool to int, right?If  evaluates to True,  will be 1. So yor numbers now are converted to ones if  is smaller than  and to zeros otherwise. But apparently you want the values  instead of . Just apply the transform  and you're done!
Your desired syntax is pretty close to what you'd write in numpy.The heterogeneous list doesn't make it easy, but here's an example:
