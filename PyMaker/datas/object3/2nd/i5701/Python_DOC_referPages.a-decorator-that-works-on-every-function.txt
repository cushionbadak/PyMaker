I want to print Hello World on every function call and I'm using decorators to achieve this.  Assuming that this caused a function to error out, while an undecorated version of that function worked fine, what might be the problem with the decorator?  The issue isn't with print since I can remove that and the issue remains.Is there a better way to wrap a function and call it exactly the way it would have been called without the prototype?
A decorator must return a function.
