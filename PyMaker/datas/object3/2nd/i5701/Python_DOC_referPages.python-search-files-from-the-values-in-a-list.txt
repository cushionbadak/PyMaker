I'm very new to Python and I'm trying to solve the following problem. I want to iterate a List with words and lookup it in a file and if found return me the line number where the words are found.But it doesn't seem to work, it only searched the first value o the list. What I want to do is to search all the List values in every file.
I think your holdup is that iglob returns a generator. It is a one-use iterator that get's used during the first "for item in files" loop. You need to either replace iglob with glob (returns a list instead of a one-time use iterator), or re-invoke iglob for every loop.Read more about generators:https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators Understanding generators in Pythonhttp://intermediatepythonista.com/python-generatorsAnd glob documentations:https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.htmlHope this helps set you in the right direction!Edit (Note): The advantage of iglob over glob is that it doesn't work with the entire list in memory. If you have a really huge list (lots of items * size in memory per item), then iglob may be expected to have performance advantages over glob.
