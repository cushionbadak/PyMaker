Given the following simple example:(1) How can the main code / loop continue to work after an Exception has been thrown?  (2) And if we simultaneously run another thread, how can we catch the Exception in there?Edit: is it possible to do this without having a try/except block inside the loop?
Yes it is possible with try/except.Try making a function like so:And then call:For example (from the example):
Without using the try/catch it is not possible in python. When we call a function in python and it raises a exception, the exceptions is propagated to the caller function and it continues.    If you do not handle the the exception anywhere in the above chain, interpreter just throw it out to the user.
