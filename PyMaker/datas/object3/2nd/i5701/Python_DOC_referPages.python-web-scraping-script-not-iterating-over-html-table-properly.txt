I'm using BeautifulSoup to pull the elements of an HTML table into a python dict. The problem I'm having is, when I create the dict, the first record from the table is repeatedly loaded into the the dict. Printing the variable rows shows the expected number of different records returned in the response, but only the first record is printed when print(d) is called.
I think you meant to get the header cells from the first row of the table (once, before the loop) and iterate over the  elements instead of . You can also use a regular  instead of  and  to handle the loop increment variable more nicely:
Apart from what sir alecxe has already shown, you can do like this as well using selector. Just make sure the table index is accurate, as in first table or second table or another one you wanna parse.
