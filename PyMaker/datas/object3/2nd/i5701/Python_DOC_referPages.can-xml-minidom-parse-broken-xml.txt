Note:I can't use third party modules so bs4 and lxml are not an option.I need to parse HTML with the Python 3 std lib. I thought xml.minidom would be the way to go but it doesn't seem to be able to parse invalid XML/HTML without throwing an exception like syntax error.Am I missing something within the xml module that can do what I'm looking for?Am I missing something in the std lib?

if you need to handle broken html/xml, I recommend you to ckech Beautiful Soup 4
