I was reminding myself about the ''keyword'' and I stumbled across this article http://effbot.org/zone/python-with-statement.htm. I just had a small, likely obvious, question. The article states that this ''swallows any TypeError''I'm not quite seeing how that is the case? A quick explanation would be greatly appreciated?
If you return  from an  clause, it will stop any errors from going through. For example:will outputbut not raise anything because  returned .In the example case, if the error raised is a , the statement:Will return  and the  will be "swallowed".
