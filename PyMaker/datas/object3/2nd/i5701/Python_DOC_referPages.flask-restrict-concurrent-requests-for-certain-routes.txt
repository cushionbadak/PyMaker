I have a flask application and I want most requests to run concurrently. I set  and this seems to work for the most part. However, there's this one endpoint that runs dredd where I want to restrict it so that requests for that endpoint do not run concurrently. It appears to cause a socket error when more than one is run at the same time. Is there a way to do this?
I don't think it is possible to do per-route declaratively.You can, though, use a  or, better, a  to serialize actual processing of something you need processed serially. Request handlers will wait until they can acquire the lock. Be sure to pay a lot of attention to releasing the lock in various error scenarios as well as during normal execution.
