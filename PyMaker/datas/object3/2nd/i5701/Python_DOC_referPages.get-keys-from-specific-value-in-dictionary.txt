How can I get all keys which contain the specific value in dictionary?For Example:- This is dictionary which holds simple data.  If I enter a value of 4, prints all the keys which containing the number. This is the output.
Since your result is a set, I would use a set constructor.Since the value of your set depends on an iteration of your input data, I would pass a generator expression to the set constructor.
What about without loop ?Everyone is going to give you loop soution , let's try something different :data is:One line without loop:output:Best way is use a function :output:
