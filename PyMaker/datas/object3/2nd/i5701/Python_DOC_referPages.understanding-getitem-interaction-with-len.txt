I am having trouble understanding something in this code: I understand that customizing  will make all objects with type CustomeSequence will return a length of 5, and the index of something with length 5 will return , , , , , at least to my understanding. My question is, why does  look for ?The function prints this:
Straight from the docs:If the  method is not provided, the   built-in will fall back to using the sequence protocol (  and .
No,  does not "look for" . It's simply that in order to reverse a sequence you must know its last item, and for that you need the length of the sequence, or the  magic method.So, Python's  first finds the length of the sequence and retrieves its elements starting from the last one:(It's not Pythonic to call magic methods explicitly. These calls are here just to show their usage. In real code please use  and the index notation  instead).
