I have a simple three line script that converts a string to a datetime in Python. But when I run this code, I get an error saying:Can you please help me understand what am I doing wrong here? Thanks in advance.
You don't need to repeat  two times -  handles two-digit days by definition: - Day of the month as a zero-padded decimal number.
