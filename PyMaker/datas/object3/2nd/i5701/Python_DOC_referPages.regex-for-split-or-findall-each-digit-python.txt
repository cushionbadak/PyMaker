What is the best solution to split this  var into a continuous number listMy solution : 
The more flexible way would be to use  which is made to match consecutive groups in iterables:The  would be the single key that is being grouped on (in your case, the digit). And the  is an iterable of all the items in the group. Since the source iterable is a string, each item is a character, so in order to get back the fully combined group, we need to join the characters back together.You could also repeat the key for the length of the group to get this output:If you wanted to use regular expressions, you could make use of backreferences to find consecutive characters without having to specify them explicitly:For finding consecutive characters in a string, this is essentially the same that  will do. You can then filter out the combined match to get the desired result:
One solution without regex (that is not specific to digits) would be to use :
If you only need to extract consecutive identical digits, you may use a matching approach using  regex:See the Python demoHere,  - matches and captures into Group 1 any digit - a backreference to Group 1 matching the same value, 0+ repetitions.This solution can be customized to match any specific consecutive chars (instead of , you may use  - non-whitespace,  - word,  - a specific set, etc.). If you replace  with  and use  modifier, it will work as the  solutions posted above.
Use a capture group and backreference. matches whatever the  capture group matched. The list comprehension is needed because when the RE contains capture groups,  returns a list of the capture groups, not the whole match. So we need an extra group to get the whole match, and then need to extract that group from the result.
What about without importing any external module ?You can create your own logic in pure python without importing any module Here is recursive approach, output:
