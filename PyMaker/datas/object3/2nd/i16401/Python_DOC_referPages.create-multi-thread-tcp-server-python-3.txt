Hello I tried to make a simple server that accept multiple clients simultaneously I'm new to python and I have a difficult to understand it....I try to change my code in multi-thread applications but without positive result...here is the code:I know that there are many errors but I'm new in python sorry :(The original non-threaded code is:
Your basic design is close, but you've got a whole lot of little problems making it hard to move forward.First, you have a function name with a space in it, which isn't allowed. And you have an  because you didn't indent its contents.Next, inside that  function, you're using  wrong. doesn't exist; you probably meant . has to be a sequence (tuple, list, etc.) of values. You probably expected  to be a tuple of one value, but it's not; tuples are defined by commas, not parentheses, and what you have is just the value  with superfluous parentheses around it. You wanted  here.Also, calling  on a thread object just runs the thread's code in the current thread. You want to call , which will start a new thread and call the  method on that thread.Meanwhile, you're never actually calling this function anywhere, so of course it can't do anything. Think about where you want to call it. After creating the listener socket, you want to loop around , kicking off a new client thread for each accepted connection, right? So, you want to call it in a loop, either inside , or at the top level (in which case  has to ).And finally, your  function can't access local variables from some other function; if you want it to use a socket named , you have to pass it as a parameter.So:As a side note, be careful with using  and assuming you're going to get the whole message that the other side sent with . You might get that, or you might get half the message, or the whole message plus half of another message the client sent later. Sockets are just streams of bytes, like files, not streams of separate messages; you need some kind of protocol to separate messages.The simplest possible protocol is to send each message on its own line. Then you can just do  and , just like you would for a real file. Of course this doesn't work if your messages can have newlines, but you can, e.g., backslash-escape them on one side and unescape them on the other.
Here is some example code I have showing a threaded socket connection.
