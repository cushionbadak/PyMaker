This question already has an answer here:How do I write a regex to replace a word but keep its case in Python?                    3 answers                I'm looking to replace instances of a string in python but keep their original case.For example, say I was replacing the strings 'eggs' with 'bananas': -->  -->  -->  Right now, I do an re.compile and .sub but I can't figure out a smart way without explicitly declaring the three variants each time. I'm replacing about 100+ words so I imagine there has to be a smarter, more pythonic way.EDIT: THIS IS NOT A DUPLICATE OF A PREVIOUSLY ASKED QUESTION. --> Some differences: I'm replacing the word with an entirely different word, not wrapping it in  tags. Also, I need to keep the case even if its all caps, etc.. Please do not mark as duplicate without fully reading the question.
The key insight here is that you can pass a function to  to do all sorts of checks before determining the proper replacement for a given match. Also, use the  flag to get all the cases.Example:
