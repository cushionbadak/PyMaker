Natural Text
I've been trying to produce a program with an output:How I want it to work is for you to enter a few lines, and when nothing is submitted it will count the number of each line. Currently, I'm not able to count individual lines in a sentence, but only the whole sentence. My code:Which produces output:Rather than the first oneAny help would be appreciated. Thanks
The code is using each line as a dictionary key, not word. Split lines using  and iterate words.BTW, consider using  for this kind of task (counting occurrences).
