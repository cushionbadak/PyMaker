I have this code. Its not the entire code because its a Blender addon with many lines that are unrelated to sockets so I give here only the part that deals with the sockets which I kept isolated from the rest of the program. If you want to see the entire code, it can be found herehttp://pastebin.com/iqN7tr8EI am using telnet to test the socket with telnet 127.0.0.1 4000, telnet can send the data but never receives any. As you can see my socket is blocking inside its own thread so it does not block the entire programs execution. I assume that sendall tries to send everything and for some reason it cannot connect back to telnet for sending . Am I doing something wrong here ? 
Following line will raises error, because there's no  defined according to the given code.exception in above line will prevent the excution of next line ().To solve the problem, define the  as a list or remove the above line.UPDATE after seeing OP's comment: accepts byte string ( in Python 2.x,  in Python 3.x). In Python 3.x, you should use bytes literal as follow.
