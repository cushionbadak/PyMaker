Simply put, I have a dictionary () of namedTuples (records) on a server.Objective: I want to send the entire thing () or a single instance () to the client via a SOCKET connection so it can be printed (shown on screen).To send a single record I have tried to do the following:However this generates the following error:I have tried to encode it and convert it but nothing I do seems to work. I am even open to converting it to a STRING and sending the string but I can't seem to find out how to convert a namedTuple to a string either.And then, no clue where to start to send the entire dictionary to the client so they can print the entire set?Any help would be much appreciated.
Sockets can only send and receive bytes, so you need to serialise your named tuples and dictionary to something else.You could use JSON to produce a string representation of your tuples and dictionary, for example. The  library produces a (unicode) string when encoding, you'll need to encode that to UTF-8 (or similar) to produce bytes:This will not preserve the named tuple attribute names; the values are sent over as a JSON array instead (so an ordered list).Another option is to use the  module; this would require the listener on the other side to also be coded in Python and to have the same  named tuple type importable from the exact same location, however.When Pickle loads the data, the name of the full qualifying name of the  type is included, and you must be able to import that type on both ends of the socket. If you have a line in a module at the global level:then  is possible, but the exact same import should work on the other side too. produces a  object which can be written to the socket without encoding.
