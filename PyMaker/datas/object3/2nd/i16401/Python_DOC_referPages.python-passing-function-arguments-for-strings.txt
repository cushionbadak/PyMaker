I am practicing with "Think Python", Exercise 8.1 that: "Write a function that takes a string as an argument and displays the letters backward, one per line."I am able to do this question, by using banana as an example to print each letter per line.However, I would like to generalize the situation to any input words and I got the problem, my code isThe corresponding errors are:I think there should be problems concerned with the function arguments used. Any helps will be appreciated.
your program got error due to your accessing a global variable in your method and trying to change its valuethis give you error but if you give this produces correct resultin python we have  and  please go throught this In Python, variables that are only referenced inside a function are implicitly global. If a variable is assigned a new value anywhere  within the function’s body, it’s assumed to be a local. If a variable  is ever assigned a new value inside the function, the variable is  implicitly local, and you need to explicitly declare it as global.
This should probably work better:This works by indexing the string in reverse, a built in python function known as slicing.Reverse a string in Python
You need to assign a value to  before you use it.
