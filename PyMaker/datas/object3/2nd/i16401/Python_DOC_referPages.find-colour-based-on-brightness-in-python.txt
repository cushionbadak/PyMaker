Given a certain amount of brightness (from 0 to 255, for example) is there any algorithm in which one can derive an RGB colour from it?This would work where 0 is black, 255 is white and all the other colours are placed between them.
In Python there is the standard library module . What you want is the HSL colour coordinates; then your "brightness" is the luminance. The values used by the module are 0..1 for each component. [ Notice that whereas the standard order is HSL, in python it is HLS. ]Thus to get fully saturated red colour for different luminances, you can doResulting in Likewise to get colours at a single brightness for the whole spectrum, keep the luminance and saturation constant, and vary hue from 0 to 1.
