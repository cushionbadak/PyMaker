How do I write a batch script in windows that starts 2 python scripts and waits for both of them to return? and also terminates both of them if I terminate the batch script?Already asked this and got no answers...Also looked for solutions here, but the ones listed do not wait for a return from execution of the python scripts.EDIT: yes terminate it using ctrl+C
To make sure that the other scripts wait for your proccess to be complete, call it using  - this calls another batch or command line script:so would containwhich is how you can call your python program from a batch script.Finally, in Python, you can use this to check if a program is running (for you, that would be  or ) and if it is not there then the batch script has been terminated, so you can use  to exit Python.
