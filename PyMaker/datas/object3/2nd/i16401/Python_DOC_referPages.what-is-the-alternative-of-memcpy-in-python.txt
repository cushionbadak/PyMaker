I have a class object in python. I want to send that object values through TCP.I know if it is C++ I can send it like following..Thus the data will be sent to destination as bytes.now i have to do this in Python.what is the alternative part of these two lines.
It is not the equivalent of C , but if your requirement is to send an object through TCP and reconstruct if at the other side,  module is for you.Is is targetted as storing objects in sequential files or strings and retrieving them, including across different architectures.Edit : example from The Python Standard Library manual for Python 3.4 :For the simplest code, use the dump() and load() functions.The following example reads the resulting pickled data.
The  package can do this for you.You have to specify the maximum length of the string (here 10). Your C++ version doesn't work because the raw bytes of a string will contain a pointer rather than the characters inside the sting.
