I have read a file in python. The data content of the file is in string format. What I want to do is:go through the file content line by line and save the lines in an array (size = line no.)Then read line into an array.How should I do that using python? Any help will be appreciable. Thanks in advance.
All the other stuff people are doing—creating a list in advance just to replace it it, writing a comprehension that just explicitly yields exactly what you gave it, etc.—is unnecessary.A file object is an iterable of lines. The  function takes any iterable, and gives you a list with the same values. So, if you want a list of the lines, just pass the file object to the  function and you're done.
Use a list comprehension
Honestly I don't know what you mean with "Then read line into an array."
Pretty easily:Will give you a list of strings with each line in the appropriate index ( will give you the third line).
