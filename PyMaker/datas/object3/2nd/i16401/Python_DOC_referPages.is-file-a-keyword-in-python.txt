Is  a keyword in python?I've seen some code using the keyword  just fine, while others have suggested not to use it and my editor is color coding it as a keyword.
No,  is a builtin, not a keyword:It can be seen as an alias for , but it has been removed from Python 3, as the new  framework replaced it. Technically, it is the type of object returned by the  function.
