What would be an efficient algorithm to do the following:given a list, we have to output all combinations of elements up to a length n. Let's say x = ['a','b','c','d','e'] and n = 2. The output should be:
You could use  and iterate for increasing lengths:or, using a list comprehension:
Code:Output:Documentation:itertools.combinations()
Use :
Since you're looking for an algorithm and not a tool... this gives all possible unique combinations.
