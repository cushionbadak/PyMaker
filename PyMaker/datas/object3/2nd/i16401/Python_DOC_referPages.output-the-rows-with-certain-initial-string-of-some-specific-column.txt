The resulting expression in this case is .  matches the beginning of the string against the pattern (the match must start from the first character).However if you must only match the beginning of string against fixed phrases, then do note that  accepts a tuple, and this is the fastest code:Also it demonstrates the use of context managers for opening the file, opens the  before  so that if the former does not exist, the latter does not get created. And finally shows that this looks nicest without any generators and lambdas.
