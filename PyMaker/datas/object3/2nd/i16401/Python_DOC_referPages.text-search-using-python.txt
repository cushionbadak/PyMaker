Natural Text
I am working on a text search project, and using text blob to search for sentences from text.TextBlob pulls all the sentences with the keywords efficiently. However for effective research i also want to pull out one sentence before and one after which I am unable to figure. Below is the code I am using:
If you want to get the lines before and after the match, you can either create a loop and memorize the previous line, or use slices, like  on the  list.The best way might be to use the  bultin function.Here,  will extract the sublist spanning from index  (inclusive) to index  (exclusive), and  turns the elements in this list into strings.Note: Actually, you might want to replace  with ; otherwise  could be  and Python would interpret this as the last element, yielding an empty slice. If  is higher than the list's length, on the other hand, this will not be a problem.
