I'm trying to count hashtags from a json file of tweets. The goal of my program is to first extract hasthags and make a list, and then to create a dictionary of those hashtags (for which I wrote the "hashtags_dic" function) to count the number of times each hashtag is present. My problem is that right now the program returns the hashtags values but does not sum up the number of times each particular hashtag is present.I created a function named "hashtags_dic" that creates a dictionary, but it doesn't work. Here is the code:I'd appreciate any hints or ideas on what's wrong with my code. Thanks in advance... Norpa
There are several techniques for counting using dicts or dict subclasses (including dict.setdefault, collections.defaultdict, and collections.Counter).As you might guess from its name, collections.Counter() is ideally suited to the task of counting :-)FWIW, you're original hashtags_dict() function seems to work just fine:The hashtags_dict() function would do much less work if you substituted  for .  The former does a high-speed hashed dictionary lookup and the latter builds a keys list uses a slow linear search.
You can use  to easily count unique hashtag occurrences.  For example:
