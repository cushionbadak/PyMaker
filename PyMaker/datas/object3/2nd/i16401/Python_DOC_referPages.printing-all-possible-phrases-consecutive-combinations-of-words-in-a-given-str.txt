Natural Text
I'm trying to print phrases in a given text. I want to be able to print every phrase in the text, from 2 words up to the maximum number of words the length of the text will allow for. I have written a program below that prints all phrases up to 5 words in length, but I can't work out a more elegant way to get it print all possible phrases.My definition of phrase = Consecutive words in a string, regardless of meaning.The output for this is:I want to be able to print phrases such as  and  etc.Can anyone offer some advice please?
Simply Use output:
First, you need to figure out how to write all four of those lines the same way. Instead of concatenating the words and spaces manually, use the  method:If the comprehension inside the  method isn't clear, here's how to write it manually:Once you've done that, it's trivial to replace those four lines with a loop:You can simplify this in a couple of other ways independently.First,  can be done much more easily with a slice: .And I'm guessing  is already a list of strings, so you can get rid of the  calls.Also,  defaults to starting at , so you can leave that off.While we're at it, it would be a lot easier to think about your code if you used meaningful variable names, like  instead of .So:And now your loop is simple enough that you can turn it into a comprehension and the whole thing is a one-liner:One last thing: As @SoundDefense asked, are you sure you don't want "eating a rat"? It starts less than 5 words from the end, but it's a 3-word phrase in the text.If you do want that, just remove the  part.
I think the simplest approach is to iterate over all the possible  and  positions in the list of  and generate the phrases for the respective sub-lists of words:Output:
You need to have a systematic way of enumerating every possible phrase.One approach is to start with every word, and then generate all possible phrases that start with that word.
