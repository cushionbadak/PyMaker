Natural Text
I'm trying to replace backslashes or front slashes in a string with double backslashes. I've tried a couple of things but it doesn't seem to work.Â¨My work so far: This prints the string:But what i really want is a string that looks like this:So that when i print the string it will look like the original
Just convert that string to a raw string:
If what you are really getting at is path manipulation, I'd just use the  module.Normalize the case of a pathname. On  and , this returns the path unchanged; on case-insensitive filesystems, it converts the path to lowercase. On Windows, it also converts forward slashes to backward slashes. Raise a  if the type of path is not  or .
