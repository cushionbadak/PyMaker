I'm looking for a way to remove duplicate entries from a Python list but with a twist; The final list has to be case sensitive with a preference of uppercase words. For example, between  and  I only need to keep  and not . Unlike other common solutions which suggest using  first, I'd prefer to maintain the string's case here and in particular I'd prefer keeping the one with the uppercase letter over the one which is lowercase..Again, I am trying to turn this list:into this:How should I do that?Thanks in advance.
This does not preserve the order of , but it does produce a list of "unique" words with a preference for capitalized ones.If you wish to preserve the order as they appear in , then you could use a collections.OrderedDict:
Using  to track seen words:Usage:UPDATEPrevious version does not take care of preference of uppercase over lowercase. In the updated version I used the  as @TheSoundDefense did.
Since an uppercase letter is "smaller" than a lowercase letter in a comparison, I think you can do this:The  will have a preference for words with uppercase letters earlier on.
Some better answers here, but hopefully something simple, different and useful. This code satisfies the conditions of your test, sequential pairs of matching words, but would fail on anything more complicated; such as non-sequential pairs, non-pairs or non-strings. Anything more complicated and I'd take a different approach.
