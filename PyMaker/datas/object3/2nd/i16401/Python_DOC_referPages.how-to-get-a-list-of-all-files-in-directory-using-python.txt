I am using the python plugin  for notepad ++ and need to be able to get a printout of all the files in a directory.  Basically I need to run something like dir in command prompt. Is there any way to do this? 
You can use the  function to get a list of the files in a directory.
So, here's how to put all the files in a directory and in all its sub-directories in a list, print out the list.Note: How to 'walk' was found here:  concatenate the directory and file name
