When printing pages from a document, for example, you can specify the specific page numbers you want to print using this shorthand notation:And in a 12-page document this would print pagesHow can I represent such a structure in Python so that I can query whether a specific "page number" (this is not limited to printing; that was an example) is in the range and also loop over the range?These things would be easy if they were in a flattened list as in the second example (and string processing to convert it to that would be trivial), but the open-ended ranges pose a problem. It must not be flattened until the last minute.
I would use a generator:You can enforce a max page number when you iterate over it:Or do that separately:
If I understand your problem correctly, you could use a list of tuples.  means page number 1,  means pages 4, 5, 6 and 7. The tricky part is representing "from this page to the end". However, if you have the access to the number of pages, this can be solved by using . The flattening function would then look like this:
Pardon my noobish attempt using list of tuples as the pages
