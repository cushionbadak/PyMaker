In Mathematica, I can do thisthat returns square root of 20. I'm trying to hack python to do the same. Like this:How? Overriding operators in  class. But it's postfix. And according to this http://rgruet.free.fr/PQR26/PQR2.6.html#SpecialMethodsWhen I try to override any operator it's alwyas  so in mentioned case I would have to do it for classes like int,string and ton of other - bad.Is there a way around this? I would like to swap the order and redefine operator in   class. (edit for clarification:   is passed as argument to  class like this: self.__ operator __(...,other))

You can hack this into Python (see "Hacking Python without Hacking Python") or into IPython (see "Custom Input Transformations").To allow , you need  to be a low-precedence operator. But all of Python's low-precedence operators are either important (like ) or have meaning for ints (like ).(See Operator Precedence)Options:Hack it in as , which would look like a pipe. This would be an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) hack, and can possibly break an imported library that uses .Hack in a new operator (but don't use , because that's important). You need to hack this in at the string level, before the AST.For you, it might be enough to take advantage of Python's and IPython's various commands, and skip the bothersome hacking altogether.First, instead of using , you can use Python's power operator.Next, in Python/IPython, the underscore "" represents "the last result". You can type this:(IPython also allows  or  to mean "the result of the 14th input", and  and  to mean "second-to-last result" and "third-to-last result", respectively.)Finally, with IPython, you can use functions without parentheses or commas if the line begins with a slash.
