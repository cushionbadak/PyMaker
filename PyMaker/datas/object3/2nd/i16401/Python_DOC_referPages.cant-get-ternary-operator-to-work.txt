So I have a double problem. I have  list, which contains 2 elements - card rank and suit, in this format:  I want to change 'c' into graphical representation of club, but this expression not working. I tried searching a lot but couldn't find what's wrong. It says: Second problem, If I remove else statement, then it works, but it does not output what I want, it looks like this: , even thought print(club) outputs â™£.EDIT:  is the correct syntax, thanks to xtofl.
