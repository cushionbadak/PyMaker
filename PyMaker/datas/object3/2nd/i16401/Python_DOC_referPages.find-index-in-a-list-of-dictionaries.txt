If I know the key name, how can I find the list index when data is structured like this?For example, given the string , what is its index in the list above?My current code:I'm curious however if there is some slick technique that does not require an explicit loop.
You can use , , and a generator expression:Note that you can also replace  with any default value:Also, I would like to mention that doing:will not always work if the dictionaries have more than one item.  This is because a dictionary's keys are naturally unordered:In addition, there is no need to call the  method of a dictionary to search its keys because you have the  operator:This solution is also a lot more efficient because it avoids creating an unnecessary list.
