I am new to python and in general to programming. I am trying to combine 'while loop' with 'for loop'  to iterate through some list but i am getting infinite loops.  here is the codesimilarly with this code i got the same endless loop i want an output when the condition 'lo+ l[i] is greater than 40 stops looping and gives the final 'lo'output or result. I tried every method of indentation of the print line,but could not get what i wanted. please  comment on this code. thanks in advance.   
You get infinite loop because you wrote the infinite loop. You've probably thought that the  statement will somehow "magically" know that you don't want to end just the for loop, but also the while loop. But  will always break only one loop - the innermost one. So that means that your code actually does this:If you want to end both loops, you have to do it explicitly - for example,you can use a boolean variable:
Your break cancels the inner loopthis will work:
Try with this:
You don't need the external infinite loop and you don't have to manage the index yourself (see enumerate in the documentation).I changed the condition  to  for improved readability.
