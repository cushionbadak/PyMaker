I have these functions, and I'm getting errors, with the do_twice functions, but I'm having problems debugging itdebugger errors
The line  evaluates the expression in the brackets first before passing it. Since print_twice doesn't return anything,  is assumed, and that gets passed.
The problem is that the expression  is evaluated by calling  with  and getting the result that you returned,* and that result is what you're passing as the argument to .What you need to pass to  is a function that, when called, calls .You can build such a function manually:Or you can do the same thing inline:Or you can use the higher-order function  to do it for you:The documentation for  has a pretty nice explanation:The  is used for partial function application which “freezes” some portion of a function’s arguments and/or keywords resulting in a new object with a simplified signature. For example,  can be used to create a callable that behaves like the  function where the base argument defaults to two: [snip] * If you're thinking "But I didn't return anything, so where does that  come from?": Every function always returns a value in Python. If you don't tell it what to return, it returns .
Right now  is returning  which is what ends up being passed to  as a parameter. In other words, you are passing the result of the function call instead of the function call itself.Instead you want to wrap that function call in a lamda function like this:This will pass the actual function call as a parameter instead of calling the function and passing its result.
