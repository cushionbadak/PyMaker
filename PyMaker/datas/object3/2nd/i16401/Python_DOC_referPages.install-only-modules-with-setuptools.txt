I have some modules i want to deploy with setuptools.i wrote this short setup.py:but i get this Warning:The modules get correctly deployed but is there a clean way to do this? If the packages line is removed, no modules are copied.
If you have a Python package, you can specify it in the  parameter.As you describe it, though, you do not have Python packages; you have only modules.If you want to install Python modules that are not packages, you instead use the  parameter.
