When displaying results in IPython (without using ), nested objects gets an easy-to-view formatting. Is there a way to create/copy a function in Python with the same pretty formatting functionalities as IPython uses? I have been trying to look through their code for a possible module to import, but it seems like an impossible task. Would it be possible to write one yourself?IPython example:[EDIT] I know of the  module, but it does not do indentations the same way as IPython does (I don't want the indentation level of child elements to be dependent on their parent).What  outputs:
IPython uses its own formatter, , for output pretty-printing. If you want to use it, you'll either need to install IPython or copy the  source. With IPython installed, you can useIf you want to copy the source, it's available on Github. It looks like the only dependencies on the rest of IPython are trivial to remove. Take note of the license.
Try the pprint module. Usually simply using  and then using  instead of  can get you decent results; its output can be customized as well if you read over the module docs.
