I'm trying to split a string containing Swedish characters with re.split, but I can't get the code to work.The output is:EDIT: The third word is supposed to be "gå". The Swedish character "å" is missing.I'm on Mac OS X Mavericks, using Python 3.4 and "locale" in Terminal (Bash) outputs:I've found this thread on Ubuntu Forum, but I can't see why it's not working for me although the locale is correct. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1534940
Small Typo: use , not This will work:In Python:Output:Explanation matches chars that are not letters, digits or underscores, which is the opposite of what we want to match the wordsIn Python 2,  matches an ASCII letter, digit or underscore (unless, as @MartijnPieters points out, you use the  option)In Python 3,  matches a unicode letter, ideogram, digit or underscore, (unless, as @MartijnPieters points out, you use the  option) so the accented letters are unneeded ( is enough)
You are including  in the characters to split on. It appears you have misunderstood what the split does. will split the words on anything that matches the characters class; in your case that means anything  matches (anything that is not a letter, a number or ), and you added the characters  to that set.Omit those characters if you don't want them to be split on:In a Unicode regular expression, they are not part of the  character set to begin with.Demo:As  is the inverse of , you can also use  instead of , using the  pattern to extract the words rather than remove the non-word characters:with the added advantage that there now is no trailing empty string left.Again, when using a Unicode pattern, all letters are included, the character set is not limited to just the ASCII letter characters.
