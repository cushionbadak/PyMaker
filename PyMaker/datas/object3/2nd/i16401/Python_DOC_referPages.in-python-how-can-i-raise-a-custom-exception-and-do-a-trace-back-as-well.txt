This question already has an answer here:“Inner exception” (with traceback) in Python?                    9 answers                I am newbie to python . I know how to raise a **custom exception** in python with a message printed on to the stdout. But when I am dealing with multiple modules and long codes, while raising an exception with a message , can I trace back as well? what I meant as trace back is get the error line , or say the function and module name where the exception happened ?? I know that the message that I am giving out can be modified in such a way that I add more detail information. But I was wondering if there is any inbuilt way of doing this.
You don't have to "generate" a traceback, Python takes care of this when you raise an exception (custom or builtin).
This question is been already answered here:"Inner exception" (with traceback) in Python?Quoting the response there from Glenn Maynard:It's simple; pass the traceback as the third argument to raise.Always do this when catching one exception and re-raising another.
