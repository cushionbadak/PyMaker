Lets say we have a list I want to be able to remove all elements that are immediately preceded by an X and also remove the X's themselves. So the result should look like . What would be the pythonic way of doing this?I came up with something like the following, but I feel that it is very clunky and not clean. Is there a better way of doing this?
Using  and list comprehension:BTW, don't use  as a variable naem. It shadows builtin type/function .If you use Python 2.x,  will return a new list. If you don't want it use .In addition to that if you don't want to create temporary list (), you can use .
I would recommend processing the list backwards with list comprehension, like this
