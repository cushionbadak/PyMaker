I tried to look around but I couldn't find anything clear about this topic.Are built-in functions implemented in a module that is automatically imported every time Python is launched? In the case which is the module?Or are built-in functions just embedded functions inside the Python interpreter?
For CPython, the built-in functions are (for the most part) implemented in the  file.The exceptions are mostly the types; things like  and  and  have their own C files in the  directory of the C source; these are listed as a table in the  source.Technically speaking, this is treated as a separate module object by the implementation, but one that is automatically searched when the current global namespace does not contain a name. So when you use  in your code, and there is no  object in the global namespace, the built-ins module is also searched for that name.It is also exposed as the  module (or  in Python 3) so you can access the built-in names even if you shadowed any in your code. Like the  module, however, it is compiled into the Python binary, and is not available as a separate dynamically loaded file.
