I usually do for uncompressed csv files the following:for the case I want even compressed file I would do:though this would work, is there any more concise and efficient way of doing this? for example using an 'or' operator within .endswith()?

If your file names all end in '.csv' or '.csv.some_compressed_ext' you could use the following:
You can do this in one line as:Broken down:EDITFor an even more general solution:You could of course replace the code in  with whatever testing you wish to do on the file.  You could even use this approach to validate file contents too, i.e.
