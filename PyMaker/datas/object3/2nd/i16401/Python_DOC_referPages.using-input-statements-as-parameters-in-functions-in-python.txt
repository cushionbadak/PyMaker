I'm trying to use the results of some input statements as parameters in a function. I've tried putting the input statements before the function and then calling the function up afterwards, like this:but it just gives me the error . If I just put the input statements before the function, they'll prompt me for input, but they won't recognize that the input is supposed to be used as the function's parameters.Thanks very much for the help!EDIT: NEW CODE:This is currently the code I'm working with:It doesn't give me the UnboundLocalError anymore, but it also doesn't print anything after I give the parameters to the input statement prompts.
If you're running this on Python 3.x,  will not  the user's response like the Python 2 version does - it will return it as a string (it basically behaves like Python 2's ). Therefore your conditions  etc. will never be satisfied, leading to  being undefined.So you have to options:Either convert the user's response to an  and test against integers:or you accept the user's input as is, and test against string values:See the documentation on exception handling for the details of the  statement, and the docs on the  statement for details on the  clause. They're not strictly relevant to your problem here, but as @TheSoundDefense pointed out, the error handling of your code could be improved a bit, so there you go ;-)
The problem is that  is not guaranteed to be set by the end of . If  is 3, or anything besides 1 or 2, then there is no  statement that gets executed, so it's never assigned. Then when you get to , you get an error because you're trying to return a variable that was never assigned. At the very least, you should put an  statement in to make sure  is covered.
