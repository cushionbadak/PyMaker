I have a pkl file from MNIST dataset, which consists of handwritten digit images.I'd like to take a look at each of those digit images, so I need to unpack the pkl file, except I can't find out how.Is there a way to unpack/unzip pkl file?
GenerallyYour  file is, in fact, a serialized  file, which means it has been dumped using Python's  module.To un-pickle the data you can:For the MNIST data setNote  is only needed if the file is compressed:Where each set can be further divided (i.e. for the training set):Those would be the inputs (digits) and outputs (labels) of your sets.If you want to display the digits:The other alternative would be to look at the original data:http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/But that will be harder, as you'll need to create a program to read the binary data in those files. So I recommend you to use Python, and load the data with . As you've seen, it's very easy. ;-)
Handy one-linerWill print  for the pickled object.The generic problem of visualizing an object is of course undefined, so if  is not enough, you will need a custom script.
In case you want to work with the original MNIST files, here is how you can deserialize them. If you haven't downloaded the files yet, do that first by running the following in the terminal:Then save the following as  and run it.The script doesn't normalize the pixel values like in the pickled file. To do that, all you have to do is
