What does the  mean in Python 3.4's  output for  before the closing parenthesis?
It signifies the end of the positional only parameters, parameters you cannot use as keyword parameters. Such parameters can only be specified in the C API.It means the  argument to  can only be passed in by position (), not as a keyword argument (), something you can do with positional arguments in pure-python functions.Also see the Argument Clinic documentation:To mark all parameters as positional-only in Argument Clinic, add a  on a line by itself after the last parameter, indented the same as the parameter lines.and the (very recent addition to) the Python FAQ:A slash in the argument list of a function denotes that the parameters prior to it are positional-only. Positional-only parameters are the ones without an externally-usable name. Upon calling a function that accepts positional-only parameters, arguments are mapped to parameters based solely on their position.The syntax has also been defined for possible future inclusion in Python, see PEP 457 - Syntax For Positional-Only Parameters. This PEP has recently been revived and has been accepted for inclusion in Python. With Python 3.8 still in the alpha phase, it may become a reality in that version, or in 3.9, depending on how quickly the reference implementation can be finalised.Positional-only parameters can lead to cleaner and clearer APIs, make pure-Python implementations of otherwise C-only modules more consistent and easier to maintain, and because positional-only parameters require very little processing, they lead to faster Python code.
