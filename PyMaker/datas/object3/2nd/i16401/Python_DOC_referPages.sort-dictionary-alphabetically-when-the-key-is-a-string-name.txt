First, I know there are a LOT of posts on dictionary sorting but I couldn't find one that was exactly for my case - and I am just not understanding the sorted(...lambda) stuff - so here goes.Using Python 3.x I have a dictionary like this:So as an example my dictionary looks likeAnd right now for printing I do the following (where response is a dictionary):And when the user asks to print out the database of users I want it to print in alphabetical order based on the "name" which is used as the KEY.I got everything to work - but it isn't sorted - and before starting to sort it manually I thought maybe there was a built-in way to do it ...Thanks,
simple algorithm to sort dictonary keys in alphabetical order, First sort the keys using for each key name retreive the values from the dict
Just to reiterate @hughdbrown's comment in a separate answer, because I missed it at first and believe it to be the true answer to this question:You have a dictionary you want to sort alphabetically, say :sorted() will alphabetically sort the keys for you into a list, given that you convert all keys to lowercase (otherwise uppercase entries will be sorted first, then all lowercase):By calling the original dictionary again using that list of sorted keys you then can output it alphabetically:
