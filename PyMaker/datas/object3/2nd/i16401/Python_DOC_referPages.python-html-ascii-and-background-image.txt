I'm trying to create a python script that displays a  as a background for a web page and using a suitable font, print all of the printable characters in the ASCII character set. We can specify a font like Times New Roman, Palatino, Georgia, Lucida Grande, or Helvetica. The printable characters start have decimal numbers from 33–126 and 128–4000. and we do not need 127.I thought everything is right but this script isn't working. Pretty sure the background part I did in incorrect and I'm not sure if I'm using the the correct tags or if I'm missing some tags, but I think I did the ASCII part right.UPDATED: added this to the script because i needed to make the ascii display in a 12 row column and making it a certian font and font size but doesn't work again. pretty sure im doing this wrong as my professor didn't go deeply into it and didn't gave us very much examples.
First of all: add the  traceback manager to your script so that any errors are output to your browser still:Now, if your CGI setup is otherwise correct to at least run your script, you'll get error feedback in the browser.Your  assignment is not valid Python:You'll need to use string formatting here:The  result is a  value so it needs to be decoded to a  value first.Depending on how the CGI server handles the current working directory, it could be that the  file is not found. You can guard against that by using the script file location as a starting point to load files in the same directory:
