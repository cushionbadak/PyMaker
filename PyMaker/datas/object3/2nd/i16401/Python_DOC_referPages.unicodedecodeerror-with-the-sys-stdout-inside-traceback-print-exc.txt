I am getting  with the . I am using Python3.4 and did not get the problem with Python2.7. Am I missing something here? How can I make sure that  passes the correct encoded/decoded to the  ?My code looks something similar to this:Error log:
The traceback module wants to include source code lines with the traceback. Normally, a traceback consists only of pointers to source code, not the source code itself, as Python has been executing the compiled bytecode. In the bytecode are hints as to exactly what source code line the bytecode came from.To then show the sourcecode, the actual source is read from disk, using the  module. This also means that Python has to determine the encoding for those files too. The default encoding for a Python 3 source file is UTF-8, but you can set a PEP 263 comment to let Python know if you are deviating from that.Because source code is read after the code is already loaded and a traceback took place, it is possible that you changed the source code after starting the script, or there was a byte cache file (in a  subdirectory) that appeared to be fresh but was no longer matching your source files.Either way, when you started the script, Python was able to re-use a bytecache file or read the source code just fine and run your code. But when the traceback was being printed, at least one of the source code files was no longer decodable as UTF-8.If you can reliably reproduce the traceback (so start the Python script again without encoding problems but printing the traceback fails), it is most likely a stale bytecode file somewhere, one that could even hold pointers to a filename that now contains nothing but binary data, not plain source. If you know how to use the  module, add a  call before the  call and trace what filenames are being loaded from by the  module.Otherwise edit your  file and insert a  statement just before the  line in the  function.
