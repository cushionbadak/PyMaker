The  decorator seems to have changed behaviour between Python 3.3 and 3.4 but I could not find any documentation about that change.The issue is that the following leads to a test failure with Python 3.4.1 but does not with Python 2.7 or 3.3 (all on a debian system):Note that this is just a short example script demonstrating the issue. In the actual test suite I have I can't simply check for an exception but rely on expectedFailure to make certain tests pass under certain circumstances.
It was a regression bug #21112: Python 3.4 regression: unittest.expectedFailure no longer works on TestCase subclasses in Python 3.4.0 to 3.4.3, because unittest has been hard refactored in 3.4, fixed in 3.4.4 (v3.4.4rc1 by commit ed599b7)
