When I try to create thiswith the built-in  function... i.e.... I get this error:The dictionary with the curly brackets () -- whatever special name that is -- works, but I cannot fathom why the "newer version" (the  form) does not work. Is there something that I am missing, or do you just have to use the curly braces?For clarity:Each value in the dictionary is a function (and yes I did remove , and I also tried to do both  and  so that when I called it I didn't have to do  but could rather do )
Keyword arguments must be valid python identifiers. You cannot use  in valid identifiers (you are trying to subtract two identifiers instead).  is just a callable, and keyword arguments passed to it are no exception.Use the  literal dict syntax instead:because then you can use any valid immutable & hashable value as keys.Alternatively, use valid identifiers; replace  with , a character that is allowed in indentifiers:Any other alternatives get ugly real fast; you could use the dict literal syntax to produce a  double-splat keyword argument mapping:but that's not any more readable, is it.You can set those peskey non-identifier keys after the fact:but that's more ugly still.Note that dictionary displays (the official term for the syntax) are faster for the interpreter to process than are  calls, as fewer bytecode instructions are used to build one and no function call is involved.
