I have a dictionary created that looks like the following: I tried the following: But it showed the error: "". How can I access the individual items to print of Manipulate themIndividual items means: I want to check associative rules. So I want to access individual items such as 'Rule1' in an if condition and then check for the values in the next dictionary such as 1 or 2, and the list items.
I think you are overcomplicating this.Given this dict:You access individual elements using either a key (for a dict) or index (for a sequence) in one or more sets of brackets (paired brackets:  are AKA subscriptions or  operator):Dissecting the last one there:To print then:To access and compare for example:If you want to unpack the example, use nested loops:Since dicts are unordered, the items will not necessarily come out in a sorted in as-inserted order. You can sort the keys:You can also use json for pretty printing a nested dict:
 gives you the  pairs, and will not further unpack the contained dictionaries.You can only unpack the key and value, where the value is another dictionary object here. To get to the nested dictionary, iterate over that too, perhaps:
To answer your question, you could nest another loop within the original loop, like so:And so forth, down as many levels as you want. If you want to get fancy, you can get all recursive up in there but for two levels that will suffice.NB. Disregard the non-existent naming convention I'm using :P
