When defining a function within a class in python 3.x does it matter in which order you define functions ?Is class code pre-complied before you would call the class in main ? 
The order of class attributes does not matter except in specific cases (e.g. properties when using decorator notation for the accessors). The class object itself will be instantiated once the  block has exited.
By default, all names defined in the block of code right within the  statement become keys in a  (that's passed to the metaclass to actually instantiate the class when said block is all done).  In Python 3 you can change that (the metaclass can tell Python to use another mapping, such as an , if it needs to make definition order significant), but that's not the default.
