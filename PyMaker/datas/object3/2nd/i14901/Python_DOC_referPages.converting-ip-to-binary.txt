I am trying to convert 4 entered octets of an IP address into their binary form. This is only part of the code for converting the first octet into its 8 bit form. 'oc' is octet - I will fix variable names when I get this working.When I enter 128 or greater as the octet I get a successful output.E.g.: Entering '192' will display '1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0' but anything below 128 and the output is all zeros.I am sure, I could use a loop for most of this as well but do not know how.
Will this work for you?bin() converts an integer to binary, and using the [2:] appendage drops the leading '0b' you would otherwise get. If you want to ensure that you have 8 characters, with leading zeros, you can use zfill(). As another appendage, zfill(n) will add leading zeros until your string is n characters long.
Convert a IPv4 address to binary :Input :Output:
The solution given by @Tom seems most appropriate. But if you want to go to basic school mathematics of converting decimal to binary, one solution is this.
