How can I turn the result of this code into a list or a set?
You need to return something rather than print. You can build a list in the function:You can make that a set too, if you want, using  and .The other option is to turn the function into a generator; you'd have to do some iteration after calling the function:but you can also 'pull in' all the values into a list or set:
Check the divisibility till the square root of the value. If matches, add divisor and quotient to the factors list. Then create a set out of the list to remove repeated elements (which will only arise if x is a square of an integer). Finally return the list after sorting it so that the returned list is in ascending order.
