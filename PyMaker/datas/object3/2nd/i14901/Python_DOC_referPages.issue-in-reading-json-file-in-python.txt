Here is what I have in my JSON file and when I try to read it using  and  and json.loads it fails.After using json.load
You are using the wrong function. Use  (no !) to load data from an open file object:The  function expects you to pass in a string, not a file object. You'd have to read your file in that case, returning the read data:Next, you have invalid JSON in that file:JSON is not Python; those  prefixes are not supported nor needed. You'll need to remove those from the file before it'll load. If you have an API producing that format, it is not giving you JSON. It could be that it is producing a (strange form of) Python syntax instead; Python itself would produce  (single quotes). You can have Python interpret that as Python literals with :but it could be that the format is broken in other ways we cannot determine from a single isolated sample. It could be using  and  for boolean values, like in JSON, for example.Better to have the API fixed rather that try and work around this broken-ness.
You are using the  method. More documentation here. This method is used for string arguments only. Luckily, there is a similarly named  method documented here. This one can be used directly on a file object.
Your issue is that the JSON is not valid.It looks like it is a python dictionnary.  is a python 2 unicode string.If you remove the  from your strings, it works fine.Here is the json file:
