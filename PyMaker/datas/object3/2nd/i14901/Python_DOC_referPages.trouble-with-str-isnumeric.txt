Natural Text
Im trying to test whether a command line argument is a number or not by using the isnumeric string method. It is to my understanding that it returns True if all characters are numeric and false if otherwise however when running it I seem to be getting True regardless of whether it is a number or not.
You need to assign the result of  to a variable and check it's value:Besides, using  built-in package would make the command-line parameter parsing and validation a lot cleaner and readable (tutorial link).
