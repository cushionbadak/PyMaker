the code above returns:I am a begginer programmer and I want to know why the  function also modifies the x list instead of the intended y list? The code is run in python 3.4.2. How do I fix this so that only the y list will be modified?
it's because you copied the reference of  into .you can create a copy by . for example:
Simple - x and y are not , they are just references to list. there is some point in memory containing list data and both x and y just know where it is. So when you do  and change list referenced by y, this change will be reflected at .
You have to understand the difference between the variable and the what this variable contains. With this: X and y are exactly the same, you have to copy x and make the assignation you can do it this way: , this code copy the content of x and assign it to y
