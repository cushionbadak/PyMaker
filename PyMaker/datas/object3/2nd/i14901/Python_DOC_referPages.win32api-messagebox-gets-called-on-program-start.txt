I have a very simple Python program that I am using to get familiar with the win32api message calls.  I put a line in my program The problem is that the message box gets displayed as soon as the program starts.  And it does not get displayed when the button is clicked.  Any ideas what I am doing wrong?Here is the rest of my code:
