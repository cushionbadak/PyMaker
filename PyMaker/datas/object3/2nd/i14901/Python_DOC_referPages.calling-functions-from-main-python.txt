I have some python 3.4 code that works fine:I want to put all this code in a class (Except possibly ...) When I put all the code including ... in a class like so:I get the following error: .  When I remove the self argument from  it runs until  is called and then I get: .  I get the same error if I take the if statement out of the class and call .  I have some other code earlier in this program that works when I call functions of a class from another function in that same class.  I realize I don't have to put all my code in a class, but in this case I want to. Why am I getting these errors and what can I do to put my working code in a class? 
Since you wrap your code within a class, your  is a method now. You should remove your  from your class by unindenting it and initialize an instance of your class:
As others mentioned, by putting your functions in a class, you've made them methods, that means they need an instance of this class as first argument. So you can indeed call your  method using  as  will create an instance of .Another way (e.g. if you don't need the class for anything else than encapsulation) is to make them static, using the  decorator:In Python, a method can be static, i.e. no need for any special argument, a class method, i.e. first argument is the class itself, or a standard method, i.e. the first argument is an instance of the class.
It thinks the guard is a part of your class due to the indentation: you have your guard indented to the same level as the other class members. Unindent theAlso change it to beand then instantiate a new object of type Foo in your newly created main() function
