I have working code that takes a directory of csv files and hashes one column of each line, then aggregates all files together.  The issue is the output only displays the first hash value, not re-running the hash for each line.  Here is the code:
You are creating a hash of a fixed bytestring . That value has no relationship to your CSV data, even though it uses the same characters as are used in your row variable name.You need to pass in bytes from your actual row:I am assuming your  column is a string, so you'd need to encoding it first to get bytes. The UTF-8 encoding can handle all codepoints that could possibly be contained in a string.You also appear to be re-inventing the CSV reading and writing wheel; you probably should use the  module instead:
