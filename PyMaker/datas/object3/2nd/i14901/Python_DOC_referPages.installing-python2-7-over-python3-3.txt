I'm running Windows 7 and I currently have python 3.3 installed on my system. I need to install the python 2.7 interpreter so that I can work with some outdated code, and I don't want to uninstall Python 3.3. Does anyone know how to do this without reinstalling IDLE and duplicating the system files that python33 and python27 have in common? Thanks.
As both the python versions are installed in different folders, so you need not worry about it.You can use set "PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;C:\My_python_lib" command in windows to temporary change the default python version to use. While working on the projects requiring different python, you can use virtual environment approach. The following link will help you on this topic: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/This is widely used concept by python developers.
just install them in different folders.
When you install python 2.7 , it will be automatically be installed in a different folder just go into that folder and run python idle from there.
