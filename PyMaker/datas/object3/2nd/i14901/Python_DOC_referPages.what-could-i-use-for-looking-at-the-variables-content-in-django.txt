I'd like to have some information about set of functions (maybe analog of the var_dump() in PHP) which I could use for looking at the content of variables on a server side  in a way that they should be printed on server-side somehow during the work process, or on the client-side in the browser's console (chromelogger?).I was recently involved into a new project, I'm a newbie in Python/Django, so I need to get familiar with the internal logic and hit the ground running.I'm using extJS on front-end and Django 1.6 on backend.Thank you!
Just print them and they will appear at dev-server's console:Or, if  is a some kind of structure (dict or list), use the  module:
I think you are looking for an IDE.. Go for pycharm or eclipse + pydev.
If you are looking to print the variable structure use dir. If you want to print only the variable content use pretty print(pprint)
If you're trying to diagnose issues on a server or in a production-like environment (i.e., one where you can't just dump into an interactive debugger), might I suggest you use logging?https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/topics/logging/https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html (or https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html)You can even go so far as to have an SMTP log handler that will automagically email you log output for certain handlers.
