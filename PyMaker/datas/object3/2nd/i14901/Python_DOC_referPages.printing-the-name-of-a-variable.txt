I am a programmer new to python trying to write a simple test1() function that uses arg (or *arg)  to print out how it was called using the "name" of the argument passed to it, not the content of the list or any other variable that I am passing.  The following example:I want it to print out: name of arg is alphabetI researched and tried several things related to using *argv but did not succeed. Can someone shed some light on this?  I feel like I'm missing something obvious.Thanks!
This is more than a little ugly, but it's one way to achieve what you're after:The result of which is
I'm not quite sure, why you want this, anyway ...If you want the name of argument available in a function, you have to pass the name of the argument to the function. Python is call by reference in all cases.In your function,  will always be named  inside the function. Its outside variable name is not available inside the function.However python has variable keyword arguments and there lies a possible solution to your problem. Let me redefine :You can call this function with a keyword argument:Note, however, that what get's printed is not the variable name from outside the function, but the name of the keyword.
