Natural Text
I have two rows like belowWhat i want to do is to merge the seq start (column 3 of row 1) and seq end (column 4 of row 2) of two lines if they have the same ID(column 1). For example, the output would look likeI made a good start but cannot quite finish. Any help?
You're almost there.Instead of  being just the , make it the whole last line. This lets us check existance and id () and get the seq start and seq end ().
If your file is small you can use a temporary dict.
If you have a a header row in your file you can use a DictReader. For a file with headers for columns x, y, and z you can do:The csv module it is a part of is very helpful in general.
