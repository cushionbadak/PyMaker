In Python 3,  returns a string; strings are never equal to integers or floating point numbers:Convert the answer to an integer or float first before testing it against your calculated  integer:The  and  functions can do this conversion for you, but take into account that they'll raise a  exception if the input is not convertible.See Asking the user for input until they give a valid response if you want to handle incorrect input better, by catching that exception and re-prompting for an answer.If you are going to use , take into account that floating point values are approximations, and a user typing in  while your  expression actually produces  is likely to lead to issues:See What is the best way to compare floats for almost-equality in Python? for approaches to how to handle this.
 will return a string, but  is a numeric type, such as . You should convert  to a float and then compare -
