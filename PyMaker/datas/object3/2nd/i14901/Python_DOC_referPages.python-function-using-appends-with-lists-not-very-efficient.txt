Trying to write a function which takes input of 4 digit numbers and compares them, output of Ys and Ns to try and check if they are the same. EG 1234 and 1235 would output YYYN. At the minute it's very inefficient to keep using all these append commands. How could I simplify that?Furthermore, how can I validate this to just 4 digits for length and type IE. Nothing more or less than a length of four / only numerical input? I have been researching into the len function but don't know how I can apply this to validate the input itself?
For the validation, you can write a function that will ask repeatedly for a number until it gets one that has  4 and is all digits (using the  string method).The actual comparison can be done in one line using a list comprehension.
I think this should work.   
You don't need to convert the input to a string, the input() function automatically takes in the values as a string.Second, I added in input validation for firstn and secondn to check that they were numeric, and to check if they are the correct length (4).  Also, there is no need to change the input to a list, because you can search through the strings.I tried to do your function like this.  Basically, the function uses the length of the first string to iterate through all the values of each list, and return Y if they are the same and N if they are not.
Because you don't make it a global variable which can be used from out of the function. Here is an example:
