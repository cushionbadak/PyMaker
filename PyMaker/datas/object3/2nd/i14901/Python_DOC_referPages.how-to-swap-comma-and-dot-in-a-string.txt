I am fetching price from a site in format: 10.990,00 which does not make sense as such. What is needed to make it as 10,990.00. I tried following but it's replacing all.What am I doing wrong?
You are replacing the first dot with a comma, after first replacing the first comma with a dot. The dot the first  inserted is not exempt from being replaced by the second  call.Use the  method instead:This'll swap commas for dots and vice versa as it traverses the string, and won't make double replacements, and is very fast to boot.I made the code compatible with both Python 2 and 3, where  was replaced by a the static  function.The exception here is Python 2 ; it works the same as  in Python 3, but there is no  factory to create the mapping for you. You can use a dictionary for that:Demo:
The reason your code doesn't work is because you convert  to  and then you are replacing all dots with comma. Instead you can convert  to a symbol then convert  to  and the symbol to  :Or as suggested by georg Note that i removed the optional argument in , since numbers like  would not convert as expected.
@Martijn has given the best answer. you can also iterate over the  and .
May be this is a long answer but it is simple to execute and doesn't use any built in function:
