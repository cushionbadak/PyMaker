In a defined object some values are kept in a , and I want to iterate over the contents in that  as when referring to a plain , thus with directly access using , and loop using e.g. .  Code structure is: How to write the  and, other required methods, so this kind of access is possible through an instance of Klass?
You'll have to implement the ,  and  methods yourself; together with  they can all delegate the actual work to the  dictionary:I renamed the attribute to avoid masking the  method.The easiest way to delegate  to iteration over the dictionary (by key) is to use the  function to get an iterator for the dictionary object.To be explicit:  plays no role in how ,  and  are handled; the latter are just more methods.
