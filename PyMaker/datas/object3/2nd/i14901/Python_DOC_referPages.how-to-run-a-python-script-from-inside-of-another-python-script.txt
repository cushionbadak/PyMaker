I am currently using subprocess to run a Python script inside of my current Python but it is keep giving me an error:Above is what I am currently using.  is the path of the python that I want to run.Problem is, the python that I want to run can only take one file at a time.However this subprocess looks like it tries to execute ALL at ONCE.I want to run ONE at a time, instead of ALL at ONCE.Because it is running ALL at ONCE, my python that I want to run does not work the way it is.. What do I need to do to change this? 
If you want to wait first for the subprocess to terminate, before going ahead, I think you could use Popen.wait():
To actually do what you're asking, and not hack it together through subprocess, you can use  which allows you to run python code with your own provided globals and locals.In older versions of Python (meaning pre-3), you can use  to achieve the same thing.
