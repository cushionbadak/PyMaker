I would like to authenticate to  and get some contentI use  python module and do something like this:And, got the content, all right,But, now I want to use tornado framework to do the same workI get  in the similar way and make post request:And after arriving responseBut I get simply a login page What's wrong?
Tornado's AsyncHTTPClient doesn't have any concept of a session; each request is independent. It looks like requests.Session is transferring something from the login request to the vsearch request, probably cookies. You'll need to handle the Set-Cookie header from the login request and transfer the cookies to any following requests (perhaps using the http.cookiejar module)
