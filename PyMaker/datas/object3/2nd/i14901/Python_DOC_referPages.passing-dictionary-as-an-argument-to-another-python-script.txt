I want to pass a dictionary as an argument to a separate python script as shown below:Contents of mypython.py:Traceback details:Now when I convert the dict object to string using str, I hit another issue:It adds an extra space after : (before 11) and hence it fails. Only workaround is my input is a string:It works as expected in the above case.Can someone suggest me how to pass a dictionary as an argument to another script?
You could cast the dict to a string () and then parse it in the other class with this.
