I'm trying to write a python script (I'm a newbie) that will search the root directory of each connected drive on Windows for a key file and then return the drive letter it's on setting a variable as the drive letter.Currently I have:-- And then recurring for every drive letter A through Z. Naturally this will be a lot to type out and I'm just wondering if there's a workaround to keep my code tidy and as minimal as possible (or is this the only way?).Additionally, is there a way to have it print an error if the drive isn't found (IE say please plug in your USB) and then return to the start/loop? Something likeKind of like a GOTO command-prompt command?EDIT:For people with similar future inquiries, here's the solution:This script prompts the user to plug in a drive containing 'file.id' and when attached, prints the drive letter to console and allows the use of 'drive' as a variable.
Since you want to repeatedly check if the drive exists, you may want to move that as a separate function, like thisand then, if you want the program to repeatedly prompt the user to plugin the device, you might want to run it in a loop, like thisInitially, we ll try to get the drive with  and if it fails to find one, it will return an empty string. And we iterate till the returned value from  is an empty string and prompt the user to plugin the device and wait for the key press.Note: We use  to create the actual file system paths, instead of all the manual string concatenation.
Use a loop and generate the path names:
Python haves a simple solution to this. Use the pathlib module.
