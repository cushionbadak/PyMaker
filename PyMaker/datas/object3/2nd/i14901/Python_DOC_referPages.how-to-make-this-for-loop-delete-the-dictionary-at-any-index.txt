How would I make this code for the deleting of Player dictionarys in a PlayerID list remove a dictionary at any index?Whenever I have multiple dictionaries stored on this list, all with different ID's, it only seems to say that the ID associated with the first index exists, and the others prompt the error message as seen in the "else" statement
You are changing the list as you iterate, that is not a good idiomYou can use the else statement on for loop: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#break-and-continue-statements-and-else-clauses-on-loopsI asume your list is something like: Note that the else is only executed when the loop is finished normaly (without break)
