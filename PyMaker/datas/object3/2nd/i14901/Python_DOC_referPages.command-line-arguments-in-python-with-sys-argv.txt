Natural Text
I want to use  to access the arguments passed to the script. Here is my code :I understand that  and  refer to the arguments.My arguments are contained in a text file.What I cannot understand is how can I tell the code that it needs to read the arguments in that exact text file.I used  but it didn't work. Any ideas ?
If I understand you correctly you want what would normally be on the command line to be in that file, right?You can do that using command substitution , as seen here
Although not a direct answer to your question, I would highly recommend using the Python argparse module to parse command line argument. I your case I would add a "-c, --config" option that specifies the location of the config file that you want to use.
