My webapp wants to send a message to AWS SQS with boto and I'd want to mock out sending the actual message and just checking that calling send_message is called. However I do not understand how to use python mock to patch a function that a function being tested calls.How could I achieve mocking out boto con.send_message as in the pseudo-like code below?views.py:tests.py
To do this kind of test you need  . When this method is patched return a  object that you can use to test all your function behavior.Your test case can be something like this one:Just some notes:I wrote it in a white box style and check all calls of your view: you can do it more loose and omit some checks; use  if you want just check the call or use  as argument if you are not interested in some argument content. is not mandatory but very useful: take a look at autospeccing.I apologize if code contains some error... I cannot test it now but I hope the idea is clear enough.
