I'm working on a Reddit bot to learn TDD in python. I have a module with a class that is something like this:In my test suite I have a setup method like this:..and  a test like this:It seems like my patch is only partially working. It doesn't actually call the Reddit API which is good. The assertion is always false however. Ideally I could just mock the entire Reddit class and assert the methods are called with expected arguments later. How can I accomplish this? 
You are asking two different things:Why my assert doesn't workHow can I mock entire For 1 @wim answer is correct and tell to you exactly how to fix it: replace your test line by: mock's call already raise exceptions when assert fail.To take care of 2 you should patch  instead and take in account that your object will be the  of your mock. In this case I strongly recommend to use  to preserve  complete signature, take a look to Autospeccing to more details.In this case your test become:In this case you should take care of use  to check object method and  to check both static and class methods. Follow a simple example:
 is the assertion.  As long as that isn't firing, i.e. raising an  exception, then you're OK.  You needn't check its return value, which will always be .
