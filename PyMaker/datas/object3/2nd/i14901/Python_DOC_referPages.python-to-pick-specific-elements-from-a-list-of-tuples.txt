Hello all…I have a list of tuples (number of colors in an image. For example, there are 6320 (255, 255, 255) colors there etc.)What I want to have is get the number of certain colors, like “(159, 177, 205)” and “(223, 213, 196)”. 2 and 618 are their correspondences.How can I operate the tuples so I can pick them out (2 and 618)?Thanks.
Use simple List comprehension, with a filtering condition and unpacking the tuple, like thisBut, if the number of items to be filtered is very big, then you can convert this to a generator expression and get the elements only when you need, like thisOr, if you are just going to iterate the filtered data, you can simply iterate over the generator, like this
This can be done using simple list comprehension.Output:
Seems like you want to get only the tuple element which was at the the index 1 only if the corresponding  index 0 value is  or 
Why not use a dictionary instead of a list? Given your original list, let's call it tuples:you can succinctly convert it to a dictionary as follows:Then you can access the tuples for 618, for example, as follows:
Or you can use a dictionary: EDIT: Well, I have updated to solve your problem with dictionaries.
