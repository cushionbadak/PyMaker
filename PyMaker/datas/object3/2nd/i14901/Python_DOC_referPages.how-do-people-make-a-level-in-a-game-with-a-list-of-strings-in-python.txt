i would like to know because i am making games in pygame and would like to use this method because it looks neat and tidy.EXEHere the s's are empty space and the w's are blocks
If you use that method, you will need to define the dimensions of the level - LEVELWIDTH and LEVELHEIGHT, in this case 8 and 6, then you can find the block at x, y with this code:remembering that the indexes x and y both start at zero and end with the last item at the index length - 1 because of Python's method of indexing.Here is a different method I have used in situations like this:with this method all you need to do to find what block is at (x, y) is:but remember if you want to be able to edit the level, you need to create a new string for each row you edit, because you cant assign items to a string.E.g: To set the block at x, y with the string new:See https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#strings for more information on indexingthe method I have shown is based off of the examples in this bookhttp://inventwithpython.com/pygame/and a good example of levels in use in the book is in chapter 9 - Star Pusher
