Write and test a Python function leppard to go through the zoo_list and remove any item that is not also in zoo_dictionary. Use the following tuple as the dictionary:( "lion", "tiger", "bear", "chupacabra", "giraffe", "sloth" )    print(zoo_list)that's my code but when I enter "cat" "dog" "lion" "bear" "monkey" my list shows ["dog","lion","bear"]any reason why? please and thank you :)
in the first iteration of your second for loop when the value of i is 0,when you didthe element at index 0 in the list get removed. Now the list becomesNow the loop continues and in the second iteration of the loop, the value of i is 1, and in the new list(formed after first iteration) the element at index 1 is "lion". Thus you are missing the element "dog".And what you are saying a dictionary is actually a set, not dictionary.
As mentioned in one of the other answers, mutating a list you're trying to iterate over is a recipe for disaster.  Instead, build a new list and then assign that list to I've remove the unnecessary assignment to the  variable.  I've also removed your erroneous for loop and replaced it with a list comprehension.  If you wanted to use a for loop still, you'd do something like thisYou could also use the builtin function .  Replace the list comprehension or the for loop (whichever method you use) with the following.and you'll get the same result.
I think you should use a while loop here. Here's a the code for Python 2.
