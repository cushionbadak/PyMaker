How do I convert the output of  to a list of  (from a list of Unicode s)? It has to work even if the filename is invalid UTF-8, for example:So what do I need to write to the  above to make it work?Please note that it's not an option to rename the file, to use Python 2.x, or to use ASCII-only filenames in this case. I'm not looking for workarounds, I'm looking for the code in place of the s.
Use an error handler; in this case the  error handler looks appropriate:Value: Meaning: U+DC80U+DCFF'surrogateescape'` error handler is used when encoding the data. (See PEP 383 for more.)The  utility function uses the latter option; it encodes to  using the surrogate escape error handler when applicable for your OS:Encode filename to the filesystem encoding with  error handler, or  on Windows; return  unchanged.In reality it'll use  only when the filesystem encoding is , see the  module source, a codec only available on Windows.Demo:
There is also a corresponding  for conversion in the other direction.Docs here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.fsencode
If you just want the filenames from  in bytes, it has that option.  From the docs:path may be either of type  or of type . If path is of type , the filenames returned will also be of type ; in all other circumstances, they will be of type .
