Natural Text
I am trying to build a random word generator that randomly selects a consonant and vowel structure (e.g. 'cvvc' could be 'mean'). It is not working. The problem when I run it in the debugger is at the last two lines at the end of the while loop.
Your code is actually working, albeit only just. The length reflects how many consonants and vowels you produced, but the generated word can be longer as you include two-letter consonants like  and . However, there are improvements to be made. The  operator does not do what you think it does. It is a binary bitwise operator; it sets binary flags in integers:You want to use the  operator instead to do boolean logic AND testing:For booleans, using  happens to work as the boolean type overloads the operator to return booleans still.You can greatly simplify your program by using the  function, and move the termination test to the  loop condition. The  variable is redundant; you can just use  here:
