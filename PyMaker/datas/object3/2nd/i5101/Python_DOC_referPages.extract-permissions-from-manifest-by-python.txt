I want to print the "permissions" from a Android Manifest file. I have already reverse engineered the apk and got the Android Manifest file and want to extract the permissions by using Python.This is my Python Script by which I can parse the XML file. How can I find the permissions and print it. Can anyone help me with this?
XML parsing is a very common task and by writing a module to do that you are reinventing the wheel only to end up with a rough non-circular design.Python provides a much better designed, rounded wheel for that: . You can use this module to effortlessly parse XML files.This will print all the attributes of the  tag. Refer to the link above for more details.Note: For more details on the structure of the Manifest file, see the App Manifest page on Android Devs.
