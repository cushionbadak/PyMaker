There are a lot of python questions about how to import relative packages or by explicit location (linked to two popular examples). In addition there is always the documentationHaving read this, I am still not quite sure what specs are, how they are related to modules, and why one would need to tokenize it. So for someone who doesn't understand, could you please try to explain how one would do this (programmatically and what the means under the hood)e.g.if I havehow do I import mod2 into mod1?this technically works, but I fear that it may cause issues in the future if I try to pickle objects and use them elsewhere...The explicit location suggested so in this case I just do:??
First of all, let me clarify the differences between a Python module & a Python package so that both of us are on the same page. ‚úå A module is a single .py file (or files) that are imported under one import and used. ‚úîWhereas, a package is a collection of modules in directories that give a package hierarchy. A package contains a distinct  file. ‚úîTherefore, the correct version of your proj-dir would be something like this, ‚§µüîé Notice that I've also added an empty  into the proj-dir itself which makes it a package too.  üëç Now, if you want to import any python object from module2 of package2 into module1 of package1, then the import statement in the file module1.py would beI hope this simple explanation clarifies your doubts on Python imports' mechanism. üòä
