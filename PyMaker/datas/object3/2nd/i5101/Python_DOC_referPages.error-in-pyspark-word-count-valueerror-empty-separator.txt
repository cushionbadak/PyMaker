Natural Text
Here is the s84.txt which is on hdfs and I want to do wordcount on it:[paslechoix@gw03 ~]$ hdfs dfs -cat s84.txt   Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy  text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been  the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make  a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but  also the leap into electronic typesetting,remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with  the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and  more recently with desktop publishing software like AldusPageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. Error:ValueError: empty separatorWhat am I missing here? Thank you very much.
From the official docs:Return a list of the words in the string, using sep as the delimiter string. needs a separator. You are using  with argument as  which is an empty string.
