Natural Text
I have a path string "...\\JustStuff\\2017GrainHarvest_GQimagesTestStand\\..." that I am inserting into an existing text file in place of another string.  I compile a regex pattern and find bounding text to get the location to insert, and then use regex.sub to replace it.  I'm doing something like this...The inserted text is messed up though, with "\\20" being replaced with "\x8" and "\\"  replaced with "\" (single slash)i.e."...\\JustStuff\\2017GrainHarvest_GQimagesTestStand\\..." becomes"...\\JustStuff\x817GrainHarvest_GQimagesTestStand\..."What simple thing am I missing here to fix it?Update:to break this down even further to copy and paste to reproduce the issue...produces...
When you define the string that you want to insert, prefix it with an  to indicate that it is a raw string literal:
