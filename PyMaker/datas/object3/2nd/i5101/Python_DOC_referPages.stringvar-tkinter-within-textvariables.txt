Natural Text
I'm trying to create multiple inputs for the user but for some reason it doesn't get the variables and I can't seem to figure it out how to do this.The output of this script is:It should readable text because I'm trying to get the Name and Age of someone they manually enter these in the program.I know you usually have to do  but I've no clue on how to implement this with list or if I'm on the right track with setting this up.
You seem to understand why it outputs what it does, so I will not address that.To print each variable individually, you can do:To print them all in 1 list, you can do:This uses a list comprehension.
