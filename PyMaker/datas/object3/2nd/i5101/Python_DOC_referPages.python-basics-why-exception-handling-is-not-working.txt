Am new to python development and trying to understand exception handling.I have 2 functions 1st to find 1 occurrence of duplicate value in a list and 2nd to call the function.But if try to pass the name of list that does not exist it should print message from except block , but its not working , please help my command is likewhere I have not created the list : y , it should print the exception message in this case but its not , please help 
Here is an example. In the code below, in  there is a name  which is not an input, so it will raise  exception.The  will raise .The  will raise ..because  is catched first.Now, if you call  , which  is not defined yet, then it will raise the default . Because the error happens even before the code inside the function is processed. So the  is not even processed. I think this should explain why you get the default .If you want it to produce your  you can also (in addition) set the  outside the function scope.
Fundamentally, in any code you write,  blocks can only catch errors for the lines passed within them.  If you make an error in the function call (or code that in fact wraps the  block), the error is happening ahead of the test and so the error cannot be caught there.This is why in order to catch an error caused by an argument before it is  passed into a function (or by the syntax of the function call itself), as in , the error handling has to be moved outside that function as demonstrated by others on here with the code: Exception handling can only do so much.  At some point the programmer must proof their code and make sure it works.  On a related note, it is a good best practice to include a general exception statement in your  blocks to catch any unexpected errors you have not tested for yet or thought of yet.  The following modification to your code demonstrates this as well as showing how to get the computer to tell you exactly what error it caught:On a final note - to prove your exception handling is working, make the following edits to  and re-run it.Result:  code catches the name errorResult:  general exception is caught and error type identified for you
