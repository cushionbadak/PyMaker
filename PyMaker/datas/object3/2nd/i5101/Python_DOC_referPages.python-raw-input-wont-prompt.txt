The input wont prompt when I run the program. How do I fix this? 
The standard idiom is useful here:
You need to call your function.  As it is it is not executing anything but closing immediately.  In this case you can call your execute it with :When you create a function you create code that is never executed unless it is called.  This is useful when creating modules for example because it does not execute it immediately.It seems you are used to another language because unlike some (C++/C/Java) you do not need to use a function for structural purposes but rather to not call code or clarity.  Also Python automatically stops executing.  Unlike (once again C/C++) you do not need to return anything. In the case of:Rather than printing (which might be considered bad practice) you can return the string:Now to get it to print you can use You should also ensure to end in either a plain  or an  statement.  Ending with a  can return strange errors.If you still need those two loops you could add an  statement at the end and using the  function that does nothing: Once you move on to modules, you may want to execute code that  can be executed and is also a module.  This is where the other answer helps.This specifies if the name of the script (try running  in a script) is the main file (i.e. it's not getting called by another script) then only then will it execute by itself.  Otherwise if imported  will not run.
