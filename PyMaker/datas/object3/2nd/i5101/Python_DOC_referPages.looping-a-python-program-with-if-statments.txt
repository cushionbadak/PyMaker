I am writing a python program that will encrypt and decrypt a file. All the formulas in my code should work just fine but I'm having trouble with the actual loop. I want to present the user with the option to either encrypt, decrypt, or exit. Once they make their selection and go through the process I would like the program to automatically ask them the same question over again until they choose to exit the program. I appreciate any advice of what I could fix or may be doing wrong.Edit: To clarify, my code right now will continue to loop only what the user initially picks. It does not give them the option to pick encrypt or decrypt continuously until they exit.Below is the main function in charge of the loop:
If you choose the option in (e)ncrypt in your program, you enter a  loop whose exit condition is always true. In this loop, even if you enter a valid file name, the loop will go on. You could solve it by using a  statement once a valid file name got entered likeIn the (d)ecrypt part, if the user enters the name of a pre-existing file, an option to overwrite is provided. But if the user enters the name of a pre-existing file again, you may display the message alerting the user again. You can do this by placing it in a loop in which  statement is executed if user gives the go-ahead to overwrite the file likeYou could put the whole menu-driven part in a loop likeWhile you split the file name to its name and extension, useinstead of if  stores just the name of the file.If  is an absolute path or something you could doRead about  here.
Well it seems like you need to make a bit of modifications while user makes their choice. Here, I modified your code snippet a bit just take a look :The only change made here is that until user provides 'x' as input, while loop will not allow user to take any other actions.Let me know if it was helpful.
