What is the algorithmic difference between math.ceil() and round() when trailing decimal points are >= 0.5 in Python 3?For example,
From the docs,[...] if two multiples are equally close, rounding is done toward the even  choice (so, for example, both round(0.5) and round(-0.5) are 0, and  round(1.5) is 2).However,  will always "round" up. I.e. the smallest integer greater than or equal to the input.Moreover,  and  differ greatly when executing on negative numbers.
