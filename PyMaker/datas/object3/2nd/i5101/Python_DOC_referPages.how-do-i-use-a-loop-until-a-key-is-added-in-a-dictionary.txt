I am using Django as the framework. I am using boto3 to create an AWS account in my views function. Every created aws account will have an AccountId. Before going into further details,  here is my snippet :Initially I am creating the account. Like I mentioned before it takes some time (around 1 to 1.5 mins) to create the account. Then I need to GET the account details, one of the details being the AccountId. I tried increasing the sleep time to resolve this issue but that didn't help. I am getting an error when I try to GET the AccountId value in 'accid' declaration line. The error I am getting is:KeyError: AccountId doesn't existThis is probably happening because the account is not getting created yet and before that event my code is trying to fetch the AccountId value. How can I get the AccountId value then ? Should I try putting it in a loop or using try and except block to avoid the error message ? Please help. Thanks in advance. 
This will use the  of  to supply it (or an empty ) for  and a  for   and loop while it is .About  and the As pointed out by JonClements it might be more pythonic to use a  construct for this:This avoids duplication of the  line and makes for a more clearer flow. Using  fits better with the pythonic ask-forgiveness-not-permission approach.
In your  variable, you should have a key State that will tell you when the creation is completed.Here is the documentation, see in the Response Syntax
