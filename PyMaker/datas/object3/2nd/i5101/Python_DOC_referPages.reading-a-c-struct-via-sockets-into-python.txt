On an embedded device running a C application, I have defined this struct:On request, I send this struct via sockets: and read it from a Python script on my desktop:This is the data printed to console on my desktop:How can i reassemble the  into a ?Note that the embedded device uses little endian, so I have had to use  to reassemble an array of floats.
[Python]: struct â€” Interpret bytes as packed binary data contains all the needed intel.code.py:Notes:Starting from the point where the data () was received from the socketThe format passed to  (fmt arg) tells it how the data is organized: in our case it's : , ,  (preceded by the little endian marker)Also calculating the size (in bytes) of data that the format requires: it's 9 (4 + 4 + 1).  has 12 bytes, so ignoring the last 3, otherwise  will spit Check [SO]: Python struct.pack() behavior for more details on Output:
