I am trying to get detailed calendar information on all my birthdays to 2024(i.e. week #, day of week etc...). I noticed  as  function/method, but am trying to do it using / because I couldn't get "freq=" to work. This is what I have so far, and I think I can get what I need from  list, but am wondering if there is/was an easier way? Seems like a lot of extra work. TIA. 
Because it is possible to just replace the year in original birth_date, there is no need to switch between dates and strings. (Note that I have also PEP8'd the code and used slightly different variable names + added type hints)The output should be:To format output, please check datetime documentation. Hopefully this helps!
