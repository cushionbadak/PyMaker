Currently I have code which takes in a set of tuples each having the format (A,B). Over the course of the set, each A has a multiple B's which it is linked to. I want to create another set that contains tuples of the format (A, B1, B2, B3) where B1, B2, B3, etc. are values of B associated with A in the first set. Currently I have this code:How could I find the correct tuple in association to update. I plan on updating a tuple A by using A = A + (j[1]). 
I'll lean out of the window and claim that you're describing a XY problem.It looks like  is not the data structure you are looking for. If you have a list of tuples of the form  and want to group them by their first item, you could use a dictionary like this:If your input data was , the result will be .The above code can be cleared up a bit using tuple unpacking:
You can't change the value inside of a tuple, but what you can do is making it a list and making it a tuple after. Something like this:
