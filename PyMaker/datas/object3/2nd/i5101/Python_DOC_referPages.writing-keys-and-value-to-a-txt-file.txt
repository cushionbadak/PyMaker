Natural Text
I currently have made a program that takes words from a webpage counts them, then prints the results out with the word and how many times it shows upex) the, 4 hello,10 am, 12instead of printing the keys and value I want to be able to write them to a text file. currently this is what it looks likeas you can see at the end its printing the key and value but how to I write that to a txt file instead?
For example:Format the output in  part as you wish.
For counting the  specialized dict is the right tool, simply stuff your list in it and it counts it for you. If writing to files use the   - approach that autocloses the filehandle when you leave the scope. Combined:Counter has convenience functions to output f.e. the top 5 counted words:Output:  Doku: collections.Counterwriting filesOutput-File:
You can easily just add file output to your existing code by:1. Opening a file for writing2. Telling the print function to write to that fileThe  statement provides context management of the file object and is considered a best practice. If anything raises an exception within the scope of the  statement, the file will automatically be closed. The same is true when you exit the  block scope naturally (e.g. you've iterated across all items in the dict).
Another option would be to use the  module. It wouldn't result in the output format that you posted, but it has the benefit of being easily readable back into a dictionary.For instance:The contents of the file would be:But you can read this file back into a dictionary using :
