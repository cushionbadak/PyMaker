Given a pattern and a string , find if  follows the same pattern.Here follows means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in .Examples:,  should return true;  is ,  is  and the words form the  pattern.,  should return false; the string follows a  pattern instead.My solution works in Python 2:But I am just wondering why this solution  does not working in Python 3. There, the function will always return  when trying to test the above examples. Could anyone please give some advice?  
In Python 3,  returns an iterator object, not a list. Equality testing between these objects won't work (equality is testing for identity, the exact same object in memory, instead).Convert to lists explicitly:or use list comprehensions:or avoid creating lists altogether by comparing the zipped results with the  function:The latter short-circuits without having to make all comparisons if there is no match. In the spirit of keeping the functional style, I used  to test for equality with the  function. By using  we make sure that we can detect the case where the pattern length and word count don't match.
