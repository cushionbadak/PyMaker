I am giving a wrong input and I want an exception to be raised. Somehow this is not happening. This is my unit test code:and my code that I am testing:It shows the output that the exception is raised as below:Which is what it should do. But why doesnt it raise the exception?

Do you have a  destruction method? Seems to be failing there.
