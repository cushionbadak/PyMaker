I'm using Python 3.6 in Windows and using PyCharm. I have a .py file that is using packages installed on a venv which is in a different folder to the .py file.I'm trying to run this .py from command line and when I do it gives me a ModileNotFoundError. The file works fine from PyCharm just not from the command line because the packages are in the venv.How can I get the file to run without errors from command line and keep the packages in the venv?Many thanks
You need to activate the virtual environment by callling the activation script:as indicated here. Then you will automatically use all the packages installed in this environment when calling your script. Your pycharm is probably set up to automatically use your virtual evnironment
