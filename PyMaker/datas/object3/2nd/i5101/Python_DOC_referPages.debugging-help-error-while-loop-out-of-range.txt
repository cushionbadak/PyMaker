is my first post, sorry for the formatProblem:I have a error in the output, the data output is correct but, the loop is out of range and I don't know how to fix it.Code:Output:Content of .txt file:Expect: My Task:Add the weather for RioOpen the file in append plus mode ('a+')Write a new line for Rio de Janeiro "Rio de Janeiro,Brazil,30.0,18.0\n"Grab the column headingsuse .seek() to move the pointer to the beginning of the fileread the first line of text into a variable called: headingsconvert headings to a list using .split(',') which splits on each commaRead the remaining lines from the file using a while loopassign remaining lines to a city_temp variableconvert the city_temp to a list using .split(',') for each .readline() in the loopprint each city & the highest monthly average temperatureclose mean_tempsTips & Hints:•   print headings to determine indexes to use for the final output (what is in headings[0], [1], [2]..?)•   the city_temp data follows the order of the headings (city_temp[0] is described by headings[0])•   The output should look like: "month ave: highest high" for Beijing is 30.9 Celsius•   convert city_temp to lists with .split(',')
Try changing the while loop so you have an endpoint Like try adding a break statement after you reached the end of your file (using len to find how long it is)Or you can add a condition to your while statement to check if the file is at the end
