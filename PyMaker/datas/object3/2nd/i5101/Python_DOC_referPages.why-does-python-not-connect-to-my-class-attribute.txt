I am trying to make a game similar to a MMORPG but is single player. I am trying to put the Player class on one script, the MaelstromPlayer, and it's child class MaelstromMove to connect to it using another script because I am adding the MaelstromBattle and MaelstromInv classes soon.The problem is that I could not access, not to mention adjust, the MaelstromPlayer class attributes. I wonder what caused this problem and how to solve it, or even if this is possible.In case you were wondering, I got the method of "Distributing A Class Across Multiple Files" from this website https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2012-January/618880.html .This is my code for MaelstromPlayer, the file where I store the parent class.This is my code for MaelstromMove, where I store the child class of PlayerMove.The sys.path method is from here: http://www.daveoncode.com/2017/03/07/how-to-solve-python-modulenotfound-no-module-named-import-error/ .Please help, preferably with a code sample, thank you.
Your problem is that you never call the the  class (for your test at the bottom), just the  class. Also in the  class you override the  class'  method. To make sure the  is still called, do something like this:Some additional problems:don't use , it's inefficient, pointless and just bad practice.For creating your  do  isn't defined in python, perhaps you mean  but you'll automatically  if you don't return anything else.Your  loop will never end. Put a  clause in or something.Don't use  as the first method argument. Use  like you'll find in every python class example ever 12345.Finally, have you noticed that that entire thread from https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2012-January/618880.html is about how you should never do this?
