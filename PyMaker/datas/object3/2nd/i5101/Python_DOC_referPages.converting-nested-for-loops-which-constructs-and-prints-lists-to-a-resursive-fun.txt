I'm trying to convert the following nested for loops which constructs and prints a list into a recursive function as it would greatly improve the runtime of it.  However, I'm having difficulty with this.  How could I go about converting it with so many layers of nested loops?
As @mypetlion mentioned above, recursion in Python might not give you the performance boost you are looking for.What about using ? I haven't benchmarked it compared to your original but it does seem to be implemented in C.
If I understood well, this could be a combination with replacement function done with :
You can create default list in the function signature to store the elements you have currently accumulated, and once the length of the list equals the desired amount, yield the current list:
