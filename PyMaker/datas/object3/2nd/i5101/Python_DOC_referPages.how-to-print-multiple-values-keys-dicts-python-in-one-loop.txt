I'm trying to print two values, keys from two  different dictionaries  in one loop, to do some  adding*, but I could not able to do it correctly together in one loop, my code My file look like this with this code its count two word happen together (bigram) and unigram(2th  word) in different dict like this (the bigram car1 bmw happen two time and Bmw unigram happen 3 time in the whole carpus)  I manged to print them correctly separately, but could not print it together to do some calculation like this (the code run correctly but together give the wrong output) My question here how to print two keys and values at same time in same loop/sorted order to get this result
There's no "simple" way to do this.You need to apply the same logic as you apply while you're dividing bigrams.You need to iterate over dict2, for every key you'll see, split it, get unigram, get count from dict1. I.e.:Offtopic: you can simplify your code with defaultdict. Initialize  and  as  and you can skip  routine
As Slam mentioned using defauldict, it can be done in the following way. The output is In the file that you mentioned , car2 has both Benz and Kia. But in the output Car2 has only Benz. Is the data correct? Or am I missing something?
