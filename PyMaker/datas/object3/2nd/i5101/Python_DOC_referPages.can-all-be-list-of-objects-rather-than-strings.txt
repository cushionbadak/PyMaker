This question already has an answer here:Why should __all__ only contain string objects?                    2 answers                I found myself using the following pattern in the  files:The code like that works will all python versions that I have ever tried, but it seems that this is an accident. I have not seen it mentioned anywhere that  can be a list of objects (rather than strings), and also, this is reported as an error when running :Is there any reason why  should be list of strings? Or are objects ok too?
You will break  by doing this.  isn't used otherwise.
