TL;DR threading.Timer uses system time but the time changes while I'm using it, how can I get it to use system uptime?I have a Python script that does a bunch of stuff one of which is set the system time. When this script starts up the time is wrong. This script also needs to have a global timeout of 30 seconds.I have been using the following timeout class:Which wraps my entire script:occasionally the script fails really quickly or never gets killed after the 30 seconds. I believe this is because  uses the system time which gets changed while the script is running. Is there anyway I can get it to use system uptime?
It seem like your are using Python < 3.3. On Python 3.3 or newer,  will be an alias of  from the standard library.  was then also used for the -libary. As said in the docs:Return the value (in fractional seconds) of a monotonic clock, i.e. a clock that cannot go backwards. The clock is not affected by system clock updates.So, with Python >=3.3  will be independent.trying to solve your problem:WindowsI see an option to get your desired system-uptime using  from the  using :with this you could create your own timer with something unperformant as this:I realy hope this approach helps with your problem - good luckEDIT:Linuxbased on monotonic: you can try this as alternative to getTickCount1:1:  Copyright 2014, 2015, 2016 Ori Livneh   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");  you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

I ended up extending  to use system uptime.
