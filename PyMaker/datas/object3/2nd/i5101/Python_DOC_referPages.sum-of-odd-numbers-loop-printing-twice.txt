This is my python code, every time I run the program, it prints the number twice. (1 1 4 4 9 9 etc.) Just confused on why this happening - in intro to computer programming so any help is appreciated (dumbed down help)
My guess is the print statement is not indented inside the if statement properly. As the sum wont increase for an even number and every other number is even Make sure you have everything indented properly
My best bet would be to add M++ line after the scope of if statement.What really is happening that your increment only works when it is inside the if statement but this is logically incorrect because it should increment everytime loop executes.
Get rid of  you really do not need it. and replace it with .  By default  is a string  by default so  converts it to an integer.You are using a reserved keyword Try running .  You will see that  is actually an inbuilt function.  You should not create a variable the same name as an inbuilt function.  However you can use an underscore (described in pep8) and this will create a working variable.Corrected code:
