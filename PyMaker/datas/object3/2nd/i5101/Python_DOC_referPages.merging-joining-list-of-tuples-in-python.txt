I have 2 list of tuplesI want to merge these 2 lists in such a way that my output is :I found this piece of code when I execute this, it returns me the tuple whose first element is commonHow can I resolve this, so that I am able to get required solution
You can use  to group similar elements, based on the first value of the tuple. This will give you output like:Next we need to sum the second and third value of tuple inside grouped list to get the required output.Which will give you your required outputIf you prefer one-liners:
It sounds like you want to use the first value of each tuple as a key in which case changing tuple a to a dictionary might be more practical. I'm sure there's a better way but you could try this. Instead of try You can then check b (the list of tuples) against the keys in the dictionary. If no matches are found the new key and values are added to the dictionary. If a key matches then its values are added. Result is:
Check this out. It is working. You can change/tweak the code as you want. Hope the code is simple enough to understand.
