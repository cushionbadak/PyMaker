What is the difference between if / if any in a list comprehension?The code:gives me the expected result. However, if I use "if" instead of "if any", then the result is wrong. 
 is a generator expression.  will always see this as a  value is a function. It iterates over the generator expression and returns a boolThere is no "if any" it's "if [some expression]" the  is part of the expression
Think of it this way. The  method will return  the moment it meets the condition you are looking for as it iterates over the collection. In other words it 'short circuits' once it meets your condition. So, inside your  you are determining this  condition. Once you move outside of it, the  in the overall comprehension is simply checking for whether the  did in fact return . In the event it is  (aka the  passed the  check), you take the  in to the list you are crafting.
