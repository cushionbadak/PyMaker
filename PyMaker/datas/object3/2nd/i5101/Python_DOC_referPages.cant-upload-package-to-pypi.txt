I've been trying to upload a package to PyPi. I receive this error every time.I googled first and found that there was several issues for this on GitHub. I followed what everybody said was working and no dice.I made a ~/.pypirc file in the same directory as my setup.py file with the following contents like everybody saidI did fill in the password part but obviously I'm not going to share thatThen I ran    python setup.py sdist uploadin the correct dir and it returned thisI can't seem to figure out why its doing this. If anyone knows plz let me know. Thanks :)
Maybe double check that the .pypirc files is actually in the same directory as setup.py, since in your question you have called it '~/.pypirc'. The '~/' indicates that the file is in your home directory, which I assume is not where you want it to be.
