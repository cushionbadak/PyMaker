Natural Text
I am writing a data in a file using append method of file handling but it is not being shown in a file.Also while reading a file it shows a Null byte error.This is the code of writing.while reading I am using this programAny help would be appreciated.
Few things you can check:Variables v1, op_minute have correct values assigned to themCheck if you are able to read the current content of the file without appending anything (if the file already contains some data).There might be some issue with the delimiter.I tried to run your code and it works fine for me.
