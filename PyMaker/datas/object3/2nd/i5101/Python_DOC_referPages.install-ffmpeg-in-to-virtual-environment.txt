I have installed it using  but somehow when I compile my code I get the same error, it is like the package is not recognized by my  where I am working.Error on Python console:However, when I execute which  I got the following path .It seems like that Anaconda for example needs a specific command to install this package into its environment, it is the same for virtualenv?Thanks in advance.
This is not possible. FFmpeg is a separate application. If you need to use ffmpeg in python, you either need to  a wrapper for python (e.g. ffmpeg-python, ffmpy, etc). But those wrappers does not use the full power of FFmpeg. Instead what I suggest is to execute command line FFmpeg command in python using .Ref:Running cmd in python (ffmpeg)Using ffmpeg with Python 2.7
