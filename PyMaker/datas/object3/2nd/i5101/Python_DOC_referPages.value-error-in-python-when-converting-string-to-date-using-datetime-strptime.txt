I have a string variable named dte that prints in the following format: I'm trying to convert it to a date type so that I can work out how long ago it was in days, hours, minutes etc but keep getting the following error:I'm using this code:I've tried removing the colons but get the same error. I'm sure it's something very simple I'm overlooking but can't figure out what it is. Any help appreciated.
You need  for the hour component not :You have 24-hour hour component, not 12-hour which is what  is for, see the docs
