Am trying to get the top most rating using groupby of multiple columns and if there is no combination of that particular groupby, its throwing me an error . how to do multiple combinations ?data : code : input : output:     throws me an error as there is no such combination.Here if there is no such combination my function should limit to, married, male and young and not teacher as there is no such combination.
This is one non-pandas solution.  orders results by most common descending counts.
You can use  for dynamic input, (ordering of values cannot be changed)  with  for filtering:
 is definitely the goto library for handling detailed tabular data.  For those seeking a non- option, you can build your own mapping and reduction functions.  I use these terms to mean the following:mapping: reorganize data grouped by a desired queryreduction: an aggregation function, used to tally or condense many values to one analogous groupby/aggregation concepts.GivenCleaned data where multiple spaces have been replaced with a single delimiter, e.g. .CodeStep 1: Read dataOutputStep 2: Remap dataOutputStep 3: Reduce dataOutputDemoWith these tools in place, you can build a data pipeline and to query the data, feeding results from one function into another:Overall, you tailor your output based on how you define your reduction function.  Note, the code from this generalized process is more verbose than a former example despite its powerful application to many data columns.   succinctly encapsulates these concepts.  Although the learning curve may initially be more steep, it can greatly expedite data analysis.DetailsRead data - we parse each line of a cleaned file using , which maintains the header names as keys of a dictionary.  This structure facilitates easier column access by name.Remap data - we group data as a dictionary.  The keys are items in the selected/queried column, e.g. , .  The values are each a list of dictionaries.  Each dictionary represents a row of all remaining columnar data (excluding the key).Reduce data - we aggregate the values of the remapped data by tabulating related entries for all listed dictionaries.  Together the  and  combination build an excellent reducing data structure where new entries to the  initialize a  and repeated entries simply tally observations.ApplicationPipelines are optional.  Here we will build a single function that processes serial requests:
