So I have recently began programming in earnest with Automate the Boring the Stuff, and after reading the chapters on basic syntax decided to start working on a Blackjack game. However, I ran into a problem when dealing out the cards. I have the main deckand have a separate empty list called . I understand that I can use .append and random.choice to pick a card at random and add it to , but this doesn't remove the cards from .The only way I could think of would be to randomly generate a number between one and the amount of cards left in deck, set a variable to that number, set another variable to the card at that index, add that card to , and then finally delete the card at that index in . Is there a way to do it that doesn't involve 2 temporary variables?

Instead of randomly choosing an element, randomly choose an index. You can then remove the element at that index and append it to another  in one single line with :
