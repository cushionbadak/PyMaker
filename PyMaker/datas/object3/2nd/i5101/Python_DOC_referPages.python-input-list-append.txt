I want to make a list where Input() gets appended to RandomList, and the numbers gets to stay there for ever even if I close the file. I don't really know whether it can be done or not. Thank you.
So to make objects persistent, one module you could use would be the pickle module.One example would be:This would save the RandomList list object to a file. To then access it again, you can use:Bear in mind, opening the file in write-mode will overwrite the list, so if you want to ammend a list, ensure you open the file in read mode first, save the list to a variable and then open it again it write-mode and re-write it.I.e. Hopefully this helps. More information on the pickle module can be found here:https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html?highlight=pickle#module-pickle
