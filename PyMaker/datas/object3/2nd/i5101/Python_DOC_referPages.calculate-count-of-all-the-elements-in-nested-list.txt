I have list of lists and would like to create data frame with count of all unique elements. Here is my test data:I can do something like this using  with  loop as:But how can I have result of this loop summed up into new data frame ?Expected output as data frame:
Here is one way.For output as dataframe:
In terms of better performance, you should be either using: with  as:OR, yo should be using  with list comprehension (requires one less import of  with same performance) as:Keep reading for more alternative solutions and the performance comparison. (skip otherwise)Approach 1: Concatenate your sublists to create the single  and find the count using .Solution 1: Concatenate list using  and find the count using  as:Solution 2: Combine list using list comprehension as:Solution 3: Concatenate list using Approach 2: Calculate count of elements in each sublist using  and then  the  objects in the list.Solution 4: Count objects of each sublist using  and  as:Solution 5: Count objects of each sublist using list comprehension as:In all the solutions above,  will hold the value:Performance ComparisonBelow is the  comparison on Python 3 for the list of 1000 sublist and 100 elements in each sublist:Fastest using  (17.1 msec)Second on the list is using list comprehension to combine the list and then do the  (similar result as above but without the additional import of ) (18.36 msec)Third in terms of performance is using  on sublists within list comprehension : (162 msec)Fourth on the list is via using  with  (results are quite similar to the one using list comprehension above) (176 msec)Solution using  to concatenate the list is too slow (526 msec)
Here is another way to do it, using Convert it to dict like:To convert it to dataframe use
The function "set" keeps only the unique elements in a list. Thus, using "len(set(mylinst))", you get the number of unique elements in your list. Then, you only have to iterate over it.
