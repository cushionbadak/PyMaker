lets say i have something as follow: when I print c, I get I am using c as an iteration in a programme. Now lets say that while working on "2"  i get an error and I want to go back to 2 so as it does the followinghow to do that? I have inserted an "if" statement if an error occurs and a "continue" but it just skips to the next item. ThanksUsually I get a value error after the df line. Thats because the server of the website didnt have enough time to respond. Hence g_data is empty. 
The error is occurring on this line at the call to reshape(...):'results' can be an empty array right? Then np.array(results) gives you and you get an empty array. Then when you call reshape(20,7) with the result of np.array(results), it gives array because the result of np.array(results) does not have 20*7 = 140 elementsreshape(20,7) expects that the input (previous) array should also have 20*7 = 140 elements. But you may have an input array with 0 elements (according to lines preceding the df line).You may check the description of 'reshape' parameter on https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.reshape.htmlOne solution to what you want (Warning: if the server fails all the time for a certain page, you will get an infinite loop unless you want to limit the number of retries):
You can loop over each item using a  loop, ing on success and continuing to the next item:for i in items:
