If I make a deeply nested list, like this:thenwill work fine, butfails miserably with maximum recursion depth exceeded. (, and  too.)How could I get the string that print prints? And what is the underlying reason for the difference? 
Just to state (one of) the obvious :) (Clearly, we could add handling for more nested instances other than lists, as well.)Output:
You can increase the recursion limit. But this safeguard is there for a  reason. Are you sure this is what you want to do?
