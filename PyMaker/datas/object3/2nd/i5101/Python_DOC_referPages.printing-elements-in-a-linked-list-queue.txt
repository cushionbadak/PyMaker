I have the following code in python. My question is how do you print each element in the linked queue? I know that I will have to make a  or  function but I am unsure how to implement it. Thanks.
It depends on what you want the repr to look like, but here's one way. We give the  class a simple  that just returns the repr of the element, and to build the repr for a  instance we walk the linked list, storing the repr of each  into a list. We can then call  on that list to make the repr for the .outputI got rid of the getter & setter method in , since you don't use them, and we don't normally write getters & setters like that in Python. See the Descriptor HowTo Guide in the docs.FWIW, I would make  a separate class (or get rid of it entirely), rather than nesting it in . I guess it doesn't hurt to nest it, but nested class definitions aren't often used in Python.BTW, the  is a very efficient double-ended queue. For simple queues and stacks, it's generally faster than . But I guess this  class is for an exercise in implementing linked lists in Python, so  isn't currently relevant for you. ;)
