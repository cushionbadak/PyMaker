I have a dictionary of formexample:- I want to find only those elements of the  list such that it is a part of at least one another list say  list  and then for all keys store only those elements that satisfy the above condition.Is there any good way of doing it except using multiple loops? Example:-answer: 
You can achieve this in linear time (no nested loops) wrt to the overall number of list elements:The  holds counts of how many lists an element appears in for each unique list element while ignoring duplicates within single lists (via ). The nested comprehension then picks only elements with counts greater , therefore guaranteeing that they occur in more than one list.
Here are a couple of other methods, with benchmarking on a realistic data set. This answer assumes no duplicates within a list, and ordering of output (duplicate items for each key) does not matter.Benchmarking:
