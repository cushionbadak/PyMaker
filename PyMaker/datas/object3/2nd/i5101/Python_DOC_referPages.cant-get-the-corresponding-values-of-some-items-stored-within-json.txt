I've written a script in python to get different items from json response from a webpage. I've partially got success by collecting the name of different items. However, I wish to get the different price of it. When it comes to parse the corresponding values of each item, I've got stuck. Any help on this will be highly appreciated.site address: web_linkScript I've tried with:This is how the structure look like:Output I'm having (only):Output I intend to get:
Use this:Output:From the documentation:When looping through dictionaries, the key and corresponding value can be retrieved at the same time using the  method.
The problem I feel is that you need to understand that you are trying to print in the second loop. If you print in the first iteration, you can see the following result. Now you need to iterate through the second object, so you can use the following code. The second and third for loops are coming because of Python's assumption that dictionary by definition has arbitrary number of keys. You can continue to drill down as much as you want or follow the previous answer where you have got the exact result as you want.
