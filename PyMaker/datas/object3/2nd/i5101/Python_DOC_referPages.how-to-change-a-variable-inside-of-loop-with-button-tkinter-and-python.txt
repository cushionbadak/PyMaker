I am trying to make object tracking example with user interface. I need a few buttons for changing the way of code. But the code below does not working as I expected. The boolean variables must change because I can see the button fuctions forking when I press buttons but it does't effect the loop that works continiously. If there is someone knows what am I missing could you tell me? Thanks for your help.
When you assign  within your class, you're assigning it locally within the class as opposed to the global attribute as you expected.  See this documentation for more details.To update the global attribute, you have to first declare it is a global variable before assignment:However, I would argue it's not a good practice to have an instance method handle global attributes.A better approach would be having the  as an instance attribute instead so you reference it within the scope of  as , that way you have more control and avoid messy namespace handling.  You can also define it as a class attribute instead of instance attribute, but that would give you a similar headache so personally I wouldn't do that.
