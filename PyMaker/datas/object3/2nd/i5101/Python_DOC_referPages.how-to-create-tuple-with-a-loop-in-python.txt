I want to create this tuple:I tried with thisHowever it creates a tuple inside other tuple in each iteration.Thank you
Use an extra comma in your tuples, and just join:Edit: Adapting juanpa.arrivillaga's comment, if you want to stick with a loop, this is the right solution:
You can declare it without having to use a loop.
 can also be used here: If you want the final result to be in a tuple of tuples instead of a list of tuples, you can wrap  again:
A tuple is an immutable list. It means once you create a tuple, it cannot be modified.[Read more about tuples and other sequential data types here.][1]So, if you really need to change a tuple during run time:Convert the tuple into a listMake the necessary changes to the listConvert the list back to a tupleORCreate a listModify the listConvert the list into a tupleSo, in your case:  
A little experimentation got this working. I guess you need a comma after the tuple in a to convince python it is a tuple.
