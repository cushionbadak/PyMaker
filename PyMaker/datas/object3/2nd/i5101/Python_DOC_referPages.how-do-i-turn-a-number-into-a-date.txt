I have a dataset with the dates given in numbers from 1995 to 2016. 1/1/1995 is equal to 1, 2/1/1995 is 2 and 31/12/2016 is 8036, so every day is one number.How do I turn my time array [1,2,3,...,8034,8035,8036] into dates of dd/mm/yyyy?
Use the  method. This creates a date from the number x, signifying the number of days since 0001-01-01.If you want to start with  being 1995-01-01, you can dowhere  is the number of days since the last day of 1994.
Use the epoch conversion which is also supported by the python time library. The unix epoch time starts on 01/01/1970 and is counted in seconds. If you add 788932800 seconds to reach 01/01/1995, you can then add 86400 (seconds per day) and can use standard techniques to calculated the "seconds from epoch" back to a correct date. Example code:
does this help for first 100 days? You can change the no though.
