I am trying to use  to parse command line arguments. Here is my code:When the script is executed like this,  complains about unrecognized arguments.But when the script is executed like this,  is satisfied.How should I change my code so '=' can be used in the argument list?
According to the argparse documentation, passing  in the  argument meansAll command-line arguments present are gathered into a list.When you invoke your program without the equal sign, all three IP addresses are considered part of the  argument; they will be available to your program in a list.When you invoke your program with the equal sign, only the first IP address is considered part of the  argument.  then tries to parse the second and third IP addresses. But it cannot because your program does not take any positional arguments. So  raises an exception.
