Hello so I am making a python socket server and client and I am trying to figure out how I can make it so when the server sends a message to the client using arguments(I am not good with explaining myself) but basically my issue is thisServer Console:Clients Response:I am sending 32 bytes of data(I think) to 127.0.0.1 and it wont workThis is my clients code:I seriously cannot figure out what I am doing wrong
You are reading from msg, not sys.argv.
the server sends the entire message in the form of a continuous string byte, not in discreet form of array. in order to get the ip address and the data size, you have to parse the msg string byte.
