I have a list of URLs. (We can assume that a given URL is met in the list no more than once.)I need a fast way to determine which of two URLs is before in the list.I think, I should create the dict from URL to its position in the list.What is the easy way (without writing a  loop with manual increasing of the counter) to map elements of a list into their positions in the list?The best thing I conceived is:Now to check if  is before , I check .Can this code be shortened?
This creates your Example:Your version:My version:Output:Better don't use for your variable name because it is a built-in.enumerate provides an iterate that gives you the index and the value for each iteration through your list.
If you want to know which comes first for a specific pair of items, you can use the  method on the list:
List of URLs:List of indices:Create the dict:Test:Demo
