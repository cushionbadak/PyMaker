The title is kind of misleading, but I can't really describe it in one line.I have a list that looks like this.The list was already sorted by the first term of the tuple, using this code.(I am just saying that the list is already sorted, so there's no need to sort)Assume that the first term of the tuple is the score of a Poker player, and second term is the name of each Poker player. So, the list above is the same as this:[ ( score = 4, player 2 ), ( score = 4, player 3 ), (score = 2, player 1 ), (score = 1, player 0), (score = 1, player = 4) ]There are 5 players, and the score of each players could be the same, or different. I want to evaluate the players based on their score, and want to print result in case of ties (when . So,Player 2 and 3 had the same score (score = 4)  and they tied. Also, Player 0 and 4 ties, but since their score ( score = 1) was lower than that of Player 2 and 3, they were printed below player 2 and 3.How can I do this in Python?
