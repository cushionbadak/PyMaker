I have a subclass of  and I want to terminate it correctly.I want to close  (which is an SQLAlchemy Session) when the process is terminated. But as the Python documentation says "exit handlers and finally clauses, etc., will not be executed". How can I correctly terminate a process and close the things it uses?
I found a nice solution, by using . I added an  object to the constructor of my  class, and the process loop looks like that now:Instead of calling  when I need to terminate my processes, I just call , which will break the loop and close everything gracefully.
