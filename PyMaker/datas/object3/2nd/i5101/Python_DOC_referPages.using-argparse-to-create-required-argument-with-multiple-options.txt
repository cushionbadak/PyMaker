If I understand Argparse correctly, the positional arguments are the required arguments that the user can specify. I need to create a positional argument with argparse where the user can specify a certain type of argument that is displayed if he/she brings up the -h option. I've tried using add_argument_group but it simply only displays a header with a description of the other arguments when you bring up the -h option. So when I run the script, I should specify   in order to run the script. If I choose either .txt, .n12, or .csv as my  argument, then the script should run. However, if the I  don't specify the file type from those 3 options listed, then the script wouldn't run. Is there an argparse function that I'm missing that can specify multiple options for a positional argument?
I think you're making this too complicated.  If I understand your problem correctly, you want the user to enter two arguments: a directory name and a file type.  You application will accept only three values for file type.  How about simply doing this:... and adding application logic to reject invalid values for file type. You access the user-entered values through the object returned by parse_args().
Use the  parameter to force the user to choose from a restricted set of values.
Use option grouping feature use  instead of
