I am trying to code code that downloads a PDF from a URL. I found a method of doing this, but it was not written in Python 3 and used the  function.I tried replacing this with  in the line .However I get this error:TypeError: expected str, bytes or os.PathLike object, not HTTPResponse.I cant find a solution online. Any help would be appreciated. Here is the code:Resources used http://zempirians.com/ebooks/Ryan%20Mitchell-Web%20Scraping%20with%20Python_%20Collecting%20Data%20from%20the%20Modern%20Web-O'Reilly%20Media%20(2015).pdf(page 101)Extracting text from a PDF file using PDFMiner in python?

Rather than struggle with an obsolescent version of , I'd advise using  which is a more recent fork of the  library that's compatible with Python 3.You'll have to edit some of the  statements, but for the most part, the newer fork is a drop-in replacement. So, now, after reading the body of the HTTP response (as per Adrian Tam's advice), you've got a PDF object. You can then call your conversion method with that object as a parameter:
Do this (you need to get bytes from a HTTP response object):See https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html#httpresponse-objectsBut then you have to modify your  function to take raw data as input instead of file object, i.e., instead ofYou have to do: helps you to convert a byte data into file-like byte streams (https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#binary-i-o) so you can afterwards pretend that as a file.I didn't play with the PDF library before, but you may start in this direction.
