I am building a web scraper that stores data retrieved from four different websites into a tuple array. I later iterate through the tuple and save the entire lot as both CSV and Excel.Are tuple arrays or arrays in general, limited to the processor's RAM/disc-space?Thanks
According to the doc, this is given by sys.maxsizeAn integer giving the maximum value a variable of type Py_ssize_t can  take. Itâ€™s usually  on a 32-bit platform and  on a  64-bit platform.And interestingly enough, this the Python3 doc about data model gives more implementation details under .CPython implementation detail: In CPython, the length is required to  be at most . If the length is larger than sys.maxsize  some features (such as ) may raise .
I believe tuples and lists are limited by the size of the machine's virtual memory, unless you're on a 32 bit system in which case you're limited by the small word size.  Also, lists are dynamically resized by...  I believe about 12% each time they grow too small, so there's a little overhead there as well.If you're concerned you're going to run out of virtual memory, it might be a good idea to write to a file or files instead.
