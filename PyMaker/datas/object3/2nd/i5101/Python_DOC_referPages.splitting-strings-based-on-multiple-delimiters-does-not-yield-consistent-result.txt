I also investigated  using stuff like  but that didn't work either. I'm also not a big regular expression user (though I know they are very powerful) which explains why I'm having a hard time finding the right one.I guess I need to delimit the lines by   and  though I'm really not sure how to do it such that the resulting lists are consistent. Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks

It's not always a good idea to use it, but  can be ideal in these situations:
Regex:   or Details: Match a single character present in the list Matches between  and  times Matches between  and  timesPython code:Output:
