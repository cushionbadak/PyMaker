I have a list of elements [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], I want to generate combinations one by one, like [1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5], etc. I tried using itertools.combinations but that makes a list of all possible combinations, which takes up too much memory space. How do I access each new combination right when it is generated? 
How do I access each new combination right when it is generated?Use a  loop, like so: makes a list of all possible combinationsNo, it doesn't. is a generator function. When used in a  loop, only one result is returned at a time. No  of all the results is ever created.
