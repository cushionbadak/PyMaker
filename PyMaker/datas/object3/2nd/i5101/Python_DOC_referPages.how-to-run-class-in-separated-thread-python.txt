One of is  and the second is At first, works  that return was filled dictionaryThen is created instance of  that iterates all images and downloads them:So, the problem is when I call this script it creates one major thread that is waiting for the end of .As a result, a major thread works so long, it invokes 502 Server error.How to run  in a separate background thread that to release major thread?What will be launched first in this code:Using:
You need to look for which line is blocking your code to run it in a separated thread, usually the blocking line is some kind of I/O or expensive computation.To do it you can use the threading module.So, assuming that your blocking line is theTry to run it in a separated thread with this code.
As mentioned, you can use Python's  module for this. Though, a thread takes a reference to a function (passing  a function call is useless / wrong).In your case, if you want to both instantiate then run a function on an object in a separate thread, you should put these two in a function:Then pass a reference of this function to a new thread, like so (notice no ):If you don't want the main thread to wait for the new thread to finish, you could make it a Daemon thread, like so:Shorter version of all the above:
