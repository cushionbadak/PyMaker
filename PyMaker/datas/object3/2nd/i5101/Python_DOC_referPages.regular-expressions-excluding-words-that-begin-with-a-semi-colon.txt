Natural Text
I have been trying to figure out how to include certain word groups and exclude others.I have this string for exampleI want to find  and   but not  because it begins with a : I have made this code but it still includes the :JKLJBLKJD:DKJL? just ignoring the : in the front
The actual pattern is pretty simple to specify. But, you'll also need to specify a look-behind to handle the second term appropriately.The regex means "any expression that does not start with a colon but ends with a question mark".A simple word boundary does not work because  will also match the boundary between  and ... no bueno, hence the lookbehind.
Alternate approachOr, using the regex module will effectively ignore strings starting with  means non-capturing group
