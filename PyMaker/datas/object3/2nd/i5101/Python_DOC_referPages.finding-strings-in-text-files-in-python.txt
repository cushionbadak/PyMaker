I need a program to find a string (S) in a file (P), and return the number of thimes it appears in the file, to do this i decided tocreate a function:I know it doesn't look very good, but for some reason it's not outputing anything, let alone the right answer.  
There are multiple problems with your code. First of all, calling  returns a file object. It does not read the contents of the file. For that you need to use  or iterate through the file object.Secondly, if your goal is to count the number of matches of a string, you don't need regular expressions. You can use the string function . Even still, it doesn't make sense to put the regular expression call in quotes. Assigns the string  to the variable .Here is a version that should work for you:
You can read line by line instead of reading the entire file and find the nunber of time the pattern is repeated and add it to the total count 
There are a few errors; let's go through them one by one:Anything in quotes is a string.  Putting  in quotes just makes a string.  If you actually want to call the re.findall function, no quotes are needed :)You check whether  is None or not, which is really great, but then you should return that matches, not the initial pattern.The if-statement should not be indented.Also:Always a close a file once you have opened it!  Since most people forget to do this, it is better to use the  syntax.So, taken together, it would look like this (I've changed some variable names for clarity):
