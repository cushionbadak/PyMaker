Sorry for the weird title, but I don't really know how to explain this. Basically, I have this code that grabs from an API, however, if the numeric value is trying to display low.

(Python 3.6.4) It MUST Be kept as a String to work!Why this is not a Duplicate: Although another thread found a similar answer to what I want, it doesn't exactly explain how to incorporate it into my code where I have already converted it into a string. Would I just overlay it overtop after its been converted to a string or..?Code:
You are seeing scientific notation.  8.888e+2 means 8.888x102.You need to use the String Formatting Mini-Language if you don't like the defaults.  Python has gone through some gyrations with formatting.  Here are some options:Note that  means "8 places after decimal, fixed floating point".More information:Old string formattingstr.formatf-stringsPer your comment, you could format a string in scientific notation with:
When numbers get big or small enough, Python refers to them using scientific notation. This doesn't mean the value is incorrect or "weird", it's just displaying in a different format.To force it to display, for example, 8 digits, you would need to format it to do so:
