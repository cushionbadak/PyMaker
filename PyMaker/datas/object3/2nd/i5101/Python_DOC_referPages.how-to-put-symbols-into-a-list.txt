How do I put symbols such as \, /, :, *, ?, ", <, >, | into a list?if I do this:the commas separating the items will be counted as a string including the PS: It is to check if the filename contains illegal characters (can't be made into a file), so if there's any alternative methods, please do tell me, thanks!
Use raw strings (denoted by putting an  in front of your strings).  Then, transform your raw string into list:Note the  when printed is still a single backslash, but in value the first backslash is stored as an escape character.You can read more on the documentation of lexical analysis.This answers the question, but in reality you a  is treated like a  of characters, so both of the following will return the same elements:As for how to identify if a filename has any of these characters, you can do this:This is just one of the many ways.  You might even opt for a regex approach:
You need to escape the special characters like  in the string before inserting them into the array, like this:Printing it will give you the escaped backslash
If the idea is just to check for illegal characters, you are doing an overkill here with complex stuffs. python  allow for lookup as they are iterators too. I would go with below easy approach :downside : one type of s have to be skipped which surround the string ( in this case)
Just add the escape character  before the backslash .Changeto
