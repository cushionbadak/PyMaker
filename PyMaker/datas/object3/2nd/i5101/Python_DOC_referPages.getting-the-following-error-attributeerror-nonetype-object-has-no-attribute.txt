Got "AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'find_all'" when trying to scrape through following python code.
The reason you are not getting main-list is because the site("https://deathtimeline.com/") is JavaScript loaded. if you check the content of page.content or view source of the site you can only see JS code. BeautifulSoup does not execute Javascript, so any data delivered or  rendered via JS will not be available to you if you scrape with  BeautifulSoup.You can try using selenium to get JS loaded pages
