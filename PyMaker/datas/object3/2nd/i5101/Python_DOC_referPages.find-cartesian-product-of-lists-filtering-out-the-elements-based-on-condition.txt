I recently came across this notationFirst I don't know how to search for the notation in creating , is there a name for this type of structure?Also, I'm confident that  can be updated to not allow  to equal . Please can you help me with this?I've tried various things on the lines ofbut so far I can't find anything that works, or is even valid syntax.What I'm trying to accomplish is to find every combination of  where  can only be used once in each line so the result would beThanks
It is known as list comprehension and you can use logical  within it to filter the results in the returned list as:Instead of using nested list comprehension, you may get the same behavior using  as well:
this is  and the correct syntax for the filtering condition is this:List comprehensions
The syntax being used to create  is called a list comprehension. Almost your exact case is the fourth code example in those docs:A list comprehension consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, then zero or more for or if clauses. The result will be a new list resulting from evaluating the expression in the context of the for and if clauses which follow it. For example, this listcomp combines the elements of two lists if they are not equal:>>>[(x, y) for x in [1,2,3] for y in [3,1,4] if x != y][(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)]All you need to do is change your last  to an :
Just for the sake of variety, I would like to add the following solution that is based on  and circumvents the  check.producing:I did some timings too to compare the different approaches using:and the results are:So it seems that the plain list comprehension is the fastest. This behavior persists with bigger  lists too.
