I have a list as follow:For instance, item1 .. itemN might be a list of classes, and [subitems] contains a list of students that attend each class. A student might attend more than 1 class.Each class and student has a description (in a string variable).I want to create a (static) table that contains two columns. The first column is the list of classes.When I click to one element in the first column, the second column will display the list of students attend this class. Also, the description of the class will be displayed.If I click to a student, the cell will expand and display the description of the student.Sorry if the description is not so clear. The idea is as the image following:The list and description are stored in TXT files, not database.
Your question is not very clear, but i will suggest you to read list comprehension and chain itertools.https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensionhttps://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html#itertools.chainI didn't understand your question exactly. But if you have a list like my_list = [[[1,2], [2,3]], [[1,2], [2,3]]]. You can manipulate this with list comprehension and chain(itertool).
