I made a Python script that generates multiplication problems my only issue is if the multiplication problem is wrong. I need to get the script to display the question again and run through the if statement wouldn't I need to make the if statement a function? If so how would I do that? I'm still pretty new to python any help would be appreciated!
My understanding of your question is that you want to continue to ask the same question until the user has answered correctly. You could use a function for this, but essentially you need another loop (the for loop to iterate over the number of questions you want to ask and an inner loop to continue to display the question until the user inputs correctly.
Using a  is one way to achieve this.Below is an example of how you can structure your code.
