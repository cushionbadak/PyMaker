In Python, I receive two floats e.g.and a precisionthat tells me there will be no digits beyond the 6th decimal of the floats.I want to transform the floats to two integers, so that every information they carry is represented in the integers.The solution in this case is obviously to multiply them by 1000000, but I can't figure out a smart way to get there.I tried the workaround to get the number of digits in p by:But:Well I could replace the "-" by a "+" in the string and transform it back to a float, but this seems for me to be a pretty ugly approach and I thought there must be a much cleaner, mathematical way to do that.Any suggestion?
Why you just do not multiply  and  with  ?You exactly do not need python (or its string methods) other than converting resulting floats to integer, just arithmetics -))
