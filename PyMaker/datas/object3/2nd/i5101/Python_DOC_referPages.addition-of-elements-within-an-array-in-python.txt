One way to do it is to use the  recipe pairwise:Another is to use the built-in :And finally, as requested in the comments by @StefanPochmann, if you are using :As for speed, the  solution is basically unbeatable, as long as your input array is already a . If not, then casting it to an array, the  and the  one are about equally fast.
