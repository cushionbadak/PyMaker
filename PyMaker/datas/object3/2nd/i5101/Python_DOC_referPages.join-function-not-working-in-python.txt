From the documentation for :str.join(iterable)Return a string which is the concatenation of the strings in iterable. A TypeError will be raised if there are any non-string values in iterable, including bytes objects. The separator between elements is the string providing this method.What you need to do instead is create each row in your  with five s:
Instead of creating secondary lists of s, you could leave them as length five strings  and trust that  will work because  is also an iterable.As an aside, my preference would be to write the  function like this:
 results in . What you want is probably , which makes a list of five elements.
You can split your row as:
