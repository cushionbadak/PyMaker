I am running some shell scripts with the subprocess module in python. If the shell scripts is running to long, I like to kill the subprocess. I thought it will be enough if I am passing the  to my  statement.Here is the code:I have tested this call with some shell scripts that runs 120s. I expected the subprocess to be killed after 30s, but in fact the process is finishing the 120s script and than raises the Timeout Exception. Now the Question how can I kill the subprocess by timeout?
The documentation explicitly states that the process should be killed:from the docs for :"The timeout argument is passed to Popen.communicate(). If the timeout expires, the child process will be killed and waited for. The TimeoutExpired exception will be re-raised after the child process has terminated."But in your case you're using , and I've seen issues like that before, because the blocking process is a child of the shell process.I don't think you need  if you decompose your arguments properly and your scripts have the proper shebang. You could try this:note that I can reproduce this issue very easily on Windows (using , but it's the same thing):=> notepad stays open, probably because it manages to detach from the parent shell process.=> notepad closes after 1 secondFunnily enough, if you remove ,  works even with  probably because it successfully kills the shell which is launching .I'm not saying you have exactly the same issue, I'm just demonstrating that  is evil for many reasons, and not being able to kill/timeout the process is one more reason.However, if you need  for a reason, you can use  to kill all the children in the end. In that case, it's better to use  so you get the process id directly:(source: how to kill process and child processes from python?)that example kills the notepad instance as well.
