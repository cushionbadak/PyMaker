I have a Python class which needs to accept one of two mutually exclusive arguments. If the arguments are not exclusive, (ie: if both or neither are given), an error should be raised.In most scenarios, the best option would be to make two separate classes. However, I am working with an external API which requires these two attributes to be mutually exclusive.Request:Response:Similar questions seem to indicate that  can be used for mutually exclusive arguments in command-line interfaces, but I'm unsure how to apply this to a class constructorHow can I create a Python function with mutually exclusive arguments?
You might want to create a test in the init method but a better question might be... Why?Why would you make a class that has multiple purposes? Why not create separate classes?
Beyond the answer by @Ivonet, a common way in Python is to accept a single parameter, and duck it:possibly with another exception. If you want to use , which may be overkill for only two parameters, but would scale nicely:Results from top top bottom:This is also cool since  will actually print the usage (and exit). This is to answer the specific question regarding , but to be clear, @Ivonet has the answer I would actually use for your exact example.
What you want to do is easy:but it's not considered correct python. You should create alternate constructors as classmethods, instead:See What is a clean, pythonic way to have multiple constructors in Python? for a more in-depth example.
