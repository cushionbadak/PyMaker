This question already has an answer here:How do I read and write CSV files with Python?                    3 answers                If I use the following code:I see 5 columns and numerous rows. How do I take one row at a time and set variables to each item in a row?
The for loop already takes one line at a time Split the line into a list. Assuming comma is the delimiter, this assigns variables to each column This also assumes you don't have nested commas within columnsFor a better solution please see the  module Note: Pandas has more useful functions for CSV manipulation 
Use the csv module:Hope that helps.
