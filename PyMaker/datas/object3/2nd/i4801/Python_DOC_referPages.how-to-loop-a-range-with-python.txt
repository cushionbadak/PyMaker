This is my question:I have to write a function that accepts 2 integer values as parameters and returns the sum of all the integers between the two values, including the first and last values. The parameters may be in any order (i.e. the second parameter may be smaller than the first).This is the example of the result:This is what I've tried:but for this example:I got the wrong result, can anyone help?
You'll need to swap your variables if  is smaller than :You don't really need to use a loop here, if you passed your  to the  function, then you can leave the looping and summing to that function:
Using loops:Note: You could also do:
 counts from the first parameter up to (but not including) the second, which means the range is empty if the first is no smaller than the second.
You don't really need to use the loop:Example:Output:
