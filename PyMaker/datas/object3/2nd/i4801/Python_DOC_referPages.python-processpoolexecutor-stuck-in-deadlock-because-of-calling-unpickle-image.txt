Hi I am working on image processingI am using  to make image data processing faster, it works fine until it seems to find an unpickled image (but I am not sure if it is the real problem, I did some googling for many hours..)It raised...TypeError... and got stuck into deadlock forever.The code works fine without ProcessPoolExecutor, so I do not think any problem with my code but ProcessPoolExecutor.So my question is, "is there any way to avoid from ProcessPoolExecutor getting stuck in deadlock status?"My code is the following :Error Message :
You are probably affected by this Pillow bug.Only workaround I see for the time being, is to try to pickle the  object in  before returning it. If it fails you simply return something else (, ) or raise the exception within the function itself.The pebble pool is a bit more robust and it might deal with the issue transparently for you.
