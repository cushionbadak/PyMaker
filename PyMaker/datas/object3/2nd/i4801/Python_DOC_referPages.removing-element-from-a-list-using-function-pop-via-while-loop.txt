Since you essentially want to do left popping, you might want to consider using a  rather than a .
Once you have removed the element at index , the element now at index  is really what was at index  as all the elements are "shifted along". So, you do not need the for-loop inside the while, you merely need to call  at the start of the while.So, the code would look something like:completing with  as .Note that popping the first element is actually  complexity (compared to popping the last which is ). So if you were looking for efficiency, you could use a double-ended queue which permits the use of  (equivalent to ) but is .So the implementation of that would simply be:which gives  as  but, if necessary, you could convert back to a list with .
