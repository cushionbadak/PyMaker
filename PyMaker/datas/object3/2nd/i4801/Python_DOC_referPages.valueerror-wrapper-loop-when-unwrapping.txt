Python3 test cases (doctests) are failing with my sample code. But the same is working fine in Python2.Run test cases: Error:Can anyone please help in how to overcome this error.Thanks.
This is arguably a bug in doctest. What's happening is that doctest is searching for functions/methods/callables with a docstring, and while doing so it's unwrapping any decorators it finds. Why it does this, I have no idea. But anyway, doctest ends up calling  (where  is a  instance), which is essentially equivalent to doing this:Because  is a  instance, accessing  calls  and returns a new  instance. This would go on forever, but  is smart enough to notice that it's not getting anywhere, and throws an exception instead of entering an infinite loop.As a workaround, you can rewrite your  method to throw an  when  is accessed. Even better, throw an AttributeError when any dunder-attribute is accessed:
For  try importing items asinstead of This worked around the bug for me.
