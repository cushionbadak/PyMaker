I have in my code:And it works OK. But if I call to a second function. The 'for' stament only iterates once, only for the first element of the list.Why? Any help/tip?
In the scope of the  function the name  is bound to the list  but this does not override the empty list with the same name (created in line 1), since that list lives in another scope. If you try to access a variable by the name  from within the  function the own scope is checked first (no variable found) than the parent scope (the file) is checked and the empty list is found. This is why no output is printed.To avoid this shadowing of variables it's useful to pass the variables as arguments instead of defining them again:you can (and sometimes should) choose your name for the argument as you want it does not need to match the name used in the start() scope.If you want to go on with programming in python, I would recommend you to think a minute about this or read in the documentation about scopes of variables.
