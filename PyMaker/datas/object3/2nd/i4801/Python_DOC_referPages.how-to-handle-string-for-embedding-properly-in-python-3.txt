I am trying to use python embedding with Python 3 but unfortunately there are some strange outcomes when using it. Here is the source code:Scenario 1/tmp/main.cppIf I compile and run the above code in Python 2.7 like this, it did not show any errors:However, if I compile and run the code in Python 3.6 like this:It will show the following errors:Scenario 2If I remove the three lines to append the current directory to system path like this:It will show the following error in both Python 2 and Python 3:From Scenario 2, we can observe that the lines to add the current directory to the system path is required. When adding the path is done, the code in scenario 1 works in Python 2 only. The error logs for Python 3 showed that it expects something like byte object rather than string. However I have no clue how to use the embedding with byte object as I cannot find it in the official python website nor any other places on the web.Please can someone kindly explain how to use embedding properly in Python 3?
Python 3  takes Unicode strings, not byte strings. Don't use  to create the path element.Use  instead, at least when embedding Python 3.If the path elements contain just ASCII characters, you can use the same function in Python 2. Non-ASCII character support in  elements in Python 2.x is spotty and depends on the OS.
