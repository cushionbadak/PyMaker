How to add two sets and delete duplicates
Try this:Result:
You can get the union of both sets using the logical or operator {'e', 'a', 'b', 'd', 'c'}If you want the set ordered and as a list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
Use  methodYou want to use the  method of a set:https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#frozenset.unionhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=sets#frozenset.unionThe union method is the same as the  operator, so the line of code above is equivalent toUse in-place operatorIf you have no need to retain  or , it would be better to use the  method, which will add the new members in place. That is,will produce the union in the existing data structure . This is also performed by the equivalent codeSidenote: use  literalIn the code you provide, it would be faster to use the set literal notation with :because it will execute twice as fast and not generate the unused list object.
set() return  so can't add two set togetherhttps://docs.python.org/2/library/sets.html
