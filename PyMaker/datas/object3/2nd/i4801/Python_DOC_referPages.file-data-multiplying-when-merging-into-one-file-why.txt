My script below takes files with a predetermined string in the filename and merges them into one file. I have to pre-define the  for a reason.What I expect:Contents from files    to be added tothe  (in order, but not crucial).What happens: The  has the content from the 3 files (in order), but 9times each (1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, [...]).
Your issue lies here:For each file, check if  is in , the filename, then for a predefined number of files, you append to the output file. This is being done 3 x 3 times, since there are 3  files, which you then are telling it to loop another 3 times any time it finds a file.My suggestion is to remove the inner  loop . I defined my test  files as such:The output of the original script using my test data is below, where  comes from  in my test sample. Notice the triplication of the data, as described in the question:The output of the corrected script is below, where  comes from  in my test sample:You also reuse , which can cause problems. I have eliminated this reuse.
