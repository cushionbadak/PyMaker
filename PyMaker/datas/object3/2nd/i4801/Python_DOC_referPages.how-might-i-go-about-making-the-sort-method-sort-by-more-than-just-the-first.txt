I am trying to sort a list. But when I try, it always seems to sort by just the first digit.This is my code:My input is just numbers. eg. 1 25 3 466 4 32 5but with this input the output is something like 1 25 3 32 466 4 5my goal is to have the variable data sorted properly. I would like the output for the input mentioned earlier to be 1 3 4 5 25 32 466. I am new to python so i apologize if this question is simple or if my terminology is off.
You're sorting the input alphabetically:, in the same way that , or , they come later in ordinal values:Since you're sorting numbers, convert your input to numbers before sorting them:If you want to keep them strings, you can use use a key to compare the input as integers:
You don't have a list of numbers, you have a list of strings that happen to be (hopefully) string representations of numbers. So, they get sorted as strings. As a string,  comes before , for the same reason that  comes before .There are two basic ways to fix this.If you actually want a list of numbers, convert each string to a number. For example:If you want to keep a list of strings, but still sort them as if they were numbers, you can use a  function:Either of these will raise a  is someone types  instead of . You need to decide what you want to do in that case. Maybe just failing with a  is fine. Or maybe you want a loop, asking for a new input line forever until they give you a valid one. Or maybe you want to silently skip over non-integers, or sort them to the end, orâ€¦ whatever you want to do, you can do it, but not until you decide what you want.
