I am pretty sure that  in Pandas is boolean . I found a couple of StackOverflow questions / answers, but no pointer to official documentation.Sanity CheckThe df isand  isSo I'm pretty sure it is boolean not.
The  is the operator equivalent of the   dunder which has been overridden explicitly for the purpose performing vectorized logical inversions on / objects.Note: Dunder methods must not be used directly in code, always prefer the use of the operators.Also, since you've asked, the section on Boolean Indexing describes its use.Another common operation is the use of boolean vectors to filter the  data. The operators are:  for ,  for , and  for . These  must be grouped by using parentheses.Bold emphasis mine.
Here they define explicitly:Another common operation is the use of boolean vectors to filter the  data. The operators are: | for or, & for and, and ~ for not. These  must be grouped by using parentheses.
I found it referenced on this page. It's about halfway down, I'd navigate to it with ctrl+F. You're correct though, it's the  operator.
