I face this peculiar situation:I am using  format to give my filenames a certain pattern. For example I am using a prefix and then a fixed-length number to create the filename. The problem occurred when I needed to also control the fixed-length number length:action1_000000.jpg  action1_000001.jpg  ...I came up with this idea which combines old and new style string formatting but it's peculiar and surely prone to being deprecated:action1_0000.jpg  action1_0001.jpg  ...So, is there any other approach to control the string format (the  part) inside a string format ()?
You can use  inside  in . Try this:See at "Nesting arguments and more complex examples" at this linkOr, using the f-string feature:
Why not use .rjust()?
