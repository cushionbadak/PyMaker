I need to generate 2-tuples from a list in Python, such that, in a tuple ,  and if a tuple  has already been generated, skip generating .Here is something I have written. It serves the purpose. However, when it is run in a pandas , it takes some good time to run.I would like to know if there is a faster way to attack the problem.Thanks in advance!!Update:I tried the solution by @ThalishSajeed. I enclosed it in a function and the function works perfect on a list of words as input. However, when I try applying it on a pandas  containing list of words. This was my function,and the result I got on passing a single list () is,Applying the same function on a pandas  containing list of words gives this result.Is there something wrong with the way I have used ?
