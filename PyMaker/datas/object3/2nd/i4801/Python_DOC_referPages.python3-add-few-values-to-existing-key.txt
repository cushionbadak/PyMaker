I know there is a lot of information about this subject, but I'm really stuck with this problem.I have a dictionary loaded from a file:Now, I need to add more values to the existing key.But instead I receive an error: Here's what I've tried so far:and:Result is the same: Please help!Full code below:
This can not work, reason see comments:You can try to fix it with:(Disclaimer: Code not executed, may contain typos, tell me, I'll fix)Reads: dict.setdefaulttype()You check if a key that you parsed from the commandline was already stored into the json-file that load as . If you have a file that contains a string for a certain key, loadign it will always recreate it as string. Your code checks if a key is already in  - if so the new code reads the value into . Then it checks if  is of type  - if so it replaces the value in  for  with a list containing . Then it appends the new parameter that you parsed from the commandline. In case the key is not in the dictionary, it creates the entry in  directly as list, using the just parsed value as defaultvalue inside the list.Then all is stored back and replaces the current file.
