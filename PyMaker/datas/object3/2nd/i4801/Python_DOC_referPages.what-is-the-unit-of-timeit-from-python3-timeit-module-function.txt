This question already has an answer here:What unit of time does timeit return?                    1 answer                Outputs:
As the documentation clearly says:This… returns the time it takes to execute the main statement a number of times, measured in seconds as a float.Meanwhile, notice that this is the elapsed time to run the main statement—that is, nothing at all, in your case. It's not a timestamp or anything like that. So subtracting  doesn't give you anything useful—it's the difference in elapsed time for two different runs of a no-op.
