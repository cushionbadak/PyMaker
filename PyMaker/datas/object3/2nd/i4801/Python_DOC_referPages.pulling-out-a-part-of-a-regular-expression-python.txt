Say I have the following regular expression and searchesI know that  gives  and  gives .Similarly  give  and  give However, what I want is a way to get the "named category" for an arbitrary match.So if I have an arbitrary match, say new_match, I could call  and it would return "int" or "alpha_num" depending on how it matched.  Does any such command exist or do I have to create my own?Thanks!
