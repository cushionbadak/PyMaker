Code to get all data from URL in requests.get not working - it only retrieves one page's worth of data (30 records).  How do I have to modify my code to make sure I get data from all the pages?
The actual page only provides 30 results at a time. Each subsequent page is accessed with a different argument to  in the URL (the first page is , the second is , etc.).You could download each page individually, but frankly, the better solution (for you and their server) is probably to download the CSV linked to on the search results page you're trying to grab, which contains the same information structured as a single CSV file, requiring fewer connections and less bandwidth to transfer, and is easy to parse programmatically (easier than HTML in general, and much easier than parsing nine separate HTML pages and gluing the results back together).
