Set-upI'm looking for all the integer pairs  in 2 closed sets:  and  such that .Code so farI tried,But this gives a  pointing to the  in the code. And if I do,I get . How do I solve this?
Comparing float calculations with == is difficult due to the nature of float arithmetics. It is often better to compare like this:By substracting the wanted value from your result and and comparing its absolute value against something kindof small you get better results.Result (using a set):Python rounding error with float numbers
For the first one you are using the assignment operator instead of the equivalent operator so it should be: And for the second you're probably better off using two for loopsThe second one would not make sense as you said it because x and y are coming from lists that have an unequal number of elements so you cannot loop over them like that
