For example, if I want to detect all odd numbers in an array and set them to zero, I can use:which works like a charm.But when I try something likeit expects two arguments. Likewise,  does not work. How can I pass that  argument from within ?
Try using lambda functionAnd rather than  did you mean ?
You can use  to make partial functions
You make a function which returns a function:BTW, you can entirely omit empty branches like ; it doesn't do anything. Since it results in a , I don't think that's what you want either. You probably want  there instead.
Another approach, instead of using , is to supply an infinite (or at least, long enough) sequence of 2nd arguments for the two-argument function:In Python 2,  will append  as necessary to the shorter of the two sequences to make them the same length. Assuming that will cause problems (either because your function cannot handle  as an input value or you end up with an infinite loop), you can either use , which stops after exhausting the shorter sequence:or pass the length of  as a second argument to  so that the two sequences are the same length.
