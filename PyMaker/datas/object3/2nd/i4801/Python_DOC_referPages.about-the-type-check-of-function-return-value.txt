Recently I wanted to give my personal project an idea: I want to select different feature branches based on the return type of the functionFor example, func() returns an instance of type A, then selects the branch that adapts to A; returns an instance of type B and selects the branch that adapts to B.It is well known that the class type of an instance can be simply implemented with the instance method, but how to determine the return value of the function.
You might be able to use  to do this (Python 3.4+)
