I can't understand why my below code raise an error.I'm trying to build a priority list based on heapq module of Python.The only difference with a basic example of the module is that want to use it with custom objects in it it, instead of simple (int,int) or (int,str) tuples.This is the error I have:The error is not raised if I use a different key to insert in the heap, but isn't heapq supposed to deal with same keys?I don't understand very well this behaviour.Thanks a lot
The operator  is not defined for your class. That way  can't define priority.raisesYou must then define the logical operators. See this for more info.
A heap has the property that the smallest object is always on top. In order for Python to preserve that invariant, it must have some way of determining which object is smaller. Your MyObject class does not provide this.You can define  or  to enable this.
