So I'm creating a basic (my first project using python) game with python. there is a part where I put a random.choice. I want to refer back to the same random number that it picked so I wondered if it is possible to create a variable for that output. I've tried str = randomint(1,7) but that didnt give me the result I wanted.
Here is how you would generate and then store a random number in Python. If you want a number between two numbers use . Note that using randint will give you an int and not a string
Your use of random.choice is indeed giving you a random selection from your list dice1. You can store the return value of random.choice in a variable.
