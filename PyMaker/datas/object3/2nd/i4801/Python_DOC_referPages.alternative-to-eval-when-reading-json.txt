And __init __ is reading the json, and I want to execute functions with parameters as in json.I could do a bunch of ifs, but it isn't scalable, I guess. I could do eval(), but it is a vulnerability. What do I do? Can I create something like a dictionary with functions?EDIT:Here's my class (simplified):
You can use the getattr function to call a particular method of class like this:- I think This was what you were asking for? I hope it helps.
