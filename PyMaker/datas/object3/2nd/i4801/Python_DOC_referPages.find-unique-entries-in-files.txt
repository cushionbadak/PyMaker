guess you have a solution concerning the following issue:I want to compare two lists for common entries (on the basis of column 10) and write common entries to one file and unique entries for the first list into another file. The code I wrote is:The following error appears:Does somebody know about help for this?Best
This linereplaces the  you read from a file by it's splitted . You then try to write the splitted list to your file - thats not how the write method works and it tells you exactly that. Change it to :You could have easily found your error yourself, just printing out the line before and after splitting or just befrore writing. Please read How to debug small programs (#1) and follow it - its easier to find and fix bugs yourself then posting questions here.You have some other problem at hand, though: Files are stream based, they start with a position of 0 in the file. The position is advanced if you access parts of the file. When at the end, you wont get anything by using INFILE2.read() or other methods. So if you want to repeatadly check if some lines column of file1 is somewhere in file2 you need to read file2 into a list (or other datastructure) so your repeated checks work. In other words, this:might work once, then the file is consumed and it will return false all the time.You also might want to change from:toas it is safer, will close the file even if exceptions happen.To solve that try this (untested) code:Links to read:the-with-statementany() and other built-ins
