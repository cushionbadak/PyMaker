I'm trying to get some info from this url "http://baloncestoenvivo.feb.es/Game/1881578". And I want to get all the info that there is inside a table which is inside a div with this I access to this table with this code:Then, print "table" to see what I get and I get one tr with no data. However, using firefox or chrome console we can see that there are 799 table rows with data!!!This is what a I get when I print "table" in python console:And this is what we can see in the console:Why don't get the same? All the tr tags with their td tags with information?What am I doing wrong? 
The contents of the table are dynamically generated through JavaScript. That's why the page source doesn't have them.  module gets you the page source without the execution of the JavaScript, which is the reason why you are seeing incomplete data.If you check the  tab under the  tab in the dev tools, a request is being sent to http://baloncestoenvivo.feb.es/api/KeyFacts/1881578 which returns the data in the form of JSON. You can parse this data using  module and its built-in  function.Only thing is, you need to pass the following headers. Without them, the website is blocking the script and you'll see .You can now get all the table values from the  variable. To see its structure, use the  module.For example, to get the player names and corresponding points, you can use this:Output:
The reason behind it is that we need to use a browser emulator like  to render this dynamic content generated by .If we try to request this data just with requests we'll not get the s that you're looking for. I would recommend official Selenium Documentation or a Youtube tutorial on this library, it is very easy to use once you get a grasp of things.Selenium DocumentationThis doesn't work and it will return only a portion of the HTML that doesn't contain the information you're looking for (i.e. table elements)
