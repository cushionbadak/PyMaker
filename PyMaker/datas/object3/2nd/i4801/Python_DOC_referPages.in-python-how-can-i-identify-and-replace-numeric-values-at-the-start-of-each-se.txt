Natural Text
Objective: to find digits that start at the beginning of a sentence and change the number in place to equal the original number plus 10%.The output I am seeking is as follows:Notice how two of the three sentences have changed the numerical values, but one did not. EDIT:Keep in mind the same number could appear multiple times in the string. And a new sentence is a sentence that comes either after a full stop (such as a period, exclamation mark, question mark) or that comes after a new line character. 
You can use  with a regex like  using the multiline-flag  so that  matches a line break and a replacement function for doing the math and formatting the output:This assumes that all sentences start at a new line (and no sentences span more than one line) as is the case in your example. This problems (if itis a problem) can be handled separately.
