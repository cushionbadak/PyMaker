Natural Text
I would like to create a text file in Python, write something to it, and then e-mail it out (put  as an email attachment). However, I cannot save this file locally. Does anyone know how to go about doing this?As soon as I open the text file to write in, it is saved locally on my computer.I am using  and  to send the mail.
StringIO is the way to go...
