I have encountered a problem with some code I am doing to simulate a D&D (Dungeons and Dragons) campaign.This is the code, but I am only experiencing difficulty with the most recent section. I made code to roll a 4-sided dice and a 20-sided dice to divide the result of the 20-sided dice by the result of the 4-sided one, and then add this value to the preset value of 10 like so:There is no syntax error, although when my code runs I will get a low value for the first variable, and then a different that is the same for the rest of the remaining variables. 
When you add the values of , , etc to your  array, you're just adding their current values.  Updating those values in the array does not update the original variables, and vice versa:You should consider using a dictionary instead: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries
