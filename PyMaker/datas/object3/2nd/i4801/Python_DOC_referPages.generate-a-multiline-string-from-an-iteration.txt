ths is probably a dumb question... I'm working with some data that is generated, line by line, after an iteration and I'd like to store the result for further processing in a multiline string. As an example, let me show you this:The result is: But I'd like it to be a multiline string:What is te correct way to achieve this?
In this line  use this  instead
You could build a multi line string as follows:Or iteratively as:These methods avoid string concatenation which should be avoided if possible as they are less efficient.Strings have a  method which takes a list of strings to join together, so:would give you a string:(where  is the newline character)
Add a newline after each element.
Is this what your are looking for?Be careful dealing with the '\n', you may use something like  to retreive each sub string
I think you just have to add  character at the end of the each insertion and this will solve your problem:hope, it helps!
You can do it in a list or as a string adding a new line  to each..
