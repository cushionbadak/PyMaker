Is there any builtin (or very simple) method of having a python dictionary work in a similar fashion as deque.I need it to have a maximum size, and when new keys are added, if the maximum length is reached then the key added first is deleted. It shouldn't be too difficult to implement as a custom class, but using builtins is always prefered.I am using Python 3.6 if that is of any help.
It sounds like a variant of .
It sounds like you want a least recently used (LRU) cache.The functools.lru_cache decorator might be useful to you. If you want more control, then check out the package pylru or just google Python LRU cache.
