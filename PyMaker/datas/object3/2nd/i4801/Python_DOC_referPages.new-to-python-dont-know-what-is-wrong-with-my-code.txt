I'm new to Python so please be gentle.I seriously don't know what is wrong with my code.Here it is:Since , I'd expect (analytically) to get r = (-16/4)^(1/4) = (-1)^(1/4)*sqrt(2) = exp(i pi /4)*sqrt(2) = 1 + 1 iBut instead I get:I've tried to find the error. If I print  I get 0 as expected, and If i set  manually like:I get . And If I remove the , it works and I get So why doI get this error?
I noticed that the value returned by  is of type . The problem occurs when we include this value in Python's built in  function. For example, try ; it breaks too. Perhaps it's due to this:With mixed operand types, the coercion rules for binary arithmetic operators apply.  Built-in Functions: pow()I managed to fix the issue by casting the result of  to .. 
Problem is probably caused by the numpy float thing. (as aswered by Schomes). Fix by convert to 'normal' float.
The reason is   are like  float, and overload all operations (including) power to work as such. This is the type returned by  and subsequently in all operations. Note you're trying to compute:which is an imaginary number. Python can handle that, and output the result, but  s are "real", so the above is an invalid expression. For this reason all the answers here suggesting to convert to  work:
