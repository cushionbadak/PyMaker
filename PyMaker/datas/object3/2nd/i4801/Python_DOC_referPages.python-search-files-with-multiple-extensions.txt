You could create a list and loop over ityou could format like this for iteration
you could try:
Actual-glob syntax has no way to do this. The "enhanced glob" syntaxes of most modern shells can, but I'm pretty sure Python's  module is only very lightly enhanced.Under the covers,  is a pretty simple module, and the docs link to the source. As you can see, it ultimately defers to , which is also a pretty simple module, and while ultimately just builds a regex and defers to that. And of course you can do alternations in a regex.So, one option is to fork all the code from  and  so you can build a fancier pattern to pass down to .But the simplest thing to do is just stop using  here. It's the wrong tool for the job. Just use  and filter things yourself.If you understand how to write a regex like , use that to filter; if not, just write what you do know how to do; the performance cost will probably be minimal, and you'll be able to extend and maintain it yourself.If it turns out that doing a set method and a string method really is so much slower than regex that it makes a difference, and you can't write the regex yourself, come back and ask a new question. (I wouldn't count on the one I used above, if you can't figure out how to debug it.)Also, if you're using Python before… I think 3.5…  may actually be inherently slower than . In that case, you'll want to look for  on PyPI, the module that the current implementation is based on.
