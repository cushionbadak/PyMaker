My  file is over 100,000 lines now. If I delete it, will it be re-generated again? It exists because I have  in my :
Log file cannot be re-generated. It consists of events that occurred in the past. But if you deleted it, a new one will be generated. I suggest you set  logging handler, the maximum size for the log file and a number of backups to be kept. This way once the file reaches maximum size, current log file will be renamed and a new log file will be created.Django uses dictConfig scheme for logging configuration. For rotating file handler with maximum size of about 2MB and 2 backup log files, you'd define  key in  as:This way current  will be renamed to log.django.1 once it reaches size of 2.000.000 bytes and 2 backup files will be kept (log.django.1 and log.django.2) at all times.If you add  and  to your current configuration, your current log file will be renamed to log.django.1 and a new log.django will be created.
