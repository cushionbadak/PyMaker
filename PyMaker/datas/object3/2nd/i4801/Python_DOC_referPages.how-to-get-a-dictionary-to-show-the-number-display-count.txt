I have a nest-list like bellow:I want to get a dictionary to show the number display count, the dictionary should like bellow:how to get this? 
First the list can be flattened by combining all elements (taking inner elements out of list) to single list and then using Counter:Result:If you want the item as key, may be converting each item to string and passing them to :
First change your variable from  to something else say Your need to first flatten your list and then count the element using counter.You can also use list comprehension if you want to change like data type in your case
Is very easily to do this, just one line code:Please DO NOT use  as your variable name, here i use  instead.

the result:
Just one line for the actual logic (chain your  and apply  to it):PS. Consider renaming your variable name  to something else as it is a Python keyword.
If I understand correctly, you have a list of lists, and want to add the sum of the number of times a value appears in the list of lists (1-6), and want to the sum of times the value appears as the value in a dict, and the specific number (1-6) will be the "key" of the dict. Here is some code below that can get you your desired output: Your output will be the dictionary that you wanted with the keys being the number and the values being the number of times that particular number appeared in your list of lists. Here the output:I created your list of lists (nested-list). I created empty lists that will store each of the 6 numbers. I created four for loops (one for each index in your list of lists) that appends each number to its corresponding empty list. After I did that for each index I created an empty dictionary called list_dict. I made the keys of the dictionary the numbers that you wanted (1-6), and the values are the length of the empty dictionaries that we created earlier that now hold each occurrence of the number from your list of lists. This will get you the output that you are looking for. 
You can simply do:output:
