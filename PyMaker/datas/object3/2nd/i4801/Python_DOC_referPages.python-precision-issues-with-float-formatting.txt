Please look at the below Python code that I've entered into a Python 3.6 interpreter:Hopefully you can immediately understand why I'm frustrated. I am attempting to display  on my GUI, storing the full precision behind a cell but only displaying 2 decimal points (or whatever the users precision setting is). The GUI is similar to an Excel spreadsheet.I'd prefer not to lose the precision of something like  and round by , but I also don't want a value such as  displaying as .I'm interested in hearing about a standard way of approaching a situation like this or a remedy for my specific situation. Thanks ahead of time for any help.
Consider using the Decimal module, which "provides support for fast correctly-rounded decimal floating point arithmetic." The primary advantages of  relevant to your use case are:Decimal numbers can be represented exactly. In contrast, numbers like  and  do not have exact representations in binary floating point. End users typically would not expect  to display as  as it does with binary floating point.The exactness carries over into arithmetic. In decimal floating point,  is exactly equal to zero. In binary floating point, the result is . While near to zero, the differences prevent reliable equality testing and differences can accumulate. For this reason, decimal is preferred in accounting applications which have strict equality invariants.Based on the information you've provided in the question, I cannot say how much of an overhaul migrating to  would require. However, if you're creating a spreadsheet-like application and always want to preserve maximal precision, then you will probably want to refactor to use  sooner or later to avoid unexpected numbers in your user-facing GUI.To get the behavior you desire, you may need to change the rounding mode (which defaults to ) for  instances.
