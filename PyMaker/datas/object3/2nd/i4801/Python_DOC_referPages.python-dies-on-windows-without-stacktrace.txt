I'm loading a large csv file into pandas and when I load too many lines at once I get a dialog box telling me "Python has stopped working" without any error messages in the terminal (screenshot). I suspect it's a memory limitation but it'd be nice to confirm with the python stacktrace directly.  Anyone have a similar experience and know how to get at what's happening? update: Turns out not to have been a memory limitation after all.  I think the root cause was a pandas issue, upgrading from 20.3 -> 22.0 seems to have fixed it.  I suspect it was related to this: https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/16798
Use the trace module to try and force it.or Python debugger might also provide insight. If neither of these work, it's most likely a memory issue based on the context you provided. Hope this helps.
