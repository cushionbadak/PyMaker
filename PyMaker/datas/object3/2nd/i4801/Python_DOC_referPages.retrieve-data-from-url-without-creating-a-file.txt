I've got an issue with a little project I have, I'm trying to downlaod large amounts of data from a website to store them and work on them later, however I need to make small changes to them in order to make them work. I'm currently using to download the data, and then I open it, make the necessary changes and save it again. However, it feels like the write and read operation is unecessary, as I'm saving the data on my disk just to open it again, especially as I end up downloading a lot of data. I tried using the request module that I don't know really well for this, but I ran into trouble as the data is initially compressed as gzip file. This doesn't work, as he neither recognizes or as a valid encoding. I think that the data behind the is in utf-8, but if I try to use as an encoding parameter, it doesn't work either. Would anyone have an idea on how to make it read the file? Ps: I'm not sure if it's usefull for this issue, but this is the operation I do to the file when I've downloaded them: 
Use with a package io.BytesIOfor example:
