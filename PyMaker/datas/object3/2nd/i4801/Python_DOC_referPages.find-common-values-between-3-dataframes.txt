I have 3 dataframes: df1, df2, and df3. What I want is an output of all of the 'num' values which appear in 2 or more of the dfs, and I want to flag how many dfs that 'num' value appeared in. So I want something like this: I tried doing an inner merge, but that only accounts for 'num' values that appear in all 3 dfs, ignoring the ones that appear in 2/3 dfs. What's the best way to go about this?
