I would like to inherit the  class to set up a maximum length to the dict.I did : But now I don't see which function to overwrite to catch the "adding a key" event.I Googled for a while without finding the answer. Even special functions are not clearly an answer.
Use the dunder method  as mentioned in the comments by  @AshwiniChaudhary. You need to distinguish overwriting and setting a new key, though.Note that while the  method also allows adding new keys, it calls  under the hood, as mentioned in the comments.If the dictionary exceeds the maximum size you might want to  until it matches the length ( for FIFO order,  for LIFO order, the default).
