Natural Text
this is my first ever Python script/question on Stackoverflow/step into real coding.I am looking to count the number of times certain strings appear within the rows I am iterating through then print out the values. I have not set up a delimiter so there is only one column. Essentially I am saying, if the column contains said string, add to the counter.The problem is, I get an output of 0 for all my variables. Any suggestions?Here is the code (sorry it's long).
I have not set up a delimiter so there is only one columnIf you do not specify a delimiter, the default one is used, which is a comma . So, there still may be multiple columns and, therefore, multiple elemtns in the list .Now, the string in  also contains commas, so, if this string is present in your input CSV, it never appears in  as a single element. Therefore  is always . Some of the other  strings have the same problem.You can open the file just as a text file (without using the  module) and iterate over the lines.A dirty solution would be to specify a character that is not present in your input file as delimiter for .
You are reading the file outside the  context manager.Your code should be:otherwise you are opening and closing the file before even reading it.EDIT:As @yann-vernier has pointed out,  must be consumed inside the  block. That is, the  loop should be all indented.
