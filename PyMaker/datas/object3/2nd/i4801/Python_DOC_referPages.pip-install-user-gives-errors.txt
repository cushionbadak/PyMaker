CONTEXT:I am having trouble installing a module (namely 'plotly').  I have seen a lot of information, which is overwhelming, and so I hope to take the problem step-by-step.SETUP:MacOS High Sierra version 10.13.3python version 2.7.10possibly relevant: I also installed python 3.6, but when I type  version 2.7 gets started (this is another issue that I need to sort out)WHAT I HAVE TRIED (OR REFRAINED FROM DOING) AND WHAT I UNDERSTAND:Simply typing  throws an error (and I think I understand why it should): In the past I have used , but since then have learned it is a bad thing, so now I am trying to do things "neatly".Disappointingly, doing  also throws an permission error, but not the same as 1.:which I guess is logical since it is trying to install the module in a different location.At this point I am not sure what to do.  
Using Pip is not the best idea, try using virtualenv:The installation of virtualenv shouldnâ€™t throw an error.Look up the usage, or use this reference:http://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/Python/virtualenv.htmlAlso, try python3 to execute 3.6.
