I have a list of full names which I am splitting into two variables currently like so:which works only if  is two words when split, otherwise I get. Is there a concise way to account for a name with more parts to keep  as the first word and  as the rest of the words? I could do it with an extra line or two but I was wondering if there was an elegant way.
Look into the second parameter of split If  can be one word:
You can use str.partition that guarantee three tuple output in the format:
You can use:
Since you're using Python3, you can also use Extended Iterable Unpacking.For example:This stores everything after the first element of the split string in . Use  to put the string back together.It also works if there's only two elements to unpack.Or if you wanted first, middle, and last:
I had this problem before while what I had is a little bit more complicated, like including middle name. And the solution I found is name-cleaver https://github.com/sunlightlabs/name-cleaverIt works well cleaving name into parts, like title, first name, last name, etc.
