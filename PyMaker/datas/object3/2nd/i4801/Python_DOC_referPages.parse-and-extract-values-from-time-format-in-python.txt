I am trying to parse and extract values from my time data . I'm using  to do this with the  format but I am getting this error:Also, I don't know how to handle the  in my time data. Can anyone help?
There are two problems here to solve.First is the format string. It should be  to match exact date separators and timezone sequence (without space).From strftime and strptime Behavior: (lower case)     UTC offset in the form +HHMM or -HHMM (empty string if the object is naive).    (empty), +0000, -0400, +1030Second is the colon (:) in timezone offset '+01:00'. That can be left out using substring: s[:-3]+s[-2:] or string substitute.So the final answer is as below.
  should be changed to  to match with the time string. Also, you need to remove the last  from the input to use with .Here is how you should do:
At first: will not match . You need to adapt it to the time string!  instead should work.Secondly:IF you are in python3, the  was added for time stamps. However the timestamp has to be without the colon, e.g. instead of . Therefore, if you use python3 this works:Btw the time_string after the editing looks like that:IF you are in python2, the  won't work, here you have to use the parse function of the dateutil module, which is straight forward.
