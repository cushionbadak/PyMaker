I have a list containing a set of the history of a file. I need to separate each element in the list into several columns and save it to  file. The columns I need are . Suppose, this is my list:The desired  output:I tried using this code:In general, the code works. But for , it's written  in column  and is written only  in column .Is there something missing in the regex?
The main problem with your pattern is usage of . If you replace it with  you will not only solve the issue with line number but also with catching whitespaces after committer name:https://regex101.com/r/f7zjpA/2EDIT:You didn't mention that you want to keep indentations and your code didn't look like you actually want it. Whitespaces/indentations before the code are removed not only because of the regex pattern. There are two things:in regex pattern you used  before  group, which excludes all the whitespaces/indentations. If you want to keep them, replace  with  which will catch only first one instead all of them:in the for loop you use  which removes all whitespaces which are present at the beginning and the end of the string. Modifying the pattern and exchanging:with:will result in keeping indentations where they belong.
I fixed regex.This should work:I added a question mark to use Lazy matching".+" => ".+?" https://regex101.com/r/GQGLvy/1
Not exactly you are looking for but this can be useful.
