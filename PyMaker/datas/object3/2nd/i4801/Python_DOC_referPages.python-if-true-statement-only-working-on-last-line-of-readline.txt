Natural Text
My function only says that the last word in a file of words is an anagram (the first helper function). But every word in the file is an anagram of the word I tested and returns true independently with the helper function outside of the main function. I am not sure if it has something to do with  being a part of the string, and then it accounting for that, but I tried putting in an if statement saying to delete it if it was in there and that did not work either. I also did test to make sure it is running through each word in the  file and it is.
This is expected, based on the method you use to read a line (). From the documentation: reads a single line from the file; a newline character  () is left at the end of the string, and is only omitted on the last  line of the file if the file doesnâ€™t end in a newline.Your  has a trailing newline, but  certainly does not. So, in the end, all you'd need to change is:Well, that's all you'd need to change to get it working. Additionally, I'd also recommend using the  context manager to handle file I/O. It's good practice, and you'll thank yourself for it.It's better to use a  loop to iterate over the lines of a file (rather than a , it's cleaner). Also, there's no need to explicitly call  when you use a context manager (you're not currently doing it, you're only referencing the method without actually calling it).Incorporating @Christian Dean's suggestion in this answer, you can simplify your anagram function as well - call  and return the result in a single line:
