Trying to upload a file off the internet to my server using ssh. Have the following code that uploads local files fine, but I do not know what more to do to get the picture bytes object to upload.
You need to use the  method to get a file-like object, then copy across your data, using :Paramiko (and by extension, pysftp) does not have any support for putting an in-memory file object directly.
