I come from C++, and I want to access another static member function in one member function.S1:output:error, the hello() isn't definedS2:output:ok
From the staticmethod documentation:A static method does not receive an implicit first argument....It can be called either on the class (such as C.f()) or on an instance (such as C().f()).You still need to self reference the object. Otherwise, the interpreter will be looking for a top level function named . Hopefully, this example explains better.
