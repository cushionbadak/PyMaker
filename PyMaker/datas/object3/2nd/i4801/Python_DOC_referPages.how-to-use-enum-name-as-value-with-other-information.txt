I've researched this and found similar answers, but they don't work in this case because  is resolved earlier than  is called and only if the whole value is .Basically, what I want is the following:However, the name isn't passed into  so there's nothing to fill in  with.Then, I tried to use  in the following way:This doesn't work because  is only resolved when used as the sole value when defining a member, as in .  So it seems it's not even possible to do  and then take both of those parameters in the  function.  It seems my only option is to hardcode the name:and define the  function to take two params:Am I missing something? Is there a better way to do this? A better way to structure this information? 
This is definitely advanced behavior, so to use it you'll need the 1 library instead.That code will look like:The  setting says what the given values should be used for; in this case:the  for each memberthe  attribute for each member instructs  to create a value if one is missing -- since each member is only being provided with one piece of information, and  says there should be two,  will attempt to provide the missing piece. is (one of) the mechanism(s) used to do so, which in this case adds the  to the given , which is then passed into . uses the  as it's value and ignores the rest is automatically generated to handle the non-value items, so it sets the  attributeFor those still using Python 2.7, or need their code to work for 2.7 as well 3.x, the above class should look like this (all changes are in the first block):1 Disclosure:  I am the author of the Python stdlib , the  backport, and the Advanced Enumeration ()  library.
