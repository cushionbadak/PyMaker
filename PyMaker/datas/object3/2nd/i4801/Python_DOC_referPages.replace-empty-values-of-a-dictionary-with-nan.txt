I have a dictionary with missing values (the key is there, but the associated value is empty). For example I want the dictionary below:to be changed to this form:How can I write that in the most time-efficient way?
You can use a dictionary comprehension.  Also as was noted in the comments, naming something  in Python is not good practice.:Output:Just replace  with whatever you want it to default to.In your question, you want to replace with .You can use any of the following: if you are using Python 2.x, or with Python <3.5 for Python 3.5+ using 
You can use implicit syntax with boolean  expression:But be aware that in The Zen of Python it's said:Explicit is better than implicit.
You can create a class object to represent :Output:
You can use a for loop to iterate over all of they keys and values in the Dictionary. You created your dictionary with a series of key value pairs. I used a for loop and the .items() method to iterate over each key value pair in your dictionary. if the value of the key/value pair is an empty string, We change the that particular value to 'NaN' and leave the rest unchanged. When we print the new dictionary we get this output: This is time efficient because it is a quick loop, so long as you are okay with not 'NaN' values being strings. I am not sure if you are looking for them to be strings, however, you can change the value from 'NaN' to None very simply if that is what you are looking for. The for loop is relatively efficient in terms of time since it will iterate over each value quickly.
