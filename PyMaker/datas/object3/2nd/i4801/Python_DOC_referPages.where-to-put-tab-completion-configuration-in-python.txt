python tab completion Mac OSX 10.7 (Lion)The above link shows that the following code can be used for autocompletion in python.But I don't see where to put it so that it can be loaded at startup. I tried , but it did not work.Does anybody know what is the current way to load such a configuration automatically for an interactive python session?
