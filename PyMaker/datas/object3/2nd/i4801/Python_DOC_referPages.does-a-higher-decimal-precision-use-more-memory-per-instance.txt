With Python's decimal module, does a context with a higher precision value use more memory. If not, for what reason would you not always use the maximum?
yes, of course the size increases; you can check that with:ymmv... the exact values may be implementation/platform specific.
 can be very useful however that generally you shouldn't require infinite decimal places, currencies generally require 2-4. The more numbers you want to store the more memory it will use, generally speaking you only ever want to use the minimum required type, it's the reason we used to use  rather than  in Java, the same applies to Python it's just a little more behind the scenes.These days it might be quite minimal that you'd run into memory issues due to typing however it can still happen.
