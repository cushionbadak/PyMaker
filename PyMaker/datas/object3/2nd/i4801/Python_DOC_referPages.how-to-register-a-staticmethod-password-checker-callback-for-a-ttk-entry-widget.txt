I have written a password strength checker that dynamically checks the strength of the password keyed into a  widget. I have applied the criteria by @ePi272314 and the tutorial on adding validation by @ByranOakley to a  widget. The python script for this password strength checking ttk.Entry widget is given below and it works.Presently, I like to express method  as a  so that other classes may use it. For this to happen, I need to pass , a , into it. Also, I need to include this  when I register the . However, I am having difficulty implementing this. I tried something like:but got the error msg:Appreciate guidance on how to register the  when it contains a  input parameter.Python Script:
You can do it by modifying your  function to accept a  argument along with  to supply this to the now static function (which can't reference  since it's no longer a regular method with a  argument). Here's what I mean:
You don't need to set something as a static method for it to be used by other classes. So long as your class has all the required attributes and methods, it will work: In general, there is very little use for  except for namespacing. Often things I see as static methods should really be top level python functions.
