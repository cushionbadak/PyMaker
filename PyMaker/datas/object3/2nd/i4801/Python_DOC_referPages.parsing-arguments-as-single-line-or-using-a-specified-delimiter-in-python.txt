I want to parse the command line arguments while attempting to call the program in the following manner:I have been using  to parse them using a  loop: Output:But I wish to get the output as follows:Is there a way to split the line by specifying the delimeter  ?
 the args first, then split by . Output:
you need to use the argparserand here is a sample code of usage:
You can use split() and replace() functions. split() takes delimiter as an argument and replace takes two arguments - first one is the character you would like to replace (in your case the white space) and the second one is what you would like to replace it with.   Then you can reference your arguments by the indices of this list. Hope this helps.
