Here is a file called . If you have a look at it, you will find I define  and . Obviously I want to format them with my input data.First I read data from .And now input data comes.Finally I want to format subtitles with above json data. Simply, I want to replace {font_size} with 47.  is above json.However I got an error.Traceback (most recent call last):    File "iemoji.py", line 17, in       subtitles.format(data.get('font_size'), data.get('sentences'))  KeyError: 'font_size'EDIT for I load data like this.

But you're only providing positional values, so there's nothing that matches.You could fix this by doing something clumsy like:But really, this is exactly what  is for:For future reference, it's a lot easier to debug things like this if you (temporarily) break up the expression, so you can see exactly which part causes the exception:Then you'll see that it's the third line, not the first, that's raising the , and it'll be a lot easier to figure out why.Finally, I'm not sure why you're using  instead of just .
