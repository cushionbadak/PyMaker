I am trying to make a solar system in OpenGL but the planet is not revolving around sun. That is revolving around some other axis. How to fix this?First, I am drawing a sun, Then, there is rotation, translation and again rotation of first planet. So it should revolve around the sun and rotate on it's own axis, but that's not happening.I also want to make the circle on which planet will revolve. How to make the circles in XZ plane (possibly)
Planet should go behind the sun (invisible for some time) and then it would be visible after coming back, but that' not happening. You have to enable the depth test and you have to clear the depth buffer. The depth test can be enabled by . The default depth function  is . This causes that fragments which are behind a fragment that was drawn before, are skipped:Before every frame the depth buffer has to be cleared, by , to restart this process.Add the following lines to your code, at the begin of :Of coures you have to create a window with a depth buffer ():See the preview:Can you also tell how to make circle where the planet is revolving? I recommend to use  for setting up the simulation. The following example shows the sun, earth and the moon (Of course it is a very very simplified simulation with completely wrong sizes and distance relations):
