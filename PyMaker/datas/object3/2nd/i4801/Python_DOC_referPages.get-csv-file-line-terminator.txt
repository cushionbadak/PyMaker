In a python script, I need to detect the endline terminator of different csv files. These endline terminators could be: '\r' (mac), '\r\n' (windows), '\n' (unix).I tried with:But it doesn't work.How I could do that?EDIT:Based on abarnert response:
You can't use the  module to auto-detect line terminators this way. The  that you're using is designed to guess between CSV dialects for use by . But, as the docs say,  actually ignores  and handles line endings interchangeably, so  doesn't have any reason to set it.But really, a CSV file with a XXX line terminators is just a text file with XXX line terminators. The fact that it's CSV is irrelevant. Just  the file in text mode, read a line out of it, and check its  property:In Python 3, as long as you opened the file in text mode (don't use a  in the mode), this will work. In Python 2.x, you may need to specify universal newlines mode (don't use a , and also do use a ). If you're writing code for both versions, you can use universal newlines mode, and it'll just be ignored in 3.xâ€”but don't do that unless you need it, since it's deprecated as of 3.6 and may become an error one day.
