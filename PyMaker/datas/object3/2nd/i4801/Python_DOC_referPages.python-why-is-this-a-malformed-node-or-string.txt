I was just tidying up some code and ran into some trouble. I am getting an error I have never come across before My openLabels function at the top works fine and returns a list of items structured as you can see in the error message. I am doing some debugging and found it is the labelsToFrames function throwing the error. It is not accepting my list of lists as input. I have no idea why. Any direction would be much appreciated! 
The issue is that  is a list of lists. As such, when you're executing  and passing in , it is iterating over the list of lists, assigning each individual list to  and then trying to run  on . This then fails because  requires either a string or expression node, not a list.The reason that  is a list of lists comes from when it is assigned a value from the  function. In the following section, you iterate over the file paths returned by  and open the files:On each open file you're iterating over the individual lines and then splitting each line in the file (which returns a list) and assigning it back to the  variable, which you then append to the  list. This list of lists is then what you return from the function and assign to  in .
I'm not at home so can't experiment at the moment but I believe the problem is the real numbers mixed in with the string. Try converting them to string first then pass them onto whatever function is utilizing them. I ran into this once a few months back and converting ahead of time was the answer.
