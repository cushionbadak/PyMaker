Edited because it seems as though I was too vague or didn't show enough research.  My apologies (newbie here).I am trying to read a csv file and assign each new line as a value to iterate through a script that writes to an API.  There's no header data in my csv.  I'll be adding a regex search and then using the data that follows the regex expression and assign it as a variable to iterate through my script if that makes sense.CSV Contents:Basic premise of what I want to do in Python:Read from CSVScript runs with each line from the CSV as a variable (say Variable1).The script iterates until it is out of values in the csv list, then terminates.An example for the script syntax could be anything simple...until the script runs out of Variables to print, then terminates.  Where I'm struggling is the syntax on how to take a line then assign it to a variable for the for loop.I hope that makes sense!
You should take a look at the csv module.Here's how you would use it:This produces the following output:It separates your lines into lists of strings at the occurrences of the delimiter you specify (a comma in this case).If you want to read the file line by line (not as a CSV), you can just use:Using the with statement makes sure that the file is closed after we are done reading its contents.
