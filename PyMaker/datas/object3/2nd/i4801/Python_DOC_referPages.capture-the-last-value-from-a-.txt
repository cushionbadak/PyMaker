Let's assume we want to have a generator that is recursively yielding values and, as a convenience, we have a sub-iterator that we yield from.How can we capture the last returned value from the sub-iterator, so that we can feed it to the second one?Is this even possible?Here is a possible solution, that drops the use of the yield from:
As we are aware of sub-iterator's length in this case, we can slice it using  till the second last item and then fetch the last item by simply calling  on the remaining slice.Using  you prevent a Python level for-loop:Another way, but something that defeats the purpose of using an iterator is using the extended variable unpacking:
