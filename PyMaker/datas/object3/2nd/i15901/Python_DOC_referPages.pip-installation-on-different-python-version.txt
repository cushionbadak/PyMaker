I encounter a problem with  installation on linux. I've python 2.7 and 3.4, also Django in 1.7 installed. Currently I'm working on a project which uses different versions and I'm unable to install packages trough  on python 2.7. Everything goes to directory of 3.4. Is there any way to "force"  to install packages in concrete version of python?
The usual, and recommended by most users, way of working with Django is to use a separate, virtual environment per project.Use virtualenv to set up your Python 2.x environment and venv for Python 3.x. Both will install their own, local version of pip. Google lists lots of tutorials if you need help beyond the documentation.
