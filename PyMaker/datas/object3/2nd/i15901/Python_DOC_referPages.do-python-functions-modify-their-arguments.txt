I was in my computer science class today and the teacher put a piece of python coding on the board and said he couldn't figure out why it wasn't working. He was showing us functions and said:The code was meant to show how when you don't typein the function then the variable doesn't change when you return to the main program however when he ran the program, the first function added the space and kept it there when it returned resulting in the following text being printed...Please help me out.
You say that the point was to demonstrate that a list won't be changed unless it is returned.  That is false.  The list is a mutable object.  When you pass it (by name) to a function and change it, it will be changed.  If you don't want the change, you need to work with a copy.
might be what you are trying to do ... im not sure, this will not alter either of the original lists, but will return a new list as the result
