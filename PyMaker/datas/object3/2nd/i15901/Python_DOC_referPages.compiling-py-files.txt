I'm trying to compile python source files without success. According to documentation, compileall.compile_dir function has "ddir" parameter, which (I guess) specifies the destination folder for .pyc files. I try to compile it with this script:but it doesn't work. I see output from terminal (compiling, listing etc.) but pyc files are not generated. Anyone can help me understand where pyc files are stored and how to change that default behavior?Thanks
Check  directories. Since Python 3.2, the compiled files are collected in  directories.See PEP 3147: PYC Repository Directories - Whatâ€™s New In Python 3.2.BTW,  is not destination directory. According to the documentation:If ddir is given, it is prepended to the path to each file being  compiled for use in compilation time tracebacks, and is also compiled  in to the byte-code file, where it will be used in tracebacks and  other messages in cases where the source file does not exist at the  time the byte-code file is executed.
