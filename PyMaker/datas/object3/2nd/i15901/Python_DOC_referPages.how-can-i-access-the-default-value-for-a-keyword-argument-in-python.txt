I'm trying to use the  attribute of a function object to get default values for arguments. It works for this case:but for this it doesn't:Why does  contain ? How can I get the default value for the parameter in this case?
You created a function with a keyword-only argument; you cannot use  as a positional argument. Keyword-argument defaults are stored in :Quoting the Callable Types section of the Standard Types hierarchy datamodel documentation:: A dict containing defaults for keyword-only parameters. You should really use the  module  object to introspect callables however; it'll take care of details like these by providing you with a rich object instead:
