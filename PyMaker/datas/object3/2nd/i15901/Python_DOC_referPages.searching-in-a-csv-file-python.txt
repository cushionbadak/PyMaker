I have a csv file containing a lot of songs. Each row has 5 columns, which are:Artist | Song Title | Album Name | Genre | YearI would like to open a CSV file, and then search all the song names to bring up results. Therefore, if I search for 'heaven', I would want one of the results to turn up as "Stairway to Heaven by Led Zeppelin". I am unaware of how to specify specific columns of CSV file when performing a search, and returning the results. I am still new to python so a simple answer would be best, if possibleThank you in advance!
To search for songs, you can use this:Call it like this:
Example of a file named songs.csvLoad data file into a csv.DictReader.
As Kevin said in his comment, you'll want to use the  module for this one.Here are some examples for how to use it.If you want to be able to specify names of columns (and not just their positions), you'll want to take a look at csv.DictReader, which works just like the  used in the examples from my first link, but with dicts (mappings of column names to column values) rather than lists of the column values in order.
