I have created a python calculator, I need to get it to restart, I have added the loop:It keeps saying  and shows, that it wants the indent in front of:but when I add them in, it keeps saying, that the operation is not defined. I also feel like the loop will not work either.
It looks like you are trying to recursively re-run the code, in which case you probably want e.g.You can define functions within other functions (although there's no need here), but remember you need another level of indentation:Note that using recursion means you will eventually hit the system recursion depth limit; iteration is probably wiser:
You may be interested in this solution to your problem. It makes use of the  module, which provides named functions for all the standard Python operators. It also uses a list to translate the operation number to a function and a symbol for printing.output
If you have an empty function, put in the phrase  as in:And that error will no longer occur.
