This question already has an answer here:Initialize List to a variable in a Dictionary inside a loop                    2 answers                Is there a more elegant way to write this code? What I am doing: I have keys and dates. There can be a number of dates assigned to a key and so I am creating a dictionary of lists of dates to represent this. The following code works fine, but I was hoping for a more elegant and Pythonic method. I was expecting the below to work, but I keep getting a NoneType has no attribute append error. This probably has something to do with the fact thatbut why?
 returns , since it is an in-place operation and you are assigning it back to . So, the next time when you do  you are actually doing . That is why it is failing. Instead, you can simply doBut, we have  for this purpose only. You can do something like thisThis will create a new list object, if the  is not found in the dictionary.Note: Since the  will create a new list if the key is not found in the dictionary, this will have unintented side-effects. For example, if you simply want to retrieve a value for the key, which is not there, it will create a new list and return it.
Is there a more elegant way to write this code?Use collections.defaultdict:
 sets    to  as  returns .You should use collections.defaultdict
