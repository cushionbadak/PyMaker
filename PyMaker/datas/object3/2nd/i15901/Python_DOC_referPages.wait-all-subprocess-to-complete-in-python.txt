I have a method which executes a command using subprocess,I want to call that method "n" no of times and wait for all "n" subprocess to complete for example:
You need to store references to the  objects to call  methods of them later.(The code in the question overwrites the  object with the last  object, and waits only the last sub-process.)Other issuesThe code is passing the entire list () instead of item.The last  statement should compare  with .
