I have two arrays: one with 30 years of observations, and one with 30 years of historical model runs. I want to calculate the standard deviation between observations and model results, to see how much the model deviates from observations. How do I go about doing this?EditHere are the two arrays (Each number represents a year(1971-2000)): 
You want to compare two signals, e.g.  and  in the following example:Output:Analyzing individual signalsThe standard deviation of each single signal is not what you need:Output:Analyzing the differenceInstead you might compute the difference and apply some common measure like the sum of absolute differences (SAD), the sum of squared differences (SSD) or the correlation coefficient:Output:
Use numpy.Or you could try this:
If you're doing anything more complicated than just finding the standard deviation and/or mean, use /. If that's all you need to do, use the  package from the Python Standard Library.It was added in Python 3.4 (see PEP-450) as a lightweight alternative to Numpy for basic stats equations.
