Here's what I want to doThe above code won't work, because the coord tuples get passed as , and there is nothing for A workaround that works isBut the first solution looks more elegant to me. Probably I've to add an extra step to split the coord tuple. How do I do that?
You can use tuple-unpacking to call the  constructor:Or for your example:Alternatively, since you are on Python 2, you can also make the lambda accept a tuple:Instead of calling  (which actually returns a generator in Python 3, so your code wouldnâ€™t work there), you can also use a list comprehension to create the Vertex objects:
Just put parentheses around :Edit: it turns out the above won't work in Python 3 (PEP 3113).The following generator expression will work in both Python 2 and 3:
use  along with unpack operator *:also, your  signature is possibly wrong, as I assume it misses  argument:
