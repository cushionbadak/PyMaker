I try the following and it prints 1 with no exception. Is this an expected behaviour for all versions (>2.7) of python?
The documentation for  explicitly states this is expected behaviour:If x is not a number or if base is given, then I must be a string or Unicode object representing an integer literal in radix base. Optionally, the literal can be preceded by + or - (with no space in between) and surrounded by whitespace).Emphasis mine.This is the expected behaviour for Python; the first version where you could pass string to the  function was Python 1.5, and the behaviour has remained unchanged in Python 2 and Python 3.
