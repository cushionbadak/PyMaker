You have two different pythons installed on your machine (3.4.1 and 2.7.5). Do not expect to be able to use one package installed in one python (wxPython 3.0.1.1 at python 2.7.5) automatically to be available in another python.Additionally wxPython (classic) does not work for Python 3. You need wxPython Phoenix to be able to do that.EDIT: The recommended way (by @RobinDunn) to install  (the Phoenix variety which will work on 2.7 and 3, now hosted on PyPI) nowadays is just doing:If you have the developer version installed, just do the following beforehand:You can try to install one of the wxPython Phoenix snapshots in your Python 3.4.1. However, mind that Phoenix is not 1000% compatible with classic and you may experience the one or another hiccup when reusing classic code (but transitioning its doable and worth it).You can find a complete explanation/description in the following wxPython wiki at the following link:Installing wxPython-Phoenix using pipThere are several important points:that / is new enough (> 6.x.x/> 12.x.x)that the builds are "inofficial", and thus  refuses to install it: basically you need to add  when installing with pip.that you waive SSL verification  (no longer needed in modern versions where https now works properly).Full command for Windows machines:Note that this will install wxPython Phoenix for Python 2.7.
To use wxPython with your Python 3.4x you need to use wxPython Phoenix - as others have pointed out.  To install it you can do:Note the space after the last '/' and wxPython_Phoenix
As it seems, wxPython is not yet completely ported for Python 3, even though the version number might suggest that. This is why the wx modules aren't added to the  of Python 3. You can either settle for using wxPython from Python 2.7 or have a look at this SO entry: Still no wxPython for Python 3 (or 3.3) yet? This is what @nepix32 suggested.Alternatively, use another GUI library which works with Python 3. Here is a list. 
Check your sys.path in an interpreter :If you don't have the proper link to the proper directory, it won't work.Also, check Lib/site-packages in your python directory, to make sure wx is properly installed on your python 3. (there should be a directory starting with "wx-3.0")
Perhaps the solutions given earlier worked before. But what worked for me today (June 1, 2017) was:Always check the Readme.txt for this one...
