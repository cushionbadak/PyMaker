I created some functions which return 1 if all went well and 0 if there was an error. Now, I need to execute each of these functions in a defined order and verify the return values. If one of them returns 0, I need to reboot immediately, without invoking any of the subsequent functions.I intended to use multiple s but with one :but it does not work like I want: I want the  part to be executed right after any of these conditions fails, and now it is executed only if  fails.
There are two ways to do this.1). You can use one  statement, and  the conditions together. This will produce "short circuiting" behavior, in that it will continue through the functions until the first one fails, then none of the remaining will execute.2) If you want all to execute, here is a method, though it is more cumbersome.:
It's possible to get the short-circuiting behaviour you want (jumping directly to the  clause as soon as any of your functions return ) in a more compact way with :Let's set up some dummy functions for demonstration purposes:... now, with this code:... we get this output:
You could make a list:then check all of them:This way you're running all the functions (assuming this is a requirement), and checking whether all are true. Assuming all the functions pass:Or if one fails:
