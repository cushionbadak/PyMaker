I'm trying to parse the following feed into ElementTree in python: "http://smarkets.s3.amazonaws.com/oddsfeed.xml" (warning large file)Here is what I have tried so far:but it seems to just hang on , infinitely maybe?? (I know it's a big file, but seems too long compared to other non-compressed feeds I parsed, and this large is killing any bandwidth gains from the gzip compression in the first place).Next I tried , with but noworbut these raise exceptions.What's the proper way to do this? 
The  function takes "a filename or file object containing XML data". You're giving it a string full of XML. It's going to try to open a file whose name is that big chunk of XML. There is probably no such file.You want the  function, or the  constructor.Or, if you prefer, you've already got a file object, ; you could just pass that to  instead of reading it into a string.This is all covered by the short Tutorial in the docs:We can import this data by reading from a file:Or directly from a string:
You can pass the value returned by  directly to  and in turn you can pass it to  methods such as :where  allows to parse files that do not fit in memory.To preserve memory, the constructed xml tree is cleared on each tag element.
