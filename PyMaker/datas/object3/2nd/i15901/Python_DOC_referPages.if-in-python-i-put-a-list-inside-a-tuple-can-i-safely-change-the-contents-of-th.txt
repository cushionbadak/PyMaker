This question already has an answer here:Why can tuples contain mutable items?                    8 answers                The value inside the tuple is simply a reference to a list, and if I change the values in the list everything is still in order, right? I want to make sure that if I do this I won't start running into confusing errors.
Tuples are immutable, you may not change their contents.With a listWith a tupleBut if I understand your question, say you haveYou are allowed to modify the internal lists as
Tuples are immutable - you can't change their structureor sizeafter you create them.On the other hand, mutable objects stored in a tuple do not lose their mutability e.g. you can still modify inner lists using list methods:Tuples can store any kind of object, although tuples that contain lists (or any other mutable objects) are not hashable:The behaviour demonstrated above can indeed lead to confusing errors.
