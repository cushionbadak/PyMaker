 I'm trying to retrieve a Javascript variable using Python and I'm having some issues...Here is what the variable looks like :After some research, I discovered that its content was in the JSON format, and I'm new to it...My problem now is that I would like to retrieve the value of "param3b1" (for example) to use it in my Python program.How do I do this in Python ? Thanks !
Step by step this is what you need to do.extract the json string from the file/html string. you need to get the string between the  tags first, and then the variable definitionextract the parameter from the json string.Here is a demo.
You need to use the JSON module.JSON module documentation : https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html
