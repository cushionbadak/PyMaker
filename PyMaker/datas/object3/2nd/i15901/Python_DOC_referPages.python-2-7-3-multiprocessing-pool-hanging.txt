I have the following code in ipython where the child process tries to do  but causes the parent process to hang. Is this a bug? Any idea how to workaround this?I have also tried to put  instead of  but it was the same thing. The only workaround I know is to put  which turned out to work just fine.I understand that  is essentially the same as , but this exception should be delegated up to its parent process and thus  should be able to receive this exception correct? But it seems to be getting stuck on  call. Is this a bug in  module?
You're causing the  worker process to actually exit when you call . The  exception is special-cased; when you raise it, the process you raised it in exits. The exception doesn't get propagated to the caller. So, that means that in your example, the worker process simply never returns anything back to the parent. And then the parent process will just wait around forever for the child to return something that's never going to get returned. See this question for a more in-depth discussion of that behavior.I would argue that this is a bug, and that when the sub-process exits, the  should be marked as broken, and all outstanding tasks should be aborted. This is how  behaves already. I've actually submitted a patch that adds this behavior to , but so far it hasn't been reviewed.Now, back to your original question. It looks like you want the parent process to exit here, not just the child. To do that, you'll need to actually return some object back to the parent, and then have the parent exit when it receives that object. It looks like you've discovered you can do this by simply raising an .
