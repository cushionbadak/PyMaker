I've reduced my problem to the following toy file and command:^ results in a segfault in a call directly within .I'm on an AMD64 Linux machine running Python 2.7. What am I doing wrong?EDITTo lend weight to how the pointers don't matter, a second example that segfaults:
CFUNCTYPE is used for callbacks (or pointers to functions defined as a variable in the shared object). After you do  you should simply be able to call  functions on the returned library object directly. So something like this should work:Method  is generally used to access variables that are exported from shared objects. Not functions themselves. An example of using  would be something like this:File a.c:Python script:More on the usage of ctypes can found in the Python Documentation
