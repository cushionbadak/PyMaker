Recently I have been learning about classes and inheritance etc. With classes how are we suppose to inherit other traits from classes other from . So from here how do I get data or traits from the "Parent Class". Because that's what OOP is about right? Getting stuff from the upper class? If you didn't want to do this why not just code without OOP. I say this because I see people who wouldn't really try get anything out of the parent class, they are just related in "outcome" or "goal".
The point of classes is that they encapsulate data and the methods that operate on that data. Classes can be extended and the child class will inherit the attributes of its parent. This is one specific feature of classes and OO programming - 'inheritance'.To access an overridden method in the parent class in Python you use the  syntax. If an attribute is not overridden it can be accessed with . I think this is what you're asking.
