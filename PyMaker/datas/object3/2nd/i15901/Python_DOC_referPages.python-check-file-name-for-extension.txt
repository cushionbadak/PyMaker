This question already has an answer here:Checking file extension                    10 answers                Is there a way in Python to check a file name to see if its extension is included in the name?  My current workaround is to simply check if the name contains a . in it, and add an extension if it doesn't...this obviously won't catch files with . but no extension in the name (ie. 12.10.13_file).  Anyone have any ideas?
'12.10.13_file' as a filename, does have '13_file' as it's file extension. At least regarding the file system. But, instead of finding the last . yourself, use os.path.splitext:If you want to exclude certain extensions, you could blacklist those after you've used the above.
You can use  via https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-magic to determine "file types."  It's not 100% perfect, but a whole lot of files can be accurately classified this way, and then you can decide your own rules, such as  for text files,  for PDFs, etc.Don't think in terms of finding files with or without extensions--think of it in terms of classifying your files based on their content, ignoring their current names.
