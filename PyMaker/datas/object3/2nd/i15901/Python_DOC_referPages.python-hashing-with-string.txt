Natural Text
I am trying to make a function that takes a string(key) and returns the slot number the hash table.Such that:    The function needs to convert each letter of the string to number form using alphabet position(eg. a=1, b= 2, c=3, etc). So the hash will be: John = 10+15+8+14= 47 -----> = 47 % tablesize(13) 
You can convert the string to lowercase with  function and iterate through the characters in the word, with a  loop, like thisThen, you can get the character code corresponding to the character with  function.Since we need to get the offset of the character in the alphabets, you can subtract the first value from the current value. Then finally, you can use modulo operator  to get the remainder of the division by The same can be written succintly with a generator expression and built-in  function, like this
Use  function and substract the ascii offset (a letter is 97 code, b is 98, and so on)
