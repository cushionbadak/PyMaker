I am using a brute force tactic to finding the answer solution to my problem. The idea is I loop through 3 different ranges, e.g. a nested loop, in increments of 10 to significantly decrease the number of combinations.I then take the three solutions given to me in my first function, to redefine the looping range parameter for my function that will yield a more precise solution.This is my code:The error message I get is:Essentially, I just need to pass nc_f, c_f, and cd_f from my t1_solve() to my t1_finetune(). Running t1_solve() on its own works fine, and when it gets called in t1_finetune(), it still works up until it goes on to the rest of the code where I commented the error occurence.I hope this is clear, please let me know if there is anything I can clarify.Thanks in advance!
First, your  function has three  statements instead of one. As soon as the first one is reached, the function is over, and the other ones never happen. So, you need this:Next, when you call  and it returns those values to you, you just ignore the results. You need to store them somewhere. For example:For an intuitive understanding, what you're doing here is returning three values instead of one, and assigning those three return values to three variables.If you want to know what's actually happening: The first  creates a single 3-element tuple and returns that one tuple. Then, the later  uses iterable assignment unpacking. See the tutorial section Tuples and Sequences for a nice introduction.
