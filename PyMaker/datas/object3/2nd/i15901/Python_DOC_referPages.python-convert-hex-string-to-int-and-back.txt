My python script gets and sends words over a serial line.Each word is a signed 24-bit value, received as hex string.The script should now take these strings and convert them to integers, do some calculations on it, and send them back in the same format.My problem is, how to do this conversionHow can this be done?
Test results:Reference: Hex string to signed int in Python 3.2?
(Edit: An oversight on my part. See Rob's answer for correctly covering the negative sign numbers)If you just want to convert a hex string into an int, do e.g.:The reverse can be done with the  function. From the help page:Help on built-in function hex in module builtins:It should be trivial to remove or add the '0x' if it's missing in your data stream.Here's an example to ensure padding to 6 chars (representing 3 bytes = 24 bits):If you get the data in 3 byte form (24 bits), you can use  and  as described in the Python docs. This is new in Python 3.2.
