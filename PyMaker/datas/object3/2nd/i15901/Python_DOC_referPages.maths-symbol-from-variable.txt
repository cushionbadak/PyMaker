I have a challenge at school, but i am stuck with a small bit of my code.Here's what I have; what I'm missing is how to finish the  line:The variables ,  and  are randomly generated,  and  are both integers, and  is either , ,  or  I was wondering how to use these to get an answer to an equation. For example,  is ,  is , and  is . How would I use the variables to get the answer ?
The clean way to do this is to create a mapping from symbols to functions.The only question is, what is the function behind the  operator?The answer is in the  module:  is , and so on. So:I'm assuming here that you want  to be , not . If I'm wrong, use  instead of  above. (See Numbers in the tutorial for an introduction to the difference, with links to more details.)Anyway, now, you can do this:Even if you didn't have , you could always build a function for each operator:This may come in handy if you want to extend your language to a symbol that doesn't have a matching operator in Python.If your maths language is a strict subset of Python's expression language (which it may not beâ€”notice that the symbol  maps to the Python operator  if you want integers), and you're sure that you're never going to extend it in a way that isn't (e.g., using  for exponentiation), and you're sure that you will never be using any numbers or symbols that you didn't generate yourself, it may be simpler to just build a Python expression and  it:However, you should always be careful about using ; if the clean thing to do is simple enough for you to write, and to read and understand later, it's almost always a better answer.
I think the best way is creating conditonals and check the symbol..
