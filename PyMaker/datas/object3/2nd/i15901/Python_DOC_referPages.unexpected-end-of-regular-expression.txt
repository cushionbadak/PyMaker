I want to get only the file name with extension from the path:The statement below,gives error: unexpected end of regular expressionI am using python 3.3.2
You need to double the doubled escapes again, or use a raw string instead:orotherwise first Python, then the regular expression compiler will interpret those backslashes, resulting in the  being escaped:Also see the Blackslash Plague section of the Python Regex HOWTO.Next, you need to be aware that  anchors to the start of the string. You'll probably want to use  instead here. See the  vs.  section:The  function only checks if the RE matches at the beginning of the string while  will scan forward through the string for a match. Itâ€™s important to keep this distinction in mind.You may also want to escape the  in the  part;  matches any character, so  would also match; the  would satisfy the  pattern.The  and  functions return a match object, not the matched part of the string. You'll have to extract that part explicitly:Demo:
It is because you don't use a raw string. The double backslash is interpreted as an escape for the closing square bracket. You need to write:with the raw string format  is seen as a literal backslash as expected.
