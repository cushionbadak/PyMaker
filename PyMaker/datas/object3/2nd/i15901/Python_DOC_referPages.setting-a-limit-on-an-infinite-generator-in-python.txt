I'm trying to make the below generator to be able to set an upper limit on the numbers returned.Calling  returns a list of all primes under 100 as expected but  (which should return the same list in the same way) just returns with an empty list.Obviously, I could include an  in the  loop but I'm mostly interested in why the  construct doesn't work like I'm expecting it should. Shouldn't it just return the same  iterator that works above? What am I overlooking here?
Here:Since this is a generator, it needs to  these values instead of ing them. Depending on your Python version, you might be able to use the  syntax.The following might be useful as background reading: Return in generator together with yield in Python 3.3
The problem is with the line Since it's a generator, returning something stops the execution, and raises StopIteration(). You need to return the values in generator
