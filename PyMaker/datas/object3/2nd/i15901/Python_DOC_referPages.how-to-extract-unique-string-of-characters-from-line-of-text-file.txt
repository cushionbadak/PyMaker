Natural Text
I have a big text file who's lines are composed in this format:For each line, I want to be able to extract only the varying sequences of agtc while removing the other character (query, sbjct and varying numbers) so that the final string would look like thisI've been working on this for awhile and can't get it to work. I've tried the re module and  but to not results. I am programming in python 3.4. Thank you!
While you could use regular expressions (like you have attempted) the example your provide can be easily split up by using This splits a given line into a list of strings where the delimiter is a space. Indexing starts from 0, so the part with  in is indexed by 2.Note that calling  without explicitly passing in an argument indicating the character to split on not only splits on a space character, but will also group sequential spaces together rather than splitting on each one. This is important in your case because you have a different number of white space characters between the number and the agct string.Example:
