This question already has an answer here:How do you split a list into evenly sized chunks?                    57 answers                I have a list of different things and I was wondering how to split it every time it hits a new name? So what I would like to have is have it take a list that looks like this:and it will create 3 lists:I am guessing it would be something along the lines of a loop that repeats a new list until it hits a non integer, but I really dont know how it would look set up.
Try this, assuming that new names appear every four elements as in the sample input:The above will return a list of sublists, split every four elements. If you're certain that there will be exactly twelve elements in the input list, it's possible to directly assign the resulting sublists:Now each variable will contain the expected result:
For checking if a String is a number (and don't forget to include quotation marks if you're going to use that code exactly), look at str.isdigit().I.e.
This may not be the prettiest solution but it's able to respond when the delimiter size changes (say you want to track another number between corn and broccoli) and also allows it to grow beyond a set of three lists if you want.At the end,  is equal to:...and it unpacks into the three lists as shown above.
This is hideous but will get the job done for ya. 
There are two problems in the single line of code that you postedit's likely that you want to use strings rather than generic objectsin your list is a  function that creates a list from a sequence oran iterable and deserves to be let on its own, so we name your listWhat follows is based on a single assumption, that you want to split on each string and only on stringsSomeone will object that the test  will fail for objects that are subclassed from str, or that quacks like a str, but I assume that you have 'nuff stuff to think about already...
