I have a stream of data something like, and i have to get no. of occurrence of all words in the list from the stream So, result would be something like with my current implementation, I am iterating through the list of words and add them to dict as below,I am looking for some better way to do it, as list of words keep on increasing and data from stream in continuous.This is what I have currently,Thanks
So I played around a bit with a trie-based approach to your problem (now that I understand what you want). Maybe you can find something useful in it. There is an initial idea, an abstract interface slapped around that idea, to help looking for more efficient solutions, and a few pytest tests to help understand whether/how it works. There are trie modules out there, but this seemed like more fun, for now.

I got it working and have tried to cover all know corner cases, will be really thankful if you can propose some suggestions/improvements, Thanks for help, and sorry for initial incomplete question.
Here's my take on it. Takes O(k) time per character, or O(nk) for the whole stream, where k is the length of the word and n is length of the stream; and O(k) space.And here are some tests:
