I'm trying to find a way to write regex which match any 5 digit numbers in string, except those, which are followed by slash.I can't figure out why this RE doesn't work:EXAMPLE Have you any idea?
Try this.This Works.See demo.Your regex does not start or end with 0 width assertions.So it actually needs 1 charcter before and 2 ahead.http://regex101.com/r/yA5iD9/16
You could try the below regex,DEMOEXplanation: Match wouldn't be preceded by a digit. Exactly 5 digits. Must be followed by a  non-digit or  or end of the line anchor.Code:
The reason your regex is not working is due to the s. I don't know why you put them in. Another problem is that  will not match the end of the string, so use  instead.The following works:
Since you want to find numbers that are on their own, i.e. not preceeded by another number, not followed by another number, and also not followed by a slash, we are going to use negative look-aheads and look-behinds to ensure this:This will match a  if it is not preceeded by another  (i.e. no number is before it), and it is also not followed by another  or a .Using that on your examples yields the desired results:
