I have a c# background and I am trying to pass a dictionary in method and some some I want to check if a specific key exists or not. If that key exists in dictionary and then I want to perform few other things.Let suppose if have following dictionary:and I want to check whether key 'sape' exists or not? In method somehow, I do not know the type of argument. How can I cast to dictionary in order to  retrieve keys and values.In method I want to check:However, in method, I do not have information about the type of passed argument.
Few things to note about Python:Python is not statically typed like C#. The function/method signature doesn't contain the data types of the parameters. So you do not need to cast the passed in value to a dictionary. Instead you assume that what is passed in is a dictionary and work on it. If you expect that something other than dictionary will be passed you can either use exception handling to catch any issues or you can use isinstance to check what is passed in is what you expect. Having said that casting does exist in python; for example you can convert an int 1 to a string by str(1).Also note that if use the  keyword it will work for any iterable not just dictionary.Example:If you really want to check if something is a dictionary you can do like this:
