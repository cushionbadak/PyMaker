I have a script which takes in some arguments, uses some of those argument to choose a script to run, and passes the rest of the arguments to that script. So it looks something like this:This works fine, unless I want to pass in arguments that start with . For example, if I called , I'd get an error , when really I want to just have it run  (i.e. just pass the  along to the subprocess).Is there a way to get around this with ?
Perhaps you are looking for parse_known_args. It will parse all the options it recognizes, and returns all the unrecognized arguments in :
I discovered the function , which provides a solution to this, albeit perhaps not ideal.What this does is use  to parse what's known, and collect the rest in a list. Then those remaining arguments can be passed to the subprocess as desired.
The  works if you include  in the argument list:An alternative is to use  ('...') instead of '*':Both the '--' and REMAINDER mean: 'treat what follows as positional arguments'. also works, though its logic is different - 'just return a list of the strings you didn't recognize'.   calls  and raises an error is the  value is not empty.But don't use  as the first positional argument:  Using argparse.REMAINDER at beginning of parser / sub parser
