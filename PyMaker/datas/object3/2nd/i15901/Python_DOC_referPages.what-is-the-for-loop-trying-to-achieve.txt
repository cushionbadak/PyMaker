This probably is very simple but can someone explain what the below is meant to achieve?It is called from In the  loop are the variables  and  assigned to  and  respectively and a  is performed on the value field? Followed by the other two sets in  loop.
It loops through the tuple of tuples , and "unpacks"  and  as the 1st and 2nd element in the tuple respectively. Then it does a replace, so ultimately replacing  with  etc
The first code will assign  to  and  to , and next items in next iteration (tuple unpacking).Inside the loop  return a new string that replaced all occurrence of  with . So it is meant to be there to replace  with ,  with ,  with .But, NO. It does not because  returns a new string, and does not replace the string inplace.To be correct, it should assign back the return value. And the method should return the replaced string.BTW, here's more efficient way to do it.You can use .In Python 2.x, with :In python 3.x:The second codeThe second part is  with generator expression:This is getting ,  values from fetched rows to make a new dictionary.With the fixed version of , it will result in something like:with dictionary comprehension:
