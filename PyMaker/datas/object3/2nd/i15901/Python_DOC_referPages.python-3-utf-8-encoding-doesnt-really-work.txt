I have read a lot now on the topic of UTF-8 encoding in Python 3 but it still doesn't work, and I can't find my mistake.My code looks like thisMy  file looks like thisAnd I get the following error:
Your file is not UTF-8 encoded. I'm not sure what encoding uses F6 for  either; that codepoint is the encoding for  in Latin 1 and CP-1252:You'll need to save that file as UTF-8 instead, with whatever tool you used to create that file.If  works, then you were able to decode the file using the default system encoding. See the  function documentation:encoding is the name of the encoding used to decode or encode the file. This should only be used in text mode. The default encoding is platform dependent (whatever  returns), but any encoding supported by Python can be used. That is not to say that you were reading the file using the correct encoding; that just means that the default encoding didn't break (encountered bytes for which it doesn't have a character mapping). It could still be mapping those bytes to the wrong characters.I urge you to read up on Unicode and Python:The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!) by Joel SpolskyThe Python Unicode HOWTOPragmatic Unicode by Ned Batchelder
