I wrote 3 Questions and I want to use Random Randint to pick and display one by one randomly. I don't know how to use Random Randint to use that in my Code. 
You wouldn't use  at all. You'd use  instead:The function picks one element at random from a sequence.If you need to produce questions at random without repetition, you want to do something different; you would use  to randomize the whole list of questions, then just pick one from that list (perhaps removing it from the list) every time you need a new question. That produces a random sequence of questions.or
Don't use , use . This function will select a random item from a list.
If you need to use  because of an assignment, you can look at how  works. Slightly simplified, it's this:And  is just "an alias for ".So, you know how to use  from Martijn Pieter's answer, you know what  does, you should be able to figure out from there how to use  from there.
If "you want to pick with replacement (that is, each time there's a 1/3 chance of each)":"without replacement (that is, each one only shows up once, so after 3 choices there's nothing left)":"or some hybrid (e.g., pick all 3 in random order, then repeat all 3 in random order again, etc.":
