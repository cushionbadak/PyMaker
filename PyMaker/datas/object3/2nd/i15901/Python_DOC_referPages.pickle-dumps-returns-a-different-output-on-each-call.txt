I have a simple python script which pickles an object and prints it.Following are the outputs I get when i execute the same script multiple times:Is it just a difference in ordering of the properties of the object or is there more to it?
In Python 3, dictionary order is dependent on hash randomisation. Each time you start your interpreter, a different, random hash seed is used. If you were to print the dictionary, you'd see the different ordering too:Python uses a random seed to prevent certain types of Denial of Service attacks against programs parsing incoming user data into dictionaries, such as web servers; such an attack could otherwise predict when two strings would cause a hash collision in a dictionary and feed Python values that do nothing but create collisions, slowing down a Python program to a crawl.You can set the seed to a fixed value with the  environment variable, or you can disable hash randomisation altogether:The integer must be a decimal number in the range [0,4294967295]. Specifying the value 0 will disable hash randomization.Also see: Why is the order in dictionaries and sets arbitrary?
