Most basically open a terminal with Ctrl-Alt-t and type . That will work but there is a better way, which I'll explain.When you're developing a web app you will eventually want to deploy it. You'll want the environment on which you're developing to be as similar to the one on which you deploy as possible. One way to do this is virtual environments. On Ubuntu you also have the option of Docker.Virtual environments are probably slightly easier if you're just starting out but I would recommend building up to Docker, which is more complete IMO. If you're using Python 3 then you should use pyvenv to create your virtual environments. On Python 2 you want virtualenv. These will create an isolated Python environment specific to the project they contain, which means you can have many custom setups for many projects, and you can recreate these relatively easily when deploying to production. When the environment is active you can install python packages with .
