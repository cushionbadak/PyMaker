I am using Centos 7.0 and PyDEv in Eclipse. I am trying to pass the variable in Python into c shell script. But I am getting error:This is my Python script named raw2waveconvert.pyOutput/Error when I run the Python script:The file test1.csh contains:
Okey, so apparently it's not so easy to find a nice and clear duplicate. This is how it's usually done. You either pass the value as an argument to the script, or via an environmental variable.The following example shows both ways in action. Of course you can drop whatever you don't like.This is corresponding bash script, but from what I've read addressing command line variables is the same, so it should work for both  and  set as default shells.:Test:Please note that the python interpreter needs to have appropriate access to the called script. In this case  needs to be executable for the user . Otherwise, you will get  error.I also urge to read docs on . Many other materials use , I won't discuss it, but I dislike and discourage it. The presented examples should work and be safe.

The only way to do what you want here is to export/pass the variable value through the shell environment. Which requires using the  dictionary argument.But it is more likely that what you should do is pass arguments to your script instead of assuming pre-existing variables. Then you would stick  in the array argument to  (probably better to use  unless you know the script is supposed to fail) and then use /etc. as normal.
