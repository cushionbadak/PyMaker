Just a part of learning Python tricks and best practices.
you can access to end of a string with  index : 
For an application like this, you should probably use  ( in Python 2) No need to manually manage the slashs.For file paths,  is an analogous function.
For a difficult-to-read one-liner, you could do this: - This part sets the url to a string by default if it's false, null, empty list, etc... - This part is an index lookup that should have a value of  if the url does not end in a string and  if it does. - Based on the value of the previously mentioned index lookup, we will append either a slash or an empty string to the end of
