I don't want to be a bother, and I probably shouldn't be trying to even manipulate a programming language I know nothing about. But the deployment method this presents is too irresistible not to use. Basically urbackup has this script designed to automatically pull a downloader for a specific computer using its WMI %ComputerName% property. The issue I seem to be having is related to JSON not being able to authenticate with server any more after Python 3.4. I honestly know very little about Python, and if it is too complex for me to fix or would require more work than necessary I understand that, I just figured maybe its a simpler error that can be corrected by someone with a bit of know how. The error it is outputting looks like this (I've removed applicable server names).I've tried using different things talking about using different JSON methods that don't involve the decode variable, and using json.dump instead, but they all seem to lead to different errors because I don't know which parts of the code correspond to the parts of the code I'd be changing. This is really just a quality of life tool, and isn't absolutely necessary. But it would be comforting to simply convert this into an MSI I could deploy instead of having to manually one by one go to each of our (over 100) computers and manually do this. Any help would be appreciated :).Here is the log in javascript from the back end of the server.
Could you try changing line 86 to readI don't know what readall() is but it's not listed in the docs for the HTTPResponse object
