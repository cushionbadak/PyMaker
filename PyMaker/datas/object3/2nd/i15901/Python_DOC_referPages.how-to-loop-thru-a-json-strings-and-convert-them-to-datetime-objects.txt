Natural Text
I have a json file with the following content, and I want to convert its string values to date time object:["2014-01-20 00:01:31", "2014-01-20 00:01:51", "2014-01-20 00:02:12"]I think I need to create a for loop and iterate through the string values and convert them using strptime method. I'm not sure how to create the for loop so it correctly iterates through the string values. I think it should look as follows:Any help would be appreciated. 
In Python for loop can iterate over elements of any type (and most containers, notably , can contain elements of different types). It just takes element after element and binds it to name used in  statement:
Your loop is fine but if you want a list of datetime objects  use a : will remove the newline chars
