I understand that I should use  or  in Python for 'secure' pseudo-random numbers.But how does Python generate these random numbers logically? Also is there a way to generate a number in Python that is 'more random' than others?
For "secure" random numbers, Python doesn't actually generate them:  it gets them from the operating system, which has a special driver that gathers entropy from various real-world sources, such as variations in timing between keystrokes and disk seeks.
