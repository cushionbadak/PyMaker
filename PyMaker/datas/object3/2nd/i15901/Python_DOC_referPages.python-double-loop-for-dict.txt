As already explained in the comments, the problem is that a csv reader is an iterator, thus it will be exhausted once you have iterated it once, i.e. the outer loop will end after the first pass of the inner loop.To fix this, you could create a new reader in each iteration of the inner loop, but instead I suggest using  to get each combination of users.Note that you need to call  just once; that second call in your code was necessary only because the first item was already consumed by the outer loop. Also, while my version is true to your "how it should look" example, you might instead want to use .
