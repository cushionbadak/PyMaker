What are invalid values for the  function? I mean which arguments make it throw exceptions?As far as I know any custom data structure is  and empty list, empty strings etc. are false. So are there any values for  arguments that make it return other than "True" or "False"?
No,  can only return  or . All values in Python have boolean meaning.If the value is not an empty container, numeric 0,  or ,  returns .Note that  will use the ,  (Python 2) and  (Python 3) special methods if present; if these throw an exception  will not catch it.
