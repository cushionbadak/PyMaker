Natural Text
I am working in Python 3.3.2. right now I am trying to create a list of lists from a txt file. For example:I have a txt file with this data: I want python to generate a list of lists from this txt file, so I need the data to look like this: What must I do?Thanks for your attention!
I'd encourage use of the  statement in new programmers, it's a good habit to get into.Depending on the size of the file, you could also instead of using the  list, modify it to use the  keyword.
This is a case where I think  is more readable, although having to wrap that in a call to  in Python 3.x detracts from it.
This might do:
