I am looking to take a list that contains data in it and append it so that it will save next time i execute the code. So far i have this that works, but when i execute the code again it does not include the new data that was entered. Any suggestions?

If you mean to save data across executions, everything in memory of the "live" program gets discarded at the end of execution, so you must save data to a file (or some other persistent medium), then read it back in.You can save to a file as simple strings, or you can use  to easily serialize objects like lists.Using simple stringsWrap your program with code to load and save data to a file:Of course, you have to do some work to prevent having duplicates in  if they must not appear.Using pickle
