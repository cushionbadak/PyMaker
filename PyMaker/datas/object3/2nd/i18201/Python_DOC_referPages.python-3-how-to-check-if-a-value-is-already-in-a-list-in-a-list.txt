I have a list of lists in my Python 3:(x is just some data)I have my code wich does that:now i want to add an entry, if there is any sublistentry ==aHow can I do that?
Use  to test the sublists:This tests each  but exits the generator expression loop early if a match is found.This does not, however, return the specific sublist that matched. You could use  with a generator expression to find the first match:where  is a default returned if the generator expression raises a  exception, or you can omit the default and use exception handling instead:
You could use  with list comprehensions (well, generator comprehensions here):
