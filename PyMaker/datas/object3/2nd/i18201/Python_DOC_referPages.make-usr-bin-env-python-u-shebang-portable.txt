I'd use the following:The line  will be parsed by  as , because it consists of an empty  string followed by . Since  is a no-op command, it will be effectively ignored, and the following line will execute the Python interpreter.On the other hand, Python will parse the  line very differently, as the opening of a triple-quoted string which starts with  and is closed two lines below. Since the string is not used for anything, the Python interpreter will effectively ignore the shell snippet that starts up Python. It is the difference in interpretation of  that allows Python and  code coexist in the same script.For a simple test, append something like:Given a reasonable  implementation (and taking into account the time to start Python), this should not be measurably slower than using .
