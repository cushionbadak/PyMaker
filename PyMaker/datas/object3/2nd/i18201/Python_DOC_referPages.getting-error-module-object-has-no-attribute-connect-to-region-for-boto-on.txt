I am learning how to use the boto module with python and AWSwhen i am trying to run the follow code:I keep geting the follow error:I am subscribed to the AWS service,I am using the pycharm as an IDE and have the boto.cfg file configured correctly
From this line of the traceback:You apparently haven't actually installed , you've just copied its source code into your project. That's now how you use packages in Python. See Installing Python Modules in the Python docs, Installing Boto in the Boto docs, and Quickstart in the  docs.Orâ€¦ I believe PyCharm has built-in GUI functionality for managing your installed site-packages, and building virtual environments and managing their installed packages, so you don't even have to learn how to use  or  files if you don't want to.
