Here is my  class:And when I'm trying to run the  function:I'm getting the following error:How can I fix that?
If I had to guess, you did this:at the top of your code.  This means that you have to do this:to access the  method.  Or, you could change the import statement to this:and access it as you are.The people who made the  module also named their class :
Use the correct call:  is a classmethod of the  class, it's not a function in the  module.As mentioned by Jon Clements in the comments, some people do , which would bind the  name to the  class, and make your initial code work.To identify which case you're facing (in the future), look at your import statements: that's the module (that's what you have right now).: that's the class.
