Natural Text
I try the following code:but the resulting string I get is (when cost = 100.00 and provision = 4.00)So  is working perfectly (looked it up in here) but for some odd reason these apostrophes appeared around the values.this doesn't happen in my next line of code:which gives me As you can see, no apostrophes, why is that? Can you advise me how to remove them? I have tried adding  to my string, but it didn't help.
Do not use  here; it introduces the quotes because you are asking for the Python literal form of the strings. The  is entirely redundant too as that is the default. Grouping the format strings in parenthesis would do what you want:or justifying before interpolating:You perhaps would do better studying  and use that to format and justify your text:Here the  and  right-justify the value in a field 24 and 18 characters wide (the latter is 17 + the extra space  adds when printing multiple arguments):
That's what  does, though: shows a representation of the actual object. In this case, the object is the string composed of  etc.I have no idea why you would use  here at all, especially when you're not doing so in the next, correct, line. It should just be:
Why that double formatting (i. e. using  first and then again using )?  You can do that in one step, that's what it is meant for:This is probably what you want.
