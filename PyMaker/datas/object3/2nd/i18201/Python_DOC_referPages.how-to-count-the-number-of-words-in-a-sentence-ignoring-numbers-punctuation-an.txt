Natural Text
How would I go about counting the words in a sentence? I'm using Python.For example, I might have the string: That would be 7 words. I'm having trouble with the random amount of spaces after/before each word as well as when numbers or symbols are involved. 
 without any arguments splits on runs of whitespace characters:From the linked documentation:If sep is not specified or is , a different splitting algorithm is applied: runs of consecutive whitespace are regarded as a single separator, and the result will contain no empty strings at the start or end if the string has leading or trailing whitespace.
You can use :
This is a simple word counter using regex. The script includes a loop which you can terminate it when you're done.
The statement above will go through each chunk of text and remove punctuations before verifying if the chunk is really string of alphabets. 
Ok here is my version of doing this. I noticed that you want your output to be , which means you dont want to count special characters and numbers. So here is regex pattern:Where  means it will match any character beetwen  (lowercase) and  (upper case). About spaces. If you want to remove all extra spaces, just do:
output is 8
How about using a simple loop to count the occurrences of number of spaces!?
