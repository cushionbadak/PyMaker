I read the django doc and some SO posts to know the differences between  manage.py and django-admin.py.They all say:manage.py is automatically created in each Django project. manage.py  is a thin wrapper around django-admin.py that takes care of two things  for you before delegating to django-admin.py:It puts your project’s package on sys.path. It sets the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable so that it points to  your project’s settings.py file.So I checked the scource code of these 2 files(latest version, so it the doc).Then I am confused.  does the second thing: sets the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable.

And where is the code that puts the project’s package on sys.path?

From what I can see it's not  who "puts your project’s package on sys.path."The doc says:sys.path is initialized from these locations:The directory containing the input script (or the current directory when no file is specified).PYTHONPATH (a list of directory names, with the same syntax as the shell variable PATH).The installation-dependent default.The installation-dependent default must be what  adds. But it can be disabled with  switch. Now then when I run this script ():I get:So, when you run ,  will be the first on the . And when , .As such, one can probably say that  "puts your project’s package on sys.path," but indirectly, by being at the root of your project.
