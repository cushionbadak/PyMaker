Adding the prefix "b" to a string converts it to bytes:But I can't figure out how to do this with a variable. Assuming , none of these seem to work:Is there a simple way to do this?
In Python3:Bytes literals are always prefixed with 'b' or 'B'; they produce an  instance of the bytes type instead of the str type. They may only  contain ASCII characters; bytes with a numeric value of 128 or greater  must be expressed with escapes.In Python2:A prefix of 'b' or 'B' is ignored in Python 2; it indicates that the  literal should become a bytes literal in Python 3.More about bytes():bytes([source[, encoding[, errors]]])Return a new “bytes” object, which is an immutable sequence of  integers in the range 0 <= x < 256. bytes is an immutable version of  bytearray – it has the same non-mutating methods and the same indexing  and slicing behavior.Accordingly, constructor arguments are interpreted as for bytearray().Bytes objects can also be created with literals, see String and Bytes  literals.
Use :
where 'string' is your variable. 
Or use the  method to convert to  (using a given encoding):The opposite conversion is  to convert a  to :
