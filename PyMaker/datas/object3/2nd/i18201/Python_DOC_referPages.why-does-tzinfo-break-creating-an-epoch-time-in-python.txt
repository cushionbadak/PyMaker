Both seem very "No DST-ish".Just not thrilled with the workaround.Update:After reading some docs (http://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html#time.mktime)  It appears   outputs "localtime" not UTC as I had thought.  Which confuses everything.
 is not supported by Python. Do not use it.On systems where it works, it interprets the datetime object as time in local timezone i.e.,  might return value near .To find out utc offset or whether DST is in effect for a given local time, you could call ,  where  is a datetime object with pytz timezone.As expected UTC offset is zero for UTC timezone and there is no DST transitions so  is always zero all year round.
