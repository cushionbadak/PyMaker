Is there an easy way to compute the element-wise sum of N lists in python? I know if we have n lists defined (call the ith list ), we can do:For example:Here But what if we don't have  defined and instead have  in a list ? Is there a similar way to find  if we just have ?I hope this is clear.resolved: I was wondering what the * operator was all about...thanks!
Just do this:In the above,  is the list of . As explained in the link in the comments (thanks, @kevinsa5!): is the "splat" operator: It takes a list as input, and expands it into actual positional arguments in the function call.For additional details, take a look at the documentation, under "unpacking argument lists" and also read about calls (thanks, @abarnert!)
This isn't all that different from Óscar López's answer, but uses  instead of a list comprehension.
