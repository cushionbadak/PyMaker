I am trying to write a math quiz program for my Python class, but I keep getting an error with the  function. The error is:Here is my code:Error:
The problem is that, at the time you call , you haven't yet defined .So, why isn't this a ? Because there's already a builtin named , so you're calling that. And that function requires an iterable of values, not two separate values. (If you don't know what an iterable is: It's something you can loop over in a  loop, like a list.) So, it looks at your first argument—a random integer—and tries to use it as an iterable. And that's why you get that error.If you move your definition up above the call to , your code will work. However, it will still be a source of confusion. This is one reason it's better to avoid giving your functions the same name as any of the builtins.As a side note, the function you're defining already exists, as . The reason  and friends are tucked away in the  module is that you usually don't need them. If you just want to add two numbers,  is always clearer than . You only need it as a separate function when you need to pass that function around (e.g., to use as an argument to ).
 is already a builtin function!Usage: In your code:
Place the sum function on the top of main function.ex:Then call the main function.
The problem is that a int can't be an iterator in sum build in function , you need to make it a list :
