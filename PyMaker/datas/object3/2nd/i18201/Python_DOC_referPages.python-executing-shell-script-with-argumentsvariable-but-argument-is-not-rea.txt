I am trying to execute a shell script(not command) from python:var1 and var2 are some string that I am using as an input to shell script. Am I missing something or is there another way to do it?Referred: How to use subprocess popen Python
The problem is with . Either remove that argument, or pass all arguments as a string, as follows:The shell will only pass the arguments you provide in the 1st argument of  to the process, as it does the interpretation of arguments itself.See a similar question answered here. What actually happens is your shell script gets no arguments, so $1 and $2 are empty.Popen will inherit stdout and stderr from the python script, so usually there's no need to provide the  and  arguments to Popen (unless you run the script with output redirection, such as ). You should do this only if you need to read the output inside the python script, and manipulate it somehow.If all you need is to get the output (and don't mind running synchronously), I'd recommend trying , as it is easier to get output than :Notice that  and  have the same rules for the  argument as .
you actually are sending the arguments ... if your shell script wrote a file instead of printing you would see it.  you need to communicate to see your printed output from the script ...
