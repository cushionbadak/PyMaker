I have thousands of lists inside one list. Each of the thousands of lists contain [name, gender, age] with the name and gender being a str and age being an int.I want to sort all of the lists by age is descending order. How would i go about this?
 allows you to specify a key which is essentially something that is used for every item in the list when sorting the list. That key is a function that takes the item as its argument. By default, it is the identity, so it always returns the original object, but you can easily change that by specifying a different function.In your case, you will want to return the 3rd item in the inner list:Note that this won’t specify a good ordering when ages are not unique (they are usually not). As such, you might want to specify a second order, for example using the name:To get a descending order, you will have to further set  in the sort-call:Note, that doing this will also affect the order of the name, so you would get a descending age and name. If you don’t want that, you could sort the list twice (separately; name first, and then age descending), or you could trick a bit: You could assume that no living person will ever get older than 200—or say 1000 to be super safe—So you could sort ascending by  to get a descending sort on :
