I'm trying to get a redirected url from another url without using a selenium object. I have an url like:and it gets redirected to:when is opened by some browser.I want to avoid instancing a Selenium object and raise a Firefox/Chrome process just to get the redirected URL. Is there any other better way?Thanks!
If this is just an HTTP redirect, / in the standard library can follow redirects just fine, as can third-party HTTP client libraries like  and . In fact, in the simplest use cases, they do so automatically.So, just:But if you just want the data, you don't even need that:That's the contents of the redirected request.(For Python 2.x, just replace  with  and it works the same.)The only reason you'd need to use Selenium (or another browser automation and/or JS-environment library) is if the redirect is done through in-page JavaScript. Which it usually isn't, and isn't in this case. There's no reason to go outside the standard library, talk to another app, etc. for simple things like this.
