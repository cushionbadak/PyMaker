I have to make a function called intercala_lista who will receive 2 list and return a third list who need to put the elements of the first list (l1) in the  odd index and the elements of the second list (l2) at the even index, like the asserts shown. I didn't expect a complete answer I need an idea of how do that.Edit: I tried something like this:I know i'm not use index properly in this function. The idea is ok?
You could zip the lists, and then flatten the result in a comprehension:
Hint: use the  function:Regarding your answer: Python lists aren't arrays. They don't have a fixed size, so just append elements to the end:
The  function is designed to zip lists together. You seem to want to put the second one first, but you can do that by just reversing the arguments.Meanwhile, this gives you a sequence of 2-tuples that you have to flatten. The right way to do this is to use . (Using  is not only misleading, it's also quadratically slow.)Finally, the end result of this will be some kind of iterable (in fact, an iterator), not a list, so you have to construct a list out of it. So:
Short and sweet:
Using  for this problem in particular can be confusing and slow (see comments), that's why it'd be a better idea to avoid it. Here's how:
Here's a funky solution using python's slice assignment with offset and step size, to show off some of pythons lesser known features - a nested list comprehension or other solutions using  would probably be preferable in general. This solution assumes both lists have the same length:
