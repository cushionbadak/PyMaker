I am writing a Python program, and I want to run two while loops at the same time. I am pretty new to Python, so this could be a elementary mistake/misconception. The project is having a Raspberry Pi monitor a sump pump to make sure that it is working, and if not, send an email to the specified recipients. One loop is going to interact with the user, and respond to commands send to it in real time through SSH.The other loop will be monitoring all of the hardware and to send the email if something goes wrong.Both of these functions are critical, and I want them to run in parallel, so how do I get them to run like that? Thanks for everyone's help!
Stuff running in parallel? Try using threading - see for example this module in the standard library, or the multiprocessing module.You will need to create a thread for each of the while loops.This post has some good examples of how to use threads.On some other notes, I can't help noticing you use  instead of  and  instead of , the alternatives given being more normal and Pythonic.When you do  this will always be true because it is actually testing if .  is a non-empty string, so it will always evaluate to  in this context. What you actually want is  or even .Finally when you do  it would probably better to do string formatting. You could do , or use  (I don't know how to do that since I only used Python 2.x for a few weeks before moving to 3.x, where  has been deprecated).
