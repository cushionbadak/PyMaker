I have this simple code:If i input, say, any 3 numbers, why do I get this output:Instead of something like this?The program seems to just keep on working with one array in all created objs. I don't understand why. Any help would be swell.
The problem is that you're defining defining  and  as part of the class (as "attribute references"), instead of in the constructor. Try this instead:The documentation for class objects may help:Attribute references use the standard syntax used for all attribute references in Python: obj.name. Valid attribute names are all the names that were in the classâ€™s namespace when the class object was created. So, if the class definition looked like this:then MyClass.i and MyClass.f are valid attribute references, returning an integer and a function object, respectively. Class attributes can also be assigned to, so you can change the value of MyClass.i by assignment.There's also a Dive Into Python page about this:Class attributes are available both through direct reference to the class and through any instance of the class.Note: In Java, both static variables (called class attributes in Python) and instance variables (called data attributes in Python) are defined immediately after the class definition (one with the static keyword, one without). In Python, only class attributes can be defined here; data attributes are defined in the  method.
