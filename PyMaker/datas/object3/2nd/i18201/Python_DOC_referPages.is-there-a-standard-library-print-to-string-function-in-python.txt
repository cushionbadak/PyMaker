This question already has an answer here:How to print terminal formatted output to a variable                    1 answer                assign output of print to a variable in python                    6 answers                I'm wondering if there is a function in the standard library that takes whatever the print function would print and returns it as a string. It seems like there ought to be but if it's there I'm not looking in the right spot.My situation is I've done a programming exercise that creates (after some calculation) a string of digits stored in a list, e,g,and the position of a decimal point and I want to roll this into something that looks like a decimal. The print function works nicely to display what I want:produces but if I want to return this result as a string is seems I have to write additional code. Not that it would be difficult but it's unnecessary if there's something already built-in. None of print, format or the % operator seem to do the trick. The closest thing I could find was the StringIO class but I was hoping for something a bit simpler and less arcane.
You can define your own function which behaves pretty similar to  like this (untested, have no python on tablet):The  argument in print does not make a lot of sense for strings.
You can give an alternate buffer to the print statement:
Python3's print function will call write method of the file argumentIf you don't like using StringIO, you can write your own:This is used with the file argument:
Check out the join command on strings - first you must convert your digits to strings:
