I just recently dove in to the world of programming and was given a very basic exercise to complete but I am kind of stuck and do not know what to do next.The problem was : Given 3 numbers determine if they can form a triangle and if yes calculate the Perimeter and Area,draw the Triangle afterwards.I have managed to calculate the perimeter and area of the triangle(is such exists) but have no idea how to make the computer draw a triangle from whatever values were input.Here is the code:Would love if you guys could give me an insight on how to achieve this task
Here's another solution, using Tkinter:

If you are plotting by using the (x,y) coordinates of the vertices, you have at least three continuous degrees of freedom: 2 for choosing the location of vertex A, and one more for the direction from A to B.  Then, there is a binary choice of clockwise or counter-clockwise order for the labeling of the vertices.If you don't care which of these to use, then you can put A at (0,0), B at (0, c), and then solve for the intersection of two circles: radius a centered at B, and radius b centered as A.Now you have three points A=(0,0), B=(0,c) and C=(x,y) with the desired opposite side lengths a,b,c respectively.  If you need the angles, use the Law of Cosines from trig:The same pattern applies to solving for A and B.  Those are the interior angles.  For turtles, the turning angle is exterior angle, so start at point A, move (c) in any direction, turn (180-B), then move (a), then turn (180-B), then move (b).
