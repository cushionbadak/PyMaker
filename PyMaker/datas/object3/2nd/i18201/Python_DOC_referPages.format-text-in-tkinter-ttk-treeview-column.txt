Natural Text
I would like to know how to justify the text in a ttk.Treeview column. Below is an example of what I mean. Notice the dates and how the digits are not properly under each other. I think it has something to do with the spacing, but I could be wrong.EDIT: It's written in Python 3.
Use monospace font using :See Tag Options.
You can justify the text in the date column in the same way as you have justified the text in the date heading by using the anchor option.More detailed information on anchor and other options for the  and  methods can be found in Tkinter 8.5 reference: a GUI for Python from New Mexico Tech.
