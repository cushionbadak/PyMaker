My code should print the number of cities before Sochi excluding Sochi  .  I don't understand what this line (place = places[count]) does, nor do I understand why I need it twice. 
foreach would neaten it up
Now  is always , i.e. Jack. Thus the while loop only terminates on the second condition, giving you the list length of 3. should go in the loop.

Why not try a more pythonic solution instead ?
