If a Python has a line:is there a way to make the message to always appear on standard output as whole?There problem is that there might be some subprocesses or C extensions which could write to stdout in the same time.In other words, if I want to  something how to guarantee that it will end up in stdout non-interleaved with other outputs? Is this even possible? I know there is  but that would require to pass the same lock around every  in subprocesses or extension, something I'm not sure if possible to do...
In cPython for Python 2 the GIL,  global interpreter lock, will usually take care of this for you.For sub-processes you can start them with stdout redirected and report at your convenience - most library C extensions would only normally give output to stdout in the event of a serious problem so should not be an issue.If it is an issue - and I wouldn't worry too much until it is - why not replace all your print functions with a report function that uses Lock if needed - you could even replace the default print with such a class.
