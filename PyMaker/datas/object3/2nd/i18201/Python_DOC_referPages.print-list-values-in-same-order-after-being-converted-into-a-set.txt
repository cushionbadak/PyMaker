For example:It gives me a list of values such that each value appears only once, but I'd like it to also print them in the same order as the original list.
A  does not have an order, so after converting a list to a set, the resulting order when iterating the elements is implementation detail.You could use the  to get some set behavior with an order:
Here's a faster (albeit less compact) approach, which basically iterates over the elements in the original list, checking if they are yet in a  you are adding to. There may be some subtle changes which could further speed up my approach:Outputs:Benchmarking:Poke's answer:The above answer:This approach is nearly 10 times faster. For a small list like this, the difference is negligible, and Poke's answer is great. If you do happen to be doing this for massive lists (e.g. 10000 times longer for instance) however, the difference is 75 seconds compared to 5 seconds.
