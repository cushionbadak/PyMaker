I have a string like the following  which means 0 hours, 7 minutes, 38 seconds and 701 ms.I then have a  object like the following: I would like to add these times (the first one is a delta, while the second is an absolute time reference) and get a new  object.How can I do this?
Once you have a  and a , adding them is as simple as using the  operator:There is no built-in parser for  objects akin to  for  objects.You can sometimes fake it by actually parsing the string as a , then extracting the fields to build a , but this is both hacky and complicatedâ€”and, for your simple format, you can write one trivially:
You can use a time delta:
EDIT: As pointed out in the comment, timedelta can handle float values. i.e. if , it will convert it to  and Version before edit:
One more solution, and my favorite so far since it requires no manual parsing and uses existing functionality in  to parse dates in string format:
