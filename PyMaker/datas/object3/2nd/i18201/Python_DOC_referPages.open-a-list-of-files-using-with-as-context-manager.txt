Something such as:which of course doesn't work as it attempts to use the context manager on a list.  The length of the list may not be known until run-time, such as

How about this?Output is:Notice, they are open inside the with context and closed outside.This is using the Python context manager API.EDIT: It seems like this already exists but is deprecated: See contextlib and this SO question.  Use it like this:
It sounds like you are basically looking for , this was deprecated in Python 2.7 in favor of the multiple manager form of the with statement but as noted in the docs:The one advantage of this function over the multiple manager form of the with statement is that argument unpacking allows it to be used with a variable number of context managersIn case you are on Python 3.x, here is the code from the Python 2.7 source:
