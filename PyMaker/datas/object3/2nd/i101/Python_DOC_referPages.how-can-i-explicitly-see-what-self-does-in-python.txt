I've read somewhere that the use of ‘self’ in Python converts  into . Does anyone know how I can prove this? Is it only possible if I look at the bytecode by using ?
self doesn't do anything. self is merely the conventional name given to the first argument of a method in Python class definitions. This argument will be passed an instance of the class.Essentially, to understand what is actually going on, you have to understand Python descriptors. The best places are the official docs To boil it down, descriptor objects are objects that implement ,  or . These methods intercept object attribute access, , object attribute assignment: , and object attribute deletion, .Also, check out the HOWTO, where they show how Python functions and methods are simply descriptors, and show an example Python implementation (of course, in CPython, this is implemented in C):We can "cheat" and create our own object that merely wraps a function object, and see that this works.And or, in a REPL:This shows you that the magic behind "self" is merely that function objects are descriptors, they implement a  method which either returns the function itself if called without an instance, or returns a method-object that binds the first argument.
Trying it out for yourself in IDLE could help you out with this:Python doesn't convert anything, it just silently passes the class instance as the first argument to a class method. Above you can see if you made the method static (via  decorator), you avoid that extra parameter.
