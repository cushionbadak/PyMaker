I am trying to write a for loop that creates new columns with boolean values indicating whether both of the columns being referenced contain True values. I'd like this loop to run through existing columns and compare, but I'm not sure how to get the loop to do so. Thus far, I have been trying to use lists that refer to the different columns. Code follows:I think the issue is with the np.where(), where what I want is for exam and nestedExam to call the columns in question, but instead they're just calling the list items. Error message follows:Can someone help me out with this?
First to go through your combinations more effectively, and without double-counting, I might recommend you use the built-in library itertools.If you actually need all possible orders/combinations, you can substitute  for To deal with the actual issue, you actually need a whole lot less code to do what you want. If you have two columns  and  that are both boolean arrays, then the array where both are true is . This is called a "bit-wise" or "logical and" operation.For example:
