Problem: there are 100+ tables to UNION ALL. The only difference in the name is the date. Instead of writing 100+ code blocks and only changing the date, it makes more sense to write a python script to output the sql code: Our SQL query, querying one table (i.e. one financial quarter): The naming convention of each file name includes the date (financial quarter)We want to query all financial quarters including 19921231 to the presentThe script will: The input would be a single financial quarter, (see above code block), with the output being, that code block repeated 100+ times, with only the yyyy/mm/dd changed in each file name.  Each code block will be joined with a UNION ALL: 
Step one is to write a generator that yields date strings in three month increments from a given date string to the present.  We can store the initial date in a  object, using that to generate the new date strings at every step, and keep the dates from moving past the present.  Then we can use  to find the last days of the given months.Then we can use string formatting to inject this value into a template string
