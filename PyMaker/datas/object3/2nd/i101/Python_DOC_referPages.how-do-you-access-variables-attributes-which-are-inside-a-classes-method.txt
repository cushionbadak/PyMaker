How do I access the attribute/variable a inside the method yes form the body of the program outside of the class? What I have below gives me an error. 
You cannot directly access the variable, even if 'g' is an object of 'test', and yes() is it' method, 'a' is still a local variable for yes(). You haven't initialized it for the entire class. So your object cannot access it. You need to return its value from the function. This should work
I am not sure why you would want to access it, but here's another way to do so:defaultdict(None, {'a': 7})
Variables defined within a function have local scope, and can't be accessed from outside the function.If you want to access a variable from inside a function,  it from the function:However, I suspect you may want to look at setting the variable as an instance variable:Finally, if you're using external code, and are interested in this for the sake of debugging, then the python debugger (pdb) will let you inspect variables within a function.
You should use  to set and get instance variables. You can set it in the  method:ORIf you must use the  func:OUTPUT:
