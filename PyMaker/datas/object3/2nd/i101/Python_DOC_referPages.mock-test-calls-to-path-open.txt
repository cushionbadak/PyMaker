I am attempting to write a unit test for a function that calls the  method on a .  I am able to successfully mock the  method without issue, but verifying the function is having the correct behavior is difficult.  See the sample code below:When I introspect  and review the  list, I am unable to find the string path of the file that is being written to.  The call history looks like this:Is there a way to test what path is being opened when  is called?
You replaced a method with a mock object. The issue with using a mock object here is that it won't be bound to the  instance. It'll be called, but there is no path back to the  instance (no pun intended).Use a function to mock out , one that returns a  object to track further 'open file' use, functions will be bound when accessed on instances of :Now any  call will call the  mock, recording all file interactions and the  object on which it was called:
