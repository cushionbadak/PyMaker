I have code to make a triacontagon (30 sided polygon) but when i let it run, it only provides an answer in the shell and not an actual program. It may be due to what I put beside int, but I'm not sure. Thanks!the code
If I understand correctly what is happening, you are misunderstanding the use of input(). ask the user for input at runtime. Let say in the code you have , then the user is asked for input, typically to be typed in the terminal, and the input is saved in the variable . The string argument of  is shown in the terminal just before the user typing: it's intent is to provide information to the user on what he/she have to type.In your case, if you want to draw a triacontagon you could just edit your code this way:You do not need  to assign to a variable a known value.But your code is more general, it can draw any regular polygon. To make it more clear, try to edit it this way:It will draw a regular polygon according to the numbers you give him each time you execute the code (if you type 4 and 10 for example, the code draws a square whose each side is of length 10).Remember to add at the end of the script:otherwise the window is closed immediately.
You can do it manually, it will be long, but it will be SO much easier.Here is the code you should type:By the way, this tricantagon won't look exactly like a tricantagon, more like a circle, but if you see the code, it is a tricantagon. 30 sides!!
