I have a question about a regex pattern. I have to write a function where I have to find sentences that start with a certain word and have a certain number of words. This is what i've written so far:But the problem is that when i put the brackets around the part that i have to repeat: (\s\w*){2} it's not working. It's just giving me a list where I have just one random word in the middle of some random sentence sentence and not even the word that the sentence should start with. Could ypu please tell me what I'm doing wrong. Thank you :)
In order for the function to work, I changed the first line to be:and I used the following data and function call:The value of  is , which means it matches the word  followed by  (two words). The parentheses around  will capture the last one (second one) of the two words captured, including the space in front of it -- meaning, the third word, counting from :I added parentheses around the entire pattern:So now the pattern is: , which has two sets of parentheses. The first one encompasses entire pattern, so it will capture entire match (the word  and two following words), while the second one will capture the third word (with it's preceding space), returning:Your can then loop through this list and take the first one of each tuple.To simplify your code, you can also add  after the  of the group(s) that you don't want to capture, for example, . Now the code is:and it returns:Also, this is not a good practice:In this case, there is no problem, because the function  is a method in  class. But if you did something like this:it could cause the problem further on, because the function  is not accessible anymore. The name  now refers to the variable .In this example:the output will be:
