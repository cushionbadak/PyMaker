I'm trying to 'unpack' (using Python's struct module) a bytearray to multiple variables, using a formatted string:I expect (when I read the docs) that:a through e will be an unsigned short (of a size 2 bytes each)f and g will be an unsigned char (with a size of 1 byte each)h will be an unsigned long (with a size of of 8 bytes)When I run this on my Windows 10 machine, this is exactly what I get.On my other two machines with Mac OS X and Manjaro Linux (all three have Python 3.7 installed), I will get an error stating:When I run the following, the output is the same on all three machines But when I run the following: The Output on my Windows machine is 16, but on the other two systems 24. Which seems strange to me, what is going on here?And how should I use struct.unpack in a multiplatform environment? 
Thanks @jasonharper:You have to start your  format string with one of the standard byte order/size/alignment indicators (usually  or ) in order to get any sort of cross-platform compatibility
