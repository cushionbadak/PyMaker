I have a python script that writes to a screen as a startup script. I want to monitor the progress of the server so I go into a loop checking the status. I don't want to write down the screen. Therefore I'm using sys.stdout.write. The issue is that the program I'm using (wlst Weblogic) prints all this logging which I don't want to display. I get around this by using grep and only printing lines that start with a space.I have this functionWhat I want to display is:then after 10 seconds Hello is over written withif I run the grep commandit only prints the first lineIt wont print any of the sys.stdout.write lines. I think it is an issue with the buffering but I can't find an example for my issue.The python script works as expected but it also includes lots of other info I don't want to print to screen.Any help appreciated.I believe it is an old version of Python, i.e. 2.7cheersJames
The thing is the other lines aren't new lines as far as  is concerned, as you are not outputting a  newline character.What grep sees is – this output is via  for a hex dump so we can see all the characters – the following.  (on the second line in the dump) is the newline character. You can see that there are no more newline characters (s) after that, so there's nothing more for  to slice the input to lines on.
