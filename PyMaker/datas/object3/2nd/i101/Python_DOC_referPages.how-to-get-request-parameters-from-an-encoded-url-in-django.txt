For example:Where the decoded parameters areI can't find anything in the documentation for Django or DRF pointing to how the framework can handle this so that I get a  with the json objects in it by doing something like:How can I decode JSON encoded URLs in Django Rest Framework?Note that my actual parameters are much more complex. Using POST is not an because the caller relies heavily on caching and bookmarking
The Django  object, and the  alias that Django REST adds, can only parse  query strings, the type encoded by using a HTML form. This format can only encode key-value pairs.
