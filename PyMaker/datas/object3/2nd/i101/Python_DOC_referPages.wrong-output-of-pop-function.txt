While using  function to read a value from the defined list, I'm not getting the desired result.My code:Here, .If someone can explain, it would be great help.using pop function. Code and ouptput
Lets go step by step:Now we arrive at  and .Looks like the right output to me.
When you enter the funcion j = 4 you append 6.08 at the end of the array after thatyou remove 4 and the vector becomes [1, 5, 9, 7, 2, 15, 6.08] you insert 67 in the position 2, and the vector becomes: [1, 5, 67, 9,7, 2, 15, 6.08] you pop the 3 position and get 9when you print a you get  [1, 5, 67, 7, 2, 15, 6.08] and after that you get 5 and 9you should try to pop 4 not 3.you should be carefull whit or maybe your error is here: , remember this instruction put the value in that index and change the index of the rest of the array.
This is the result of each step in your code:Output:Now you can see why  comes to the result.
pop function takes index as a argument.
You may have misunderstood this methodlist.remove(x)Remove the first item from the list whose value is equal to x. It raises a ValueError if there is no such item.from python3.7 dochttps://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#using-lists-as-stacks
