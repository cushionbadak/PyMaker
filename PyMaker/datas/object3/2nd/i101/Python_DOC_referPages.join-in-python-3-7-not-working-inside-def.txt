I'm trying to generate a unique password with a function. Everything works fine, except . Help me see whats the problem in the code? Using Python 3.7.My code:

You should use a generator expression, like this:Alternatively, you can use the built-in function , which is useful in the general case when you want to return a new iterable containing the results of  applied to every element in . So you would use:It's basically a matter of taste as to which you find more readable.
You use an empty string as join separator it does nothing
