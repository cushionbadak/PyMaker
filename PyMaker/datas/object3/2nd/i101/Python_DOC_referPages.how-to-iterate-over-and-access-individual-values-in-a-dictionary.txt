I'm working on some python homework and I am asked to define a function that takes in a dictionary that maps bus routes to bus stops and returns a dictionary mapping bus stops to list of bus routes which stop at that stop. The input would be something like this:I need to somehow make the values into keys and at the same time check if those values are values in any other key as well. Basically, I'm having a hard time trying to figure out how I can access the values and make them the new keys (no duplicates) without actually hard coding them.
This is actually very easy if you use Dictionary and List Comprehension. You can get the required output in one line.A more readable but longer comprehensionOutput:
So if I've understood the question correctly, you want to find stops along the routes, where there are stops visited by the same bus, essentially finding bus route duplication.Please see the below code.We get a variable () from iterating with  where  is the route name and  is the stop name list. We then create another iteration with  and try to see if a key with that stop name already exists in  and if it doesn't exist, it catches the  and creates it with the value of the name of the route in  list, however, if the key does exist, we can safely say it will the list we created already, and therefore  to it, with the next route name.Hope this helps.
