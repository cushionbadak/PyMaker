Before I run my python script I need to check if an external program is running and wait for it to finish.I have a few pieces but am having some difficulty putting it all together into a cohesive script.I can use the following to get the PID of a program and a while loop which will timeout in 10 secondsIf the program is not running get_pid would fail and I think I need to catch the exception in that case? This is where I am not certain where to go.  Maybe there is a better way to approach this?==============Here is an update which seems to work correctly.
You can try catching this exception. Because when  returns non zero exception instance of  is raised which can be handled. Like this.Hope it works!
Have you tried using the try and except block?E.g. You can read the docs here Handling Exceptions
Exception handling can be at the place where the exception is thrown. So if check_output is throwing exception, you could handle below way,
