I am trying to create a  function that will make creating a dictionary a little easier.Looking at it now, this is probably kind of dumb because I can just do , right? Anyway, to understand how Python works I would be grateful if any of you can explain why the following code is returning a key error instead of creating a nested dictionary.
The easiest solution would be to use a collections.defaultdict:We define  as a  of . When we do:if  doesn't yet have a  key, a new one is created on the fly with an empty  as value. So, we can add  to this new dict.
Do you mean this? I'm sorry, but my query does not respond to your problem in a comment, so I had to put it as a possible solution / explanation.///EDIT: So when the dictionary already exists, then you can change its contents. However, if you want to add a new pair (to the right side of an existing key), you must add to the existing key, a non-existent, just above syntax. I guess I explain that complicated, sorry.Another example from Python console:
