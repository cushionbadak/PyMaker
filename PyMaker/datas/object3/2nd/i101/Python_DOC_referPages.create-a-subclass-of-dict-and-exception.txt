For a web application I want to have a raise-able .How can I avoidand have some raise-able -like exception that can directly be JSON-dumped without having to access a special attribute of the exception subclass or having to use 's  argument?
Can you simply define the methods that you need for the exception to work as a dictionary and also define a dumps method of your exception?
