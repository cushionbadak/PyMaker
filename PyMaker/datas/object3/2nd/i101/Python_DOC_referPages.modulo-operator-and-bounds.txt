I have a function that takes 3 parameters (upperBound, lowerBound, value), if value is not in between upperBound and lowerBound it should get reassigned in between. I can do it for positive numbers but I don't know how it would work for negatives and positives mixed i.e. if I have f(60, 0, -5) i want the function to display 55. I know we have to use the modulo operator and I can use combinations of different cases but I'd like to achieve the following with just 2 cases :if value is < lowerBound , then one general statement for positive, negative integers that gives value between boundselse if value > upperBound , then one general statement for positive, negative integers that gives value between boundsAny help would be appreciated. 
In Python The % (modulo) operator yields the remainder from the division of the first argument by the second. The numeric arguments are first converted to a common type. A zero right argument raises the ZeroDivisionError exception. The arguments may be floating point numbers, e.g., 3.14%0.7 equals 0.34 (since 3.14 equals 4*0.7 + 0.34.) The modulo operator always yields a result with the same sign as its second operand (or zero); the absolute value of the result is strictly smaller than the absolute value of the second operand [1].See Python documentaiton
remember to do an offset for min value.assuming we have the followingdo the followingthis should work the same even if min, max or testValue is negative.
