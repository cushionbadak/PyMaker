This question already has an answer here:Python : AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'append'                    2 answers                Why does append return none in this code?                    4 answers                In Python 3, I am writing code to make a list of words of length k, where k is a positive integer, in some given alphabet. The alphabet should be a list (for example, [a,b,c,d]). Here is the code:This throws the error "'NoneType' object has no attribute 'append'". I partially understand what is happening: if I print the values of i+j that the program generates, the last value is always None. This has something to do with the return statement of my code, but I do not see how to fix it.
The main problem in your code is that you assigned the output of  to list.  modifies your list in place, and returns nothing (in fact, it returns , as all functions that don't have an explicit return value). On the next loop, your list was , so trying to append to it failed.Note that I renamed your list to 'words', as  is the name of a Python builtin function.You could also have used the itertools module to obtain the same result:
