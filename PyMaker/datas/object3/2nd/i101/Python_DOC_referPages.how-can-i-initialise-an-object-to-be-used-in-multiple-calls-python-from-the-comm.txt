I have a script I've written that uses a very large object. I load the object with pickle, but it takes quite a few seconds to do so. That's not a big deal if it has to happen once or twice, but I'm hoping to use the code many hundreds or thousands of times!I think my issue is that I'd like to almost 'leave' the object alive and then be able to call it from command line whenever I need it. I'm reasonably new to Python so I'm not sure how possible that is; sorry if I haven't used the right terminology in my question. I'm writing and running my python in Spyder at the moment, but eventually I'd like to run it on a server, calling the code as and when required.
If your script is looping over the python program, move the loop inside the program.If on the other hand, you want to be able to use the large object on demand, you probably need a client/server configuration. Thriftpy is a very simple way to achieve this. The thriftpy server will hold the object and the processing logic, and the client will be a command line script that will call the server and pass whatever parameters you need to process the object.
