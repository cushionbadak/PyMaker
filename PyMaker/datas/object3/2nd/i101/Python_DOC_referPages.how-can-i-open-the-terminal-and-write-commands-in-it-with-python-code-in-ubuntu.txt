I have a lots of programs in different languages, but all of them do the same thing. If I give the same input to them, they all give the same output.I want to process the output of each program, so I need output of each program in a string variable.I want to write code in python to test these programs, in Ubuntu's terminal. I want to to work like the test code on the ACM servers. How can I write/read in the Ubuntu terminal with python?
Getting an actual terminal window open that the user can see, and typing in it, would require some fiddly interaction with X11, which manages the desktop on Ubuntu.But if all you want to do is to have your Python code run commands and look at their output, without necessarily having a real window, you probably want the subprocess module. In current versions of Python 3, you can pass  to  along with your command, and then look at the output of the command (in  under the returned ) to see if it looks like what you wanted it to look like.
