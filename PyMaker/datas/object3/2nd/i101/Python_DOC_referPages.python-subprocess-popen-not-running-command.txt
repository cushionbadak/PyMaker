I'm trying to use  to run a command in my script. The code is:When I print the output, it's printing out the created shell output and not the actual command that's in the list. I tried getting rid of , but then Popen wouldn't even run.I also tried using , but it didn't work either. I would also get the shell output and not the actual command run. I want to completely avoid using  because of security issues.EDIT: In many different attempts, "hrun" is not being recoognized. "hrun" is a Pearl script that is being called, DAR_MeasLogDump is the action and log_file_name is the file that the script will call its action on. Is there any sort of set up or configuration that needs to be done in order for "hrun" to be recognized?
Try: is expecting . Without  I think it just tries to open it as a file.
Specifying an odd shell and an explicit  seems completely out of place here (assuming  is defined to the current directory).If the first argument to  is a list, no shell is involved.If you need this to be run under a legacy version of Python, maybe use  instead of .You generally want to avoid  unless you need to do something which the higher-level wrapper functions cannot do.
You are creating an instance of  but not executing it.You should try:Args should be passed as a sequence if you do not use , and then using  should not be required.Note that if you are not using advanced features from , the doc recommends using :
This works with cat example:I think you need only change to your 'hrun' command
