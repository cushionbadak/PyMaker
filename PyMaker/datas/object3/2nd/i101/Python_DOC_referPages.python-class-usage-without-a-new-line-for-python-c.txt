When defining a class in Python, why does the class usage need to be in a new line? This becomes a bit annoying when trying to run python programs from a string () because I can't define and use the class on the same line. Is there a way to achieve this?For example, the following fails:but using the class in a new line works:
Use newlines, the command line is not limited to a single line:or just insert  sequences in a  stringUsing semi-colons, you can only add more simple statements, and they all fall within the same compound statement if you started the line with one. You can't use these to define methods or expect a  statement to have completed, you are still in the  definition.
