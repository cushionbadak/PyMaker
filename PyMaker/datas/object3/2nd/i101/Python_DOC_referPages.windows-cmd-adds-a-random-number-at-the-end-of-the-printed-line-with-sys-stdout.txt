I wrote a simple  statement in the console of a Windows 10, 64 bit operating system. The installed Python version is .
The number is not random; it's the number of characters written. Because you are in a Python interactive, the return value of the statement is printed as well.  (or writing to a file in general) returns the number of characters written.Therefore, when you do something like , it first prints , then the return value () is printed. can be mocked like this:In an interactive:
REPL will always print a return value (in your case number of written characters to STDOUT) of the function called if you don't capture it. If you don't want to have it printed you can always use a temporary variable to store the return value in a temporary/throaway varaible:Notice the added new line at the end - this is because it won't be added automatically so without it your next REPL prompt would start right after  instead of the new line.Or, you know, you can just use the  function which will, in its default setup, do pretty much the same instead of you having to deal directly with the STDOUT stream.
