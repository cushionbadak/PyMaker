I'm building a basic mapping robot where all the data is stored on a 2D python array. However I am unable to find any way to move entire rows or columns over and then insert a blank row/column in. For example:if moved to the right to look like :orif moved down to look like :I have already figured out how to expand the array whenever something is detected outside of the pre-defined array however I am unable to move rows and columns like demonstrated above.Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks :)
The numpy solutions work great, but here is a solution in pure Python, with no imports. Note that most of this code just prints the results--each roll uses only one line of code. I also added , where the matrix is rotated up then the last row is replaced with all zeros (though it is done more efficiently than that).The printout from that is:
Have you looked at numpy and numpy.roll for this?then you can shift right:shift left:shift up:shift down:
You can create a class to handle this movements like this:Example:
This can be easily done by "roll" function from numpyexample in your case:output will be:for 1st usecase:output will befor second case yo can simply take transpose:and output will be Third case be done by applying numpy roll operation on transpose matrixoutput
