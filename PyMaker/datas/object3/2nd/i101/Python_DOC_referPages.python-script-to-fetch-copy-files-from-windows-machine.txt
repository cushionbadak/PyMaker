I am actually developing a script (which runs in linux machine) to fetch particular files from windows machine for every iteration and do some operation based on the file content. So, Is there any pythonic way to do this?Please help me out with this.
Sure check out the following module which accommodates to navigate both on Windows and Linux File Systems with the class 'Path' and in particular its 'iterdir', 'glob' and 'rglob' methods.An alternative is to use the 'os' module, more specifically with 'os.walk', 'os.fwalk', 'os.scandir' and/or 'os.listdir' (with 'os.walk' and 'os.listdir' available in Python 2.7 too).
Found the solution!Download and install Bitvise server (one of best ssh servers available out there) for windows machine. Run it as an administrator.Now, from linux machine fetch the contents of any file using ssh and sshpass tools (As a root user).Ex:
