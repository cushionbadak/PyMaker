The function is supposed to load a list and print the sum of the first and last primes in the list. I have written it so that a new list is made and the idea i that only primes are appended to it - if its not a prime, it should go back to the beginning of that for loop.I want my function to go back to the beginning of the for loop after as I only want prime numbers to be appended to y, but I don't think 'break' is the right thing to do here as I keep having my entire list being printed when I call the function. I've tried 'break', 'pass', 'continue' and an infinite loop (although I may not have done that correctly). Please help???
You can use the else statement:Thanks to @UlrichEckhardt for the info. https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#break-and-continue-statements-and-else-clauses-on-loops
