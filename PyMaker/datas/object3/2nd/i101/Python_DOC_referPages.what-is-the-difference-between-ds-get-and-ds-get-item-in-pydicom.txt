Does anyone know what is the difference in Pydicom between the two methods  and ?Thanks!
Both of these are not used often in user code.   is the equivalent of python's dict.get; it allows you to ask for an item in the dictionary, but return a default if that item does not exist in the Dataset.  The more usual way to get an item from a Dataset is to use the dot notation, e.g.or to get the  object via the tag number, e.g. is a lower-level routine, primarily used when there is something wrong with some incoming data, and it needs to be corrected before the "raw data element" value is converted into python standard types (int, float, string types, etc).When used with a keyword,  returns a value, not a  instance.   always returns either a  instance, or a  instance.
I imagine your answer is in the source for those two functions.  Looks like  handled strings as well as DataElements as input.
