Is there a way to do a regex across multiple files (in this case, log files) where the regular expression might be matching starting conditions in one file, and ending conditions in the next file in filename order?I need to match events out of log files where the start of the event can theoretically be towards the end of one file, and the end of the event can be towards the beginning of the next.So far, I have been reading all the files and concatenating them into a string and regexing across that -- however, I've finally run into a situation where doing this is causing a  (this appears to be somewhere around total of 800MB of log files for a day).I'm wondering if there is a way to do this across the files directly, so I don't have to maintain all contents in a variable in memory? Or, if there is another way to do this that is more memory efficient?Note: OS is Windows 7
If you are on Unix-like OS (Linux, macOS), you could use system tools. . If necessary, you can run that from a Python script using .
Process the files one at a time in order, but when you find an event start line, make note of the file and line where you saw it.  When you find the event end line, you'll know everything you need to.
