Natural Text
I am doing this:The file "ook.ini" is indeed inside the "stuff.tar" archive.However, I get this:According to the docs,  read and parse configuration data from f which must be an iterable yielding Unicode strings so what I am passing it should be fine, shouldn't it?What am I doing wrong?
 returns a file opened in binary mode. The equivalent for  is a file opened in text mode. As such, the two do not match.You can wrap your extracted file in a  or a generator that converts to unicode:
