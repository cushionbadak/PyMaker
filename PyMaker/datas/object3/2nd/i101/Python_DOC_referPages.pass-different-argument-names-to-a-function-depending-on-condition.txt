This question already has an answer here:Pythonic solution for conditional arguments passing                    8 answers                My code needs a way to determine which one of two argument names (not values) it should pass to an API function. There are two possible variable names, and only one of them will be used in the call. Something like this metacode:So in other words the API will only accept either the TransitGateway or VpnGateway variable here, but not both.Do you know the best way to address this? Thanks!
Check out the Python docs for keyword arguments to functions. Basically, you'll want to create a dictionary to hold your values:Then you can "unpack" that dictionary into the function's arguments:That will call  or  based on the values in .
Instead of setting the variable in the two conditional branches, you could just call the API with different arguments in each branch:If you must make only a single call, put all the keyword arguments into a dictionary, setting a different gateway in the conditional:You can then pass all the parameters with the 'double splat' command:
