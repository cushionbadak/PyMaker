I have a file directory that contains multiple files recorded in one day. But I need to combine the files that ends with the same ids so the logic that I am trying to use is to go over each file in the directory and then look for the file that has the matching id. For example I have files that are stored as below:These files are not necessarily stored in the sequence like above so I need to file the files that matches the id in between and combine them. So far, I have tried the code below but I need help to correct the pattern matching part as this is not practical to use for hundreds of files to keep changing for every id. 
Correct Me if I'm wrong, but I understand you have a lot of different ids. If they are always seperated by '_' you can get the id with help of the split()-Funktion of the string Type. Then you just have to go through all files, check the number and check if you already processed that number.Maybe something like this:For your code it's probably helpfull to take a look at Nullman's answer.
I slightly modify LordDot's code:Output:You can easily combine all files belongs to the same id.
the glob module is useful hereglob returns a list of matchesconsider using  if you want an iterator instead of a list (great when you have a lot of files)
