Is there a keyboard shortcut for reverse-tab in the Python IDLE?I am trying to write an if-elif-else statement but cannot reverse-tab to properly indent the elif statement. I've tried shift+tab and shift+ctrl+tab.For example, I can write this...but when I try to add the elif statement...I get the following error message:
Use the back space key to dedent.  It is easiest if one does so before entering any code.  If there is already code on the line, put the edit cursor between the end of the indent and the beginning of the code before hitting backspace.  Note that in IDLE, one enters and edits, and submits complete statements for execution.  Hence no secondary prompts. Example:The final blank line signals that the compound statement is complete and should be executed.  Until then, one can edit any part of the statement.I am a bit stunned that 3 people would suggest the awkward and much harder workaround of selecting the line or at least the indent and using control-[.  I am thinking about how to make the easy way more obvious.I am aware that having 'if', 'elif', and 'else' not lined up is a nuisance.  I intend to fix this.
ctrl+[ de-indents highlighted code. ctrl+] indents.You can see all the shortcuts if you look in the "Edit" menu at the top of the editor. 
What your doing is the shortcut on Spyder, but no, in idle, you have to do:Ctrl+[And the opposite would be:Ctrl+]
For reversectrl+[ For Oppositectrl+]
