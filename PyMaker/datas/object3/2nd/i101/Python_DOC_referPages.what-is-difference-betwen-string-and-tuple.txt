Can anyone explain what is difference between string and tupleboth are immutable.
They're different types.Which means they have different methods, different use cases, different meanings, different implementations, etc. etc. etc....  Consider:Essentially the only thing they have in common is their immutability.
A string is a sequence of unicode characters with quotation marks on either side of the sequence.Example: A tuple is an ordered sequence of objects or characters separated by commas with parentheses on either side of the sequence.Example: They are, however, similar in the fact that they are both immutable
Strings are immutable in python which means it cannot be changed once created, if you want to update it then a new string is to be created for example.you can extract value using index, find values but cannot modify itTo access substrings, use the square brackets for slicing along with the index or indices to obtain your substring Tuple they are immutable like strings and sequence like lists.They are used to store data just like list, just like string you cannot update or edit the tuple to change it you have to create a new one just like strings.Tuples can be created using parenthesis () and data is inserted using comas.
tuple use a trailing comma:string don't use:but string and tuple has some same characteristics。eg:1、indexing and slicing2、Immutabilitymeans string and tuple not suport item assigmentyou could find all of the diffrent from the Doc.including other tyeps build-in types.https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=tuple#tuple
