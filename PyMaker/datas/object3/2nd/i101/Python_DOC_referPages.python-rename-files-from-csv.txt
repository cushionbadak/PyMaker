ProblemI have a list of words in different languages with their English translation:For all these words (or entries), I have an audio file on how to pronounce the word (from Forvo). The audio files are named with language and the "#" value. Thus, spanish1.m4a, spanish2.m4a, spanish3.m4a, etc.Now, I want to rename that file as follows: yes-si-1.m4aScriptNow I thought something with an If statement. If Row equals Num, then change the file name to Eng+HebF+Row+".m4a"How do I solve this issue?
You're in the right direction. Two main things to fix are:In order to rename a file in programming, you generally move them to the same folder, using different names. This can be easily done with the shutil module of Python's standard library.Try to keep it simple for yourself. No need to change directories and build absolute paths for your files - simply leave your python script in the same folder as the files you want to rename, open a terminal in that folder and execute the script. Python is able to see files which are in the same folder just by passing the file name, no need for a full path.The following code does what you want for the spanish csv example in your OP, renaming the files ,  and . Note that:1) all files (code, csv and .m4a files) should be in the same directory;2) I'm using f-strings for building the file name strings - hopefully the formatting is obvious enough from the code;3) You'll need to do some refactoring in order for the code to work with your files in other languages.Using  is overkill for this task but I didn't want to change your code structure too much. Let me know if you have any doubts.
Please make a backup of your file(s) before you try thisWhy use Python or even  is you can just use :This will rename your  files according to your rule. You can apply the same to your  problem.
