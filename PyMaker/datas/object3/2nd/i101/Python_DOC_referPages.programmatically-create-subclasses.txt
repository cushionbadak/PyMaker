I'm using Scrapy to crawl a set of similar pages (webcomics). Because these pages are very similar, I wrote a class called  which contains all the spider logic and some class variables (, , etc.). I then override these class variables in concrete classes for each spider. Manually creating classes for each comic is cumbersome. I now want to specify the attributes in a JSON file and create the classes during runtime (ie. apply the factory pattern (?)) How do I best go about that? Alternatively: Is there a way to run a spider without creating a class for it? Edit: The core problem seems to be that Scrapy uses classes, not instances for its spiders. Otherwise I'd just make the class variables instance variables and be done with it.Example:in another file:what I want:PS: I crawl responsibly.
The  statement is a declarative wrapper around using  directly. Assuming  takes a class as an argument, will create a class with name , that will inherit from  and will have attributes as defined in the  dictionary. An example on Python docs.
Look up metaclasses. This is the way in Python to dynamically create new classes. What are metaclasses in Python?For this simpler case there is a simpler method which is described in chepner's answer.
