Is there some library available to write a  file programmatically?  Also, what is the formal spec of its format?  All I've found is this section of the docs:https://docs.python.org/3.3/distutils/packageindex.html#pypircThat leaves out details like what kinds of whitespace are allowable, whether  and  are equivalent or not, and so on.
The file is read by  using .So if you want to write it use the same . The docs you pointed are the only docs. The rest could be deduced from the code.
