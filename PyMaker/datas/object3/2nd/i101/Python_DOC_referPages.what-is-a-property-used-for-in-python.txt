I was editing a blog post and started to type the word  when my autocomplete suggested a completion called , curious as ever I looked it up and found that this was coming from the Python autocomplete package.I pressed it and this code appeared:I typed  where the cursor(s) were, so I ended up with this:By looking at the code I can see that it's creating a local variable called  but doesn't seem to be doing anything with it.It's also creating three functions, one which returns  another which adds a new property to  and one which deletes .Where did  &  come from? Is this a class of some sort, like a "pseudo class"?Where, why and how are "new Properties" used?
Your editor is providing an unusual way to create a property. Here is some information on properties.After reading that, you'll realize that there's no need to create the getter and setter within a function. The reason the editor does it this way is to have a scope where to define the names of the getter and setter without needing unique names. IOW, the names are hidden in the function.So, how are the objects defined in the function (fget, fset, fdel & doc) passed to the property descriptor?Notice the function returns the result of locals. So the return value of the function is a  with the name of the local objects as keys and the local objects as values.Finally, regarding , fget, fset and fdel will be executed as if they were methods of the object which has the property so  refers to that object.
