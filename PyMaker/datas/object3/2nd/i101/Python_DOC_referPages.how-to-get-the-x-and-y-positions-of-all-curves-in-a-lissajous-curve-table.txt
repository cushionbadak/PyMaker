After watching some Coding Train, I tried to make a Lissajous Curve Table in python. I successfully made circles, orbiting dots, and lines. However, I cannot seem to get the actual curves drawn. I created a list called positions which takes the x_ and y_ values from the rows and columns, but the animation only draws the bottom right circle. I cannot figure out my error. My full code on GitHub: LissajousCurveTable
You've to add the permutations of the positions  which are calculated in each frame to the container , rather than a single position per frame.   the coordinates to integral values and only add unique coordinates to the container. Note, the coordinate of a pixel is integral. Drawing a point twice, doesn't make it "whiter".Use a  rathet than a list to store the unique postions
