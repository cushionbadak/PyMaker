This question already has an answer here:Parse JSON in Python                    4 answers                I am calling an API which returns a complicated json:How do I extract just the name and state for attrs? 
Use the json module:Note that I had to add a missing  near the end of your string - I hope it only disappeared when you copied it here.
As @Aran-Fey suggested, you should use the json module, which turns the JSON string into Python dicts and lists.Btw, there's a syntax error in your JSON example. A double quote is missing before the first occurrence of 'Host'.
Pretty much the same answer as Thierry.Same issue with the json being invalid.
