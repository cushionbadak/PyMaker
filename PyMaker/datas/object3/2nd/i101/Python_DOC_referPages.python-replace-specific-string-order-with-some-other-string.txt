Natural Text
I have the following text: I would like to replace to replace all instances  with  Is this possible with Python ?
I would use a regular expression:An explanation. You must replace all sub-string (character sequences) that match a precise pattern:a fixed string: "{\i1}";some generic text you do not know right now (SOMETHING);a fixed string: "{\i0}";with the following text: "\textit{SOMETHING}", where SOMETHING is exactly the same text as above. Regular expressions are perfect for this kind of job. With them you can search text, capture it in a variable, replace, etc. The syntax, related to your need, is the following:the literal string "{\i1}", the double backslash is needed because the backslash is a special character;the dot () match every characterthe start-question-mark () repeat the previous pattern (the dot) in a non-greedy fashion. Combined with the previous token means any character as less as possible;the parenthesis () store the content pattern in a special variable (, , etc.) that you can reference later in the replacement text;the literal string "{\i0}".Using  you can replace the matching pattern with a replacement text. I suggest you to follow the @cglacet advice and test your regular expression with regex101: https://regex101.com/r/8vaDFt/1
