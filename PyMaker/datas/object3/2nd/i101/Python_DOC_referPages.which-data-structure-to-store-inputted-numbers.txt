Which data structure is best for calculating average of inputted numbers ?I used an array, but it feels clumsy.Is there a more standard way to do this?
There is a statistics module which you can use:
Using Python list is well. Maybe trying some built-in functions for getting average grade  would be more easily.Assume grades is a list store some grade.
You can use something like this:Yes this solution seems a little complex with average factory. But I think storing all value just for calculating average is not so good idea. Storing only count and sum of grades is better. If you have any question about solution feel free to ask me about it.
numpy or scipy offer good facilities for this.store your numbers in an .To obtain your mean, Your code would look like:
