I'm having a weird issue with the command print(next()) in python 3.When i use it to print on the console, it works perfectly, but when i try to save the output into a file, it doesn't work!The commands that i'm using are the following:The output that I get from the last command's next(fasta) part is the line+2 instead of line+1, like the one I get from the print on console command.Does anyone has a clue about what is going on? Any tip will be very much appreciated!Thank you all in advance.Cordially,Fernanda Costa
Calling  advances the given iterator ( in this case). Calling it multiple times will advance it multiple times and cause elements to be skipped. You need to save the return value in a variable if you want to use the data in different places:
Did you tried to create a variable and pass the value of next(foo) in this variable, and finally print the variable ?
I just realized that when you call next() command in python 3 it reads correctly line+1 and when i call it again, it will consider line the next(line) instead of line, so it prints next(next(line) which is line+2!So i fixed it with just removing the print in the console command line.Thank you all and sorry about the noob problem!
