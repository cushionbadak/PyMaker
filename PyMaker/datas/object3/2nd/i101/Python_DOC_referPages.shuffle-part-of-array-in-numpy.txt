I have a numpy array, and I would like to shuffle parts of it. For example, with the following array:I want to do:The following would shuffle all the array: (Not what I want)One way would be to use split / concatenate like so:This is almost what I want. My questions:Can I write  where the indices are custom (parts with arbitrary indices, not restricted to modulos, and parts with varying length)Is there a method in numpy that I missed and that would help me do that?
It can be done directly:Indexing directly references the data, making this possible.
numpy slices are views on the data below; so you can directly shuffle the slices:you could implement your  function using  this way then:or (depending on how you want to pass the slices to your function):personally i'd prefer the second version (that way you could also e.g. shuffle the even indices: )...
