Python is already installed on your machine... If you would run a different version, you'd better configure a virtual environment 
First of all, uninstall any other package higher than 2.7.Option 1:You may use the source code python and "make altinstall"Docs: https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#building-pythonOption 2:Using apt-get I could install/update versions 2.7.15 and 3.7.1-1 using docker environment with this Dockerfile:This means, if you use this code:It will probably work.
