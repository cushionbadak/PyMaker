I'm trying to write a code that would add the total of all the values from 0 to 100 and printing only the total after computing with any loop structure. For another one I did it was short so I did this but 0 to 100 is too much ,, is there another way?
Use a range: 
Using range:You would just pass the max value that you want the count up to (e.g. ).
The built-in sum() function gives the total value of all numbers in a list, so your listsum() function is not needed. gives you a list of all numbers from 1-100 (inclusive) Putting those together you getWhich adds the total of all the values from 0 to 100 The range function is much more powerful than this, here's a good reference for using it it's something you really need to know how to use well!
