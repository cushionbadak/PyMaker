I am struggling with one piece of this code and can not seem to get it right. I am attempting to access and print a single cell value from a csv in python. I have the list of rows and columns to specify each single cell but face index errors when I attempt to turn the file into a list and then specify[row][column]. Is there anyway I can get the single cell str values without using pandas? I would prefer to use the csv module if possibleCSV file 'annotations_full.csv CSV file 'results.csv'
If you want want to access / view / print the specified cell value, then you can do the following:CSV File: Python code to access specified code:
The code snippet below focuses on accessing cells of , based on coordinates provided in It first creates a list of dicts (OrderedDicts as of Python 3.6) by iterating over a  instance on .It then iterates over a  instance on , fetching the coordinates for the lookup of the  cells and prints the cell content, along with some safeguards for invalid column names and row numbers.Note the  used to provide the index for the  list. Python lists are zero-based; unless the row numbers in  account for that (e.g. the first row in  is referenced with the row number ) you need that to access the correct list element.Content of sample :Content of sample :Output of the code snippet using the sample files:
