Let i have the following class in python:now i want to create a collection of class  which hold following logic when an  object  is being added to collection:if the collection contains a  object  where  then else add  to collectionHow can i do it?Previously i used a list to do so where i checked if the list contains a  object which has same  as . But the approach has O(n^2) complexity to add n  in the collection.
Your wording may confuse community members, who're familiar with Python. I think you're using "dictionary" term as the part of your domain model and not as data structure in Python.If you really need both  and  classes - you should go forward with code like this:Key points are:Usage of type hintsHow  lookup (e.g. ) is working - When does __eq__ gets called using hash()? usage and  usageAnd I highly recommend to think if you really want to store  instances in .
You could do it easily by using a dictionary instead of a list, using the word.lemma as key:a inconvenient is that it duplicates the lemma information...If using a  class is not mandatory, your could use a defaultdict (with a 0 default value) that just associate frequency (value) to lemma (key):
