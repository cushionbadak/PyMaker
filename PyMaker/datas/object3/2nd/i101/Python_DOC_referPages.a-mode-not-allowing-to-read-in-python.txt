I'm trying to read from an originally empty file, after a write, before closing it. Is this possible in Python?Flushing with  doesn't seem to work, as the final  still returns nothing.Is there any way to read the "foobar" from the file besides re-opening it?

Seek back to the start of the file before reading:
