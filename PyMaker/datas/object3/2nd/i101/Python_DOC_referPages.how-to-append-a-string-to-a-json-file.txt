Natural Text
I am trying to append two string variables to a JSON file and I am having problems to achieve that. Here is my code: to that 'data' in the writerow() function, I want to add two attributes, which are saved in the two variables above (folderText and labelText) so I get two more fields in the data field something like that {"folderName": folderText, "labelName": labelText}Anyone has an idea how to do that?
As is, the parameter to json.dumps is a dict comprehension, so you can't just add key/value pairs to it as it's not a dict literal. What you want to do is first create a dict with the "hard-coded" items:then merge the current content of the comprehension to it:and finally pass the end-result to :Note that in case of conflict this will overwrite the hard-coded data with the comprehension's. You can alternatively update the comprehension's result:A third alternative would be to use dictionary unpacking, but that does not seem like an improvement in this specific case:
