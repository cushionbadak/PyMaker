I have one python script with it's settings in one seperate json config file. The json file looks like this: Now I need to run the same python file more than one time, each with other settings in the config file. The other settings would look like this:I don't need to change anything in the Python script. I open the json file in my Python script like this:Since you cannot add comments in a json file, I don't know the easiest way to do this. I want the Python script to run simultaneously two times, each time with other settings for the json file.Thanks in advance!
After launching the the python script, you can just modify the config file inplace and run it a second time. This won't affect the already-running python program because they already read the config.Or you can have multiple config files with different names, and run the script with some command line argument (i.e. ) to choose which config file to use. I personally recommend this approach.
A simple solution is a new script that parses your JSON file, imports your Python scripts, and then executes that scripts with different parameters using concurrent. An example (adapted from the example for ThreadPoolExecutor):
