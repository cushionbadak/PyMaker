How can I get a value from another function (input) in Python?The problem is that when I choose number 2, it asks me to enter my value again. But I want to get the first value from the first function.So when I type 1 , the program should ask to enter a value, and then when I type 2, the program should just show my value.I don't see why it keeps asking for a value. What am I doing wrong? note : when i delete this line from yyyi see this error
You need to instantiate the value of xxx function and you must return the value from self.aTake a look at this link from the official python documentation if you have doubts or any troubles while using the statement.9.
