I have this code. Basically I using subprocess to execute a program several times in a while loop. It works fine but after several times (5 times to be precise) the my python script just terminates and it still has a long way before finishing.For each time I am calling program, it will take approximately one hour to finish. In the mean time subprocess should wait because depending on the output I must execute parts of my code (that is why I am using .communicate() ).Why is this happening?Thanks for the help in advanced!
A subprocess runs asynchronously in the background (since it's a different process) and you need to use subprocess.wait() to wait for it to finish. Since you have multiple subprocesses you'll likely want to wait on all of them, like this:
To solve this problem I suggest doing the following:I know it is not recommended to use shell=True, so if you do not want to use it then just pass the cmdline you with commas. Be aware that you might get an error when passing with commas. I do want to go into details but in that case you can use shell=True and your problem will be gone.Using the piece of code I just provided your python script will not terminate abruptly when using subprocess many time and with programs that have a lot of stdout and stderr messages. It tool some time to discover this and I hope I can help someone out there.
