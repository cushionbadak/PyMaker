Natural Text
I've done some digging and most use arrays, but our class is not that far and we're to use mostly for loops to return the most repeated letter in a function.Here was my code so far, but all I could get was to return the count of the first letter.
Make use collections.Counter
There are a few problems with your code:you calculate the count of the most common letter, but not the letter itselfyou  inside the loop and thus after the very first letteralso, you never use , and the slicing of  is unneccesarySome suggestions to better spot those errors yourself:use more meaningful variable namesuse more than two spaces for indentationFixing those, your code might look something like this:Once you are comfortable with Python's basic language features, you should have a closer look at the builtin functions. In fact, your entire function can be reduced to a single line using , using the  as the  function for comparison.But while this is very short, it is not very efficient, as the  function is called for each letter in the word, giving the function quadratic complexity O(n²). Instead, you can use a  to store counts of individual letters and increase those counts in a single pass over the word in O(n).And this is basically the same as what  would do, as already described in another answer.
If you don't want to use Counter:
Here is a code that works for multiple:
