I am attempting to write a program in Python 3.6, with the help of pygame (A Python module) which is supposed to flash Red, Green, and Blue quickly on the screen. The program runs as intended for approximately ten to fifteen seconds before it stops responding. (I have noticed that only 3 events are printed to the console, when there should be A LOT more.)
You need a while loop in the  method and also put the main loop into a function.However, there's really no need for  in this case and the code looks rather strange to me. You can just use  to calculate the passed time and then change the color when it's above your time limit.  is pretty handy if you want to cycle through several values infinitely.
I would suggest that your code was running too fast, and to increase the  value.
