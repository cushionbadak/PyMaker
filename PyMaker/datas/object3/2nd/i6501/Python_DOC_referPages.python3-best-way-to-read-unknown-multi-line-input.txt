What is the best way in Python 3 to read in multi-line user input when the amount of input is unknown? The multi-line input will be separated by Enterwhen I try usingI receive an EOFErrorThen if I change it to a try-catch blockI still get the EOFError.
The  occurs when you call , not when you test it, nor when you print it. So that means you should put  in a  clause:That being said, if  reads from the standard input channel, you can use it as an iterable:Since every  now ends with the new line character , we can use  in the  function, to prevent print a new line twice (once from the string, once from the  function).I think the last version is more elegant, since it almost syntactically says that you iterate over the  and processes the lines individually.
