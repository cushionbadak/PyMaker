I am interested in generating all binary combination of  variables without having to implement a manual loop of iterating N times over N and each time looping over  and so on. Do we have such functionality in python?E.g:I have  binary variables: I would like to generate  space out of these such as:You see that I don't have repetitions here, each variable is enabled once per each of these iter's sequences. How can I do that using Python's ?
 with the  parameter is the simplest answer:The values of each variable will cycle fastest on the right, and slowest on the left, so you'll get:etc. This may be recognizable to you: It's just the binary representation of an incrementing 10 bit number. Depending on your needs, you may actually want to just do:then mask  with  to get the value of ,  for , and so on down to  (that is, ) for . If the goal is just to print them, you can even get more clever, by binary stringifying and then using  to insert the separator:
