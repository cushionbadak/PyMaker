I have made a piece of code that spits out prime numbers up to the 10001st number. It currently takes up 4 lines of code, and was wondering if I could condense it further? Here it is;I am aware that condensing code too much is usually not a good thing, but was wondering if it was possible.Thanks.
You can use a list comprehension and  to get a one-liner solution:It uses the fact that a divisor cannot be larger than the square root of the number it divies.It seems to work fine:
List comprehension[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]
