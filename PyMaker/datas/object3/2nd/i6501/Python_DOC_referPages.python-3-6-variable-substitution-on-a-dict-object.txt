I have the following dict object:I want to define elements of it from variables:How can I insert the variables into the dict?
In python 3.6+ you have f-strings.If you're using python 3.5 or older you can use format
All you need to do is add an  in front of the strings you want formatted. Documentation on f-strings.Also, I would use  to avoid KeyError's.
