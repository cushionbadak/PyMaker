Natural Text
I am having problems with this bit of codeIt returns this error Can anyone help me with this 
This code return list. List don't have attribute split. You should replace like thisBut better if you start using module csv for read this file.
The  module gives you this text parsing functionality, you do not need to do it yourself.The problem you have is that  does not exist, you are trying to use  but you already split it into a  of s. You would need to do it for every  in the list.
