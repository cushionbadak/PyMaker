I am using a FCC api to convert lat/long coordinates into block group codes:gives this output:The problem with this script is that I can only call the api once per row. It takes about 5 minutes per thousand for the script to run, which is not acceptable with 1,000,000+ entries I am planning on using this script with.I want to use multiprocessing to parallel this function to decrease the time to run the function. I have tried to look in to the multiprocessing handbook, but have not been able to figure out how to run the function and append the output in to an empty list in parallel. Just for reference: I am using python 3.6 Any guidance would be great! 
You do not have to implement the parallelism yourself, there are libraries better than urllib, e.g. requests [0] and some spin-offs [1] which use either threads or futures. I guess you need to check yourself which one is the fastest.Because of the small amount of dependencies I like the requests-futures best, here my implementation of your code using ten threads. The library would even support processes if you believe or figure out that it is somehow better in your case:[0] http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/[1] https://github.com/kennethreitz/grequests
