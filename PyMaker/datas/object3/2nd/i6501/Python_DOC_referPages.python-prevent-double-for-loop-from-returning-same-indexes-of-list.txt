I am currently working on problem 1 in Leetcode, named "Two Sum."Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such  that they add up to a specific target.You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and  you may not use the same element twice.Example: Given ,Because , return .My current code is:In this, nums is a list of integers, and the program must return two different indexes in a list, such that their true values add up to a given target. Although this works fine on most test cases, it fails on a list like [3,3] where both values are the same, and returns the same index twice, like [0,0] instead of returning the actual answer of [0,1]. Why is this happening?
There are multiple bugs in your code, not the least of which is a failure to use  instead of . For example,  is of course always 0.The focus of this answer is not to arrive at the most efficient solution, but to improve upon your specific approach. You can alternatively see the the O(n) solution instead.Understanding list comprehensionsAs a prerequisite, first understand how multiple  loops can exist in a list comprehension.The above is equivalent to:Solution using chained generator expressionExamples:Solution using generator expression with itertoolsIt's a tad simpler with :Examples:
