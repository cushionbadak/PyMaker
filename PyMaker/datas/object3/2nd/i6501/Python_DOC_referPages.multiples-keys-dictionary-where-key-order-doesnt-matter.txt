I am trying to create a dictionary with two strings as a key and I want the keys to be in whatever order.I want this piece of code to print 'something else'. Unfortunately, it seems that the ordering matters with tuples. What would be the best data structure to use as the key?
Use a Instead of a , which is ordered, you can use a , which is unordered, while still hashable as  is immutable.Which will print:Unfortunately, this simplicity comes with a disadvantage, since  is basically a “frozen” set. There will be no duplicate values in the , for example, If the trimming down of values doesn’t bother you, feel free to use But if you’re 100% sure that you don’t want what was mentioned above to happen, there are however two alternates:First method is to use a , and make it  by using  again: (Note: everything in the tuple must be hashable)Second method is to use the built-in function , and make it hashable by making it a . This will sort the values before being used as a key: (Note: everything in the tuple must be sortable and hashable)But if the tuple elements are neither all hashable, nor are they all sortable, unfortunately, you might be out of luck and need to create your own dict structure...

You can build your own structure:Output:
