When there is a call to  (as opposed to ), this wrecks the settings for the console logger:Where demo_module.py is:As you can see, inside  there is a call to  instead of .The output to the console looks like this:As you can see, the last two lines lose all the settings I originally set to the console handler, like the level, and the formatter.If it was only my code, I could find this offending  statement and replace it, but some of the code is not mine but third party and as such is beyond my control.Any idea how to make those settings stick?
By default module level logging functions will calling  to try to configure the root logger.  Docs:... module-level convenience functions, which delegate to the root logger, call basicConfig() to ensure that at least one handler is available. 's docs state:This function does nothing if the root logger already has handlers configured for it.So the solution is to configure the handlers on the root logger before any of the module level log functions get called, while also instructing your logger not to propagate messages up the logger hierarchy, to avoid duplicate output.Console output:File output:
