I have two tuples  and . I need to get the result as  since, 2 is the element that is present in  and not in . I referred this Find intersection of two lists? and Is there a way to get the difference and intersection of tuples or lists in Python? for getting an idea, but these are for lists and not for tuples. I am not able to use intersection() for tuples.Is there a way I can get  in python tuples?
Convert to  then you can get the difference, then convert it back to  using  function:Running example: https://repl.it/M1FD/1If you want the Symmetric Difference, elements in either set but not in the intersection:or:Running example: https://repl.it/M1FD/2
Sets are very useful for this.If you're only looking for elements that are in  but not in :If you're looking for elements that are in either one of the tuples, but not the other:
You can still use sets as described in the linked answer:
