In the paragraph "Descriptor Protocol" of “Descriptor HowTo Guide" of the Python 3.6 documentation there is writtenIf an instance’s dictionary has an entry with the same name as a  non-data descriptor, the dictionary entry takes precedenceMaybe I understand something wrong but why does the non-data descriptor has precedence over the instance entry in this exampleI expected that  will be outputted. However there was outputted .
That is not is what is meant by "name". Here the "name" refers to the name in the class  and in the instance , and not any name attribute the descriptor may have. See the following example for when the class descriptor gets overridden.
