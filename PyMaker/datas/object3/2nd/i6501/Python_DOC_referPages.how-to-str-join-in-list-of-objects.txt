Natural Text
I want that list of  objects to be "joinable" with str.join().Which special method should I implement to achieve this?Of course, I can extract first a list of text then join it, but it's not what I want.
 is only used if the user of your object wants to turn it into a string, and  doesn't. You have to explicitly convert your objects to  values before  will use them.(Could  have been defined to implicitly call  on each element in the iterable it receives as an argument? Sure. But it wasn't.)One of the tenets of Python is "Explicit is better than implicit". If you want to  to join the string representations of your objects, pass  objects to .The only way  will treat them as  objects implicitly is if they are  objects, which is to say if  is a subclass of .Beware of using inheritance where it isn't warranted, though.
