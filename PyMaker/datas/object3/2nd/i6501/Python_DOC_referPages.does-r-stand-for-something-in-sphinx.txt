Natural Text
I'm writing my docstring following the numpy docstring guidelines. Then I use sphinx's autodoc to generate my documentation. Within some docstrings I'm using LaTeX formulas (sphinx.ext.mathjax). It seems that  means something special like a new line. If I have the following command:it doesn't properly render. It puts like angle to a new line and gives me an error: Inline interpreted text or phrase reference start-string without end-stringIf I replace the \rangle with \langle everything works fine. How can I fix this?
The solution is to escape with a double slash or place a "r" (without the quotes) in from of the triple quotes, this disables the interpretation of the slashes inside the quotes:There are several prefixes that influence the definition of string literals, see the documentation of Python.Relevant excerpts:The backslash () character is used to escape characters that  otherwise have a special meaning, such as newline, backslash itself,  or the quote character.andBoth string and bytes literals may optionally be prefixed with a  letter 'r' or 'R'; such strings are called raw strings and treat  backslashes as literal characters. As a result, in string literals,  '\U' and '\u' escapes in raw strings are not treated specially.
