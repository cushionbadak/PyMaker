I am using  to set the same   on each of my handlers.Is there a way to set a global default format?Alternatively - is it possible to iterate though the handlers already added via  to a logger ?Another question mentions what the format is, but not how to set it.
The intended way is to attach the formatter to each handler as you're creating them.Since you're supposed to set up logging destinations in one, central place at the start of the main program, this isn't so taxing to do.E.g. this is the stock logging set-up code that I use in my scripts that are to be run autonomously:There are other methods but each has a downside:Each logger has an undocumented  list, but it only lists handlers connected to that logger directly. So, you need to iterate over this list for all loggers you have if you have multiple.There is a global undocumented  (references to all handlers are kept there to shut them down at exit). Likewise, that is an implementation detail.Finally, you can override a handler's init logic byreplacing  methods of  and/or subclass (that will affect everything else that uses ), or bysubclassing/addin a mixin to the required classes.That is probably an overkill.
If you have a number of handlers, you're advised to configure logging using the  API. This other answer shows how to configure formatters for handlers; you may be able to adapt it to your needs.
