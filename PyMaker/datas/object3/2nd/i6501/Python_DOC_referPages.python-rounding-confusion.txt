This code rounds 1.5 (value = 15) to 2 but also rounds 144.5 (value = 1445) to 144.  I dont understand why.This is my attempt to solve the codefights challenge "rounders".  Below is an explanation of whats being attempted.ExampleFor value = 15, the output should berounders(value) = 20;For value = 1234, the output should berounders(value) = 1000.1234 -> 1230 -> 1200 -> 1000.For value = 1445, the output should berounders(value) = 2000.1445 -> 1450 -> 1500 -> 2000.
This question is very similar to Strange behavior of numpy.round. What is written there about  is directly applicable to the builtin  method of python 3. Note that the behaviour of python 2 is different (as described in the post above. Thanks to ShadowRanger for pointing that out.)Have a look at the documentation of the  method: If two multiples are equally close, rounding is done toward the even choice.That is,You can write a rounding method with the intuitive behaviour with a simple if-statement:
