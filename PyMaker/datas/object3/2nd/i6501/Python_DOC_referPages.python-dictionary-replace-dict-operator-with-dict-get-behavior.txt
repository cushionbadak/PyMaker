I wish for  to behave the same as That way, if I do , I will not raise an error but get the default  value, the same way you would get it from In the case of  I could do  and it would act as When doing  it will act same as Is it possible to do so that I will not have to inherit from dict?
You can use a  object to add a new value to the dictionary each time you try to access a non-existing key:If you don't want the key added, create a subclass of  that implements the  method:This explicitly won't add new keys:If you wanted to chain  calls, you'll have to return an empty dictionary instead, otherwise  will fail with an attribute error (the first  returned won't have a  method).Generally speaking, it is better to stick to the default type and be explicit. There is nothing wrong with:Using a  or a  subclass with custom  hook have a downside: they will always produce a default when the key is missing, even when you accidentally produced incorrect keys somewhere else in your code. I often opt for an explicit  or  codepath over  precisely because I want a non-existing key to produce an error in other parts of my project.
