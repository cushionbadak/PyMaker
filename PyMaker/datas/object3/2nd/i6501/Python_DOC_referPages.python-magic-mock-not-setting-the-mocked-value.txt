I am writing python tests for the first time. I am trying to test a basic mock. I want to return some value that I want when I call the function, rather than a mock object.Here is the code: In views:In test:output:PS: I don't have my methods in a class and I don't want to change that.
You have a direct reference to  in your test module, and that reference is never patched. You only patched the reference in the  module.Your test would work if you used that reference instead of :However, a more meaningful test is to test the code that uses . You use mocking to be able to focus on the behaviour of a specific unit of code, where mocking lets you precisely control interactions with other units.In other words, if you have code like:then when testing  it makes sense to patch .I recommend you read up on how Python names work; I highly recommend Facts and myths about Python names and values, together with Where to patch in the  documentation.
