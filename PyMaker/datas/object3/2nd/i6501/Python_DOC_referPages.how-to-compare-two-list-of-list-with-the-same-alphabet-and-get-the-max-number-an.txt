I got this two list of list:and I want to compare these two lists by alphabet and append the list with the max number into a new list C?EDIT:I got this code but it only outputs
 cannot work in this case, because elements of  can be used anywhere in . The iterable returned by  only has as many elements as the shortest list.You need to keep 's order in , so  should stay a list but  should be a dict:You can then use a list comprehension to get the max values:
First create a dictionary holding the max values in  taking care to ensure to deal with any possible duplicates in the list. Then create  using a list comprehension based on the the largest value found in  and the current value:Giving you:In the example you gave,  contains unique values, but if there happened to be multiple entries for the same letter, this solution will ensure the maximum is used.
