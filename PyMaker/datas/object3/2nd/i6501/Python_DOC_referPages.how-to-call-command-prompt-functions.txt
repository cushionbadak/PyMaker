The python documentation for this is very dry, I was wondering if you guys could help me.My goal is to make python execute commands that I would normally execute in the command prompt. (I'm running windows)If I runIt opens the command prompt. Is there a way to get the program to write in something like "dir C"?
You can use the os library:If you want to open a new command prompt and run a command in it, then I can't help you there. I tried to figure that out for macOS a while ago to no avail.
