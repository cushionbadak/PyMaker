Natural Text
Im new to python and I have (maybe) a dumb question.I have to XOR two value. currently my values look like this:v1 = v2 = but the thing is, i need to XOR the actual HEX value instead of the ascii value of the given character in the string.so for example:the first byte in the first string is , in the second string this will not work, because it gives back the ASCII value of each character (then XOR them), which is obviously differs from the actual hex value.
Your mistake is converting the characters to their ASCII codepoints, not to integer values.You can convert them using  and  instead: interprets the input string as a hexadecimal value.  outputs a hexadecimal string for the given integer.You can do this without  by just taking the whole strings as one big integer number:To make sure leading  characters are not lost, the above uses  to format the resulting integer to the right length of zero-padded hexadecimal.
Parse the strings into int's then xor the ints:
