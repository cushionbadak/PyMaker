From https://stackoverflow.com/a/44880260  doesn't support instance attributes because it is the base for all custom Python classes, which must support not having a  attribute when defining slots instead.Does "it" in "it is the base for all custom Python classes" mean class  or its instance ? I guess class ?Since it is  instead of  which is the base for all custom Python classes, is it also  instead of  which must support the instances of some custom Python classes not having a  attribute when the classes defining  instead?So how shall I understand that  not having  is to support the instances of some custom Python classes not having a  attribute when the classes defining  instead?Thanks.
Per the "Notes on using ":When inheriting from a class without , the  attribute of that class will always be accessible, so a  definition in the subclass is meaningless.The wording is a little imprecise; technically, since all classes inherit from  (which lacks ), that would imply that instances would all have , but what they really mean to say is that if  is not suppressed on instances at every level of the inheritance tree (by failing to provide  for built-in types like , or suppressing it with  on user-defined classes), then a  will exist for instances of the first class in the tree that fails to suppress , and for all of its subclasses, even if they try to use  to suppress .Basically, if  instances had , all instances of all classes would have it as well; by suppressing it on , the subclasses of  (read: All classes) retain the option to have  or not.
Yes, your understanding is correct. Subclasses of  may not want a  for their instances, but if  instances had one, their subclass instances will have one too.The issue is mostly that  is the parent class of all other classes in Python. If it was designed so that its instances had a , that  would be inherited by all instances of all classes.
