While working with some code given to me by my professor to use in an assignment, I cannot change per instructions. I've been looking around and added closing around the initial write but is there to prevent modify the starter code?The code came from: Calling Code:Function Code:Error Message:I put the fix under the imports and it works!Fix (Update):
You are using a  instance inside a  statement. For it to work properly, Wave_write must be a context manager, meaning it must implement both methods  and . That is not the case here. You must either add the  method to Wave_write, or remove the with statement and close the input manually (if needed). Example:See https://docs.python.org/2/reference/compound_stmts.html#with and  https://docs.python.org/2/library/contextlib.html
The  keyword in this lineimplies that  has been written as a context manager, but it hasn't. Take out the  and do this instead:
If that code was given to you by your professor then he was using python3, where the object returned by  can be used as a context manager. You seem to be using python2, where that wasn't the case.You should use the same version as your professor, otherwise you'll run into such problems all the time. So you should probably switch to python3.
for me the work around is to add below code as mentioned by JD Smith in the above thread (AttributeError: Wave_write instance has no attribute '__exit__'). this works for me. just add these lines of code below your import statement and it will work. make sure you add (import wave statement)
