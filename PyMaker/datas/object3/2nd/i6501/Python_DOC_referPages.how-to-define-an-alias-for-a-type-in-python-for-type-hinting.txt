How to define an alias for a type to use type hint:Which means Ticker is a type of string and Report is a dict from Ticker to a list. Thank you. The good thing about this aliasing is that anyone knows that it is a ticker. Much clear and more readable than writing Report = typing.Dict[str, typing.List]
As you do with all other names that you bind to objects:See https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#type-aliases
