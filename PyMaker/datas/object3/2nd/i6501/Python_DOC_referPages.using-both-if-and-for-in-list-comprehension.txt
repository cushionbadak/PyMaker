I have an array, a=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7], and I am trying to find the index of all the values which are less than 6 and greater than 2, using list comprehension.I am using the following technique:It keeps saying that there is a syntax error at 'for'.Any idea how to resolve this? Or what am I doing wrong?
This should be enough to do the trick:
Below code will work I have modified 3 things here:way we should call list comprehension with if conditionrather than using [b] used a[b]used and rather than &Hope this will help
The placement of the condition in a comprehension has always been a point of much confusion to me as well, so I came up with a working mnemonic device.If you are excluding elements from the list,  belongs to the loop, and goes after the :If you are deciding between values, that's just a normal ternary operator, which appears as part of the comprehension before the :Your case is clearly the first one since you are excluding elements. The test should therefore go after the , with appropriate syntax fixes:It might be more intuitive to implement the same operation using  to get the indices instead of :
