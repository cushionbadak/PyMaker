I have a function I've written to take a list of arbitrary values and to split it at certain values into sublists. Basically, I want to take a list and split it at all occurrences of a specific value, returning a list of sublists. I figured the easiest way to do this would be via a recursive function as below.The function should work like this:Unfortunately I get the following output:I'm sure there's a way to handle this, but I have tried as many combinations I can think of and none seem to work for me.
I don't think recursion is the easiest way to do this, when you can use :Also keep in mind that recursion is not cheap.
As someone already pointed out, recursive function might not be the best way (at least in python) for this specific task. But since you asked, here is the code with recursive call to generate the exact output you expected.==>
