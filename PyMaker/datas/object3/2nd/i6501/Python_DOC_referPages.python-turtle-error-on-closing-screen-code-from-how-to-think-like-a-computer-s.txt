The object returned by  is intended to be a singleton so your code is actively fighting the module design. Accourding to the docs you should be using an instance of  in applications.
Another approach is to work within turtle and avoid tkinter when possible.  In the following solution, instead of destroying the window and making a new one, we simply clear it and draw anew:This should also be compatible with both Python 2.7 and Python 3
