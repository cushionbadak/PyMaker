I am trying to get data from evernote 'shared notebook'.For example, from this one: https://www.evernote.com/pub/missrspink/evernoteexamples#st=p&n=56b67555-158e-4d10-96e2-3b2c57ee372cI tried to use Beautiful Soup:The result doesn't contain any text information from the notebook, only some code.I also seen an advice to use selenium and find elements by XPath. For example I want to find the head of this note - 'Term 3 Week2'. In Google Chrome i found that it's XPath is '/html/body/div[1]/div[1]/b/span/u/b'.So i tried this:But it also didn't work, the result was 'NoSuchElementException:... '.I am a newbie in python and especially parsing, so I would be glad to receive any help.I am using python 3.6.2 and jupiter-notebook.Thanks in advance.
The easiest way to interface with Evernote is to use their official Python API.After you've configured your API key and can generally connect, you can then download and reference Notes and Notebooks.Evernote Notes use their own template language called ENML (EverNote Markup Language) which is a subset of HTML. You'll be able to use BeautifulSoup4 to parse the ENML and extract the elements you're looking for.If you're trying to extract information against a local installation (instead of their web app) you may also be able to get what you need from the executable. See how to pass arguments to the local install to extract data. For this you're going to need to use the Python3  module.HOWEVERIf you want to use selenium, this will get you started:
