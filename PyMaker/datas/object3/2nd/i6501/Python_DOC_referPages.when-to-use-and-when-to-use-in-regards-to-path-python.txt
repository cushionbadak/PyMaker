I have a few questions regarding to the path in Python using  module:(1) If using  module, is there any difference between  and  in regards to the absolute path of a file? For examples:a. Can  and  both work?  b. Can  and  both work?(2) When using the  module in Python, if I'm getting this right, it seems in some situations we have to use , and the other situations we have to use . How to tell the difference?
You would be safe with always sticking to forward slashesIf you use windows style, you need to escape them or use a raw stringIn general, stick to doing as much as you can in the  module, it will handle these OS-specific issues fairly robustly. For example you can pass a path to  and it will normalize your slashes to whatever platform you're on. Similarly building up paths with  will insert the correct slashes for your system.
