This question already has an answer here:Insert column using openpyxl                    2 answers                i am not able to find any method in openpyxl that allows for inserting a new blank column with a known column letter or index from current cell properties.  for instance, if i am searching through cells on rows and find a cell that has cell.column value of "E" and want to insert a new column before column E, i don't see any function or method for inserting a new column within openpyxl.  is this possible at all or is there any known working method for doing so ?UPDATE:so i tried the test code as is from Insert column using openpyxl .and it fails on following lines. i'm using python 2.7 and openpyxl 2.4.8File "C:/Users/me/Desktop/my.py", line 30, in     column_letter, row = coordinate_from_string(coordinate)  File "C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\openpyxl\utils\cell.py", line 45, in coordinate_from_string    match = COORD_RE.match(coord_string.upper())AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'upper'
Looping could shuffle values to the right, but you already knew that. I assume you weren't happy with cycles spent on interpretive overhead to copy in that way. It might look like:There is support for pandas dataframes. Consider turning worksheet into a df, inserting a column, then spitting out a new .xlsx.Using array slicing with a csv.writer may prove simpler.None of this deals with the sticky wicket of adjusting formula references.
