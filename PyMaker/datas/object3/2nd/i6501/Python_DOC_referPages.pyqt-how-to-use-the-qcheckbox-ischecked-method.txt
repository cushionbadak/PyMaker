The Below code is written to select the seats in an auditorium screen.. As I select the CheckBox i need the result to be displayed(Price of the Ticket) and also when I try to uncheck the CheckBox the result should be subtracted and displayed, Instead of this It's just keeps adding the result by 180 ... 
There is a problem in how you connect the  signal to the  slot. When you connect signals in a loop, the variables are not cached, so every  will end up with the same values (i.e. whatever the final values of the variables are when the loop exits). There are several ways to fix this. One way is to explicitly cache the values using default arguments:Another way is to use :But even simpler in your case, would be to use , which returns whatever object sent the signal:(PS: note that I've swapped the  because I think they are the wrong way around in your example code)
