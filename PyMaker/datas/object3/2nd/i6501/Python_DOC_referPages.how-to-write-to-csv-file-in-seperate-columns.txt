Natural Text
I am trying to write a code which asks a user for a username and password and then stores these into a csv file in 2 seperate columns. I have tried lots of different methods but cannot seem to do it :/This is one way I've tried but it writes every single letter in a different column like this:b o b , p a s s w o r d Instead of this:bob, passwordThanks in advance if you can offer any help :)
You should specify a delimiter of ','. https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.htmlAlso, storying passwords in plain-text is Very Bad Practice (TM).
It looks like in this line you're doing the comma yourself, that is what the csv writer will do for your (as @Pipupnipup said, specify a delimeter)You should just pass writerow a list and let it handle the newline and comma:And to iterate: Storing passwords in plain-text is Very Bad Practice (TM).
Working code:
In relation to your stated problem .writerow() requires a sequence ('', (), []).As you were passing strings not a sequence writerow() iterates over each letter in your string and each letter is written to a separate cell in the CSV. By giving [username, newpassword] you provide a sequence. Also, note that you are passing the original Username, as the entered string, not the concatenation of username + birthyear which you return to the user as their username.
