In , does  mean instances of ?does  mean  is an attribute of instances of ? But it is listed by  as an attribute of .Why are some attributes ( e.g.  and ) of  not mentioned with , while others are?Re: "note:  is basically the repr of these descriptors"Why is  not shown in the following example?
These are s which are computed attributes (descriptors implemented in C) for instances of the class . Documentation on these is minimal (or I can't seem to find it :-), but, you can take a look at  in the  that talks a bit about these:An optional pointer to a static NULL-terminated array of PyGetSetDef structures, declaring computed attributes of instances of this type.For each entry in the array, an entry is added to the typeâ€™s dictionary (see tp_dict below) containing a getset descriptor.The objects that don't have  (note:  is basically the  of these descriptors) are simply not descriptors ( is usually a string or  if not defined while  holds the name of the module in which the class was defined).Re: "note:  is basically the repr of these descriptors"Why is  not shown in the following example?To address this update that I missed.Because that's a descriptor implemented in Python and inherits the default  from . The  function of the s implemented in  uses a different , mainly in order to distinguish them (I'd assume).
