I have little python code to work with date and time and I need to ask  question to modify the script. The script is provided below, As I print out the result, I get the values like How do I keep to the 3 digits after the decimal like ? 
If youâ€™re just interested in the string keeping only the first 3 digits in the microseconds, you can just use string splicing.A better method which is what ShadowRanger mentioned in the comments, that uses  to format directly to ISO 8601 with an additional milliseconds time spec. But unfortunately the  argument was only recently added in Python 3.6.
