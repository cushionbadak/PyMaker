I have webscraped data into a pickle file and want to write that data into a sqlite3 database. Can anybody help me out with what needs to be done?
You need to create a column of type  (which is a supported datatype in Sqlite3).Then, you can just  with the binary dump of your pickle object.Here's a walk through on Sqlite3 inserts. will convert the object into a byte-string you can store in the database.  will turn it back after being 'd from the database.You can also consider using  for more complex objects.
