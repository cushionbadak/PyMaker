Natural Text
I used the following code to do so:there are two problems:the first is that my result on each row is like: each character takes a cell, so cat would be c  a  t   taking 3 columns. If I change the last row of my code to   each word will take a cell, but the results are in different columns rather than different rows.Another problem is that even though I specified count = 400, I have 700 words in my csv, I don't know why. TRACK_TERM should be a list of strings, and I want the length of the list to be 400
