Can't think of a fitting title for my question.So anyway, I've been looking for an algorithm to find out if a list is balanced or not and I've came across this question: Algorithm for finding if an array is balanced One of the answers is spot-on to what I need to accomplish. I would however, like to understand what happens if I change line 2 from the below code.I would like to know why it throws a TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable if I do this to line 2:Hope someone can help me understand.Thanks! 
The "numbers" variable you're passing in is an int.You can't do sum(1) for example but you can do sum([1,2]) or sum((1,2))The variable you pass to balanced must be an iterable type.  AKA a list, a tuple, a set, etc.Unrelated to your error: You should not be doing but rather If you want to mimic what the function was doing.For more on the left_total, right_total issue see: Is there a standardized method to swap two variables in Python?https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#evaluation-order
