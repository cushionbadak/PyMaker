Is there a way to just open/create  and extend this file with an existing file?I think about something like the  from function for listsLike so:I know that i can read the existing file and write that to a variable/list and "paste" it in the new file but im curious if there is an easier option like this...
This will append the contents of  onto . If you're dealing with binary data you can change the mode on each to  and .If the contents of the file are large you can do it in chunks too.
You can't merge file objects. You can make a list of each file and extended themWill return a list with all the lines in  appended to , but in a new list. You can then save it to a new file, or overwrite one of the files.
