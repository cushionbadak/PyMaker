I have a proprietary repository format and I'm trying to develop a Python module to process these repositories. Repo format goes as:Here,  is a project.  and  are folders inside this project and they represent groups in this project. A group is a container in this repo and what it represents is really not relevant for this question. The repo  also has files in its root level;  is an example of such a file.I have a class called  that abstracts projects such as . The  class has a method  that builds an in-memory representation.To unit test the  method by mocking the file system, I have:This does mock  successfully. But I can't trick Python to treat  as consisting of files and directories.How do I mock either  or , in the same test, such that the test will see  and  as directories and  as a file?
You could use pyfakefs, it is a very handy lib to test operates on a fake file system.if you use pytest, it has a plugin, all file system functions already got patched, you just need to use its  fixture:or if you prefer :
I managed to achieve the desired behavior by passing an iterable to the  attribute of the mocked  object.The key is the  line. The boolean values in the iterable should match the order of directory and file entries passed to the  attribute.
It will depend, of course, on exactly which  functions you use, but it looks like  on  is just what you need.  (Note that you may not need to patch ; many of its functions are lexical-only and do not care about the actual filesytem.)
