I have a CSV file of 1 GB with around 1 million records, each row is 171 columns, I did some research and came up with this code. I have reduced the size of file to 5 MB for testing purposes, but there are still 171 columns. The code works fine as long as the sorting column index is below 50. Even on 49 it works fine, but I have columns with index 151, 153. I want to sort the file with those columns.Error:When I give it index 50 or above it throws the error:My Code:
You can handle the short row by writing your own version of  which you can base on the code equivalent to it which is shown in its online documentation.The custom version below simply supplies a specified value for any that are missing. This will cause the row to be sorted as though it had that value in it at that indexed position.Note: That this assumes all the missing items should use the same default  value. If that's not the case, it could be enhanced to allow a different one to be specified for each index in the sequence of them passed to it. This would likely require an additional argument.
It seems that one of your files contains a truncated row below 51 columns.If you don't care about your input being corrupt, you could filter it out while reading the input & sort it, in one line:
