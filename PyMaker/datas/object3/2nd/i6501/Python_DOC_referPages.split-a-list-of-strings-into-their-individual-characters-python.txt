Let's say I have a list:I want to split these strings into their characters so I can assign values to each character (I.E. f = 5, o = 15, and so on).How might I decompose these lists? I was thinking of turning each element into its own list, and referring to each element as an item of that list, but I am not sure how to go about doing that. 
Strings are iterable in Python, so you can just loop through them like this:
try doing for range function for each wordsit will print each items.if you want to create the list of each letters,try
If This Is What Your Looking For Here You Go:
Maybe that's what you want to convert into list of characters:
You can use one line solution :result :
Join the entire list to each charactermy_list = ['foo', 'bar', 'bak']result = list(''.join(my_list))result['f', 'o', 'o', 'b', 'a', 'r', 'b', 'a', 'k']now you can iterate through result to assign value to each character
