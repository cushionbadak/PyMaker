In Python I'm trying to create a file if it doesn't exist, then open it in read/write mode. The most succinct way I've been able to express this is with the following:Is there a better way to do this? Should I just check , create the file if it doesn't exist, then open the file in "r+" mode?In essence:
The second option is a bit iffy, as testing before the open leave you open to race conditions if your program isn't the only user / consumer of the file.I would probably use a+ and seek back to the beginningSomething else to consider I guess would be to just ditch the python file object and use os directly.This would require a bunch more code as you'll have to keep track of file handles manually which may be more of a pain than what you're doing with the "with" context management. 
The main question is whether you want to truncate the file if it already exists.If so, then do:Otherwise, do what juanpa.arrivillaga suggested:The "a+" opens the file and starts at the end of the file. Check the documentation for more on how this works.
