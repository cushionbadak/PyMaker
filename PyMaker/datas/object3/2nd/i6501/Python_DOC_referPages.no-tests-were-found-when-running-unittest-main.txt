I have a test file and a main module file in which there's a function I'm testing. At the end of my test file, I have  to run the unit tests. However, When I run the test file, the console shows "No tests were found" , even though I have 2 unit tests in my file (see screenshot below and source code at the end).This problem seems to go away when I:(1) Enclose the  inside an  (tangent: I sort of understand how this clause works, but it makes no sense for me in this case, when the  module runs properly when there's an if clause, versus when there's no coditional at all), OR(2) When I run my test program in Spyder (I'm currently using Pycharm)Therefore, I'm not quite sure this is an issue specific to my IDE or to my code. I've tried the recommended fix from this Q&A but none worked. If you have any idea on what I should do/configure to get  running properly, I'd really appreciate it!For your reference, here are the 2 files in my program; my test file returns no test as opposed to the 2 tests that I'd programmed for it.---Main file: city_functions.py------Test file: test_cities.py---
As a beginner using Pycharm, Don Kirkby's answer helped me the most.  The solution, at least for me was to simply remove  from the file altogether. It appears that Pycharm is using the command  by default whenever the test is run and  method is messing up the syntax.I hope this helps anyone else who came here with the same problem.
There are two ways to launch  tests. One is with the  method that you're using, but I always use the command-line interface instead. The  command will find tests in a bunch of files and run them all together.I'm not sure why  isn't working for you, but I would suggest using the other method anyway.
