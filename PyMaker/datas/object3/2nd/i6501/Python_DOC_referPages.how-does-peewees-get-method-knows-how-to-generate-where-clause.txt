Python's peewee orm library allows me to query database using the  method like this:This query will filter the resultset based on Person's name doing a sql  behind the scenes.I know the expression  is evaluated first and the  method receives just a boolean value.How does the  method inspect it's arguments to detect that the filter needs to be applyed to the 'name' field ?PS: I read peewee's source but couldn't have any clue how it does that.
I know the expression  is evaluated first and the  method receives just a boolean value.I don't know Peewee specifically but I do know how this sort of thing is done.Basically, the second part of your sentence isn't true.  is of a custom type. Its  method doesn't return just a Boolean value, but rather an object that contains information on what comparison was actually done. (This class might even derived from  so it works like a Boolean in other contexts.) Its other rich comparison methods are similar.But how does  know that its name is ? The answer to that is that  probably doesn't actually have a  attribute. Instead, it has a  method that returns the  object, which is the custom class that has the  method I just described.Since  receives the name of the attribute, it can bake that name into the value it returns for . Then the custom  method on  returns a Boolean-like object that contains some representation of  inside it. And  uses this representation to put together the query.
