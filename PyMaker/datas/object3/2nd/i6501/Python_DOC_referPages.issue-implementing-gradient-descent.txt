I'm implementing gradient descent from scratch and I've got a segment of code which is giving me trouble.It's not changing . If I print  just after the assignment of  then it gets changed, but somehow the third line in which I assign  reverts  back to initial value. I assume this has something to do with how arrays are referenced, but I can't wrap my head around it.
You should use  to copy objects and create a new memory value and a new pointer :https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html
