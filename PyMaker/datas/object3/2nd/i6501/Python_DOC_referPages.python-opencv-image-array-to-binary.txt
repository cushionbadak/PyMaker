I have a large image , using cv2 module in python and some coordinates i cropped the image:now the crop_img is a numpy.ndarray type. then I save this image to disk and read its contents in a binary format using an open() functionand I get the binary representation.Is there any way to do the above operations without saving the image to disk. Not saving to disk will save a lot of time, I am not able to find any method to do this. if anyone could point in the right direction, that would be helpful.
found the answer on this thread:Python OpenCV convert image to byte string?converting a image represented through a numpy array into string can be done by using imencode and tostring functions in cv2
