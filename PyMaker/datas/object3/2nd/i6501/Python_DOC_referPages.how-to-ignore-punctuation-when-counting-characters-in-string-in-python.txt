Natural Text
In my homework there is question about write a function words_of_length(N, s) that can pick unique words with certain length from a string, but ignore punctuations.  what I am trying to do is:so my problem is that I don't know how to remove punctuation , I did view "best way to remove punctuation from string" and relevant questions, but those looks too difficult in my lvl and also because my teacher requires it should contain no more than 2 lines of code.  sorry that I can't edit my code in question properly, it's first time i ask question here, there much i need to learn, but pls help me with this one. thanks.
First of all, you need to create a new string without characters you want to ignore (take a look at string library, particularly ), and then  the resulting string (sentence) into substrings (words). Besides that, I suggest using type annotation, instead of comments like those.Alternatively, instead of  you can define a variable with the characters you want to ignore yourself. 
Use string.strip(s[, chars])https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.htmlIn you function replace x with strip (x, ['.',   ',', ':', ';', '!', '?']Add more punctuation if needed
You can remove punctuation by using .
