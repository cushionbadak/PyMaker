Natural Text
This question was answered/resolved in the comments section.I am a noob to Python and I wrote the code below thinking it would copy all the rows with "NY" as the state in the state field/column to a new csv file called "Output.csv".Everything runs fine but the output csv is completely blank. The first tab is named "Output" but the sheet is blank. If I have it output to txt, that is blank as well. Any suggestions?
