I have the following two dimensional array: I want to sort the array by & time, is there a fast way to do that in python?thanks in advance andy
You can sort by first transforming the dates into ISO8601 format  (as opposed to transforming to actual dates with  which is pretty slow) and then break ties using the already standardised time string: builds a list of the ISO date from the original date string, bringing the year first, month next and then date.
As mentioned in this answer, you should use itemgetter for this purpose.To sort your data by time, use this:If you need to sort by date (year), you need to define a separate function or use a lamda. I have written both solutions:This way you don't rely on a third party package import.
very short and neat code than others given above
