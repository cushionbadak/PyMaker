Natural Text
I am incredibly new to programing, my professor gave me this bit of python code with a clear error on the second to last line, I am not sure how to write this code so that it doesn't error out? things I have tried:This returns [3 4 5 6 7] but apparently this is wrong. After this I'm not sure of any other way to express what my professor wants? I have asked her to clarify but nothing helps :/Here is the original codeAny ideas?Thanks!
You're missing parenthesis: should work. 
You need to understand the nature of operator precedence in Python. The  has higher precedence than  or , so the original expression is essentially evaluating:This is clearly not what you want. You want to evaluate , then , then combine them. Also, your desired range is 3 to 7 inclusive, so:Also note that some of these operators behave a bit differently for Numpy arrays than they would for standard Python objects. You will need to play around with this to get a feel for it, or read the relevant docs. For example:So this evaluates whether each item in the array is > 3, and returns an array of boolean values.
