I have a Windows machine so I' trying to have Travis CI run my python scripts directly from github. Is it possible to run Travis CI python scripts directly from my github and not from my local repository?
You can integrate TracisCI to your GItHub repoThat way, on each push, your associated TravisCI job will run and execute what you have specified.Regarding your , it has to respect the yaml syntax format:See Building a Python Project: you will see a space between  and  version.Regarding the  error, see "unittest installation error Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement" is a standard module, which you don't need to install.
