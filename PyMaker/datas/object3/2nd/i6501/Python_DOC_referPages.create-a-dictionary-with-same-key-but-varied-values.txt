I'm studying GridSearch method to adjust the parameters of Desicion tree model or random forest model. After reading the example of boston housing price, I found I can't run the code of the example. The following code is the GridSearch code of the example. The problem is  I searched certain examples, however, the variable  in these examples are almost defined in the same format which can lead to this error. I think the writer want to create a dictionary with key is always is "max_depth" but the value will vary from 1 to 10. I have no clue to solve this problem. Could someone can help me?
My theory is: the  module has been designed for python 2 where: generates a so there ain't no  type to check againstSo passing a  from Python 3 is a cornercase that doesn't work, with a confusing message.I think I found the reason (and the fix) by looking at the source code, around line 348:in python 3,  is a sequence but since it doesn't generate a  anymore, it is not accepted by  because the code tests for object types explicity (so the error message is slightly off if you ask me :)). Also, I'm pretty sure that if the code also included  in the type test, the rest of the code would work very well, since  emulates very closely a , without generating any.A fix would be to force iteration, for instance like:( or  array would work as well)To fix , one could do:  (but that may break in python 2, and there may exist some python 2/3 compatibility requirements here)The other fixes would be:don't perform any check, let Python decide when using the methods (better ask forgiveness than permission)just use  as  already accepts a , no need for the complex construct with the list comprehension generating booleans.
