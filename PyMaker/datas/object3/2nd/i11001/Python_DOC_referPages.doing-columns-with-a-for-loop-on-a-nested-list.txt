I'm trying to get:from this:in Python.... I can't for the life of me solve it.
You can just use nested loops to print chunks out like that. Here's an example:
This should produce exactly the same output as in the question:Update: For every chunk it will first convert numbers to strings with  and then right justify them with  that uses space as default fill char. Since the first number on the row has width of  and rest of them have width of   is used to track the index so that correct argument can be passed to . Enumerate returns tuples in form  and the index is then used in  to determine if number is first or not so width of  or  can be used respectively. Finally all the substrings are joined together for a row which is printed to screen.
