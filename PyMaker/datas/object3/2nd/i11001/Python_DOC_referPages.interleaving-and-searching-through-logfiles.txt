I have multiple GB of logfiles which I want to search through. Every log has a timestamp, message and additional multiple fields, so each log consists of multiple lines looking like this:Note that this way two logs are separated by a single empty line. Unfortunately only single logfiles are ordered by time, two different logfiles must be interleaved to get the whole ordered line of logs. This is the first thing I want to achieve.Further I want to search on logs. This basically means that I want to define search terms and grep on each single log. All search terms need to match. So in the end I want have an ordered set of logs which meet my search terms.I tried to get through this by using the context search of grep but the missing order by time and the fixed context size made it a pain. So I want to ask if there is some Bash or Python magic to let this happen. Every hint is highly appreciated!
I would definitely recommend that you would look at regular expressions, they have all the things you need! You could make a script that compiles the regex template and then use  < Just an example, you have to fill in your own logs and templates.Hope this helps you...
