Suppose I have an object of the structure:For example,  could check for overlap or for equality or for "is friend".Now I'll have a list of those objects:Now, for each element which matches other elements, I d like to keep only one of those mutually matching elements.Remark and clarification:So far, the task is ambiguous: If A and B match, and B and C match, but A and C do not match, then we could keep A and C or we could keep B. It's not important, which decision the algorithm will take. The important thing is, that there are no matching elements in the final list. Two questions:What is the pythonic way to do so?Does this problem have a name?
Regarding: What is the pythonic way to do so?The pythonic way is to rename your  method to .Then you can do things like  with your custom object.A very pythonic way to make a list contain unique items is then:Edit:  is not needed and will default to Does this problem have a name?One could look for "equivalence classes".
