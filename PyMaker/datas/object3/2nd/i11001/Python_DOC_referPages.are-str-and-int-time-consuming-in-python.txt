I face myself using a lot of this kind of structure:So, my questions is: what does python(3+) uses when  or , for example, are called? It just casts? It converts? (something else?)How would you advice me to write this kind of code? Keep in mind that the key for dists must be a  and  is also a .
How expensive  and  are depend entirely on the objects that you pass to them.  Ultimately, they just call the object's  and  hook methods.  For most simple objects, these operations should be pretty fast.  e.g. to convert a simple string to an integer takes my computer about .5 microseconds:and the reverse operation only takes a little over .1 microseconds:however, it's very easy to create pathological objects for which this would be really expensive.
