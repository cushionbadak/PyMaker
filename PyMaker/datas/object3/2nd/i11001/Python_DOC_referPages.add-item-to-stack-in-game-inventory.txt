I've tried working on this problem for over an hour and a half and I've finally capitulated. Try as I might, I cannot get like items to stack in an inventory.In detail, I randomly generate a 'drop', which has a name and a quantity stored in an array. 'drops' is a 2d array which holds these sub-arrays. I'm trying to search for this drop in a player's inventory which has a quantity as well, which would increase when the drop is added to it...if it worked perfectly.Output (repeatedly pressing enter):As you can see, because the quantity doesn't match the amount it's searching for, it just adds a new one. Any idea how to fix this?
A better data type for this kind of thing would be to use  for the inventory because it can keep track of quantities given a key (item):Here is an example of the output:
You didn't state which Python version you're using. Based on your  syntax, I assume it's Python 3.x, right? If so, this might be an ideal use case for the  class from the  module. A  object is basically a dictionary that stores integer numbers as values. The advantage over a standard dictionary like the one suggested by @Alden is that you don't have to initialize a key the first time it is encountered:
