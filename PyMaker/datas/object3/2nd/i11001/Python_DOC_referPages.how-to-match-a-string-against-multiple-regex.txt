At the moment I am using the below filter to increment elements in arr, given a list of strings as an argument, is there an efficient way to do this in python.I got millions of such lists to validate upon.
For the regular expressions given in the question, you can use following regular expression using character class: will match any of , , , ,  can be omitted because  matches only at the beginning of the string.removed  because it's pointless; only one  is enough to check  appear after the .And instead of using array, you can use a dictionary; no need to remember indexes:Instead of , you can use .
Don't use regex for this. You are checking for a very specific, fixed condition. Namely,   and . Both of these are much faster than regex. The later can also be used as a mapping.
