You can use the  function which comes builtin in python (https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#round)From the documentation:Note the behaviour of  for floats can be surprising: for  example,  gives  instead of the expected  . This is not a bug: it’s a result of the fact that most decimal  fractions can’t be represented exactly as a float. See Floating Point  Arithmetic: Issues and Limitations for more information.
You want to use the round() builtin.You haven't specified whether or not you are using Python 2 or 3, but note that in Python3,  does bankers rounding: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#round.
You can use :
You can use the round() method for this. The round() method takes two parameters. round(a, b). a is the the floating number whereas b is the number of decimal places up to which you want.will give you an answer of 60.23P.S This is python 2.7In python 3 you can usefor more information go to https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.htmlHope this helps :)
