I currently have  2 "set" lists, both contain mostly the same values i.e:What I'm trying to do is compare the two and only return 7 & 8 into another list however I'm having no luck, I've tried a few methods I've found on here such as:However I've had no luck does anyone know a quick and fairly easy method of doing this? Both lists have been "set" previously to remove any duplicates within their own lists also (just felt I should add that if that makes a difference)Just to be clear, as I think I wasn't sorry, the example values are already in set format, in my head for some reason when you used set on a list it acted like the array_unique PHP function.Thanks.
You can use sets:Or more explicitly:For symmetric difference, you can use . It will return elements that are in a or b, but not in both. Assume  has an additional element, 9:Or,If they are already sets, you can just do  or .Your attempt does not work because there is no item in  which is not in . For that difference (), you need: .
Another approach is using a   to count the number of occurrences of each element from both lists:Output:
