When creating a function in PyCharm an error occurred as I tried to use a statement (in my case the try statement) as a parameter. I also do get an error at second line due to Python tries to resolve the try as well.and since the PEP8 name conventions I 'cannot' change the parameter to uppercase.Is there any way to circumvent this issue?
 is a keyword in Python used in the  statement. You cannot use keywords as a name.You need to use another name. Appending an underscore is a very common practice.
