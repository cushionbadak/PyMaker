I have a string that could be parsed as a json or dict object. My string variable looks like this :When I do , I have a dict but only the second value of the key "b" is kept, which is normal because a dict can't contain duplicate keys.What would be the best way to have some sort of defaultdict like this :I have already looked for similar questions but they all deal with dicts or lists as an input and then create defaultdicts to handle the duplicate keys.In my case I have a string variable and I would want to know if there is a simple way to achieve this :)Thank you ^^        
something like the following can be done.Please note that above code depends on value type, . So if original string itself gives a list then there could be some error handling required to make the code robust.
