I've been having trouble finding alternative ways in which Python can be ran with the -O flag. Are there any other ways besides including in a script that calls the IDLE and .py file?Is a script necessary? Can it be included in the .py file itself?
You can set an environment variable. From the  switch documentation:Turn on basic optimizations. This changes the filename extension for compiled (bytecode) files from  to . See also .Bold emphasis mine. The linked  environment variable documentation states:If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying the  option. If set to an integer, it is equivalent to specifying  multiple times.There are no other methods of enabling this mode, so yes, you need to either invoke Python with the command line switch from another script, or use something to set the environment variable before running Python. You can't enable it from the  file as it needs to be enabled before the Python code is parsed and compiled.Note that the only thing  does is omit  statements from the code being run, and to set the  global constant to  (it is set to  otherwise). If  was specified twice, docstrings are removed from the bytecode too, giving you slightly smaller bytecode files.
