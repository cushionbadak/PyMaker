I only know how to enter strings and numbers, but is there a way to enter a list? Basically, I have a dictionary and each key is being put into the database. The value to each key is a list and I want this in the database as well. 
SQLite3 does not have array data type. (See Datatypes in SQLite version 3)But, you can serialize to insert it to sqlite3 table.For example, you can convert the list into json string, and use the string to insert into the table. ()When you select it, convert it back to list by loading json string. ()
With sqlite3 I was able to execute this script that drops a database and rewrites it with new data using a list named . This may or may not answer your specific question:When the above script is executed,  takes in 4 sub lists and uses the data from them to create a new database.Hope I helped!
