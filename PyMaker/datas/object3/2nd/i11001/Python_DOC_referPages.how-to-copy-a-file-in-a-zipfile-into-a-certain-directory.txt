I need only one subfile in each of 500 zipfiles, the paths are the same, like:How can I copy all these target files into one directory? Keeping the entire paths in the new directory will be the best, which I mean is:I tried it with Python modules zipfile and shutil However, copyfile from shutil takes the entire path as argument but when I tried to directly copy the target file it will raise filenotfind error. When unzipped by the zipfile.Zipfile, the target file will be accessible but copyfile becomes invalid.How can I do this correctly and efficiently ?
 accepts optional  specifying into which directory it will extract file:
