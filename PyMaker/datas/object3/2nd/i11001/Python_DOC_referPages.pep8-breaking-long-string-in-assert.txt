This question already has an answer here:How can I do a line break (line continuation) in Python?                    8 answers                I have this line of code:I want pep8 to be happy, but I don't understand how to break this line. I tried breaking after the comma and got invalid syntax. I've tried breaking the string with additional ""'s as in How to break long string lines for PEP8 compliance?. PEP8 was happy but the assert only produced the first half of the message.What is the proper way to break long assert strings?
Use parens:Or:Or use the parens of the  function:
Considering  statements can be stripped when you run the interpreter with the  option, you probably want to keep it a single statement and use some sort of string concatenation:That said, breaking it into two statements would also be PEP8-compliant (and arguably more readable):
You can force breaking to a new line like this:That always makes the line continue, if brackets and such aren't doing it automatically.  And you can indent the next line to wherever makes it the most readable, as I did above.
