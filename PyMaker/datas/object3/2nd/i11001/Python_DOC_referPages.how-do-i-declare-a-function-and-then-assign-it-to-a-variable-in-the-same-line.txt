I have a  class that has a variable, , that is meant to be a function. For the sake of the question, let's assume that it will always be a function and not something like an . When your instance of the  class is pressed, the function contained in  gets called. So you could do this:This will print  when the button is pressed. Makes sense.But I won't be needing that function anywhere else. I am dealing with a low-memory environment, so it would be easier to do something like this:You could do this in Javascript, so I think it's possible in Python too. But I can't find anything on it. How can I do this?
