I recently discovered that the following returns :I'm aware of the python comparison chaining such as , but I can't see anything in the docs about this being legal.Is this an accidental feature in the implementation of CPython, or is this behaviour specified?
This is fully specified behaviour, not an accidental feature. Operator chaining is defined in the Comparison operators section:Comparisons can be chained arbitrarily, e.g.,  is equivalent to , except that  is evaluated only once (but in both cases  is not evaluated at all when  is found to be false). is one of the comparison operators; from the same section:No exceptions are made for combinations that may not make much sense.The specific expression you used as an example is thus executed as , with the   literal only being executed (loaded) once.
