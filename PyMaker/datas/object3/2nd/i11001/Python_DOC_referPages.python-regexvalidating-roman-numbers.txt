in the following code that which check if a given roman numerical is valid or not why is a different answer printed when ^ and $ are not included in the print statement, etc.,. theoretically the ^ and $ are just to show the matching pattern in the beginning and end.
Short answer: Because  and  are not the same. searches for a match to the given pattern in the entire input, while  requires the pattern to match at the beginning of the input.Independent of that, you can force the pattern to match only at the beginning/end of the input with ^/$. See docs for a detailed explanation. In your case  would match  because nothing enforces a match over the entire input. On the other hand  or  would not match  because either the pattern or  requires a match at the start of the input.
