Natural Text
For some reason method formatting a dictionary key only begins to indent after specifying a width greater than 4. Any idea why? Output:Also, when I try to output a dictionary with indented keys to a text document the indent isn't consistent. For example, when I specify a constant indentation width of 10 characters, the indentation is not consistent across the output. 
This has nothing to do with dict keys, nor is there anything special about the number 4; it just happens to be the length of your string .With  you say that that entire block should be right-aligned to a total length of at least  characters, including the string you passed as . So if  is , and  is , then the string is padded with two spaces, for a total length of 6.This is similar to what  does:If you want a constant padding independent of the string's original length, you can, e.g., use string multiplication, or use a more complex format string, padding an empty string to some given length before putting your actual string.
