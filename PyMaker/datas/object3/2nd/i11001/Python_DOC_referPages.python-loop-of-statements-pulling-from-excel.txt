Im still new to python. Just wondering if there is an easier way to accomplish my task.This is my current codeIs there a way I can pull statements from an excel file?For example:I would have a loop going on and each round it would pull the next line in the file instead of having to copy the code and write a new statement each time?
D on'tR epeatY ourselfYour solution uses 4 blocks of codes of 4 lines each, the last 3 lines are the same, and the first is almost the same too!You can avoid this by using a loop, as you guessed.Look at what changes between each of your blocks, and stores it in a tuple (for example). Then, loop through this tuple and apply the block with the variable element.
