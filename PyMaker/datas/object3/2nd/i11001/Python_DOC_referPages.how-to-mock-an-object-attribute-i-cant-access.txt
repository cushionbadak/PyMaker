I'm trying to mock the parser.html_source attribute of the following view in my unit test. I want to overwrite it with a former downloaded html of that page.views.py:Here's my unit test:Unfortunatly this does not overwrite the HeadParser's html_source attribute in all instances generated out of this class.I don't even know if this is the right attribute to mock, I'm totally clueless.
Remember the advice in the mock documentation: patch where the class is used, not where it is defined. Here that means you should be mocking .
