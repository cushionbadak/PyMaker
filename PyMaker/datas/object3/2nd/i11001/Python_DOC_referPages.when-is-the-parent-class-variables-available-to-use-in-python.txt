This question already has an answer here:Accessing attribute from parent class inside child class                    2 answers                I am trying to understand the inheritance concept in Python, the above lines are a silly example. "print" statement in the parent class is working as I try to create an object of layer class. But it's throwing an error at the "print" statement of the child class. Saying "isFrozen" is not defined.But, if I comment out the "print" statement in child class, I can create an object of the child class and access "isFrozen" as "layerObject.isFrozen".So, could anyone please point out my misunderstanding here? 
Class body provides a namespace and classes (unlike functions) are parsed when the module is read (import time). Your problem is that you are calling  of the  class without the namespace. Also to take full advantage of inheritance you need an actual class instance which is usually referred to as :And a RTFM is suggested here as well.
