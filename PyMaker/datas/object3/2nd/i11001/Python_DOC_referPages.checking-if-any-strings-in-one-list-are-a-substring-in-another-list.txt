I know that if I just have two strings that checking using  will work.  And that if I just wanted to check if a string is in any of the strings in a list I'd just use a  loop for that.But what is the most pythonic/efficient way to check if any of the strings in the first list are substrings of the strings in the second list?An example would be:I'm going to use both  and  words.
I would say something like this:So basically 2 for loops. And use sets instead of lists (fr uniqueness of values)...
You can do this with  and a  comprehension: helps avoid running the entire length of the iteration after a match has been found, and with  you can generate the complementary set  from the first.
the fastest way is probably to turn the first list into a setthen, for each string in , check if any of its substrings are in .
