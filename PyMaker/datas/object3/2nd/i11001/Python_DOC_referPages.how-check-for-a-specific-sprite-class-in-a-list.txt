This is my current inventory system and I am working on having it register when an item has been picked up, but I am having trouble getting the program to register when the sprite class has been added to the list.
Your  check will fail because it is not checking the type of  equals class type. Rather, it is checking if the value/object  equals class type.So, what you need to do is get s type. To do that, assuming  class is not a subclass (if it is, you will need to make use of isinstance()), you can use . You can read this as: 'if  is a type of '. To avoid runtime type checking (which is what you are doing here), I'd recommend implementing a method in your  class that returns the item type e.g. weapon, armour, consumable, et cetera as that will come in handy as you develop your game. You could go one step further and implement a method in your  class that gets the item's sub type e.g. weapon -> gun, sword, stave, et cetera.
