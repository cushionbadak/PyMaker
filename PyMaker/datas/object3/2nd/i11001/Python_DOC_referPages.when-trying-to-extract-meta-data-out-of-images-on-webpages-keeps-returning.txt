I've looked at the exifread documentation and it says that it's returned as a dictionary, but the problem is that it returns nothing except {}, I don't know if that means there is no meta data in the image, or I made a nooby mistake, well anyway I've spend a good chunk of time looking at my code and documentation, but still can't find the solution, any help would be appreciated :)Code:
The problem is you were not passing a base url, you need to pass the host and then join that to the src unless you get an absolute url from the src attribute.The following code demonstrates a working example, I used requests in place of urllib but the logic is the same:You will get the exif data for the one image on the page that has some:A PIL example: will remove files that have no exif data, if you don't want that to happen then remove it.
