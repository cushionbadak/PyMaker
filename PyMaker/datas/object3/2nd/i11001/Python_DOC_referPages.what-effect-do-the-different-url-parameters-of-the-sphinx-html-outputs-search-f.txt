HTML documentation generated by Sphinx includes a search interface.For example, when searching in the official Python documentation for the term "popen", this URL is constructed:https://docs.python.org/3/search.html?q=popen&check_keywords=yes&area=defaultWhat effect do the different URL parameters have?
The search execution of Sphinx-generated HTML documentation is completely JavaScript-based and works as follows:When you build a Sphinx project, a JavaScript file that contains the search index will be created ().When you execute a search query, the search front end will identify all files that are considered a hit and get their source files from the server. These are simple file  requests that only require a static file server. Snippets of these files that contain the fitting character sequence will be displayed.Surprisingly, the search algorithm ( in the html build in the  directory) only considers the first (the ) query parameter. All other parameters are ignored.Note that it is possible to hook up Sphinx to a search back end. For example, the documentation hosting service Read the Docs implements an Haystack/Elasticsearch-based search back end. This means that my explanation does not necessarily apply to all instances of Sphinx-generated documentation sets.
