I am looking for an elegant way to slice a list  in python, given a list of ids .For example, instead of writing Write something like (Pseudo code):Is there a similar way to slice lists? I have the feeling that someone have asked that already, but I couldn't find any reference for it.EDIT: It is ok to assume that all the list items are of the same type
You can use  like this:Also, note that I renamed  variable to  because it is less ambiguous and should be avoided.You can implicitly cast the tuple to a list using Python 3 unpacking, as @JonClements commented:Finally, since Python 3.5, you can also use extended unpacking:
I don't think importing anything is particularly elegant, or pythonic.List comprehensions work, and I can't see a reason not to use them (or no good reason to import something to do the same thing):The list comprehension is doing the following:The comprehension looks pretty pythonic and elegant to me.
You could use itemgetter['b', 'c', 'd']
I would go with itemgetter but you could also map list.__getitem__:
If all the list elements are of the same type, it is possible to use numpy:
