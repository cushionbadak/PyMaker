Natural Text
I have encountered a strange problem which I am struggling to resolve. When I run a  through a .txt file, and then try to print and write the results. all of the results I would expect appear, but they do so in different formats.The code (modified from a similar thread I found earlier):The interpreter then produces the result:which is exactly what I would expect it to do, given the contents of test.txt.However, list.txt reads:while I want it to (and believe it should) readI've tried using  in place of  but this was not helpful. What differences between  and  are causing this ambiguity, and how would one go about avoiding it.N.B. I am 99% sure that line 8  serves no purpose, but I've left it in because it's what I've been doing. Not really sure why...
I'll start with your last comment. What  does is it converts  to its string representation (which is defined in 's class's  method). If you call  you get , for example. This is unnecessary in this case because  returns a list of strings as per the documentation.As for your actual issue: you're missing the newlines. I would also prefer to open the file fewer times than you are.Perhaps try:(You can also remove the  line if you don't want to see the output in the console every time a write is done.)
