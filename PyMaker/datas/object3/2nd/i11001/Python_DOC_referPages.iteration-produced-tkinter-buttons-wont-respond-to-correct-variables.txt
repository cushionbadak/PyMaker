This question already has an answer here:lambda in for loop only takes last value                    1 answer                So in the following code I establish a Notebook in tkinter. I pull strings from the list VARS["IMPS"] and create pages with them in a dictionary using the strings as keys and the Frames as values. My issue comes in when I establish the buttons, the function the button activates just prints the impname. However, when the application is built the while the labels always have the correct content in them and "impname". The buttons across all of the pages of the notebook always print the last string in the list VARS["IMPS"]. Why is this happening?
To add to my previous answer, there is a Python FAQ about this issue.Your statementis equivalent toDoes this make it any clearer that each button_handler() does the same thing? In fact, I would advise revising your code toNow each button command is different because the default args are computed when the function is defined.  I nearer always define button commands before creating buttons.  Less confusing.
