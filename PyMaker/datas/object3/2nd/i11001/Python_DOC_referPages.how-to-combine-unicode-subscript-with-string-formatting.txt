I am trying to get unicode subscripts working with string formatting...I know I can do something like this...But what i really need is something like this since I need the subscript to iterate over a range.  Obviously this doesn't work though.Any help appreciated
 is an escape syntax in the string literal. You'd have to produce a raw string (where the escape syntax is ignored), then re-apply the normal Python parser handling of escapes:However, you'd be better of using the  function to produce the whole character:The  function takes an integer and outputs the corresponding Unicode codepoint in a string. The above defines a hexadecimal number and adds 1 to produce your desired  range Unicode character.
