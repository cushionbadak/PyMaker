I'm studying Python OOP and I arrived at the topic of decorators but the material I'm using for studying doesn't cover it in depth.I post the example code:Can you help me to understand the importance of decorators?Can you explain in simple words the concept of decorator?
Let me write some of the things I can simply say about the above code,Generally decorators are said to be "Function decorators are simply wrappers to existing functions"Decorators always wrap an another function, Not to mention that the decorator is itself a functionIn the above code you are setting,getting,deleting a property/formally  an attribute of a "duck" which is a color.Decorator always start with the '@'.  is a predefined decorator function that meant to take your getter,setter and del function of your classAll you have been doing is passing the functions(getter,setter,del) as an argument to the @propertyif you written your main it would be likeWe can have our own decorator also, I highly recommend you to read the suggested link for its various uses and advantages
