I've searched and found code below that can interleave 2 files line by line into new one.I have multiple files and like to have 2 or more consecutive lines to interleave one after another. I like to be able to choose number of lines depend on the job. Total number of lines in each file may not be the same, but the pattern for number of lines for each element on all files are always the same. How can I achieve my goal?Thank you.@xealits Thanks a million. Your codes work like a champ. Have a nice day!
This should work:-- here the files are opened and closed manually in list comprehensions instead of using  and  or ; when  called on a file reads first N lines from it (and when the lines are read they are not in the file object any more -- they pop out of it) (also, one can loop through a file with );  joins items of the given list/tuple/iterable object into a string with  as the separator; since  adds newline to the printed string,  is to remove the last character of the resulting string from files, which is newline character.If you read only 2 files, then  is fine:Some references for the used stuff:How to read file N lines at a time in Python?nested is deprecatedPython 3 uses  for  features in
