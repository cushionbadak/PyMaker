I started making a program for fun when I encountered a problem. The problem was that I wanted to find the drive letter with windows installed on it (root drive). I assumed there was a function already made for that but I searched for a while and could not find one. I wrote this code to do what I just described. Is this code redundant and am I being an idiot? There is probably a much easier way...I suppose someone can use this for testing purposes or what not.
There is an environment variable . On my computer in contains "C:\Windows". You can read this variable by  (refer to python 2:os.getenv() or python 3:os.getenv()).
