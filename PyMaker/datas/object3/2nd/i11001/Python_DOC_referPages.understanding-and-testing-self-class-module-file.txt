When reading a python-based software, I feel confused about a line of python code: . I can guess it was trying to return the file name in class file, but I'm not very clear about the exact usage of this.  I saved the related code segment into a file named  and I'm trying to test it by , but it does not print anything. How can I test this kind of file?
Classes in python have a  attribute which contains the name of the module in which the class was defined. Additionally, each module contains a  attribute which has the full path to the  file. He is trying to get the file path for the file in which the class was defined but he's not going the best way with doing it, ideally you could just index  by using :instead of going through the class (i.e ). Do note here that  this will fail because the  module does not have a  attribute defined. You'll need to safeguard against it:where  then  will contain the path of the file being executed. Next, add the usual clause in your script in order for it to initialize the object if the script is running as :Now, if you call it as the  script with:or if you  it, it will pickup the  attribute, print it and then print the file name.P.s: Fix the indentation in your final .
