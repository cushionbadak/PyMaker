This question already has an answer here:TypeError: got multiple values for argument                    6 answers                whereas:  Why it behaves like this?Any particular reason?
In the documentation for calls:If the syntax  appears in the function call, expression must evaluate to an iterable. Elements from these iterables are treated as if they were additional positional arguments. For the call , if  evaluates to a sequence , this is equivalent to a call with  positional arguments .And, this is followed by:A consequence of this is that although the  syntax may appear after explicit keyword arguments, it is processed before the keyword arguments (and any  â€“ see below).(emphasis mine)So Python will first process the  as positional arguments, assign a value to  and re-assign it with  resulting in an error for the keyword argument having multiple values. 
The problem is the keywords.  You are not allowed positional arguments after keyword arguments.works fine, in that it passes a tuple with the values 1,2,3.  The same as:Keywords must always come after positional arguments, so it is your function declaration which is incorrect:Gives:
