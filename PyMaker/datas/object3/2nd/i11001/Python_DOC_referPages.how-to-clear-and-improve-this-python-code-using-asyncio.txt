I'm coding a python script to monitor multiple site's status.And since it's supposed to check websites status at a precise interval without being blocked by an other website check, I'm using asyncio.But it looks like I don't stop it correctly when I catch a SIGINT signal, or may be I'm doing everything wrongly.  The source code :https://github.com/DasFranck/Python-Mineur/blob/master/awsum_py/awsum.pyWhat should I change, and what am I doing correctly?
According to the asyncio doc : schedules the execution of a coroutine object: wrap it in a future. Return a Task object.Your callback runs a coroutine which should be managed by your loop, but you never  it, so you never wait for it to finish. In fact, by wrapping the callback like this, you can't call  on it.Anyway, callbacks don't have to be async, so you can just use them like this:without wrapping them into a future.
