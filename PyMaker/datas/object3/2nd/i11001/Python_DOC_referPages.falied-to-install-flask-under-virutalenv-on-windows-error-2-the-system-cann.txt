I'm using python 2.7 on a windows box.I'm able to install flask using pip install, as you can see below:However, after I created a virtualenv, I got below error when trying to do the same thing. scripts: log file as below:Does the error message mean something to anyone?thanks
This issue seems to be related with the setuptools version installed in your virtualenv. Downgrading to an older version fixed it for me.From your virtualenv:
I had this problem yesterday.  I resolved it by downloading the MarkupSafe wheel and installing with pip.  The problem was way over my head.  Something about compiler flags in order to suppress an error when generating the Speedups file, I think.1) Download the wheel from the link above.2) On Windows, open a command window in the same directory as the wheel.3) run "pip Install "
The setup.py of MarkupSafe is broken for Win7 on my system where there is no C compiler. (I keep a separate VM for VC++ work) I did this to get it working:I did not try to debug setup.py to work correctly. I just wanted to try out Flask since it's supposed to be lightweight and easy to learn, and the official docs say it installs on Windows. Maybe I should go back to Perl...Unlike the other poster, a global pip install of MarkupSafe didn't work for me either.These links have other views/insights on the problem:https://github.com/pallets/markupsafe/issues/26https://github.com/babun/babun/issues/315
ok. I figure it out.  I don't think there is anything wrong in the way I install flask, as I already mentioned in my question, I am able to install it globally (without running within a virtualenv). the MarkupSafe package has an extension which is implement using c, and I don't have windows sdk installed on my local machine, so when ve_build_ext runs, ****  it always fail  ** the difference is if not (is_pypy or is_jython) , it gives a warning, which is what i got when installing it globally; it crashes, though, when running under a virtualenv. So I'm pretty sure that hasattr(sys, 'pypy_version_info') return true when running under a virtualenv.Does anybody have an idea what "hasattr(sys, 'pypy_version_info')" mean??if not (is_pypy or is_jython):    try_building_extension()else:    run_setup(False)
I had this issue today and was able to resolve it by manually installing MarkupSafe from a wheel file, per Lincoln's suggestion above. You can download the appropriate file here. There were several available. I don't know what the difference between all of them is, but the only one that would even install on Windows 10 was the one called MarkupSafe-0.23-cp27-none-win32.whl. After downloading it, I copied it into the directory I created using virtualenv (not sure if that's necessary but that's what I did) and installed it with pip:from that directory. After that I went back to the main directory and installed Flaskand it worked fine.
