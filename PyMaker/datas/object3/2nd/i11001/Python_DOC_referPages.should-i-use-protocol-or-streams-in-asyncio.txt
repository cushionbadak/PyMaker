I'm very new to  and was wondering which API is better than the other in terms of better practice, protocol or streams?To me,  seems easier to work with since there are already  and  methods provided to you.  With  you have to manage connections and read data yourself, but I feel like it utilizes concept of  more, which seems a good thing to me.this is how i listen to incoming data, feels awkward to me. I can also use  but sometimes it raises .
The stream objects are higher level and provide many useful methods:Several ways to read data: reader.read, readline, readuntil, readexactlyCheck if EOF has been reached: reader.ateofControl write flow: writer.drainLike any abstraction, this comes at a cost: coroutine are a bit less reactive than callbacks. For instance  involves at least two event loop callbacks:When some data is received, a callback is triggered and  is called.Then  triggers another callback that restores the execution of .
