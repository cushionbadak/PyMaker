Let's say I have a string like ; how do I print it as one character like  or  without using brackets ()?
The brackets are probably the correct way to do this, why do not want you to use it?Anyway, you can unpack your string (only work with Python 3 as @DeepSpace precised), like this:It works also for multiple variables anywhere:There is also , which behaves like the brackets but as a function:Finally, as @EliKorvigo pointed it out, there is  which creates a function acting just like the brackets:
Another abuse of Python functions. You could iterate over the string and only print values which are in a certain position.
Using iterators:
You could use :Other ways to do it include looping over the input string the required number of times:Or popping items off a list copy of the string:Or looping over an iterator version of the string:And another way is to use a :although you would want to length check it in case you rotated beyond the length of the string.
