I've been using IPython for sometime without ever having to package code. I glanced through the following pages and setup a directory structure for my modules and now use IPython to initiate the program.https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.htmlhttps://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.htmlhttp://pythoncentral.io/how-to-create-a-python-package/Here is a gist of my setuproot fodermodules(directory)1.1 external.py1.2 getdata.pydriver.ipynbI created a directory called modules and created two files.modules (directory)-- external.py (contains the following)-- getdata.py (contains the following)Now I run the following code in an IPython notebookRunning glob.glob("Data/") in the IPython notebook does not give out any error.How do I fix this namespace issue without renaming any function? I have a dozen functions and they all have the same issue.Edit 1:- I forgot to mention stuff that I've already triedimport statement in getdata.pyI have more than one file which uses glob. Is there any better alternative other that importing modules in every file?
Add  in  (where the  module is used), not in the .
