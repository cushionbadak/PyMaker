Say I have a Dict that looks like so...I'm trying to get But I'm trying to do so without loops in loops.So this is what I have: And it's throwing: How can I make this work?
You get the error because the dictionary is one level deeper than your loop, and you can call  on the dictionary to get the values part:
If you just need to gather those strings in a list but you are not constrained to arrange them in a specific order, this should work:The core element of the snippet above is the function .
You could also do it completely functionally combining, map, itertools.chain.from_iterable and operator.itemgetter:
