Natural Text
I have a tex file that was generated from rst source using Sphinx, it is encoded as UTF-8 without BOM (according to Notepad++) and named , with following content: Now, before I compile the tex source to pdf, I want to replace some lines in the tex file to get nicer results. My script was inspired by another SO question.This works on Ubuntu 16.04 with Python 2.7 as well as Python 3.5,but it fails on Windows with Python 3.4. The error message I get is:where  stands for left double quotation mark. If I remove the problematic character, the script proceeds till it finds the next problematic character.In the end, I need a solution that works on Linux and Windows with Python 2.7 and 3.x. I tried quite a lot of the solutions suggested here on SO, but could not yet find one that works for me...
