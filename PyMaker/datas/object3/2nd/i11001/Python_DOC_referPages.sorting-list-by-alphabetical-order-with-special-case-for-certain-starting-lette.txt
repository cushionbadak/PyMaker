Given a list of strings, I want to return a list with the strings in sorted order, except group all the strings that begin with 'x' first. For example:Should yield:I know it can be done by making 2 lists and sorting each of them before combining them, but I'm not sure how to write the condition in which 'x' is the first character. 
 or  accepts optional  keyword argument. That is the function used to get sort key, and the return value of the function is used to compare instead of the original items.used ; which return  (0) for word starts with ,  (1) for other words; resulting words start with  come first.

Just make a particular case in your key method: if starts with x, return a truncated string starting with "0" so it will appear first, but will be still sorted after "x".yields:
The  builtin returns a new, stable-sorted  of each element in the input iterable, sorted by . , in this case, is a lambda expression (basically a "mini-function") which transforms or converts each element in the input list into a sortable value. In this case, our lambda expression sorts each word in the list by a  which contains  or  indicating whether or not the word starts with , followed by the word itself. Since  is "smaller" than , the words that start with  appear first, and everything else is sorted alphabetically.
You can sort it using the built-in  and then use list comprehension to get the output you desire as follows:
