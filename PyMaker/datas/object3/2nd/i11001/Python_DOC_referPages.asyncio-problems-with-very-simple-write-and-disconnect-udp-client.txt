I wanted to try out the new  module from Python 3.5.1. Here's my test code:When I run this, the interpreter gives me:I think this is caused by the sequence of  and . If I understand correctly, the  method is asynchronous and it actually gets invoked after I close the socket by calling the  method. Is there any way to solve this?
The  (actually ) schedules two actions on connection, the first one is  from given protocol, the second is  (recvfrom) - in that order (https://github.com/python/asyncio/blob/master/asyncio/selector_events.py#L996).Since you close transport on , the following action () fails. Remove  from there.You might find interesting the asyncio udp examples.
