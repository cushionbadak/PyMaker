Just started experimenting with asynch which looks really cool.  I'm trying to use futures with an asynch coroutine that runs forever but I get this error:This is my code which runs as expected if I remove the 3 lines related to futures:
 is called indefinitely, calling  for the same future object multiple times; which is not possbile.Create new future for each  call. For example:BTW, you can use new syntax (, ) if you're using Python 3.5+:
Following @falsetru answer this is a complete program that has 3 asynch coroutines each with their own got_result function.  I'm using v3.4 so thats why I don't use the new syntax.  As an interesting side effect the output clearly demonstrates the single threaded nature of coroutines.  I hope its useful as a template for someone:
