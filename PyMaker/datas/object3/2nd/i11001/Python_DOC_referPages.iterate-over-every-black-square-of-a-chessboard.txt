I'd like to iterate over every other element of a -by- "chessboard", i.e.,I'm using an explicit loop here, but for speed would rather use a list comprehension.Any hints?For bonus points, the solution also works for , ,  with .
Well, list comprehension is just like your nested  loop, except that this is done within the list brackets:More generally, for  nested loops, you can use , like this:
As I understand it, you would like an explicit expression for the x and y coordinates of the black squares on the 'chess board', so that you don't have to evaluate the boolean for every square. Here is an implementation of my solution (for a 2-dimensional board):For the 3x4 dimensional board in the example above, this generates the following output:which you can verify by drawing a little diagram. Note that the 'helper variable'  keeps track of whether the row number is even or odd; the odd rows have an 'offset' with respect to the even ones.
