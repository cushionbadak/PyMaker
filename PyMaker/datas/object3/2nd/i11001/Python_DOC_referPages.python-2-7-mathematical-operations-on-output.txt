I'm quite new to python and currently I'm stuck with one problem. I could do this in BASH, but I'd like to learn python.I need to do math operations on output from command executed on remote server.And now I don't know what to do next. I was trying to find solution, but I failed.In this case output is ['50\n100\n75'], and it's type is list. This is only example, length of this output will vary on different servers.What I want to do is to do simple math - summarize strings/lines from this output.Can someone please tell me how to solve my problem or at least point me in right direction?Best regards,Jan
To get the sum of these inputs, you'd just (a) replace  in your  call with , so that each input line becomes an element in your list; and (b) calculate the sum with . But you probably won't be able to explain how this works, so this answer doesn't teach you much about working with python; read the python tutorial and you'll find it much easier going. And switch to Python 3 immediately. Why are you learning an outdated version of the language?
