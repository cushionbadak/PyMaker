I am using the partial method from the functools module to map a function over a range of values:Here is the error I get on line 5:It looks like functools.partial is trying to assign the range to the argument p, even though I have already assigned a value to it. I'm trying to assign the range to the value of vx. Any idea how I can make that happen?EDIT: Added a little bit of extra context to the code. Essentially what I'd like test 5 to do is ensure that the result of the function given to it increases as vt goes up, so that `func(vt=1) < func(vt=2)... < func(vt=n).
functools.partial generates a partial that stores the arguments receiveids in 2 properties: stores positional arguments stores all keyword-based argumentsSo the partial can call original function exactly as was intended. In other words, when you call the resulting partial with one argument (let's say, 1) it would be the same as:As your  contains the first argument - and you're passing the "1" as a positional argument - you get the error.I'm not sure if it's gonna work in this particular case, but one solution could be use inspect.getargspec to extract arguments from  that can be passed as positional arguments. In this case, the  function would be similar to:
