Can anybody explain me why this line gives me an error But it works properly when I do like these:or evenand it gives me memory allocation when I do like this:I am learning and a newbie in Python and I am very curious why it produces me "Invalid Syntax" when I try this line of codeIs there an alternative way to have an output of without to do manually code?Cheers!
The above implementation is List Comprehensions. You can check detail here, https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensionsHowever by doing this:  you are breaking List Comprehension implementation and actually you are defining a list whose first member is  and the other isSince the second member is neither a proper list element nor List Comprehensions syntax error is occured
The expression  does not allow an implicit  in  (comma-separated expressions not enclosed in parentheses). That forces you to explicitly choose what exactly is combined by the comma:
Use:I suspect this is because Python sees  and thinks it's just a list. Then it sees  and is suddenly confused.If you wrap  in parentheses it removes the ambiguity.
