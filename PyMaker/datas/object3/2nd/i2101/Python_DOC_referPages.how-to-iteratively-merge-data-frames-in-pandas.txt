Given a list of data frames, I want to iteratively merge them and return single dataframe. Inputs:  (list of pandas data frames) and  (string or list of strings containing the column names to merge). How do I use  to accomplish this?    """    Given a list of data frames, iteratively merge them and return a     single dataframeEdit: I think maybe I can use df.concat but am not sure how?
Something like this should work,
caveats: is an iterator of pandas.DataFrame objectseach of the  has the same columnsmight want to reindex after all the appends are donetried https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.reduce but it's not obvious what the function(df1, df2) should be (i.e.  expects an iterable); anyway the  utility does the reducehttp://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/general_functions.html lists the  and other utilitieshttp://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.merge.html#pandas.mergehttp://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.concat.html#pandas.concatP.S. don't create a function that the library provides already, be happy to read the docs and re-read the docs, esp. since the pandas docs are volumes
