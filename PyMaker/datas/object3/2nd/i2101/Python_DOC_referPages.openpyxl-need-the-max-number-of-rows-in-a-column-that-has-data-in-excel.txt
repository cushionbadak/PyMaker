I need the last row in a particular column that contains data in Excel. In openpyxl sheet.max_row or max_column gets us the maximum row or column in the whole sheet. But what I want is for a particular column.My scenario is where I have to get some values from database and append it to the end of a particular column in Excel sheet.In this screenshot, if I want max_column containing data in column 'C', it should return 10:In the above image if I want last cell containing data  of column 'C', it should return 10------------- Solution 1 --------------------------------------------Solution 2 ----------------------https://stackoverflow.com/a/52816289/10003981------------------------Solution 3 ----------------------https://stackoverflow.com/a/52817637/10003981Maybe solution 3 is a more concise one !! 
Question:  i want max_column containing data in Column 'C' it should return 10:Simple count Documentation Accessing many cellsPSEUDOCODE Comment: What if we have an empty cell in between?  Count the Rows in sync with the Column Range, and use a  variable. This will also work with no empty cell between.  PSEUDOCODE Note: The cell index of  is 1-based!  Documentation:  enumerate(iterable, start=0) 
"Empty" is a relative concept so your code should be clear about this. The methods in openpyxl are guaranteed to return orthogonal result sets: the length of rows and columns will always be the same.Using this we can work deduce the row highest row in column of a cell where the value is not None.None))
I think I just found a way using pandas:
