Why does it print 3? How is this evaluated? Does it first take the elements of list1 that are from index 1: then it takes the 1 index of that?
Python's grammar specifies how it is evaluated, since it constructs a syntax tree of your program.Without going much into technical detail, such indexing is left recursive. This means that:is short for:so such indices are evaluated left-to-right.It is evaluated  like:(of course in reality, no  variable is created, but the list itself is a real object stored in memory, and thus also might change state, etc.).So first we slice starting from the second item, this results in a list , and then we obtain the second item of that list, so .
