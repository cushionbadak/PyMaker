This question already has an answer here:Pythonic way of checking if a condition holds for any element of a list                    3 answers                I'm trying to check if a specific element in the list is greater than a set value. So I'm just not sure what commands to use in this scenario to check every list element or if it's even possible in one line. 
Use , Python's natural way of checking if a condition holds for, well, any out of many: will terminate upon the first truthy element of the iterable it is passed and, thus, not perform any spurious iterations which makes it preferable to  or list comprehension based approaches that have to always iterate the entire list. Asymptotically however, its time complexity is, of course, still linear.Also, you should not shadow built-in names like .
You ask for "if any element in the list is greater than ". If you just want one element, you could just find the greatest element in the list using the  function, and check if it's larger than : There's also a one-liner you can do to make a list of all elements in the list greater than , using list comprehensions (here's a tutorial, if you want one):This code generates a list  of all the elements in  that are greater than . You can see the code responsible for this: This means, "Iterate over  and, if the condition  is true for any element , add that element to a new list. At the end, return that new list."
List comprehension would suit your use case.If your list is very long, use generator so that you do not have to iterate through all elements of the list.
You could use  and filter your list for items greater than , if the  of this filtered list is  that means your original list contains a value larger than
