I am creating a program which iterates over the width and height of an image as well as makes use of a set of keys.Here is an example:The width and height are a range of integers up to the size of the width and height.The keys are any set of numbers (actually ASCII values) but are not ordered numbers.I would like the output to be like this:As you can see, the width and height can be produced with nested for loops, whereas the keys cycle between each other.Here is my solution:Actually it works as intended, however, I would like a more efficient way to do the above instead of using an incremental variable for the index position of the keys list.I don't mind the nested for loop, if that has to be used, but the index keys variable annoys me as it seems like the code won't work without it, but at the same time isn't really pythonic.
You can use  to get the product of your width and height, that is your whole grid. Then, you want to cycle over the keys, thus use . You finally  those together and get the desired result.You can make this a generator using  for memory efficieny.Or if you do not want a generator.ExampleOutputAs a sidenote, notice that you could replace the lists defining  and  by ranges.
You can use cycle from itertools.
You can use iterate over matrix. Its ndenumerate function from numpy packet. If width and height are range of int, you can skip creating list. Just define the size of this lists.
