I have a dict which is in the following form:I whould like to have a csv file where the first line is the keys of the dict and the next line the vectors in a column shape.Like: what I have for now is the first line but I don't understand how to write the vectors properly.All vectors have the same length.
Simple option using the  built-in (no  dependency, eventhough  allows for less code lines):Note how I unpack  using the asterisk (); without that unpacking this won't work as expected.Edited my code to have a fixed ordering to prevent mismatch between column header and content.
If you are ok with using pandas Will produce
Even if the input is a dictionary, you cannot use , which would require 1 key per data row, not column.Just  the dict values (in a fixed order) to "transpose" and create rows that  module can write properly.Also, sort your dict keys so the order of columns is the same everytime:result:to write to a file, don't forget  for python 3, and  for python 2 to avoid the infamous extra newline issue on windows:
