The structure of the project is:project- main.py- session.py- spider.pyThere is a class in session.py:And another class in spider.py:When I import class  from spider.py in main.py like this:And run main.py, I get:Session created.  Main function.  Spider created.  It confuses me. I think  is the initial function used when initializing an instance, but in this case the  function of  is called when  is imported in spider.py. I think it must be related to the default value of  function in spider.py, but why?
The default values of parameters get evaluated only once in python.  This is documented here and also here as stated by JETM.Therefore a isntance of  is created when you import  as default value for the  parameter of the spiders  method.If you do not wish such a behavior you can use  as default value and create the  instance inside the  method if no other value was provided as pointed out by MatsLindh and FHTMitchel like this:
