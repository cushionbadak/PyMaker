Natural Text
I've made a program that identifies what is inside a text file, splits it into individual lines, and prints a  from it. For example, when I run the program, it will print 3 lines of the text file, however there are duplicates. First of all, here is the text file:And here is the code:Right now, when I run the program I get an input similar to this:orWhat I want to come out is all 3 lines, with no duplicates. For example:My question is:How can I get an output with all 3 outcomes in a random order each time, with no duplicates?
You use  with a size that does not exceed your data:Then:    Output:To get them on different lines:Output:If you always want the 3 outputs, you could as well simply random.shuffle(..) your  using: Output:Sidenote: its better to cache the  in a variable if you use it multiple times - else it would have to be evaluated again and again.
When you read your file do this instead:Using with statement ensures the file is properly closed after opening it. Your problem lies in:  where you can get the same line twice. Reading all your lines to a list and using random.sample instead you make sure you won't get any duplicates.Then you can use random.sample instead:Compare that with:
Put your outputs in sets:Then use the merging function:
