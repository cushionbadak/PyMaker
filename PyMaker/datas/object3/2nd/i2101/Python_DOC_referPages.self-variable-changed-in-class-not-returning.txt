I tried to use  before to return how many elements are in the list that holds the tuples, however, I couldn't get that to work, so I'm trying to make it so when a new element is added to  list, it will add one to  which will basically take the role of .However, when I run the program, the print at the end will return 0, even though I add a new message with .It should return  but it doesn't, and I'm not understanding.
You are running  on a new instance of your inbox class (), which is instantiated with an inbox of length zero.You might consider assigning an instance of your inbox class to a variable, using that object as you need.:
Since your inbox class is basically a wrapper around a list, you could make it a subclass of UserList and have access to all list methods.
