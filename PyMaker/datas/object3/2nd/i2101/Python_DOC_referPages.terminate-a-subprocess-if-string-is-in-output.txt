I'm trying to terminate a subprocess pid if a string is in the output, but it is not working. What is wrong? 
Please refere to the documentation for the methods you call.  First of all, check_call executes until the process is finished, then returns the return code from the process.  I'm not sure how you intend to find "PING" from a return code, which is typically an integer.If it is there, look at the body of your  statement: you fork a totally new instance of , wait for it to complete, and then try to terminate the return code.I recommend that you work through a tutorial on subprocesses.  Learn how to grab a process handle and invoke operations on that.  You'll need to get a handle on the output stream, look for "PING" in that, and then call  on the process handle you got at invocation.
