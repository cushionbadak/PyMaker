I have some interesting using cases in my Ruby code that I want to convert to Python. I think we can leverage in any lib, I mainly use pandas and numpy.For instance, imagine that you have an array of timed events, these events have a timestamp and another properties (an object or a tuple).I want a list/array of groups, where these groups are "contiguous" events, with a grace period of  units (in this case, time units).In my Ruby code I use something like this:Since I'm not using only in timed events, but with anything that I can sort (so they're comparable somehow), I ask: there's a generic way, or a known lib that does this?
Python doesn't have an equivalent function. You'll have to write your own.Here's my implementation, using an iterator and the  statement:Which can be used like so:
I'm not aware of a ready-made solution to this, but it's not too hard to write one from scratch. Iterate over the elements of the sequence, testing each pair of items against your criteria, and choose whether to add it to the existing group or create a new group.Result:
