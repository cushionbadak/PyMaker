I'm trying create a list with 12 months and yours respect value, but if month/value ausent I need create a default "0" and merged with dynamic data.And the result in template django:So, I need create the months: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,12 and create the values (if not exists in queryset, default "0". And keep the Order.
you could simply work on the  using :This only inserts the value 0 if the key is not present.EDITIf you want it sorted and as strings, you could create a new dict; because its a small dict, the cost will almost be neglible compared to the query.This should use the  of the  numbers to get a string without the word "Decimal" in it.
