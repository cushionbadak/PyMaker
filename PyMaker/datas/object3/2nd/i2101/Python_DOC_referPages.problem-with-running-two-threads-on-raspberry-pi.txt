I have a streaming program that sends frames of captured video taken by picamera from raspberry to server and another program that receive some characters from server. when I run them individually there is no problem but i want them to run them simultaneously to do some functions when for example 'a' pressed on server so i threaded them but it makes streaming so slow. Is there any solution to fix this problem?server.py:raspberry.py:
In order to fix the problem you need first to find out what is the reason of it. One obvious problem here is that this code:executes a busy loop. So it uses CPU resources but does nothing substantial. You may replace  with  there or wait for thread to finish (this would require however to switch to threading module)Another possible problem may be the similar issue in  (you haven't shown its source). Make sure you don't have any busy waiting there. Some small  (50-100 ms) should be enough to give time for other thread to execute and would not affect user experience much.In general use profiler to check where you program spends time.
