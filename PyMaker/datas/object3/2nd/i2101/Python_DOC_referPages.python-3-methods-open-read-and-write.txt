When I run the script, compiler acts like there is no print (target.read()) line. If I close target before that line, and make new variable like lets say txt = open(filename, 'r+') and then print (txt.read()) it works. Can someome explain why it doesn't work like I did it above?
Think of working with files as having 2 pointers, one is the variable for the file itself, and the second as a pointer to where in the file you are currently at.You first  the file to empty the contents, pointer is at the first character in the file.Then you give 3  commands, to which the pointer will move to the end of each line as that command is finished.Finally, you attempt a . At this point the cursor is at the end of the file, and there is nothing to read from that point, moving forward. If you want to read the contents of the file, then you will either need to close and reopen the file, or perform a  to move the pointer to the beginning of the file to the 0th byte before you actually perform a .
When you are writing and reading something in a file you change the file pointer. In this case you are reading the last position in file.You can add this line before read(), that change the pointer for the first position in file.
Looks like it works to me.
