I am python 3.7 on my window 10 and having problem with code. I have created a test.py file and running following code in that file :- and when i print  then output is not showing blank(no output).Edit:  when i print hello world then output is showing. 
There is a  module in Python itself. Be sure you are running your module. You must be in the same directory as your file  to import your file instead of the Python one.Update: Python uses a search path list mechanism for finding modules when importing. The "current working directory" is usually at the first place in this list (the empty string). See  and .You can add your own path(s) into  (in shell/command line) or  (in Python).
I guess the problem is that you didn't save the file after you did all the code in , what happens if save it then run  somewhere else, that's what i thinkAlso as Messa said, "There is a test module in Python itself. Be sure you are running your module. You must be in the same directory as your file test.py to import your file instead of the Python one." that's also useful information, have to be same directory as  (your file)If you're not in the same directory, do:For it.
