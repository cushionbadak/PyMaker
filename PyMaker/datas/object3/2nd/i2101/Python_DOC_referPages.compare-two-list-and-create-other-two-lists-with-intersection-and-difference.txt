I have 2 lists A and B. In the B list I can have multiple elements from list A.For example:I want to create:to create a list with ids that are in A and found in B (unique)to create a list of ids that are in A and have no corresponding in B (unique)Nice to get also: the numbers in B, that don't have a corespondent in AMy approach is two loops:I don't know if this is a good approach, plus remains the 2) point(what is not in b).And I can't use , because of repetitions and no order in B.

Convert the list to  and then perform set operations  
With python you can simply use the set type:will return a list containing the element intersection between lists  and .Will return a list containing all the elements that are in  and not in .Vice versa:Will return a list containing all the elements that are in  and not in .
you could use the 'a in L' functionality, which will return True if an element is in a List. e.g.this should give you a good hint on how to approach the other question.best
Use set operations:
