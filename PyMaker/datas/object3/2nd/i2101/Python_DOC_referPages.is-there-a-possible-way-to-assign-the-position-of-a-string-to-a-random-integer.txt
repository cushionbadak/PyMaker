I'm doing some code on a banking system wherein there is a pre-set password, then the program will generate a random number using randint, then that random number is a position of a character in the pre-set password. The user must type the character that is in the position of the number that was generated, for example, if my pre-set password is 12345 and the generated number was 3, I should type 4 to be given access to the system.As you could see, I'm testing out calling the character from the string and merging it with the random number but it doesn't work, do you have any other ideas to perform it? Thanks. Sorry if it may cause you some confusion but this is how far as my code has gone, I'm still starting out with python though.
Is this what you're looking for?
You're not using any random numbers in here,If you must know the index it chose, use:Otherwise if you only need a random letter from password use:
Using  here would work. This will allow you to build a range using the  of your password, and then select a random integer from that range. You can then use this random int to index your code password.
