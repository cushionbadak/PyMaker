First,  the string, then iterate over groups of two from the resulting list and convert the second element of the pairs to . For the second part, the  documentation has a recipe called . You can either copy-paste the function or import it from  (which needs to be installed).Finally, if you want to flatten the result, apply .
If you like to use lambda, here's a simpler way;
