This question already has an answer here:Slicing a numpy array along a dynamically specified axis                    3 answers                Suppose I have a Numpy array A that has a certain number of dimensions. For the rest of the question I will consider that A is a 4-dimensional array:Sometimes, I would like to access the elements , but also sometimes I would like to access the elements, and so on (the position of the '1' in the '1'-colon indexing "chain" is a variable).How can I do that?
When you provide a  when indexing, python calls that a .  When you provide comma-separated slices, it is really just a tuple of slices.The  is equivalent to , so you can get the same effect with the followingYou can build up your indexing programatically with this knowledge.
