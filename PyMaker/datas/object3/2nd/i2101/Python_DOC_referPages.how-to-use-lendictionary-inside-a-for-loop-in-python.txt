I have a code snippet in python, I tried running it but I am not able to understand the ouput that is being produced. Here is my code:First For loop and it's output:Second For loop and it's output:It would be a big help if someone could help me understand both the for loop codes and also help me underdstand the outputs produced. Thanks.
When you use  the loop will iterate i from 0 to that for example following code will give  as outputin your first for loop you iterate  until 4 which is the length of list  and you are printing the  element in the  list.So you get the first outputin the second loop, loop condition is same but there you printing the length of the  element of  list, which is  1 2 3 4 and that is your output in the second loop.Hope you could understand
You have a dictionary  and  is the key pointing to the list . So calling  gives you the list , while , for i =0, ... 3, gives you the elements of this list, i.e. , , etc. The rest you should figure out yourself.Just let me add that the first loop is equivalent to and the second loop to
Explaination:First example:iterate trough the range of the dictionary's  key (  an iterator from  to )then get the value in the dictionary's  key with that indexSecond example:same as first example, but just getting length, so length of  is 1, and length of  is 2 and so on
