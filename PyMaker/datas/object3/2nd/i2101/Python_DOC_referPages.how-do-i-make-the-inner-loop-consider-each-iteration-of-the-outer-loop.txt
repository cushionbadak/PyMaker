Three-letter set, composed of , is defined as codon. Each codon corresponds to the one of 20 letter. Set of those letters (amino acids) is defined as protein. The file "codons.txt" contains codons and corresponding letters.The problem is next: The inner for loop works only once â€” it compares lines from the txt file only with the first codon. Then, as I understand, the method skips the inner loop.Code:Output:The  question is next: How to make the inner loop work for each codon?
When iterating over a file (), it stops when reaching the end of the file.You can either:reset the file reader position to the start of the file using or change the order of the loops, so that you only iterate once over the file.
