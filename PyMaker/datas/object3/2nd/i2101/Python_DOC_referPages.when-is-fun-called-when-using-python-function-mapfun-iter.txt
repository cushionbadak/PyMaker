Why doesn't following code print anything:I'm executing the above code in Python 3. I think i'm missing something very basic but not able to figure it out.
 returns an iterator, and will not process elements until you ask it to.Turn it into a list to force all elements to be processed:or use  with the length set to 0 to not produce a list if you don't need the map output:but note that simply using a  loop is far more readable for any future maintainers of your code:
Before Python 3, map() returned a list, not an iterator.  So your example would work in Python 2.7.list() creates a new list by iterating over its argument.  ( list() is NOT JUST a type conversion from say tuple to list.  So list(list((1,2))) returns [1,2]. )  So list(map(...)) is backwards compatible with Python 2.7.
I just want to add the following: [ https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/functions.html#map ]Python 2.7.6 (default, Mar 22 2014, 22:59:56) Python 3.4.0 (default, Apr 11 2014, 13:05:11) That difference makes the answer about simple wrapping with  not completely correctThe same could be achieved with:
