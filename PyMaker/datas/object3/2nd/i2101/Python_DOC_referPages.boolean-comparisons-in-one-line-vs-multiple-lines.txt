I wasn't sure what to name the title. But I'm new to programming in general and I'm using python. My question is, how come just writing return instead of a bunch if and else statements work exactly the same.Both these codes yield the exact same results.. but why? sorry I'm super new
Both these codes yield the exact same resultsThat's incorrect. It is only true where the inputs are of specific types. Consider this trivial counter-example:But note  /  are designed this way:Note that neither  nor  restrict the value and type they return  to  and , but rather return the last evaluated argument. exhibits short-circuiting. Let's assume that  is a Boolean input.  If  is , the expression short-circuits and returns . If  is ,  will return  or  depending on the value of . doesn't short-circuit, but the result is the same. If  is Boolean and , the function returns . If  is , then the second criterion  is tested. If the condition is not specified then, since nothing is returned, Python move's outside and after the  statement to .
Instead of havingin a function, you could just have it return the condition since you're checking for the same value you would return
