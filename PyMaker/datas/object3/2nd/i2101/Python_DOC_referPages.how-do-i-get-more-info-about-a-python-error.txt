I'm trying to run a python script on ; the script runs fine on , but I keep getting kind of a vague  error.It seems this exception class is still active so not sure what the problem is. I've installed  and  (even though python on the 16.04 system is a symlink to python-2.7) with no luck. This is my error and line 507 from the code. Any way to get more info about the error?update: As noted by @a_guest. Had to make this change. Why it runs fine on 14.04 I don't know. Maybe this was the difference bewteen 2.7.6 and 2.7.12:
You linked the documentation for Python 3 however you seem to be using Python 2.  on Python 2 doesn't have that  module, just as the error states. on the other hand has this class, so you can use  instead. 
That error means that the urllib module contains nothing called .My urllib doesn't have an  submodule.
Note that Ubuntu 16.04  is a symlink to . If you want to use python 3.x, you should  change the first line of your script from to(Note: the "#!" at the beginning of this line is called "shebang".)Alternatively you can create a virtual environment so that when you activate it, it will run python 3.
