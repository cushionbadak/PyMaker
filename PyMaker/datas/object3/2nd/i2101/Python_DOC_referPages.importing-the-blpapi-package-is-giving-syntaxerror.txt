Before I begin, I'd like to preface that I'm relatively new to python, and haven't had to use it much before this little project of mine. I'm trying to make a twitter bot as part of an art project, and I can't seem to get tweepy to import. I'm using macOS High Sierra and Python 3.7. I first installed tweepy by using and this appeared to work, as I'm able to find the tweepy files in finder. However, when I simply input into the IDLE, I get this error:Any idea on how to remedy this? I've looked at other posts on here and the other errors seem to be along the lines of "tweepy module not found", so I don't know what to do with my error. Thanks!
Using  as an identifier has been deprecated since Python 3.5, and became an error in Python 3.7, because it's a keyword.This Tweepy bug was reported on 16 Mar, and fixed on 12 May, but there hasn't been a new release yet. Which is why, as the repo's main page says:Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5 & 3.6 are supported.For the time being, you can install the development version:Or, since you've already installed an earlier version:You could also follow the instructions from the repo:However, this will mean  may not fully understand what you've installed.
In Python3.7,  became a reserved word (as can be seen in whats new section here) and therefore cannot be used as argument. This is why this  is raised. That said, and following s official GitHub (here), onlyPython 2.7, 3.4, 3.5 & 3.6 are supported.However, if you really must use Python3.7, there is a workaround. Following this suggestion, you canopen streaming.py and replace  with and it should work
