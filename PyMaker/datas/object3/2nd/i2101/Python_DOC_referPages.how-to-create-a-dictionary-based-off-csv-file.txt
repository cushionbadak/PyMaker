I have a csv file with the following format:I have opened the csv file and printed it out already.I now want to make it so it's made into a dictionary such as:     [ID: 1978, Number : 26, Date : 24/4/10, Name : Jim, Email :      Jim@randomemail.com], [etc], [etc]I know this is probably very easy but I'm new and have been stuck for a few hours. 
Here's some code written in pure python that'll do the trick:
Following up on my comment, consider something like:Output:The two extra arguments to  are necessary to get your variable-space-delimited file to parse correctly.Or, if you want all the rows at once, something like:producesand,produces UpdateIf your file is actually tab delimited, you could use:You should be able to tell what the delimiter by printing the line (as you already have), but wrap it in a  call -- something like .  If you see a  in the output, it's tab delimited.
Using pandas will make your life much easier:That's it, there are some optional arguments in  to help you format it the way you want.
