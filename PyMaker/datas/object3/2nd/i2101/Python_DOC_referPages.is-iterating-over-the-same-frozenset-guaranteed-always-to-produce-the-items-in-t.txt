For example, when I execute , then , I get . (When / how) is it possible, if ever, for  to produce the items in a different order? (When / how) will  return ?I am using Python 3 almost all of the time, but I would also be curious about Python 2.
By default, the hash values of  objects are salted with an unpredictable random value. Although they remain constant within an individual Python process, they are not predictable between repeated invocations of Python. Changing hash values affects the iteration order of sets. So, when hash randomization is on, you will get items in a different order:If you disable it, you will get a repeatable but arbitrary order:Since Python 3.3, hash randomization is enabled by default to workaround a security vulnerability.See also: the  switch to the interpreter.
