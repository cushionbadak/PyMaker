So basically for example of you have a list like:The output should be:So basically put together the values that are duplicated into a list, I tried:But doesn't work, and if it does work it is not gonna be efficient
Sort the list then use :EDIT: this is probably not the fastest approach, sorting is O(n log n) time complexity for the average case and not required for all solutions (see the comments)
Use :
You can use :This returns:
Probably not the most efficient, but this is understandable:
Another approach is to use  method.Output
Here's a functional solution via . As it requires sorting, this will have time complexity O(n log n).The syntax is cumbersome since Python does not offer native function composition. This is supported by 3rd party library :
