I would like to create a new nested list from an already existing nested list. This new list should include the indices+1 from the existing list.Example:Result:How can I create such a list?
save a python loop, force iteration of  (required for python 3) in a list comprehension, so it's faster than a classical double nested comprehension:
There's a few ways to do this, but the first that comes to mind is to enumerate the elements with a starting index of  in a nested list comprehension.
Another solution could be:    
Here is are some simple solutions:
Using nested list comprehensionFirst you want a list with every number from 1 to the length of your sublist. There are several ways to do this with list comprehension.For exampleorSecond you want to do this for every sublist inside your . Therefore you have to use nested list comprehension:Using list comprehension with rangeAnother way would be using the range built-in function as a generator for your sublists:Using map with rangeOr you can use the map built-in function
