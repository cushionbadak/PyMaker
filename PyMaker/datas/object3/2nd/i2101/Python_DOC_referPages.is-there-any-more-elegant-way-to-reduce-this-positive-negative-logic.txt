Is there any more elegant way to reduce the code below, which should reverse a direction from left to right and vice versa, based on the size of a line?
Maybe something like:
You can reduce 3 branching statements to 2 if you use the  function: will copy the sign of  and apply it to the left operand (in this case, 1).If  and  are floats, use  to check for closeness accounting for floating inaccuracies.If you have numpy, you can handle the special case of  with the function itself using :
A compact and elegant function definition, if you need to reuse the code, could be this: 
You can use print with two conditional expressions   
You need the  (compare) function from the  package.  In other languages, a similar function is called .  The Python community didn't have a clear consensus on edge cases, and has so far left  out of the language.I think this got deprecated in Python 3.  In that case, use For Python 3 without , you could do
