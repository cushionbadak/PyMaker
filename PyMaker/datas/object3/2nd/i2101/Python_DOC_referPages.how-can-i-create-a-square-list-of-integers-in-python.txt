I'm trying to create a square matrix, given an integer input.For example:my attempt:prints this result:The array must be square and consist of sequential integers.
Here's one way:The main misunderstanding appears to be in spotting the pattern. For example, the first value in each column can be computed via , where  iterates over . For the  argument of , you just need to add n to the formula, and we can use the identity:As an aside, if you are happy to use a 3rd party library, this is trivial with NumPy:
You can use  to create an iterator that yields ascending numbers, and then advance that iterator in a nested list comprehension using the  function:
i rather use numpy (IT IS NOT A LIST so i know it's not the required OP, however it can still be interesting)take also in consideration the time to compute:will give the following graph for 200 points:for large matrix, go straight for the numpy solution of @jpp
You can use comprehensive lists. For a zero-filled matrix:For a matrix with consecutive elements (zero-based):For a matrix with consecutive elements (one-based):And for a square print you can use:
