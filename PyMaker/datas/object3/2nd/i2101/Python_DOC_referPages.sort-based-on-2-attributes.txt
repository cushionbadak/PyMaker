I'm trying to sort numbers in lexicographical (reverse) order and from shortest to longest number. So for example the numbers  should be rearanged as .I'm trying this code:but it only does a right job when the numbers have the same length. How should I fix it so that shorter numbers would come before longer numbers (i.e., 9 before 99)?
Something like this?
This is what I came up with, similar idea to @Andyk's solution but avoiding a double sort and using  input. It requires importing  to handle, for example, .
You can hardly write a meaningful key function in Python 3 for this type of sorting without resorting to a comparator function and then using  to make it into a key function.Check which of the items is larger up to their minimum length (using  to iterate on both stops at min length), if both are same, check their lengths:The sort function is quite readable, does not process further when the items are equal, and with , stops on the min length; adaptive.
