I have the following python script that pulls tweets from twitter and sends it to a kafka topic. The script runs perfectly, but when I try to run it inside a docker container, it fails to import the kafka library. It says "SyntaxError: invalid syntax".Following is content of the python script(twitter_app.py):However, now I am trying to run this script inside a docker container, but it fails, and I get the following error:For your reference, following are the contents of Dockerfile (Please note that, when I used the same Dockerfile with a simple script that was not using kafka, it worked perfectly fine):I have been fighting with it for the past few days, but I haven't been able to figure out the issue. Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance.
The error occurs only in python 3.7, because of an incompatible change, async is a reserved keyword since this version.The solution is to keep using python 3.6 until the library is adapted to the new version, there is an already closed issue:(I took the liberty of reducing the Dockerfile)
