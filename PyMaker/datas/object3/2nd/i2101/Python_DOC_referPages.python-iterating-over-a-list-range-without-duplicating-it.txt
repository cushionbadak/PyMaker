This question already has an answer here:pythonic way to iterate over part of a list                    7 answers                Suppose that I have the list  and that I want to iterate over its elements from indices  to , where .My options, as I know them are:Option 1: Constructing a whole new listOption 2: Iterating over the indices themselvesBoth options are not desirable. The first option is not desirable because it involves construction of a new list. The second option is not desirable especially in terms of readability, as its iteration is over the indices, rather than over the list elements.Is there a built-in generator function that iterates over the elements in a given range? 
You can use  to iterate over a subset of values, by index:This will still iterate over all  initial values of , but will do so in C and not keep skipped values in memory.Demo:
