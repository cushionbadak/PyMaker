This question already has an answer here:Create a dictionary with list comprehension in Python                    11 answers                This is mostly a question of good/pythonic style. I have a dictionary which has lists for values, i.e.and so on. I also have an empty dictionary with the same keys, in which I want to store the mean of these lists against their key. If instead of using a second dictionary, I used a nested list, I could dogiving an outputwhich seems neat to me. Is there a way to do this nicely outputting as a dictionary, or is something like this:the best I can do?
Yes, by using a dictionary comprehension; you already have the parts to build each key and value together in your list comprehension, just alter the syntax a little:The syntax is closely related to list comprehensions, but instead of a single expression for each list element value, you have two expressions: one for the key (just  in the above example) and one for the associated value ( in the above).You already appear to be familiar with the syntax, as you created a dictionary mapping from keys to empty lists:before using a separate loop to replace those lists with the  calculations for the exact same keys.
Use a dictionary comprehension!
