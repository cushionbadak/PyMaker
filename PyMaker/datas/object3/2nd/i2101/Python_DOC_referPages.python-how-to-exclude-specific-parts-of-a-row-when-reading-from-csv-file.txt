I'm very new to Python and am trying to read a CSV file:`I'd like to save only the specific attributes of this data into a dictionary, or a list of lists. For example, I'd only like to keep the year, name and the five numbers (in a row). I'm not sure how to exclude only the middle three columns.This is the code I have now: I only know how to keep chunks of columns together, but not only specific columns one by one.
You could do this with a simple list comprehension:You could also consider using Pandas to help you read and wrangle the data:
You could use  and pass in your desired column names:Yields:Another option would be to pass the column index locations up front with , like so:Notice that this returns a dataframe with index-location named columns:
You could try to split each line and assign it explicitly to variables; then simply ignore the variables you will not use (I named them , so its obvious that they will not be used).This will raise errors (in the code line that has ) if a line has less or more than the desired fields.
