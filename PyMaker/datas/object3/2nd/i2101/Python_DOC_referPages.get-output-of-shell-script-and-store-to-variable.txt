I have a shell command(I'm running it on python) and I want to get its output and store it in a variable. Can you guys help me on how this can be done?This is my python code...By the way what it does is it gets the number of page/s of a docx file. It's working but as I've said I don't know how to store it in a variable. When I do this:It doesn't return the right value.Thank you so much in advance. I tried converting this to a sub-process.call but I also don't know how because I'm a beginner. Thanks again!
You can do this with the  module in the Python Standard Library.Please note that if you use  in  and the  input is not trusted (e.g. user-provided), you have a security problem, i.e., arbitrary code execution. The same goes for .See the official documentation for a possible solution using .
you can use subprocess to get the output
