In Python, what would be the most elegant way of converting this structure:into this structure: and potentially back.What is needed is a function that can take either a list of a string of comma separated values (first case) or a list of strings of the same values (second case) and handle them as one and the same: a list of strings.In pseudocode:Also, if using  as per suggestions:Is there a way to make the delimiter space insensitive or conditional or a regex: I'd like to get to the  result in either  or  or even this  (or a combination thereof) as an input?A bit more clarification:Basically, I'm looking for the most elegant Python conditional expression that would result in the same output both in case of  and  above:.
You were almost there in your edit:
you could use  and  to get from one representation to the other:in a function you could do this:
How about using :Code:Test Code:Results:To return:To return use Results:
You can define a function using  on  followed by flattening of result using In case of variable separator and optional space, regex would be a better choice
split() and join() can try .Output for case-1Case-2Output for case-2
By using  to eliminate all white spaces you can use a formula that will work on all cases presented.    
I think it's most clear simply using  and .
