i am trying to grasp Regexp using python. I am trying to match patterns wherein the first character of the block of characters cant be a number while the rest can be any number or character or _. The first char can only be _ or characters. e.gMy code: This accepts  too whereas it should only accept  or  in first place.
This would find nothing for  but find :Output:The difference is I prepended  to the pattern, meaning: beginning of line.From the doku: https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.search  Scan through string looking for  the first location where the regular expression pattern produces a  match, and return a corresponding match object. Return None if no  position in the string matches the pattern; note that this is  different from finding a zero-length match at some point in the  string. is not contstrained to find at the begin of a string - use  for an implicit "find at string beginning" search:
Problem here lies in your boundary: it matches the boundary between  and a letter.You have to rework it another way.I chose to use a lookbehind to match only when not preceded by a non spacing character, replacing  by :NB: The trailing word boundary is useless, as trying to match  will always stop when no more is met.
