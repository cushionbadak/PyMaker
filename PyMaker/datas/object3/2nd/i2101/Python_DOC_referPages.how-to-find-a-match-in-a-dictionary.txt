I have two dictionaries, RFQDict and AwardsDict. I want to take the keys of RFQdict and search through AwardsDict values for matches. So I tried thisis this the way to do it or there is a better way and how could return the key and values where the match was found?
In python3 you can do  and you will get a set with the common key/values. The '&' operator is used for set intersection and works with the dictionary views returned by values() and keys(). More information of the view returned by those methods: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=dictview#dictionary-view-objects
If you want to store the keys and values that match, it would probably be best to store the key and value from the second dictionary since if you just store the matching key and value you will have elements like  which won't really tell you much about where they matched in the second dictionary. Maybe something like this 
I would do a list comprehension:This way you get a list keeping the duplicates. That is, if a RFQ key is presented in more than one value in AwardsDict. With the & operator you loss that information (as sets only have unique elements).For example:
