Like I should be able to use:Also, is there any other way to achieve my goal?Update: Found the error,  should return a value.Correct code
 is called when an attribute is requested for get but is not available from the asked object.Assuming that  hasn't an , a call likeis functionally equivalent towhich is functionally equivalent towhich is normally the same asLast two variants only differ if the  is bound to the object instead of the class (which may not work)As you can see here,  should return the value that  is meant to have.It can also set the attribute directly so that further get requests do not call  again but are handled by Python directly.
