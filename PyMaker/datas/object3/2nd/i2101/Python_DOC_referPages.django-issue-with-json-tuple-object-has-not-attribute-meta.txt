Please do not do serialization yourself: Django has some builtin serializiation functionality, and you can subclass a serializer to change its behavior.Your view also does not return a HTTP response, but this is a contract it should satisfy (well it should return a HTTP response, or it should raise some error).Instead you write content to a file, but writing to files is typically not a good idea (unless you expect the filesize to be huge, in which case you can use a temporary file). By using files, you create race conditions, a hacker might also aim to "inject" a different filename and thus overwrting certain files to run arbitrary code, or changing credentials, and finally it is possible that the server has certain permissions making it impossible to write to a file (the permissions of the directory).Django allows you to see a HTTP response a s a stream object, to which content can be written, like:
Django's serialization is for models, but you are using  which returns plain Python s.In your specific case, you can simply use the built-in  module:
django serialize except the querset object ,this will return the tuple, you can replace with below
If you want to write the json representation of something to a file, use :
