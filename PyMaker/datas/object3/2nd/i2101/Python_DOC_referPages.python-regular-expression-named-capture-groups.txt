Im learning regular expressions, specifically named capture groups.Having an issue where I'm not able to figure out how to write an if/else statement for my function findVul().Basically how the code works or should work is that findVul() goes through data1 and data2, which has been added to the list myDATA.If the regex finds a match for the entire named group, then it should print out the results. It currently works perfectly.CODE:OUTPUT:Now I want to add an if/else statement to check if there are any matches for the entire named group.I tried something like this, but it doesn't seem to be working.CODE:OUTPUT:As you can see it does not print the vulnerabilities that should be in data1.Could someone please explain the correct way to do this and why my logic is wrong. Thanks so much :) !!
The problem is that  returns an iterator that is evaluated when you do the  test; when you iterate over it again in the for-loop, it is already exhausted and there are no items left. The simple fix is just to add a  line after the  call.
I did some more research after @AdamKG response.I wanted to utlize the re.findall() function.re.findall() will return a list of all matched substrings. In my case I have capture groups inside of my named capture group. This will return a list with tuples.For example the following regex with data1:Will return a list with tuples:My Final Code for findVul():
