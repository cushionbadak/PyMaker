I want to integrate a function that has no closed form solution with an unknown variable and then plot vs the unknown variable. To try a simpler test, I tried to use the integral of , integrated with respect to  and plot with different values of .  However, the code below gets the erroronly size-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalarseven though the integral of a number, e.g. , seems to return the correct scalar value.  
You pass a numpy array as the argument  while you wanted to integrate over  for all the items of . Therefore you can use this:
onno was a bit faster. But here is my similar solution. You need to loop over all the different :
