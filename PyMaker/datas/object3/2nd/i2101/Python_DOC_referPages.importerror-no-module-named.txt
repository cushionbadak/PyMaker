When server.py imports app1.py,  tries to import  and I get the above mentioned errorWhat am I doing wrong here?
If you are running  as a script, the parent directory of  is not added to . The  directory itself is added instead (not as a package but as a import search path).You have 4 options:Move  out of the  package (next to it)Add a new script file next to  that only runs:Use the  switch option to run a module as the main entry point:Add the parent directory of  to :This last option can introduce more problems however; now both the  package and the modules contained in the  package are on . You can import both  and  and Python will see these as two separate modules, each with their own entry in , with separate copies of their globals.
