I'm sure this has been asked and answered, but I couldn't find it specifically:I'm just picking up Python and I'm not understanding a variable scope issue. I've simplified the problem to the following:Case 1:Case 2:Case 3: and  have  undefined in the print statement.  works. Where does  actually exist in  and ?Is there a way to access  in Case 1 without a  declaration?
From the docs:Note: The default locals act as described for function  below: modifications to the default locals dictionary should not be attempted. Pass an explicit locals dictionary if you need to see effects of the code on locals after function  returns.In other words, if you call  with one argument, you're not supposed to try to assign any variables, and Python doesn't promise what will happen if you try.You can have the uted code assign to globals by passing  explicitly. (With an explicit  dict and no explicit  dict,  will use the same dict for both globals and locals.)
