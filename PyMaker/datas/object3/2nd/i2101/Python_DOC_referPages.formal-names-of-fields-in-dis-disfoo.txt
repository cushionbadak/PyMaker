I have the following codes, Reference to the bytecodes:I know that:the first column is line-number: 2, 3, 4 the third column is op-names: LOAD_CONST etcthe fifth column is the codes: (2) (a)How about the second column: 0, 2 4, 6, 8...and the fourth column 1, 0, 2, 1Could you please provide a hint to find related info?
The second column is the bytecode byte index; each bytecode consists of 2 bytes (one indicating the exact opcode, the other the opcode argument value). It is actually column #4; there are two columns with no current value in your output.For your function, you can find the bytestring that contains the bytecode as the  attribute:So  is ,  is , etc.This is documented under the  function:The output is divided in the following columns:the line number, for the first instruction of each linethe current instruction, indicated as ,a labelled instruction, indicated with ,the address of the instruction,the operation code name,operation parameters, andinterpretation of the parameters in parentheses.When you use , column #2 (current instruction) will always be empty.Column #3, the labelled instruction, is used whenever there's a loop or test. For example:There are 4 jump targets, where several opcodes can trigger a jump to one of those positions. They serve as a visual marker to ease reading.
