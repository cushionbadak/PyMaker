You were nearly there with your own pattern, it needs three alterations in order to work as you want it. First, the star in regexes isn't a glob, as you might be expecting it from shell scripting, it's a kleene star. Meaning, it needs some character group it can apply it's "zero to n times" logic on. In your case, the  alphanumeric character class   should work. If that's too restrictive, use  instead, which matches any character except line breaks.Secondly, you need to apply the regex in a way that you can easily extract the results you want. The usual way to go about it is to define groups, using parentheses.Last but not least, the  sign is a meta-character in regexes, so if you want to match it literally, you need to write a backslash in front of it. In working code, it'll look like this:Output:
