Natural Text
My code pretty much asks user input and a pre made text which it prints to the .txt file. I want to add the character calculator to print into the file, not as a print. Is it possible?This pretty much prints the amount of characters as print not to the text file how I want it. Is it possible to edit this somehow that it prints the character amount straight to the file and not as a print?
First before you go into this appending, take a look at how many places you are calling  its unnecessary most of these values are already stings and ready to be written. Also avoid variable names like  that have preassigned purposes in python. But to add this  to the end,  is an option, you should open the file as  append. Then you can add this number to the end of your file.
