I have directory containing multiple subdirectories of different scraper. How would you go about writing script that will cd into each of the subdirectories and run the scraper, cd out then continue to the next one what would be the best way to do this if it possible? Example of the how the directory looks:all the scrapers have main function 
One way of doing this is to walk through your directories and programmactically import the modules you need.Assuming that the s are in the same subdirectory  and you have the  script in the directory containing  (hence, at the same path level), the following script will do the trick:EDITIf the script is inside the  path, the code can be adapted by changing a bit how the  is called.EDIT 2Some explanations:How  is being used?The  line, is what is actually doing the job. Roughly speaking, when it is used with only one argument, i.e.it is equivalent to:Instead, when used with two argumens, i.e.it is equivalent to:This second form is very convenient for relative imports (i.e. imports using  or  special directories).What is  doing?When you import a module, Python will generate some bytecode to be interpreted and it will cache the result as  files under the  directory. The aforementioned line will avoid that, when walking through the directories,  (actually, any directory starting with ) will be processed as if it would contain modules to import. Other kind of filtering may be equally valid.
You may want to check  function that traverses the directory tree and at each directory run the script (or the  function that you can wrap the contents of the script into).An example code would be:
