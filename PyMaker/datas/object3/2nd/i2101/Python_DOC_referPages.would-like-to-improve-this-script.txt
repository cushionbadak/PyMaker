Natural Text
I was reviewing some scripts that I have saved and came across to this particular one; I feel like it can be improved without the need of using all the lower/upper case letters, any advice? I was thinking of using , but don't really see how to implement it 
Using , you could lowercase the character you are about to test so you don't need the uppercase letters. Characters that are  or  are not affected by . Also, use  with a generator expression to make you code more compact and (IMHO) more readable.Or you could use  defined in the  module:In both cases, the  check will be linear (O(k) for k "good" letters), though. This should not be a problem for such a short list of letters, but to improve it further, you could turn  into a  so that the  check will be O(1).
Use  to find all letters and dots and take length:
You can also use the following method, basically, stripping the digits and using  to count number of remaing chars:Or using  from  module:EDIT: Following tobias_k comments, I suggest the following which is similar to Austing's answer but through different approach:Which it says to look for all characters except(^) the ones mentioned after (^), which are the digits.
Well I used , , and (didn't need ):Now, my questions is about why Python says that my line   is inconsistent?error:
