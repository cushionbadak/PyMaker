Basically:I am trying to convert hex to decimal using dictionaries but I can't figure out how I would convert it. I have tried using a for loop to iterate over the hexadecimal value that the user enters, and to convert each one by multiplying it to a power of 16 depending on the length of hex. For example, if the user enters F21, the program should recognise that the length is 3 so should start by multiplying 15(F) by 16^2 and add this to 2*16^1 and add this to 1*16^0. But I come across so many errorsHexadecimal to Decimal Dictionary:Note:I am not trying to use this solution as I am trying to practice dictionaries
Since you are converting to decimals, the default base for integers, you should make the values of  integers rather than strings, so that you can perform numeric operations on each translated hex number:with the above code,would return:
Simply look over both the index  and the digit  of the hex string using , and do the computation  (e.g. with  when ). Specifically, we have , with the  needed because you store the values of your  as s. Finally,  everything up:The  is needed because the first (hexadecimal) digits refer to the larger values.The  is used just to keep the final decimal result as a , just as the values in your .
A one-liner, using  and :
