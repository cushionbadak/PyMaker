I'm trying to build a relative path. When running the following line in my .py scriptI get a name error. It used to work just a few days ago when I set it up but now it doesn't any longer. I am not executing this in my shell, just running my script as usually. only returns an empty string. When I use  instead, it returns the home directory but not the path to my file. I thought  is set to the filepath as soon as I load a module in my script. Anyone know where I'm going wrong?More info: my .py script is in a folder in "C:/Users/corr/Documents/Uni/Thesis/Code/" I want to construct a relative path so I can access the data files in folder "C:/Users/corr/Documents/Uni/Thesis/Data/". When I set up the script, the following lines worked:Now though, when I run the first line I get a NameError:  not defined. When I run the same line with  instead, it returns "C:\Users\corr". Also, I am executing my script in the Spyder environment, as this is where I usually work.
 is set for modules, not scripts, which are supposed to use .  (In some cases,  is the basename used to find a program via .)  Spyder apparently sets it to an empty string instead (or, in one buggy version sets  to an empty list), so you might have to do silly things likeMeanwhile, using  (the string literal) just means a file by that name.   returns an empty string for it (since it has no slashes), which many Python functions (like ) interpret to mean the current working directory (which for Spyder is evidently your home directory).
