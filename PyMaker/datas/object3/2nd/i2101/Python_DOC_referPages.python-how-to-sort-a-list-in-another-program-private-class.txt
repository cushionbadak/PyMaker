I am trying to sort a list which is in a private class, i can sort it without getting private but can't in private.First i open data and split it in main.py, and set a list call StudentDL in main.py and call it to Student.py , if I private Student.py, I can't sort the StudentDL list in main.py .How can I sort the StudentDL list in main.py or Student.py after private Student.py?Main.py:Student.py:markdata:
Why do you expect to be able to access private attributes from outside the class? The whole point of private attributes is to prevent that (Python makes it easy to work around it, but you're explicitly violating encapsulation when you do it).If the variables should be logically readable, with privacy being used primarily to prevent writes,  can declare  accessors:If that protection isn't needed though, then just declare your attributes without the leading  in the first place, and leave them public.
