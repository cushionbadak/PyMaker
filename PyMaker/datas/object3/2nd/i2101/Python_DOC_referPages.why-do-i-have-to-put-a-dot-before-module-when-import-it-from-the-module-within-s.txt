I am learning Python and feel import function is some different from that of Java.I have a code hierarchy like below: runs as above. When I re-write  as:Python gives me an error saying  can not be found...I guess  and  are in same directory thus they shall refer to each other with their module (file) name, why should I have to add a dot before ?
The Java equivalent would be to explicitly reference  everywhere, like:The Python equivalent of that would be:That is correct Python and actually preferred style. Python also has the ability to use relative paths in import statements ( style), but they tend to cause more confusion. PEP 8 recommends using absolute imports everywhere whenever possible:Absolute imports are recommended, as they are usually more readable and tend to be better behaved (or at least give better error messages) if the import system is incorrectly configured.
