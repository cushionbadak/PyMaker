I would like to get a unique process names, PIDs and listening ports from .I currently have the following code:The problem is that process names and PIDs are duplicated to match the number of items from the nested for loop (ports):I guess I could convert them to  afterwards but I hope there is a better, more pythonic way to do it without wasting resources.Update: Thu 11 Oct 14:36:33 UTC 2018Based on the answer from @Rouven B. I've got the following code now:But I still wonder if there is some another approach, perhaps using one of the functions from itertools?
Here is a list comprehension to get rid of duplicatesBut this is not easy to read. How about thisBut using  to get rid of the duplicates is also a quite pythonic solution I'd say. It shouldn't be too slow and doesn't change the time complexity (in O terms) of the algorithm.EDIT: I misunderstood what you wanted to achieve. Here goes another compact approach (still not really readable)
