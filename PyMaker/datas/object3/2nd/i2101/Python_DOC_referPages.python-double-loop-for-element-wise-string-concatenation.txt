My question is very simple:I have , How do I get ?Thank you!
with list comprehension:we thus iterate over the elements in  and for each element  in , we iterate over , and then add  to the list.Or for a variadic number of lists, and with a generator:This can be easily extended to a variable number of elements, like:
You can use :This has the benefit of working with any number of iterables.
Its easier to see whats happening in a complete loop, here we are going to take  which will be  and  which will be . On our first iteration we combine the first two  then  them to our new list , next comes   then onto  and the process repeats.After you understand this you can skip that process and do it with list comprehension, this is identical.
