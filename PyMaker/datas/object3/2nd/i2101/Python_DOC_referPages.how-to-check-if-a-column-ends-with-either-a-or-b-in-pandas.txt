I need to filter columns by the last character, testing against multiple characters.Output:Here I am not getting all columns ending with either ,  or .
You can use  with a , followed by Boolean indexing:The functionality mimics Python's built-in , which allows you to supply a  to match against multiple items as alternative conditions.
If I remember correctly, the  attribute of a dataframe is not a series so you can't treat it as such. It's a list.To clarify, the columns aren't technically lists. They are some variation of a special type of pandas Index. But for 99% of all intents and purposes they can be treated as lists. The point I'm trying to make clear is that they are  Series and thus don't have series methods.
