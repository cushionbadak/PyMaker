This question already has an answer here:Is there a difference between “==” and “is”?                    20 answers                In the following code :The loop breaks at 256, but if you set  to 257, it doesn't. Why ?
Because you are checking for  with  (instead of checking for  with ).As an implementation detail, Python keeps an array of integer objects for all integersbetween -5 and 256, when you create an int in that range you actually just getback a reference to the existing object.So integers above 256 will still be , but not  (unless they refer to the same object, you can compare that with ).Source: https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/long.html#c.PyLong_FromLong
