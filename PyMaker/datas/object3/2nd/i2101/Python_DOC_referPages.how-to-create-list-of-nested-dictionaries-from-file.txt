Natural Text
I have an input text file containing a list of key/value pairs that I would like to read into python as a list of dictionaries but can not seem to get it to work as expected.  Note that the file is not in valid json format so I can not use the  built-in and this question is not a duplicate of this.  I suspect that I am missing something obvious here so any guidance is much appreciated.  Since this file contains a list with 2 elements, I would expect the  to be 2 and the  to be  but that is not what I'm seeing.Output:

EDIT: I didn't saw earlier that DYZ answered before me but I would like to explain my answer a bit more.There is a module called 'ast' that have the function 'literal_eval', as the name suggest, it evaluates the information of the txt as python code and also validates the input.Output:
If you're trying to store and retrieve Python objects, serialization is probably a better way to go. See, for example, the pickle module.But, in the present context, you could use the built-in Python eval function to accomplish your goal.
