I want to match ticket IDs in ticket titles with a regular expression in Python, using the module re. The pattern is really simple:Works perfectly in testing (on regexr.com) and even in the actual program in most cases - but ONLY if the ticket title immediately starts with the ticket ID.As soon as there is anything else preceding it (like "[SomeTag]"), the Python implementation no longer gives any matches, even though on regexr.com it works perfectly in this case too.I've been pondering this for quite some time, tried different variations but to no avail. I would really appreciate any assistance in this matter.
Maybe you're using  instead of ?:If zero or more characters at the beginning of string match the regular expression pattern, return a corresponding match object. Return None if the string does not match the pattern.:Scan through string looking for the first location where the regular expression pattern produces a match, and return a corresponding match object.
It sounds like you are using re.match. This will only match patterns at the start of the string. To match patterns anywhere in the string, use re.search.
