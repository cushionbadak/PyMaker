How can I extract the index of a substring in a  list of strings (preferentially in a rapid way to handle long lists)?For example, with  and character , I would like to return .
You can use  with a list comprehension:As described in the docs:Return the lowest index in the string where substring  is found  within the slice . Optional arguments  and  are  interpreted as in slice notation. Return  if  is not found.
Or with index
