I have categories saved in a database on table Geo_Cat. I know my geo_list is getting populated correctly, because I was able to make an OptionMenu earlier. I also printed the list and it worked. So the query is good. However, I need to be able to select more than one option at a time and need to use a MenuButton instead. The options that I need are none and the categories in the table. I've been able to add the "None" checkbutton, but I haven't been able to add the geo_list. Below is a code excerpt:I also tried this: How can I add my geo_list to the checkbuttons? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 
If you want the items in the  for menu labels, why not just set them; you are already looping over them: Also, don't pack amb at the very end; you have already gridded it earlier. I'm adding an example of how to trace changes associated with each menu item. I have changed the code slightly but I think you will have no problem to get the general idea. I'm using a  instead of an , then each var is saved in  with the key . Finally I'm setting up a trace for changes in each menu item to to a callback function which will inspect the selections. Is this what you are after?
