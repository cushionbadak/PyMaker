so I recently learned about data visualization after watching a cool Numberphile video, I wanted to make my own little data visualization with random numbers. The idea is that I have a list of random integers, and based on the number, I draw a different colored circle. The color key is explained in the code below.However, I seem to be having a logic problem with my code. The code runs without bugs, but based on what I described previously, my program is not working properly. First off, my list has 10 integers in it, but only 6 are drawn on the program. Also, the coloring is a bit off. Any help is appreciated, thanks.
The first step to debug the program would be to print . You'll see that you're iterating over the indices in the  not over a range like you expect. So the first number is 9, you check , that's  and it sets  and displays it at 550.You can iterate over the range  to fix this problem.I suggest putting the colors into a list or dictionary and just iterate over the enumerated . Then you get the number  and the color index at the same time and can just access the color in this way: .The updated code:
