I want to call the Python function in C++ using python.h but there are some problems.Here is my Python function sampleand the C++ sampleBut the pRes returns NULL. And the PyObject_CallObject is just like a blackbox, I can't step in to look how it works.So I want to ask that is there anything wrong in my code?And the arguments preparation is right or not? (There are few examples in this case on the internet.)
A CPython API function that returns NULL means that an error has occurred. You can use the  set of API functions to query this exception.For debugging, the most useful is probably , which will just print the exception and stack trace (if any) to stderr.Make sure to double check that  and  are not NULL. The exception may have occurred when trying to import the module or get the function from the module. CPython does not raise exceptions, it just returns NULL on an error. So checking the return value of C-API functions is important.
