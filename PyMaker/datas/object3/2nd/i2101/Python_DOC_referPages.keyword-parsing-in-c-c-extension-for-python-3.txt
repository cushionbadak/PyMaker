I am currently trying to implement a Python module using C++. Official Python 3 docs provide an example here, but to my surprise the code provided there throws errors in my Visual Studio 2017!If you take a look at  function implementation, you will see a function call  that takes several arguments, including a keyword array  declared 3 lines above (Example copy-pasted below):However upon trying to declare a  of my own like in example above, VS2017 throws the following error:a value of type "const char *" cannot be used to initialize an entity of type "char *"The simple thing would be to declare my own  as , but  expects  as . (Documentation here)Is there a way to deal with this without resorting to extremes like ?Thank you.EDIT:One of the comments below suggested to simply copy from  to  and I believe that will be the simplest approach to resolve this.
I cannot think of anything less horrible than 
You can store the strings as s, and then use  to get your sAlternatively, you can use offsets into a single string literal
