I know many topics around class inheritance in Python have been addressed, but I could not find a thread that addressed this specific issue.Edit: I'm running Python 3.5.5.Code:Output:Why does does  return the child object and not the string ? I feel like it should print out the default string set for the Parent class.  This appears to be the same syntax as I have been following in this tutorial.Thanks, everyone.
Because you provide the instance of child (aka ) to the super call:Use: instead and you get this output instead:
Your call to  is wrong. It's not necessary to explicitly pass a  argument when using it to delegate a method call to a superclass (see the typical usage example shown in the documentation). In Python 3, calls to  with no arguments are equivalent to —which was the only way it could be done in Python 2—making it no longer necessary to specify it at all when making calls to superclass methods.So what's happening, since you passed it in your code, is that it gets interpreted as overriding the default value specified for the  argument. Here's doing it properly and the result:
