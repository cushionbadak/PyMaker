Hi i have a list of tuples containing words and their respective categories.Is there anyway that i can clump them into something like a dictionary ?Sample Data:Expected Output:Is it possible to sort it in this manner ? what functions should i use. please advice me as i have a big amount of data. above is just an example. Thank You
The desired output you have shown is not exactly valid. To achieve the closest valid thing, use a  with an empty list
Python can easily convert an iterable of  pairs into a dictionary, and back. But it looks like your tuples are .This is still not that difficult in Python, just use a dict comprehension to switch them.Traditionally, dictionaries are unordered sets of key/value pairs, but s in recent Python versions can remember their insertion order. This is standard in Python 3.7, but considered an implementation detail before that in CPython 3.6. (And before that, you'd have to use an  instead.)So, if you really want your keys in order you can sort on them first, like soThe  builtin can transform its elements before comparing them using a key function. The  operator is equivalent to . This is what makes it possible to sort tuples by their second element.
You can group data on categories and then use an OrderedDict
You can use a  here and then from there use  with a  constructor to create the dictionary back in order you desire
