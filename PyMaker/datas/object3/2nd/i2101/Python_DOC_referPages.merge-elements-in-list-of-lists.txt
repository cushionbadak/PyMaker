I have a list of lists like this:How can I merge the all elements of each inner list to get result  ? I would prefer to do this outside of a loop, if possible, to speed up the code. 
If you don't want to write a loop you can use  and However, the loop using a list comprehension is almost as short to write, and I think is clearer:
You can use :
Use the join method of the empty string. This means: "make a string concatenating every element of a tuple (for example  ) with  (empty string) between each of them.Thus, what you are looking for is:
If you prefer functional programming. You can use the function reduce. Here is how you can achieve the same result using reduce function as follows. Note that, reduce was a built in function in python 2.7 but in python  3 it is moved to library functoolsIt is only required to import reduce if you are using python 3 else no need to import reduce from functoolsIf you don't want to use loop or even list comprehension, here is another way
