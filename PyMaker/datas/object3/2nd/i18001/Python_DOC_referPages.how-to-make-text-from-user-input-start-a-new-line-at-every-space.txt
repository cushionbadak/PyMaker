Natural Text
Essentially I want each new word from the user input to be on the next line, so a sentence such as: "Hello World" would appear asHere is my current script:Which would give the result:How can I make Python detect the spaces and align the words accordingly?Thanks in advance.
When you split the input on spaces, you get your list of each "new" word.You can then print out each one using a loop.
Use the join method
Judging by your  syntax as well as the fact that you are using  and not , I believe this is Python 3.x.  If so, then you can just do this:See a demonstration below:Here is a reference on what the  is.Also,  defaults to split on whitespace.  So, all you need is .However, if you are in fact on Python 2.x (namely, Python 2.7), then you will also need to put this line at the top of your script:The above will make  like it is in Python 3.x, allowing you to use it as I demonstrated.
