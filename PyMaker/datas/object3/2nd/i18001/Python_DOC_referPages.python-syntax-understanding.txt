So in the code above i dont understand the line I marked with confused, 4 lines before the last. Might be because I am new to python or just stupid.What happends in the first case? When the range is [ ] ? ... "for each c in the range of empty array....?i dont get  on the line under aswell. If a is the first element in the counting array which might be zero, how can it be added....? Really confused...Cheers!
You've apparently figured out that  will be 0, and that  will therefore be .So, what you're asking is, what does this do:The answer is that it loops over each of the 0 elements—in other words, it doesn't loop at all. It just does nothing.*This is explained in the docs for the  statement:… The suite is then executed once for each item provided by the iterator… When the items are exhausted (which is immediately when the sequence is empty…) … the loop terminates.And that implicitly explains your second bit of confusion:If a is the first element in the counting array which might be zero, how can it be addedWhen  is 0, you will never get into the loop, so that case cannot ever arise.* If the  statement has an  clause, it does run the  clause.
 will give you a list with specified start and end values. For examplewill printWhen you say,  or  it will generate a list till  or  starting from 0.About In the , for each element, the code checks the . If the  is 0, the second loop will not be executed. ( will produce an empty list) So, for when  is 0   will not be executed.
I simplified part of you code, maybe it it can help you understand the core of the algorithm well . After counting all the elements in the array, we can reconstruct  a sorted array only with the information stored in .
