I am new to Python and  I am finding set() to be a bit confusing. Can someone offer some help with finding and creating a new list of unique numbers( another words eliminate duplicates)?Now....gives the following outputHow do I output a list of only non repeating numbers? I read on the forums that "set()" can do this, but I have tried this with no avail. Any help is much appreciated!
A  is a collection (like a  or ), but it does not allow duplicates and has very fast membership testing. You can use a list comprehension to filter out values in one list that have appeared in a previous list:Output:Note that this version does not filter out values that are duplicated within a single list (unless they're already duplicates of a value in a previous list). You could work around that by replacing the list comprehension with an explicit loop that checks each individual value against the  set (and s it if it's new) before appending to a list for output. Or if the order of the items in your sub-lists is not important, you could turn them into sets of their own:Finally, if the internal sub-lists are a red herring entirely and you want to simply filter a flattened list to get only unique values, that sounds like a job for the  recipe from the  documentation:
 should work in this case.You can try the following:
If you want unique values from the flattened list, you can use reduce() to flatten the list. Then use the frozenset() constructor to get the result list:
