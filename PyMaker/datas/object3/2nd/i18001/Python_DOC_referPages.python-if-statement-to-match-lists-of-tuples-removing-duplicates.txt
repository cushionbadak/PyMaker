I am attempting to pull data from MySQL database on a 10 second interval.  Since the amount of data coming in every second is variable, I plan on pulling the most recent 50 rows every 10 seconds.  My first function works well and pulls the data appropriately.  My second function is supposed to remove duplicates from the previous pull and only push uniques to the new variable, but I am encountering an error and not sure how to fix it.  It seems like for my if statement I am not allowed to match all elements of each tuple.  I'm not really sure how to change this.The data output looks like this:
This was originally a comment, but it seemed to be helpful, so I'm reposting it as an answer:The comma syntax tells python to create a tuple, yes. This is why the following two behaviors are identical:and However, I suspect that this doesn't always apply, for instance in the case of expressing a condition in an if-statement or a loop. This might be indicative of such expressions not being part of the python grammar itself; but not to worry, as the grammar can be edited in the source code (I know for a fact that this is possible, but the citation escapes me at the moment), which can subsequently be compiled into your own flavor of python.For the time being, however, you want to force those variables to be gathered into a tuple, so that you can check for the existence of that tuple in the set. To that end, try this:EDIT: I checked the grammar and this does really seem to be the case.
