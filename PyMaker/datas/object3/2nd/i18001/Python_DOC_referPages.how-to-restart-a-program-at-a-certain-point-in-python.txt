So I made a very primitive and probably inefficient calculator today (first time using Python), and I want to be able to continue doing more problems, how would I do so? Here is my "calculator" app..I want it to restart at the "Type in a value of A." part, but I'm not sure how to do that.
The best way of doing this is probably with a while loop.
Using a while loop, which keeps executing the block as long as the condition, , is true, i.e. it stops when the condition becomes false. After the while loop stops, the code after it is executed, in this case .PS: The brackets around  and  in  are unnecessary. Similarly, the brackets around  and  are also unnecessary. Also, the space after  makes it a little hard to see which function the arguments are part of. I'd suggest you remove the space. Otherwise for a beginner-level programmer the code is good. Once you become more experienced with Python, you might want to use a dictionary mapping the names of the operator into the functions in the  module.
You most likely going to want to use a  loop, something like:
