I know that  is bad, but I sometimes use it for quick prototyping when I feel too lazy to type or remember the importsI am trying the following code:It results in an error: `NameError: global name 'shaders' is not defined'If I change the imports:The error disappears. Why does  not include ?
 is a submodule, not a function.The syntax  doesn't import submodules (Which, as another answer stated, not defined in ). To take the module, you'll have to import it specifically:Or, if you only want to have a few functions of :And if you want to have all the functions of , use:Hope this helps!
If  is a submodule and it’s not included in ,  won’t import it.And yes, it is a submodule.
I learned this from my own situation. A module did not automatically import along with the rest of the package. Before that experience my mistaken understanding was that every packages's modules automatically import from an  or a .  They don't.Beginners might expect EVERYTHING to import under those calls, I believe. But the following GUI programming code, which is common, demonstrates that that's not the case:In the above example, module  doesn't import automatically along with the rest of the  package, for instance.  The explanation that I've been told is as follows: when you use , you actually only imported things in Packages are folders.  Modules are files.  If the import calls for specific files then the package folder's  will enumerate the specific files to import.
