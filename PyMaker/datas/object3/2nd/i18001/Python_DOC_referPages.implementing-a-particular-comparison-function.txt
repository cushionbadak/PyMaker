I am implementing the parallel DC3, pDC3 algorithm from this paper: http://algo2.iti.kit.edu/sanders/papers/KulSan06a.pdf.See line 12:How will I be implementing such a comparison in Python?Sorry I haven't given the complete picture here. But let me go back a few steps and show what S0-S2 look like in my implementation:The last few lines of my code where I compute S0-S2:This is the sample output from my program:So, S0, S1 and S2 are basically native Python sets (at least for now).
I think I can give you some general idea here. Assuming you are using python 2.xIt will be my approach to the problem:Read this http://docs.python.org/3.3/howto/sorting.html to convert the above code to run in python 3 
Rules like this look easy enough to accomodate in a key functionBut I don't see how these ones can be accomodated so easilyYou'll probably have to fall back to use a comparison function for the sortin Python2, you can still use the deprecated  parameterin Python3, use  and pass that to the  parameter
