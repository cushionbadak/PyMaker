I want to distinguish between methods and functions in Python 3. Furthermore, I want to get the corresponding class if it is a method. My current solution is like this:It works, but it looks not elegant. And I am not sure whether I have missed something. Does anyone know a better solution?UPDATE 1: I also want to get the corresponding class if it is a method. I know how to deal with class/instance method(see the above code), but how can I get the class for the static method?
You just need to get the type of the method, but since methods are descriptors, you have to :1 - Get the class out of the instance.2 - Look up the method reference in  instead of making an attribute lookup. E.G :
I think better way to use  method of .Syntax:If you want to test single method, you can do so by...There are many predicates you can use along with is function. Refer to the Python 3 documentation for  for a clear picture.
