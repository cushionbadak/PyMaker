in python i'm using the Crypto package to generate a random number of length 256 bit. The function for doing so is This gives something like:Now my is question how do i transform this number to a string of all ascii characters? Is there a build in function for doing so or do i need to convert it to binary and split it up in blocks of eight ones and zeros and do it myself? Thans in advance.
I don't know if it's built in, but I doubt it.But doing it yourself is not as easy as reinterpreting your data as bytes. This is because Ascii is a 7-bit encoding scheme. The most significant bit is always zero.The easiest way to do this is to convert your int to a packed array of bytes ()[1] and then discard a bit from each byte, e.g. by right shifting. This wastes 1/8 of your entropy but makes for a cleaner program.This only works because you're using a cryptographically secure source of random number generation. This means that each bit has an equal probability of being a one or zero - that is, each bit is uniformly distributed and independent of all others.
