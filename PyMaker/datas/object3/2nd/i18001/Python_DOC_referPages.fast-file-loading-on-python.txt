I have two problems with loading data on python, both the scipts work properly but they need too much time to run and sometimes "Killed" is the result (with the first one).I have a big zipped text file and I do something like this:I have to do some operations on the dictionary I created in the previous scriptDo you have other solutionsin mind? Maybe not the ones involving YAML or JSON...
If the data you are pickling is primitive and simple, you can try  module: http://docs.python.org/3/library/marshal.html#module-marshal. That's what Python uses to serialize its bytecode, so it's pretty fast.
First one comment, in: is not necessary, the context manager ( syntax) does that automatically.Now as for speed, I don't think you're going to get too much faster than cPickle for the purpose of reading in something from disk directly as a Python object. If this script needs to be run over and over I would try using  via  to keep the object stored persistently in memory so you can access it lightning fast:Then after saving it once you can access and modify it, it stays in memory even after the previous program finishes its execution:
