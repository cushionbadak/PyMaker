I am new to programming and one assignment I have to do is create a random hexdigit colour code generator using for loops and .join.Is my program below even close to how you do it, or is it completely off? And, is there a way to make a random amount of numbers and letters appear within 6?
Strings can be iterated over, so my code would look like this. results in You could then put this in a separate file called for example, Then in your main python file, you would use it like this:The  part will only get executed if you run the myutilities.py file directly. It will not execute when you import it from another file. This is generally where testing functions go.Also, note that this is using the syntax for Python 2.7. In Python 3.0, one major difference is that print is a function and you would have to use print(gen_hex_colour_code()) instead. See http://docs.python.org/3.0/whatsnew/3.0.html for more info on how things are different if you are confused. Why would I still be using Python 2.7? Many scientific python modules are still using the 2.7 variant, but for a newbie to Python, I would suggest you stick with 3.0
One compact way to do this is to use list comprehensions (which are a certain kind of for loop):You could shorten the alphabet line by using  and :Or simply just use a string:PS. Since colors are hex, why not just generate a random number and turn it to hexadecimal?
