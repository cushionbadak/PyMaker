Python 3.3.3Pandas 0.12.0I have a single column .csv file with hundreds of float values separated by an arbitrary string (the string contains letters edit: and will vary run to run). I'm a pandas beginner, hoping to find a way to load that .csv file and split the float values into two columns at the level of that string.I'm so stuck at the first part (searching for the string) that I haven't yet been able to work on the second, which I thought should be much easier.So far, I've been trying to use , then something like , but I'm not having much luck. I'd really appreciate if someone could lend a hand. I'm planning to use this process on a number of similar .csv files, so I'd hope to find a fairly automated way of performing the task.Example input.csv:Desired eventual DataFrame:Thanks again if you can point me in the right direction.20131123EDIT: Thank you for the responses thus far. Updated to reflect that the splitting string will not remain constant, hence my statement that I'd been trying to find a solution employing a regex  instead of using .My solution at this point is to just read the .csv file and split with , accumulate into lists, and load those into pandas. Thank you for any further suggestions.20180729 EDIT2: One other possible solution using :
use :output:
If you know you only have two columns, then you could do something likeIf you have an arbitrary number of places to split at, then you can use a boolean Series/shift/cumsum/groupby pattern, but if you can get away without it, so much the better.(PS: I'm sure there's a better way than , but for the life of me I can't remember the idiom to find the first True right now.   would do it, but I'm not sure that's much better.)
