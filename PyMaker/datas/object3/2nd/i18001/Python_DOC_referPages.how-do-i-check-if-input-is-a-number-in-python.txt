Natural Text
I have a Python script which converts a decimal number into a binary one and this obviously uses their input.I would like to have the script validate that the input is a number and not anything else which will stop the script.I have tried an if/else statement but I don't really know how to go about it. I have tried  and  but they just throw up errors when I enter a string.Without the if/else statement, the code works just fine and does its job.

You can only call  (the correct name) on a string:The alternative is to use exception handling; if a  is thrown, the input was not a number:Instead of using the  function and removing the starting , you could also use the  function, using the  format, to format an integer as a binary string, without the leading text:The  function makes it easy to add leading zeros:
