I've created a function named  that tests a number to see whether or not a number is perfect or not. Now my goal is to create a tester function that tests all numbers from 1 to 1000 and return numbers that are perfect. This is the code i have for the test function:It's not working, but i think i'm close. Any advice or help?
I think you meant this, and notice the correct parameters for , and how we use a list to accumulate all the results - otherwise, the function will return only one value!Alternatively, and not recommended (it's redundant), you could test if the returned value was :Yet another alternative would be to use list comprehensions, which is more idiomatic and potentially faster than using an explicit loop:
When you , that's the end of your function. If you want to return all of the perfect numbers, you have to keep track of them and return them all at the end.On top of that, your  means you'll return  whether it's perfect or not.So, what you need to do is:There actually is a way to solve this without building the list, by using  instead of . That's probably too advanced for you to learn right now, but I'll explain it anyway. First, here's the code:See the tutorial section on Iterators, and the following two sections, for details. But basically, a  is like a  that doesn't return. What your function actually returns is not a list, but a generator. If someone then iterates over that generator, it will go through your function until the first , then go through until the next , and so on until you're done. The tutorial explains this much better than a single paragraph ever could.
