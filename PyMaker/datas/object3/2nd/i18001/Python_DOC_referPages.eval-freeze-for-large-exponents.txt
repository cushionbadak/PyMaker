I've been making a genetic program and I've come across a problem. It seems that it will try to calculate large exponents but freeze (which is understandable, because it is a large number) in the process. Is there any way to time the execution? This way I could stop calculating before it freezes for several minutes. Thank you for your help!
Generally, you don't really want to do what you're asking. (In fact, there's more than one red flag there.) But if you do:The only way you can let something run, while also timing is, is to put it in a separate thread or process.If you want to be able to forcibly interrupt that something, it has to be a process.So, for example:If you want to return a value from the function, or share values from the main process, or anything else more fancy than just "run and finish or don't", read the introductory parts of the  docs and skim the rest. (In fact, do that anyway.)
