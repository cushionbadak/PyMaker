Natural Text
I don't know how to ask this so I'm going to explain what I'm doing instead. I'm trying to search a list of lists with only 2 values. The first value I don't care about the second how ever I need to check and if it exsists I need the first value. Exampleso basically I need to know if there is a character like % or ! that when used in find basically means any value. Link find(!,'text2') would get me the value of 1. (i know that wouldn't work like that). Ik I have the option of searching just the second value in lists but that's unecessary code if there is a special character as such. 
You can do this with a list comprehension:
There is no specific character or value for that, but you can either create your own sentinel object or you can use  for this. Just make sure to use  to detect it within your code....
Try  value.You can read more information about it here: Python 3 Constrants
When you say "the second how ever I need to check and if it exists I need the first value", I'm thinking you need to check if the second value is a) there (if the list has two elements) and b) of nonzero length (assuming they'll always be strings). This leads me to:
