I have a list: This list gets updated throughout the program. Every time it gets updated, I want to check to see if it contains only numbers or only strings, or both. What can I use to do that?I need to check all the elements in the list. Any suggestion? ****With Explanation on how the code works please. Thank you all for your help.I appreciate your help. 
How about using  and : returns the type of an object: apply  to the :NOTE (@lvc's comment)This will break if you happen to have subclases of  or  in the  list. This is probably unlikely with those classes specifically, but  it means it doesn't generalise very well.
Use a combination of  and :
The isinstance function tells if a element x is a instance of a class. So, isinstance(2, int) evaluates to true.Using map we can apply isinstance to every member of the list, generating a list with the results. So:evaluates to:If you just want to know if there is a string on the list, you can do something like that:
I think  is more suitable. 
Just for the sake of another alternative:
You can use :The  statement is equivalent to:So pretty much, the code is equivalent to:
And another alternative, should be quicker than scanning the whole list:Or even better:
