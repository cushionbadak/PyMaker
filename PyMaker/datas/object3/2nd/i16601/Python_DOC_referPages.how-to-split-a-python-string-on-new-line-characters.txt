In python3 in Win7 I read a web page into a string.I then want to split the string into a list at newline characters.I can't enter the newline into my code as the argument in split(), because I get a syntax error 'EOL while scanning string literal'If I type in the characters \ and n, I get a Unicode error.Is there any way to do it?
‚ú® Splitting line in Python:Have you tried using  method?:Python  documentation here.Python  documentation here.From the docs:Return a list of the lines in the string, breaking at line boundaries.  Line breaks are not included in the resulting list unless  is  given and true.For example:ü§î Which delimiters are considered?This method uses the universal newlines approach to splitting lines.The main difference between Python  and Python  is that the former uses the universal newlines approach to splitting lines, so , , and  are considered line boundaries for 8-bit strings, while the latter uses a superset of it that also includes: or : Line Tabulation (added in Python ). or : Form Feed (added in Python ).: File Separator.: Group Separator.: Record Separator.: Next Line (C1 Control Code).: Line Separator.: Paragraph Separator.ü•ä splitlines VS split:Unlike  when a delimiter string sep is given, this method  returns an empty list for the empty string, and a terminal line break  does not result in an extra line:While  returns:‚úÇÔ∏è Removing additional whitespace:If you also need to remove additional leading or trailing whitespace, like spaces, that are ignored by , you could use  together with :üóëÔ∏è Removing empty strings (''):Lastly, if you want to filter out the empty strings from the resulting list, you could use :üìú Additional comment regarding the original question:As the error you posted indicates and Burhan suggested, the problem is from the print. There's a related question about that could be useful to you: UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode - character maps to <undefined>, print function
