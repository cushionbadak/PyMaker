I recently had a question in a Python exam where we were asked to check for numbers to be ending in 8 and I came across two ways and I was wondering which one was the most efficient or if there was an even better way to do so.(If n is the desired number)So, method 1:Method 2:
You could easily test this yourself with Python's built-in  function:As you can see from the results above, the first solution is very efficient and outperforms the second by almost four times.
For more fun and excitement in addition to iCodez answer, you can use the  module to see what the difference in instructions is:If I were to make a guess, I'd say the major time difference has to do with the string conversion. And a quick test:Shows this to be the case.Additionally in your code, the second example would always equate to , since a string will never  a number.
