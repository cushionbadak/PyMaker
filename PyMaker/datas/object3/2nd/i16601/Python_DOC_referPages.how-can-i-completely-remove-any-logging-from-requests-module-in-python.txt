How can I completely remove any logging from requests module in Python? I don't need to set even CRITICAL level. Smth like thisbut without any messages, even CRITICAL.
First of all,  doesn't log anything; only the  library that  depends on does. That library only logs messages at  and  levels, so setting the log level to  disables all messages already:You could also just disable propagation:That's enough to completely disable all logging that the  library does.The  project has installed a  handler object on the project root logger, which ensures that the  handler is not used for unhandled messages, even when propagation has been disabled.That said, if you don't trust that future versions of  won't use  as a log level, and at the same time neglect to set a , then by all means add your own  on the project root logger object, and then disable propagation there:Now all logging within the  hierarchy will be directed to the  instance, and with  set to  logging stops there. You can use this to silence any logger in the hierarchy.In my opinion, that's overkill, no  release made so far uses logging, and the project is staffed with capable developers that are unlikely to misconfigure the logging setup if they ever did add logging.
