Maybe it's not possible (I'm more used to Ruby, where this sort of thing is fine). I'm writing a library that provides additional functionality to docker-py, which provides the  package, so you just  and then you get access to  etc.Because it seemed a logical naming scheme, I wanted users to pull in my project with , so I've created a directory called  with an , and  inside it.When I try to access , Python can't see it, as if my  package has hidden it:Is this possible, or do all top-level package names have to differ between source trees?
This would only be possible if  was set up as a namespace package (which it isn't).See , , etc. for an example of a namespace package ( is the namespace package here). Because  is declared as a namespace package in , it means that  doesn't refer to a particular module or directory on the file system, but is a namespace shared by several packages. This also means that the result of  is pretty much undefined - it will simply import the top-level module of the first  package found in the import path.Therefore, when dealing with namespace packages, you need to explicitely import a specific one with  or .Unfortunately, namespace packages aren't that well documented.
