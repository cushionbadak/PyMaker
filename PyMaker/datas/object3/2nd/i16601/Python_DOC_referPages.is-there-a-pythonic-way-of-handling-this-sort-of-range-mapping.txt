Can this be made more Pythonic please?
You can write it using  and  functions:Example:
In my opinion, what you have is perfectly Pythonic.Because you are using less-than and greater-than comparisons, we can't really improve this by using a dictionary or any other trick I can think of.I guess you could factor this out into a function and just call the function:For an actual program, I suggest you should make a class that manages the joystick, and init the class with the bounds values you want to use with any particular joystick.Maybe something like this:Then in your actual program, you just use  to read the joystick and clean up the input data.  If you need to change how it works, you have one place (the class).  Just make sure to have a different class instance for each actual joystick so you can clean up different joysticks if you have different ones.
Perhaps you find this more pythonic:your code is a very simplified version of the roulette wheel algorithm. I'm not sure you should really do a full scale version of it though.UpdateA significantly shorter and prettier version that uses a lower bound algorithm:
