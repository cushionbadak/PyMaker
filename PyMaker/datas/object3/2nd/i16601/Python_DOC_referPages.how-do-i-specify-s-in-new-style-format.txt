Natural Text
I would like to translate the following codewhich would print  with 7 trailing spaces (field width == 10, left justified), into a Python 3  call, but not having much luck googling.. Is it possible?
or with implicit indices:See https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#format-string-syntax
This should work.    
How about this:Which will produce (spaces replaced by underscores):'foo_______'For more information check out the section Format specification mini-language of the python documentation.
