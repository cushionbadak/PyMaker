I am participating in a CodeForces competition tomorrow, and the rules say that Python is compiled with the following line (where %1 is the filename): I tried to compile a test file with this line, but it does not do anything at all:However, the program works when I compile with How can I make this test file work with the compilation line above?EDIT: I am using terminal on a mac.
You can see what is happening if you try it in the interactive interpreter:The compile built-in compiles the source lines into a code object.  To actually run the code object, you need to exec it:Note that there are some differences here between Python 2 and Python 3, primarily that  is a statement in Py2 but a built-in function in Py3.  The above should work in either.
