Python Docs: : Open a pipe to or from command. The return value is an open file object connected to the pipe, which can be read or written depending on whether mode is 'r' (default) or 'w'.I'm able to use the  method  /  (2.X) but not the  call, aren't  method and  the same ? why can't we use  for 's object ?Last but not least, how do  and  method really work ? 
Looking at the source code(Python 3.4) it seems the  method is not implemented in class, so the  call fails because it fails to find the  method on the class. And the explicit  call works because of the overridden  method.Related source code:
https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#next says about :Retrieve the next item from the iterator by calling its next() method. If default is given, it is returned if the iterator is exhausted, otherwise StopIteration is raised.The error message:indicates that it's not an iterator. Most probably the  method is missing.It's strange that you're getting an error, because this works for me in Python 2.x:
