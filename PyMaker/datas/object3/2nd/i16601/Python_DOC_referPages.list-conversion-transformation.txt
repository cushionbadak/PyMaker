Any way to transform list_1 into list_2?:
This is the data.Let's start with the basics. We just try to work on one tuple. The following loop will print out every single string in the tuple.Looking at the output we can see a simple way to create a combined string. Just declare an empty string at the beginning, then add all the characters to it.The result looks good, but there is an better way to do it. Strings have a join method we can use here.You get the same result as with the loop before: .Now we have to expand our code to use all the tuples in our data. Just add another loop on the outside.To create a new list we use a pattern we used before when we built a string. We create an empty list before the loop and add the results of the  to it.Code like this calls for a list comprehension.That's all.
