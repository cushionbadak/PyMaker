I'm using pyramid 1.5.1 and python 3.2, and I just added quite a bit of code and a couple libraries to my project.On running development.ini, I'm getting the error below.If I had to take a wild guess, I would say that this particular library (looks like Markupsafe?) isn't compatible with Python3...but the project page seems to indicate that it is. Problem is, I'm not calling this library directly, it's being used by another library that would be very difficult to replace.I'm new to Python programming, and I was wondering what my options are here  Or what the best way to debug is?
The  package uses syntax only supported by Python 3.3 and up. Python 3.2 is not supported anymore as of version 0.16.The  literal syntax was introduced in PEP 414 to make it easier to create library code that can support both Python 2 and 3.Either upgrade to Python 3.3 (or 3.4 even), or downgrade  to 0.15, the last version to support Python 3.2.I do see that Mako removes the  dependency when you are using Python 3.2; if nothing else depends on it is perhaps safe to remove the package altogether. The  source code certainly will fall back to a local implementation if the package is not installed.
