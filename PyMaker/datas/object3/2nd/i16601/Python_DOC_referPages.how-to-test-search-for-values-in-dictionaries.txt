I'm trying to check whether a specific value in a dictionary is present. It seems that with keys, a simple  statement works, yet not for values.So the obvious logical error is that the output only reads:Any advice would be much appreciated, thank you. 
If you want to access the dictionary's values, you need to call :It is not necessary to call  however:because the  operator iterates over the dictionary, which yields its keys.
Read the docs on . The  operator on a dictionary looks for a key in the 's keys, not its values.To look in the values, use .Also, this is a less efficient O(size of dict) operation. If you're constantly searching for values, you should generally use a different data structure (maybe a sorted list depending on the exact use case).
