Here's the directory structureI have my import code  in abcI have created empty init file in abc and greet folders.But when i run this code then error be like:I don't understand why this happens? How is abc not a module when I have created the init file and also added the scratch directory to the search path. PS:  just contains a method  which prints "hello world", if this info is of any use.
Python already has a module named abc. Choose a different name.
