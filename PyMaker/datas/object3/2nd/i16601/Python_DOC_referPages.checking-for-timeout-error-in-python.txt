So I have a pretty generic logging statement after a request:This works great for everything I've thrown at it except .  When the request times out the err I get back is a tuple that it tries and fails to serialize.My question is how do I catch just this one type of error?  For starters  is not something I have access to.  I have tried adding  but with no luck.  I've also tried importing  because the docs say  is a subclass, but I was unable to access  after importing .TimeoutError docsI plan to either list my exceptions in order:or just check for type:Python 2.7.3 & Django 1.5
