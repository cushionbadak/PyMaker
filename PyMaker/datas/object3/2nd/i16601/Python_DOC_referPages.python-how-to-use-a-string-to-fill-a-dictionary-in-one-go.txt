Natural Text
I have this for exampleI understand why it doesn't work that way but i'm new to python and have no idea what i'm doing.I'd like to be able to export my dictionary to a variable (here x) and then able to fill another dictionary with it. I don't want to use the dict.copy() command, beacause the variable x will be stored on a txt file.Any help is highly appreciated. Thanks in advance.
If you actually want to use a string to do the copying, you can say:but there's no reason you would ever need to do that. Use  instead.EDIT: Based on what you said in the comments, , as another user has already pointed out, is the best way to go. That would look like this:
If what you're looking for is to save a dict-like string representation to a file so you can load it later, use the  module.  (This is not at all the same as "exporting a dictionary to a variable", but your comment indicates that what you're really trying to do is save a dictionary to a file.)
What you can do to specifically address what you asked is:or if you want to use dictionary comprehensionBut I really would not suggest doing it this way. Instead I was suggest looking at either pickle or json to save the dictionary to file.
