In the Python tutorial book I'm using, I typed an example given for simultaneous assignment. I get the aforementioned ValueError when I run the program, and can't figure out why.Here's the code:Here's the output.
Judging by the prompt message, you forgot to call  at the end of the 8th line:Doing so splits the input on the comma.  See a demonstration below:
The above code will work fine on Python 2.x. Because  behaves as  followed by a  on Python 2.x as documented here - https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#inputHowever, above code throws the error you mentioned on Python 3.x. On Python 3.x you can use the  module's  method on the user input. This is what I mean:
This is because behavior of input changed in python3In python2.7 input returns value and your program work fine in this versionBut in python3 input returns stringtry this and it will work fine!
that means your function return more value!ex:in python2 the function  return --> but in python3 so when you use those function,  is well by python2, but in python3 function return 3 value to 2 variable.SO  ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2)
