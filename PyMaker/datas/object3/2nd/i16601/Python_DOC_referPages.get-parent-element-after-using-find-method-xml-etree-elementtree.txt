Natural Text
I am working with a huge xml-file and try to extract information from different elements.To find the elements I use the find method:From this I extract information and in addition I need information from the parent element. But  returns only  as documented here:https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.htmlNow I use the folowing:This looks a bit unnatural to me, but works. Do you know a better way to do this?Do you know why only  is returned?
The  API only supports a limited version of XPath. The  docs for the  XPath expression state:Selects the parent element. Returns None if the path attempts to  reach the ancestors of the start element (the element find was called  on).Directly getting the parent element is not supported in the  API. I would therefore recommend to use , where you can simply use  to get the parent element: also has a full XPath 1.0 implementation, so  would work as well.
I had a similar problem and I got a bit creative. Turns out nothing prevents us from adding the parentage info ourselves. We can later strip it once we no longer need it.
