I am using Python 3.4 with PyCharm IDE. Some of the external libraries have been released for this version of Python. But most might not be presented yet, just like matplotlib.I have you use this library. How can I use matlibplot for Python 3.3 in Python 3.4? Must I migrate again to python 3.3?!Thank you
If the library is pure Python then any code that runs in Python 3.3 should also run in Python 3.4.If the library contains Python byte code (pyc) then there is no guarantee of compatibility. You have to recompile the Python code.if the library contains c code (pyd) then you have no guarantee of Python C API compatibility unless the library made some specific switches for it. You would have to recompile the C code.Matplotlib falls into the latter categories. However there are version of matplotlib compiled against Python 3.4 (for Windows). Or you have to go back to Python 3.3.
