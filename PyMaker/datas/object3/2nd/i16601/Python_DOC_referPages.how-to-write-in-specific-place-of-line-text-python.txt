That's because you're trying to write to a string. Instead of , try , or even better, just . I suspect you'll find that it's just a string.Since it is just a string, it doesn't have any link back to its location in the file. Instead, you should read the entire file into memory, make your changes, then overwrite the file. This isn't a Python limitation either, it has to do with how the OS handles file changes.You might be able to overwrite specific areas of a file by using  and , but I would do so with extreme caution since it's seeking by bytes, not lines.
