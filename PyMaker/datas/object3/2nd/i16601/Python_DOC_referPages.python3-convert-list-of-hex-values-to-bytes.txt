This question already has an answer here:How to create python bytes object from long hex string?                    5 answers                I have a list of bytes that are represented in string format, for example, when I print the list in Python3.3 I get the following output:I would like to convert these into bytes, for example 0xFF,0xFF,0xFF,0xFF. I have tried the bytearray() function but this returns an error.I'm guessing that I am missing something simple here, but I have looked around SO and Google and have so far had no luckThanks!
Use  on the joined 'bytes':Demo:Note that this is way faster than using manual conversion to integers:That's a 7x speed difference.
Since  function accepts an iterable, you can pass there a generatorThat's slower than Martijn's approach, but shorter. Update:Alternatively, you can use  methodIt appears to be faster than Martijn's solution
