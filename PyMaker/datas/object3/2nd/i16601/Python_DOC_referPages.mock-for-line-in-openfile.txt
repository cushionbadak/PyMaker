I am wanting to unittest a component of my application. The code looks a little like below.The problem I am having is that I cannot mock the  functionality within a  loop.What I am aiming for is a  like this: (I know this code is not right but its just an example of what I am trying to do):
You can mock  to return StringIO object.mymodule.py:Note that I've used with statement there.test_mymodule.py:Works for python3.4.At first I tried to use  but iteration support seems to be broken.
