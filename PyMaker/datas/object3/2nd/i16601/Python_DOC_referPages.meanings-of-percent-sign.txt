This question already has an answer here:What does % do to strings in Python? [closed]                    4 answers                Can you explain what this python code means.  The output for the print isThe '3' and '5' are values of '(v.varName, v.x)' I don't get how it knows to print 'x' and 'y' and what other uses are there for '%' other than finding the remainder.
The command Assigns the list of all Var objects in model m to variable v.You can then query various attributes of the individual variables in the list. For example, to obtain the variable name and solution value for the first variable in list v, you would issue the following commandYou can type help(v) to get a list of all methods on a Var objectAs others mentioned % is just place holdersTo understand how your code works, inspect the model m
It is a way to simplify strings when contain many variables. In python, as you see, you made a string in your print statement which reflects the variables v.varName and v.x. When a percent sign is used in a string, it will be matched, in order, with the parameters you give it.There are specific letters used for each TYPE of variable. In your case you used "s" and "g" representing a string and a number. Of course numbers are turned into strings if you are creating a string (like in this case).Example:The result will be:Notice that the order in the variables section is what gives the correct ordering.
