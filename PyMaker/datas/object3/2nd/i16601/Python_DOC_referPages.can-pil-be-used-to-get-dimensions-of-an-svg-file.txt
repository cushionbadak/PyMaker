Natural Text
I have svg files which I would like to compare based on their dimensions. I read about PIL as the best image tool in python. Does PIL handle svg files? I can't seem to find this anywhere.When googling I saw people interpreting svg files as text which seems counterintuitive. What if not PIL is be the best way to get the x & y dimensions of a .svg file? Thanks
PIL handles many image types, but not (yet?) SVG.  Partly, this is because SVG is a set of instructions to produce an image, not a container for raw image data.Fortunately, SVG can be read as XML, using the tool of your choice; for example, xml.etree.ElementTree in the Python standard library.Unfortunately, by its nature, SVG doesn't have a single native size.  Instead, it has two size concepts: the view box, and the height and width attributes.If your svg file has  and  attributes, you can safely use those as the  and  dimensions, respectively.  Otherwise, if it has a  attribute, it is meant to scale to any size you need it to; however, you can use its third and fourth numbers as width and height, if you need to.Worse, SVG files could lack either one.  In that case, one could potentially compute a height and width based on the elements in the file, but that's trickier than anyone really wants to do, given the full capabilities of the format.
