I saw this in a code, and the answer is how does  evaluate? Does it have any special meaning there? 
 calls  on the value before interpolating.For integers, the , default  and  output doesn't differ. For other types, such as strings, the difference is more visible:Note that quotes were included.See the Format String Syntax; the character after  specifies the conversion applied to the value. The default is no conversion, but you can use either  or  to convert a value to its  representation or  string output, respectively.You'd usually use conversion when either dealing with a type that doesn't specify an explicit  method (such as ), when explicitly formatting to the  output (very helpful for debug output), or when you have to handle a mix of types.
