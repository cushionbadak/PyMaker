That's because special methods are looked up on the type; for instances the type is the class.For classes then, the type is.. :so  is used:and  works fine on instances:For instances attributes are looked up first on the class (in the case of data descriptors), then on the instance, then if the instance doesn't have the attribute, the class hierarchy is searched in MRO order.
