I want to search a file in a tree.I know the filename and the root of the tree, but I want to find the file path. I use python-3.4 on windows 7.I have:I also have a tree ( something/ is a folder):etc it's an example but it's really close of my real case.I want:I precise that it should be generic, so I can't make hard link or hard path etc.For the moment I've try some tricky scripts with some os.listdir etc but it seems messy and don't always work.Do you guys have some way to do this ?Keep in mind that I don't want to add any lib or plugin to my python.Thank you,Regards,
Question resolved in comments.I'll use os.walk / glob.Thank to @kevin @Lafexlos
