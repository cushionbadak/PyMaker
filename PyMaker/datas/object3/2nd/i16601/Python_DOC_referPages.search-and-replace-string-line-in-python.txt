Natural Text
I have a strange case for search and replace a string in text file using python. Input Data: I have a text file which looks similar as shown below.I have 2 problems to be addressedSearch and replace  with . The desired output is: In the above lines I want to increment the values by some value like  or . The desired output is:The "" above indicates there will many lines in that section. In simple words my issues can be summarized as belowFirstly search for all the lines which contains , , etc. and replace all the values in the last entry to .Secondly increment the values by given increment like  or  in the last columns of lines with , , etc.Note:I have tried file open and replace option but that did not solve my problemI have not tried regular expression because of lack of knowledge in regular expression.The text file might contain about 5000-6000 lines, the lines , , etc. lines will be about 100-150 lines.
Python provides a module, fileinput, which is particularly convenient for this task:I don't think you need to replace all the s with  before replacing the s with a number incrementing by 0.2. Instead, just find the lines that begin with , and replace the last number with the desired number.
u can acheive this in following steps:open a new file to write the datasearch for the word 'QBFLUX' in linenow replace the 1.0 with the 0.0(val)increment the val by 0.2
