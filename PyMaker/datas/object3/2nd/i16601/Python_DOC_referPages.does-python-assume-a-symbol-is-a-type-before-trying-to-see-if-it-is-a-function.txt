In Python the symbol  is used both as a type and a built-in function.  But when I use  in the REPL, or ask for its type, the REPL tells me it is a type.This is fine, but  is also a built-in function: it is listed in the table of built-in functions right in the Python documentation.Other built-in functions are reported like this in the REPL:But I can't get  to show me this for . Now clearly I can use  as a function if I want to (sorry for using  instead of a comprehension, I'm just trying to make a point):So Python knows to use the function.  But why does  pick the type over the function?  Nothing in the definition of the  function says to expect this.  And then as a follow-up, what is the meaning of this expression:Is this giving me the  of the type or the function.  I expect the former.  Now if it is the former, how would I get the id of the built-in function ?
There is only one thing called  and only one thing called .The difference is that  is a class, and  is a function. Both, however, are callable. When you call , that calls the  class's constructor, returning an instance of class .It's not really much different to:Here,  is callable, and can be used to construct instances of the class.Once you realise this, the rest will follow.
