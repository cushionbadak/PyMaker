I am trying to merge a range of genomic coordinates into continuous ranges, with an additional option for merging across gaps.For example, if I had the genomic ranges  I would want the result to be . If the offset option was set to , and the input was  I would once again want the result to be .I have implemented a way of doing this that steps through the alignments sequentially and tries to merge on the previous ending position and next starting position, but it fails because the actual results have varying lengths. For example I have the results  in my list sorted by the start positions. The answer to that should be  but I instead get . Obviously I need to take more into account than just the previous ending and the next start, but I haven't found a good solution (preferably one that isn't a huge nest of if statements). Anyone have any suggestions?
Well, how about keeping track of every start and end and the number of ranges where each position belongs to?This would be easier to draw than to explain. (And yes, the cumulative sum could be written in a shorter space, but i find it clearer this way.)To explain this graphically, lets take input ([5,10],[8,15],[12,13],[16,20]) and overlap=1.
Python comes batteries included:Result:How it works: we label every start and end point as such, then we sort and afterwards we simply count up for every start point and down for every end point. If we have visited the same number of start and end points, we have a closed (joined) range.
