OUTPUTI'm assuming the empty list items ('') are the hyphens. My question is, why between a and b are there only two '' and not three like in the input? 
let's replace the empty fields by some string:now you see clearly where the fields are located.You can see that there are only 2 fields between  and . Special case is at the start of the string, where the empty string at the start is also seen as a field.
 uses its argument as a delimiter, and so won't include it in the list it returns.The same goes when using , unless you put the pattern in parentheses.  So if you really want to keep the  when splitting a string, I suggest you do something like this:This will print out:If you're wondering why there are a lot of empty strings in this output, it's because  will keep whatever is between the  characters, even if they are strings of zero length.A shorter example might help to understand what's going on:This will print out:If you don't want the  characters, then remove the parentheses from .  That is, change  to , or just use:
This is default split() function operation.So basically if you separate between to other characters, you always get x-Splitting an empty string with a specified separator returns [''].https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html
