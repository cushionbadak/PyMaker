I am trying to raise error messages using the the following line of code:The value is basically user input obtained from a JSON API, so I am trying to consider all possibilities. Can the method above itself cause an exception in my system if the value given cannot be turned into a string using the  method? If yes, then what are such values that would create the exception?
The  method will always produce an output, it just might not be meaningful. As noted in the docs here it's calling either  or  depending on what is defined. For all of the basic types like int, float, bool, etc you'll get a nice output. For a custom class though you'll probably get some garbage like:Now if you define a  method you'll get something nice like so
Short answer: you don't have to worry about it. The string is generated by the  or  functions, and one or both of these will automatically be created on all new objects and primitives.But technically there are a few scenarios where developers can do dumb stuff.Scenario A) The  function does not return a string:This results in the errorScenario B) The  function has the wrong amount of arguments:This results in the errorObviously in all three of these scenarios the fault lies with whatever developer was creating the bad  functions. I think we can all agree that these are not cases your code should have to handle.
