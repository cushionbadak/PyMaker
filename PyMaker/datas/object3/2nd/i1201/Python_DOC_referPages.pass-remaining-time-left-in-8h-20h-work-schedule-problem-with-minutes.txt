 is the hour in which a worker starts doing his job.  is the amount of time the job will take. A worker can only work between 08:00 and 20h00.If a worker starts a job at  and the job takes  to finish, the output  will be, as desired, . However, if the job takes  to be done, python won't be able to give me an output because of the minutes. In the way I did, I transform those 20 minutes into hours. But 20/60 will give me 0,(333)..... and so on. I've tried to round the value before the  condititon. But when I do that, inside the , at ,I checked that Python keeps getting a huge value in debugging.
