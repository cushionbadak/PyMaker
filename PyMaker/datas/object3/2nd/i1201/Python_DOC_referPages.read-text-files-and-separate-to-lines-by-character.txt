Natural Text
I have text file with this example content:How do I make a code that reads all the text and divide it to rows (when you see 12 break the line) and save it.
Are you sure you want a  before every ?I see that it comes from a date, but if you look at:there is a  in the text where you might not want a new line.The solution might be robust if you break before a date:
If the preferred output is a list of rows, try split()And for joining these rows, use join()
You can just use the string replace() method to do this:You can be more specific; maybe you're worried some of the messages contain '12' outside the date:If you need to be even more robust, you need to learn to use regular expressions (that could get a bit complicated; have a look).You can split this into an array of lines:You can loop through each line like this:Or you can just save it back to a text file:
It is so simple :DIf you want result to be list,or if you want result to be string divided by line,Python has many good methods üòÅüòÅ
