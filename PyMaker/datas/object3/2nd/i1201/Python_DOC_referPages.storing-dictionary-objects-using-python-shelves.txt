I am trying to implement a Doctor's weekly scheduling appointment  system.  I would like to know how can i use shelve to store my dictionary objects. It would be great if someone can review my code and suggest how I can improve it further.How can i store timeslot dictionary into shelves? (I have appended Monday,Tue,wed,thursday and  Friday objects into timeslot dictionary and now im unsure of how can I store these objects in dictionary into shelves.)  Disclaimer I am a beginner for python and shelves. Thanks for helping!
I fixed your code as it does not run :You tried to use private attributes using double underscores inside default_timeslots class and this is bad practice. + You are trying to access them outside the class. I removes the underscores.I have no idea why you use class attribute and methods that look like class methods. I let you read this to understand why the class attributes won't be saved in your shelve. That's why I replaced your class attributes by instance attributes.Similarly, when class instances are pickled, their classâ€™s code and  data are not pickled along with them. Only the instance data are  pickled. This is done on purpose, so you can fix bugs in a class or  add methods to the class and still load objects that were created with  an earlier version of the classTo create shelve : To read from shelve :Of course you need to import the Store class when you try to read from shelve (if that is not inside the same script).will return : 
You should get away from SHELVES, and other text based data storage.  Instead use SQLITE3 and convert your dictionary into a json format and save it inside the database.  Why SQLITE3?  It is better supported, it is an actual database, and can be brought over to other systems.  It handles errors better and isn't as easily corrupted. It won't be deprecated either.  If you want actual indexed JSON storage, postgres is another option that is perfect for this situation.
