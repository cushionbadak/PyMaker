I am trying to write a Fernet Key generated by using the python cryptography module(https://cryptography.io/en/latest/) into a .txt file. This .txt file is then read to retrieve the Key.However when I run this code it yields a  string instead of the key.Example: A Fernet Key : Is written as:I would like the .txt file to contain the key: I have done some research in to this matter and I know that the  denotes a bytes string, but I still do not know why it is represented as a list of byte numbers instead of  I know saving the Key to a .txt file may not be the most secure method of doing this, so any other methods are welcome.
That happens because it is the intended behaviour. From Python csv official docs Writer ObjectsWriter objects (DictWriter instances and objects returned by the  writer() function) have the following public methods. A row must be an  iterable of strings or numbers for Writer objects and a dictionary  mapping fieldnames to strings or numbers (by passing them through  str() first) for DictWriter objects.Try using a DictWriter (and DictReader)
