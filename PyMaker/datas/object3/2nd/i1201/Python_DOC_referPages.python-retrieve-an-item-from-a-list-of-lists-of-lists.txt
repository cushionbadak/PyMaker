I have a list of lists of lists, and I want to know the right way to retrieve a particular item from a bottom-level list.For example, say I want to print 100:The first example works, but the second does not.  How does Python handle indexing for "higher-dimensional" nested lists?
Actually, neither of these should work. In Python, lists are indexed starting at 0. That means to print 100 in tree1 and tree2, you would need to run:
Python indexing starts at 0, so example:So your code could be:
A way to "see" index of a list is to iterate over it enumerating items, enumerate returns the element and the index.So for example:Where you can see that index starts at 0.When you call , you get To dig deeper in the list, you can iterate over nested elements, for example (I change the name of the variables):Returns:So, calling for example , returns The same with , where you can dig down one level more.
