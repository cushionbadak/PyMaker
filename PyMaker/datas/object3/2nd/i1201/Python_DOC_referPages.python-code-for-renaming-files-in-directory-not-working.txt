I'm looking to rename my files from time to time in numerical order, so for example, 1.png, 2.png., 3.png, etcI wrote this code in an attempt to do so, I simply ended it with by printing what the files would be named to make sure it was right:How would I go by solving this? 
You keep on getting  suggested as the new name because you always set  inside the loop. Initialize it with  before the loop, and then increment it as you are renaming each file instead.A few additional points:You don't need  because even if the default is  – the current dir –, you can also supply the target path to .When dealing with  home directories, it's nice if you don't have to hardcode it.  retrieves this value for you.When iterating over lists that you possibly want to change, it's best to make a separate list of only the items that you want to change. So, rather than looping over all files and changing some of them, make it easier by first gathering all items that you want to change. In your case, make a list of only  files and then loop over this list.(Rather advanced)  will throw an error if you try to rename to an already existing name. What I do below is check if the next name to be used is already in the list, and if it is, increase the  number.
I'm not sure why you need to use  to change directories, when you can just pass the path straight to . To rename files, you can use . You also need to increment the counter for the file names, since your current code you keep  equal to  on each iteration. You need to keep the counter outside the loop and increment it within the loop. This is where you can use, since you can use indexing instead. Basic version:You can get the full paths using , since  doesn't include the full path of the file. The above code is also not very robust as it renames all files, and doesn't handle renaming already existent  files.Advanced version:Which uses  to check if the file already exists.
use os.rename
