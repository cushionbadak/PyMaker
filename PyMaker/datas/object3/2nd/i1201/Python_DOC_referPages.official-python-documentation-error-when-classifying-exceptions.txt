The official Python documentation statesThere are (at least) two distinguishable kinds of errors: syntax errors and exceptions.But when looking at the Exception Hierarchy I see that syntax errors mean  the  exception is  raised, So there is nothing "special" about it, it is a regular exception like all the other ones, e.g. ,  or .So is the official documentation wrong?
