I have a string in the following format.How can I convert it into a list of tuples (of type int) in the following format?I think it could be done using regular expressions but I'm having trouble with the expression itself.Thanks
Sure, it could be done with regular expressions. But I find it often much easier to just use string methods and list comprehensions to accomplish such things.
No, this couldn't be done with regexes, because those will just output strings. You need to split by comma, then split each element again by space:
You can try using  and then list comprehension:Edit: Added parsing to 
You could add parentheses:We can then use  to convert the string to a list of tuples of integers:This is a safe way of evaluating a string (not like ). From the  documentation:Safely evaluate an expression node or a string containing a Python literal or container display. The string or node provided may only consist of the following Python literal structures: strings, bytes, numbers, tuples, lists, dicts, sets, booleans, and None.This can be used for safely evaluating strings containing Python values from untrusted sources without the need to parse the values oneself. It is not capable of evaluating arbitrarily complex expressions, for example involving operators or indexing.
