I have a list of instances (of  class) named . I'm strugling to find min value of attribute  greater than 0.This is how my class looks: I tried something like:it gives an error : TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'Process' and 'Process'Do I have to write a function somehow or is there a way to do it using ?
