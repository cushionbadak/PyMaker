I have a dataframe with two columns containing lists. I want to combine these columns into a single column and merge the lists into a single list. Also this list should only contain unique values from the original lists.I've tried merging them using .However this creates a single column with values comprising two lists.The dataframe looks something like this:The final dataframe should look like this:Edit: The values within the lists of the dataframe are strings.

You can use  with  within a list comprehension. Note by your choice of lists within series you are losing all vectorisation benefits.The benefit of this method in Python v3.7+ (and unofficially in v3.6 as a CPython implementation detail) is ordering is preserved, as dictionaries are insertion-ordered.
If order does not matter, set will do the job:OutputIf order does matter use OrderedDict:Output
