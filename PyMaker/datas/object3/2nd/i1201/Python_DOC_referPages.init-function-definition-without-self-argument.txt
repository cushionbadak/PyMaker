In digging through the python  class in , I found something I thought was peculiar: They don't explicitly use the  argument in the  function's arguments. See code below (copied directly without the docstring):Later in this same class, the  and  methods are also defined this same way.Before you point me to questions about how  works in classes, I will note that I don't believe this is a duplicate question. I understand how  works typically and that  is not a keyword (just standard practice) etc. I also understand that this code works (I'm not questioning the validity of the  unpack/explode/starred-expressions syntax)My question is more related to why...Why would one implement the  and other normal (non-/ methods) of a class like this and in what circumstances should I consider using this in the future?Why are only specific methods on the same class implemented like this?Under what circumstance would these methods be called without any args (if any), triggering the first TypeError?In what circumstances would these methods be called with  filled in manually (e.g. )? Or other examples? I have to think that it has something to do with the TypeError("descriptor..."). 
This code is intended to make  positional-only. Otherwise, a call likewould fail due to  receiving two values of .Most classes don't need anything like this special handling, but  is supposed to handle keyword arguments like  does, where they become keys of the resulting mapping, even if the key is . The other  methods that have this handling are the ones that need the same keyword argument behavior.If you need to treat  as a valid keyword argument in your own code, you should probably do something similar.As for the , that's there to match the error message from :The most likely way for this to come up in practice is probably people subclassing  and forgetting to pass  to  (or use ).
