when the code runs con(), when ever I try to enter no, it always says invalid website. Please enter another one. How do I fix it to exit the program? everything else works it is just this one part.
The  function works by raising an  exception. Your code has a bare  block which is catching that exception and suppressing its normal purpose (that is, to exit quietly).The best fix for this issue is to make your  clause more specific to the kinds of exceptions you expect to catch. It is almost always a bad idea to catch everything (the only exception to that is when you're catching all exceptions, but logging and re-raising most of them).Since your specific code is trying to deal with exceptions from , catching  is probably your best bet.
