Python beginner here! My goal is to achieve an array or a set of strings of this shape:I created the following loops to create the parts of the strings like this:Now I'm asking myself how to concatenate all those parts together, so that the described set of strings can be printed out. I tried to create an array, append the values, create a numpy array, transpose it and stacked the three array parts, but this didn't work out as I got the wrong array:Is there an elegant way to do this?
