Why doesn't pip make logs of which version of which lib was installed when? If you update a library to a broken version then what? How do you know which version is not broken?
When you run the pip, you can specify the logfile. This way you can track the installation logs in future.Or you can set it in your pip.conf to be enabled by default:Hope this helps.However this is not exactly what you asked. This is just to help achieve that.For windows:Quoting from https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#config-file
