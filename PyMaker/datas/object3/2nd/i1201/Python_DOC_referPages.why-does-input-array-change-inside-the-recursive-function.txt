I am trying to understand quick search algorithm in pyhton. Here is the code I am working on:Then I am calling this function defining a variable. For example:MY question is that when I try to print b after the function call, it prints as [1,4,5]. So, how come the value of this array is changing within the function??? It is not a global variable. Whey the local variables inside the function overrides it?? Please help

What you are looking to do is provide only the items of the array  to This can be done by making the following adjustment:Notice  instead of . Now, when you print  after calling the function you will have the same values as you did before.You can find more information about this here
