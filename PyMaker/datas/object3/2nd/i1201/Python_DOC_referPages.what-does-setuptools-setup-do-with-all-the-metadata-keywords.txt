Getting to a point with my project that I want to distribute it, so I am reading the docs to better familiarize myself with all the information. Eventually I found myself looking at  and all the keywords associated with it and it got me wondering:What are the keywords used for, where do they go and why do we need them?After running  on some temporary scaffolding project, I noticed that a  appeared with some of this metadata in it. But thats the only place I could find them after running the command. There is the  command (or I could use ) to get the source distribution onto PyPI, so I suppose maybe its a convention used to pass information that is then parsed and loaded onto the PyPI web page for the distribution?
so I suppose maybe its a convention used to pass information that is then parsed and loaded onto the PyPI web page for the distribution?You're precisely right. Most of these keywords represent various core metadata fields that define all Python package distributions.These path of this data is roughly this:You specify the keywords to the  function;This is written to the  file when building a distribution;When uploading,  reads from  to determine all the metadata about your distribution; uploads this metadata along with your ,  or  filePyPI stores this metadata in it's database for your project.
