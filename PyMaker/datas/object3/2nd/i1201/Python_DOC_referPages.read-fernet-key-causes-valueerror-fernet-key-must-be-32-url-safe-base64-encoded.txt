In this function I am trying to read a Fernet key from a file, or create one if the file doesn't contain a key.I am having difficulty reading the file. When the file is read the key is read in as:Yet I receive this error:In this line:Any help would be appreciated.
The problem here is how the key is being written to the file. returns a  instance:The key is being written to the file as is:If we look in the file, we can see the contents aren't what we expect - the  that indicates a python bytestring has been written to the file: calls  on any values that aren't already strings.  If  is called on a  instance you get the stringified repr of the bytes instances rather than the decoded value of the  instance, which is what you want.So the solution is to call the  instance's  method before  receives it.This gives us the file contents that we want:And the rest of the code works as expected:One debugging tip.  When using  to debug your code, it's sometimes better to print an object's repr, rather than the result of calling  on the object (which is what  does).  This is especially the case if the object is a string.  For example:
