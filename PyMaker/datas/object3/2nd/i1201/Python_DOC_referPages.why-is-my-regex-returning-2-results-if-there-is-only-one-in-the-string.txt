This question already has an answer here:strange behavior of parenthesis in python regex                    3 answers                I am trying to extract an ID from a string with python3. The regex returns more then one item, despite only having one in the text:text_total = 'Lore Ippsum Ref. 116519LN Perlmutt'I am looking for a single trimed result, if possible without beeing a list anyway.That's why my original line is:The regex has an OR as I am also trying to match Lore Ippsum Ref. 1166AB.39AZU2.123 Lore IppsumHow can I retrieve just one result from the text and match both conditions?
Your groups inside your OR group, so to speak, are "capturing groups". You need to make them non capturing using the  syntax inside those groups, and allow the outer group to stay as a capturing group. Note that this still gets you multiple matches if there are many. You can use re.search for just first match.
You don't necessarily need an or, you can do  (note the space at the end of the regex, it will be used as the ending for the match.
