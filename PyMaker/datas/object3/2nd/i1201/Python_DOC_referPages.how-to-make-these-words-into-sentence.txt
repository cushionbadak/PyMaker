I lemmatised several sentences, and it turns out the results like this,this is for the first two sentences.which all the words are generated together like a list. but i need them to be like sentence by sentence, the output format would be better like this:can anyone help me please? thanks a lot 
Basically you append the characters to a new string and separate out sentence if there is a period , but also ensure that the current sentence has a minimum number of words. This ensures sentences that like "11." are avoided. is a parameter you could tune according to your convenience. 
Try this code:Hope this helps! :)
A good starting point might be str.join():
You can try string concatenation by looping through the list
You could try this:You may need to delete the last space, just before the '.'
