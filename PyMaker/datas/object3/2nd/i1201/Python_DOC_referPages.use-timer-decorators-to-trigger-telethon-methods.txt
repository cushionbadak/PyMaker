I want to make a decorator for a project of mine that every x seconds certain telethon task will be started.I've asked in the telethon group and someone give me a small decorator but the problem here is that I need to start the loop using  and I already use it when starting the client. Here is my code:Now I already have a loop running in main:and I can't run another loop because if I do that it seems to close this one. Any ideas about how to make this work?
It looks like you desire to run multiple functions at same time. So you can use  or  to create tasks and add them into list, then run them through using  or etc.
