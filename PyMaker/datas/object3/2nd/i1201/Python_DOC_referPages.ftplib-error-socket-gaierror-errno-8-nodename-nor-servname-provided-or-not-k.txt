This question already has an answer here:Python 3 ftplib error “Name or service not known”                    1 answer                I'm trying to download a file from an FTP server using FTPlib but i keep getting the error below. I tried several methods found on SO namely editing the etc/host file and adding the computer name after the local host IP but that doesnt work either.Any help is much appreciated. (running a mac, python 3.7, macOS Mojave 10.14.2)Code im trying to run:Error:File "", line 1, in   File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/ftplib.py", line 117, in init    self.connect(host)  File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/ftplib.py", line 152, in connect    source_address=self.source_address)  File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/socket.py", line 707, in create_connection    for res in getaddrinfo(host, port, 0, SOCK_STREAM):  File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/socket.py", line 748, in getaddrinfo    for res in _socket.getaddrinfo(host, port, family, type, proto, flags):socket.gaierror: [Errno 8] nodename nor servname provided, or not known
It is not clear what  actually contains in your specific code.But given its name I assume that you've tried something like . Only, as clearly documented  does not expect a URL but instead a hostname or IP, i.e.  and not . Given a URL like you probably do will result in treating that URL as hostname, i.e. doing a lookup for the hostname . Since such a host does not exist you get an error.
