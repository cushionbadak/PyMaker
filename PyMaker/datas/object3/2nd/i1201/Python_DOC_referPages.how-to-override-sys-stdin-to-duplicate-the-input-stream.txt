Natural Text
I'm writing a Python 3.6 program on Windows to record all the input to a subprocess for backup. (I cannot modify the subprocess code as the real program is a commercial product (exe file) and I don't have the source code.) I tried the following code, and it doesn't work. The text only shows in the terminal, and the txt files used for logging are empty.Main.py:Hello.py:Expected result:In terminal:stdin.txt:stdout.txt:I've asked a more general question before (Capture inputs to subprocess.run()), but there aren't any practical answer.
 will very likely bypass this because it uses the  directly.Use .However, it is not totally straightforward how to forward everything then. Maybe the easiest way is to have 3 threads, one for each , , and , where you read from the source (e.g. , or ) and then write it to the file and to the target (, or ).See also here for some other options.
