Could someone explain me what's the difference between round() and float() in Python, please?For exampleAs I see, both functions from the code above do the same job. However, round() seems more compact and appealing to me.I'd like to know if there is something else behind these functions and if I should consider something in particular when choosing which one to use.Thank you for your help in advance!
It is not the float function that is doing the rounding here.As a general term, float and round do very different things. Float takes a valid input and attempts to typecast it into a floating point representation. Round just rounds up to  significant digits.Tl;Dr Just use round.
This formats and parses a string, which is a lot of unnecessary work:This simple rounds the float, and will be much faster:
One of the main differences is that  is a class and  is a function. Using  does not round a number:but  does:Use  to convert something to a float, and use  to round off a float.
float() is used for type conversion of data to the float-type, if applicable.On the other hand, round() is used for rounding of the given value to the specified number of decimal places.Just as a quick note, what you are doing above in the example for float() is taking a number, rounding it off to the specified number of digits (in your example, two), converting it into string, and then type casting it into float data type.For more information on float(), you may visit this page:[Built in Functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float)
