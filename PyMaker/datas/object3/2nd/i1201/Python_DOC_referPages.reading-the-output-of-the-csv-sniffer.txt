Natural Text
I have a file that uses  as the field delimiter and  for the line terminator. Here is an example of the file header:When I use  I get the following:{'module': 'csv', '_name': 'sniffed', 'lineterminator': '\r\n', 'quoting': 0, 'doc': None, 'doublequote': False, 'delimiter': '\x01', 'quotechar': '"', 'skipinitialspace': False}What do the following three fields mean: quotingquotechardoublequoteThe above doesn't have any quoting, so I'd assume the  should be empty instead of a double quote, but any explanation on these three fields would be great.Also, I've tried a few other files and it seems to always give the exact output for those three fields, regardless of whether that file has quoting or not.
Check the documentation   Dialect.doublequote Controls how instances of quotechar appearing inside a field should themselves be quoted. When True, the character is doubled. When False, the escapechar is used as a prefix to the quotechar. It defaults to True.Dialect.quotechar A one-character string used to quote fields containing special characters, such as the delimiter or quotechar, or which contain new-line characters. It defaults to '"'.Dialect.quoting Controls when quotes should be generated by the writer and recognised by the reader. It can take on any of the QUOTE_* constants (see section Module Contents) and defaults to QUOTE_MINIMAL.
Those fields are covered in the Dialects and Formatting Paramteres docs:quoting: Controls when quotes should be generated by the writer and recognised by the reader. It can take on any of the QUOTE_* constants (see section Module Contents) and defaults to QUOTE_MINIMAL.doublequote: Controls how instances of quotechar appearing inside a field should themselves be quoted. When True, the character is doubled. When False, the escapechar is used as a prefix to the quotechar. It defaults to True. On output, if doublequote is False and no escapechar is set, Error is raised if a quotechar is found in a field.quotechar: A one-character string used to quote fields containing special characters, such as the delimiter or quotechar, or which contain new-line characters. It defaults to '"'.Regarding:The above doesn't have any quoting, so I'd assume the quotechar should be empty instead of a double quote, but any explanation on these three fields would be great.There's a comment in the CPython  library stating that:Source: https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/2ef69a1d45de8aa41c45d32d9ee1ff227bb1a566/Lib/csv.py#L198In your case, if there's no quoting, you probably want to use . The sniffer probably couldn't figure that out for you.
