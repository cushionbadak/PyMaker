Natural Text
I have different python files containing Neural Networks. Each python file has associated weights.h5 file. Now I'd like to make a python evaluation file, which loads all networks / python files and their weights, creates one instance of each and compares their performance. So far I tried to import as package but then I'm unable to access the modules by an index. How could I import all of the models and put one instance of them in a list, such that I can access them by an index?An examplethis works, but I have to hard code each import. Additionally I was not able to create instances by an index or access them by an index to make comparisons between all of the them.
