I have a list of tuples:I want to multiply each odd index element of tuple by 300 thus 1st and 3rd element will be multiplied by 300 and 0th and 2nd element will be multiplied by 200 and save these values at their index. But doing so it gives me below error:How can I modify these values.
Tuples are immutable, so you will need to create new tuples for your desired result. For array-based manipulations, I would strongly recommend you move to a 3rd party library such as NumPy:But if you insist on using a list of tuples, you can use a list comprehension with a dictionary mapping and :
you should to generate new list of tuplesand you can iterate for even and odd indexes
