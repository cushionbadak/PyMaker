I got sounds that I play from a list called . It plays a sound, store the time when the sound is played in , waits 6 seconds and plays the next sound from the list. Now I want to capture a reaction time between these 6 seconds with a keydown. If the condition is true then I click the button and it captures the time and store it in . Then, the difference between  and  should give me the result. The problem is, that it does not measure the time right. It always gives me millisconds, even if I way longer bfore I click. I wonder what I am doing wrong here?
I think the simplest solution would be to reset the start time when the next sound starts playing.
