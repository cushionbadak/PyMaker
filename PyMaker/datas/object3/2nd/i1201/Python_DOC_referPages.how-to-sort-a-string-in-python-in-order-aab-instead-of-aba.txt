I'm trying to sort a string (to make a genotype for a punnetsquare).My current implementation is:It outputsThough, I would want and expect:How can I change or fix this?
You can specify a sorting key and use the sorting for tuples: : Tuples are sorted by 1st element, on equality by 2nd to nth:This ensures it is first sorted by the 'lower' character - grouping  and   together and then by the actual character afterwards so they occure sorted as well: Readups:Overviewby key (part of the first link)A simple  as suggested in the allegated dupe does not group  to  and  to  which would be nice to have for Prunnet squaresIf you had them rather stay in order of occurence then grouping lower- and uppercase together, you can use:results in keeping the elements "in order":and is described in case-insensitive list sorting, without lowercasing the result?
You can pass in a key to the sorting function:
