I've made an iterable Squares object in 4 way. The classical class, generator style and just for fun a closure style and an improved(?) closure style. classIt works as expectedgeneratorclosureimproved(?) closureWhat I wanted to try is attach the  function to the inner function object and return a generator and I can leave the ()-s and I can use the returned inner as an iterable object. What is the exact definition of the iterable protocol? It seems, only the presence of the  function is not enough. 
The "exact definition of the iterable protocol" is in the documentation: iterable:  An object capable of returning its members one at a time. Examples of iterables include (...) objects of any classes you define with an  method or with a  method that implements Sequence semantics.BUT:  are only invoked when defined on the class - you cannot override them on a per-instance basis (well you can but they won't be invoked).
