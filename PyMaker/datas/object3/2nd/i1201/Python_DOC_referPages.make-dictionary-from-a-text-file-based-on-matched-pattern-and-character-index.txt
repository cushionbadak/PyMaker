Natural Text
I have a text file :I want to extract characters at [21:25] from the line starting with "S" and make a key value pair with characters at indices [23:26] , [49:54] and [75:80] from each following line which starts with "R" until the next line which starts with "S" is encountered and then repeat the process , and hence make a dictionary with these key value pairs for plotting purposes.So far I have started and made a list after extracting the "S" values in a list:But having confusion in how to use it to build a dictionary.Can someone please help in how to proceed. 
using collections.defaultdictoutputI think you need to fix the indexes, they are not what you show as output. Also I don't know if you want to convert to float or Decimal.If you want to preserve the order of insertion - you may need to use OrderedDict and then adjust the part where the values are added.using collections.OrderedDictoutputEDIT: In python3.7+ regular dict will also do, because as per the docs "the insertion-order preservation nature of dict objects has been declared to be an official part of the Python language spec". In 3.6 this feature was considered implementation detail and should not be relied upon. So before 3.7 one must use OrderedDict.
Be aware that a dictionary must have unique keys.So you have to think about what you are inputting as keys.If you are taking  and there are duplicates, some data loss will happen as the last key, value pair will overwrite the existing key already in the dictionary.
Step through it piece by piece.  You are on the right track.If you are reading the file line-by-line then you have 3 cases described:So, consider:
