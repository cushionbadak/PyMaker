What is the purpose of using  in ? Does  refer to index of  or of its sub-lists in the example code below? If I use , I get the single random word from the lists, which is the desired result, but if I omit , it gives the random sub-list with all of its elements.Why it is giving the different result for the two cases?If I try  instead of , The code gives index error: index out of rangeBut if I use  or , code gives the desired result.
You're using  instead of , which returns a list with a single element instead of the element itself. See here:Calling  on it returns the element, while  is out of range because there's only one element. You probably wanted to use  (without the s), right?BTW,  is Python 3.6+.
