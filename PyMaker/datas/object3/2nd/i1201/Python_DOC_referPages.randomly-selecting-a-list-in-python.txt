I am making a hangman game in Python, and I understand how to randomly select an item from a list, but I was wondering if there was a way to randomly select the list in general.For example, I have two lists, list1 and list2Is there a way to randomly select between list1 and list2, and then randomly select a word from the randomly selected list.I hope that makes sense

You can use  to select a random list, and then use  again to select a value from that list:    
The two list case if covered by other answers. If you have an arbitrarily nested, possibly irregular list (or sequence), you can write a recursive function.Demo:
