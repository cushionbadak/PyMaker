So the code that I am working on is for an IRC bot, and I want to implement a way to limit channels based on the  server option. The  option is a list of limits with the prefix and limit seperated by , but if there is nothing after the  then there is no limit.The solution below works, but I am looking for any improvements on it.
We can go further :Solution 2But here I have to make an assumption: I supposed that a channel can match at most one element of . In other words, no two elements of  will match the same channel. Tell me if this is not true for your situation.Here are the changes that I have made: I have created  using a dictionnary comprehension where every element's value is a list comprehensionI have created  which contains the elements of  that have been shortenedI updated the elements of  with those of I created a lambda expression so that I could include it in 's definition.I have extracted  using 
There are many ways to approach this problem. Doing some minimal simplifications you could have something like that:Solution 1Here are the changes that I have made: I created  directly instead of creating a list of tuples () and then using that to create I iterated  over  instead of iterating over I didn't checked to see if  because even if the length of  is lower than or equal to ,  will return all of 
You can even further so that you create your answer  directly but it becomes more difficult to read. So I don't recommend it:Solution 2aJust a few things to note: is created like in Solution 2 but each value of the dictionnary is a list (obtained from a comprehension) that is sliced with the integer value of the current  or  which will mean to take all the values.
When I have to extract some information from strings, I tend to use regular expressions. So extending Solution 2 we can get:Solution 3
But let's backup a little. If I understand correctly, in the end you want a list of the elements of  that matches the prefixes and doesn't exceed the limit of a prefix if there's one. You could implement this filtering behaviour in a generator:Solution 4Here are some comments:In this solution, I have put back the requirement that an element of  will match only one element of . It's because of the  statements placed in the generator.What we do is having a dictionnary with the initial limits for each  and decrement each time we encounter a match with an element of . If that value become 0, the generator will skip to the next value. This is what the (optional in this case)  statement does.
