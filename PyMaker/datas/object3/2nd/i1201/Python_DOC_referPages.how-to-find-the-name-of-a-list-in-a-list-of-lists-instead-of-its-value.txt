I am trying to find the name of a list in a list of lists (is there a specific name for "list of lists"?).For example I have the following lists:If I now want to know what is the name of the first list in list "z" I would try like that:But instead of "x" I get the value of x ("a","b")How can I get the output "x"? 
You want to use a dictionary instead of a list. Where a list is just an enumeration of values, a dictionary is a key-value data structure.This is how your example would look as a dictionary literal:Unlike a list, a dictionary does not preserve the order of elements however! If you had an application where you needed to preserve order, you can use an OrderedDict. UPDATE: This paragraph is no longer true as of Python 3.7.
Having the name of variable as your output is not possible, unless you change some strategies in your code, for e.g:using dictionaries might be better suited to your problem. You can then search for value ["a", "b"] and reach the name 'x'.
a list is a mutable datatype in python. so withpython will allocate some memory and store the adress in x.so x is internally something like:when you make z, python allocates some memory and stores the adress in zthen, it will store the adresses of x and y in the memory of z.so z is internally:now you can see that there is no information of the name of the variable which also stores the adress 0x123456789Summary: you can't get the variable name of a list object.
Maybe just put the list name at the start of each list and instead use z[0][0] to get the name?
