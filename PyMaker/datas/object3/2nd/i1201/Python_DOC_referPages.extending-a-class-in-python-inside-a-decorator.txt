I am using a decorator to extend certain classes and add some functionality to them, something like the following:Unfortunaltely, MyClass is no longer pickleable due to the non global LocalClassI need to pickle my classes. Can you recommend a better design?Considering that there can be multiple decorators on a class, would switching to multiple inheritance by having MyClass inherit all the functionality be a better option?
You need to set the metadata so the subclass looks like the original:Classes are pickled by using their module and qualname to record where to find the class. Your class needs to be found in the same location the original class would have been if it hadn't been decorated, so pickle needs to see the same module and qualname. This is similar to what  does for decorated functions.However, it would probably be simpler and less bug-prone to instead add the new methods directly to the original class instead of creating a subclass:
