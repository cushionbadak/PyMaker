new to python here. I am trying to learn how to perform operations on a list that has mixed types:If the item is a str, I want to add it to output_str, and if it is an int I want to sum it. This is what I have tried:My expected output:But I get the following error:I do not understand why this is happening.Thanks
The  function is intended to sum all the elements in an array, which explains the error you're getting. Also, if you keep  being declared inside your  function, everytime if scans a new value from your list,  would reset. That's why I am now declaring it only once, before the  even starts.I also added the variable , which will be responsible to store the sum of all numbers so far. So what we have is:
Use list comprehension which is faster and more readable and simpler:Output:
You can't do sum on single element, sum requires iterable input type. You can do that like this:Code:Output:
You can also do it like this:Now  will contain the sum of integers in your list, and  will contain the concatenation of all of the strings in your list.
You could use sum and join:OutputIn case the list includes both float and integers you could use Number:Output
Try this:
You could do:And for the strings:
The sum() function expects an iterable. Try this:Output:
