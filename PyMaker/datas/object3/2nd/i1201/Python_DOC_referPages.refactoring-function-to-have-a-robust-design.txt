i am having a simple app example here:say i have this piece of code which handles requests from user to get a list of books stored in a database.and in  i have :but while writing unit tests i realised if i use  inside  it would be harder to unit test the method.so i thought this would be the good way.i want to know what is the good design to use?have all code doing one thing at one place like the first example or the second example is good.To me first one seems more clear as it has all related logic at one place. but its easier to pass a fake collection in second case to unit test it.
you should probably use the mock library  see: https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#quick-guide(if you use python2 you will need )of coarse for yours you will have to construct a slightly more complex object
