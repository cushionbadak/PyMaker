Natural Text
I have a Python function that takes inputs from user and executes a SQL statement:When I try the above code, it runs when all inputs are provided by the user. If any of the fields are not provided, it returns an empty output.Edit : Output returned when I share the below input:However when I enter the below it returns an empty output (it should execute the  portion of the script)
It would be helpful if you include your input lines for team and dept.You're missing a comma after dept, should fix the user-defined function.Furthermore, function_name input should be as followed: prints elseprints dept is none  prints team is none
