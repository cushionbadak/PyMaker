I have some tensorflow code in a custom loss function.I'm using tf.Print(node, [debug1, debug2], "print my debugs: ")It works fine but TF says tf.Print is depricated and will be removed once i update tensorflow and that i should be using tf.print(), with small p.I've tried using tf.print the same way i would tf.Print() but it's not working. Once i fit my model in keras, i get an error. unlike tf.Print, tf.print seems to take in anything **kwargs, so what am i suppose to give it? and unlike tf.Print it do not seem to return something that i can inject into the computational graph.It's really difficult to search because all the information online is about tf.Print().Can someone explain how to use tf.print()?Edit: Example code
Both the documentation of  and  mention that  returns an operation with no output, so it cannot be evaluated to any value. The syntax of  is meant to be more similar to Python's builtin . In your case, you could use it as follows:Here  creates a new tensor identical to  but with a control dependency to , so evaluating it will force executing the printing operation. Note that Keras also offers , although it is less flexible than .
