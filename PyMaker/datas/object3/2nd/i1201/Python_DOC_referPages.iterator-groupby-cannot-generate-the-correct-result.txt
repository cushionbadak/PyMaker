Code:Output:I want to group by the first element, but it seems not work well, what's wrong here?
As you would expect form any function in ,  operates on sequences of elements that share a common key. You have to remember that an iterator can be any source of sequential data, possibly one that doesn't store is own elements as a list does.What this means is that if the data is not already grouped within the iterator,  won't work the way you expect.  Put it another way,  starts another group whenever the key changes, regardless of whether the key has already appeared in the sequence or not.Probably the easiest way to pre-group the data in your case is to sort it. Lists can be sorted in-place:A similar result could be obtained by distributing your list into a dictionary. I use  below because it makes adding new elements easier. You could use a regular dictionary just as easily:In either case, the point is that you can't expect  to do exactly what you want with the order of elements in your raw data.
