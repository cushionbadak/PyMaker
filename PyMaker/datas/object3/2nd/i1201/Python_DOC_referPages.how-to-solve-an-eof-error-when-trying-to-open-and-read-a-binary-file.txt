This question already has an answer here:How to solve an EOF error when reading a binary file                    2 answers                I am learning to write and read from a binary file and am copying code out of a book to illustrates how this is done. I have put together two pieces of code from the book to complete this task. On compilation of my code I get an EOF error and am not sure what is causing it. Can you help? The code I am writing is listed below.
The issue is the last traversal of file object, which has ended.Always use  command in case of reading/writing of a file, by this you don't have to worry about any of such issues. Also it will automatically close it for you
You are reading cars from the file in an infinite loop:At the end of the file, this will correctly throw an EOF exception. There are two ways to handle this:Instead of loading in an infinite loop, write the whole array as a pickle, then load it back:Catch the exception, and move on. This style is called EAFP.
