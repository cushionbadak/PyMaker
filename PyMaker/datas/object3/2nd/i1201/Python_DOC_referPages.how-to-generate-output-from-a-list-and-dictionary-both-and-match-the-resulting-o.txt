This is sort of an assignment or 'homework' problem as you people say and I clarify it in the beginning only. I am new to Python and I really get confused with this kind of problems.The problem stated is :Care hospital wants to know the medical speciality visited by the maximum number of patients. Assume that the patient id of the patient along with the medical speciality visited by the patient is stored in a list. The details of the medical specialities are stored in a dictionary as follows:{"P":"Pediatrics","O":"Orthopedics","E":"ENT} Write a function to find the medical speciality visited by the maximum number of patients and return the name of the speciality.Code I attempted:Sample Input  :   [101,P,102,O,302,P,305,P]Expected Output : PediatricsOutput I am getting : P
This should do it:OutputFirst you need to count each patient by speciality:After that , because there are 3 patients that visited 'P' and 2 that visited 'E'. Then use those values as keys in max:This returns  the most visited speciality, then return the value of  in the  dictionary,in this case: .FurtherThe documentation to max.The documentation on the get method of dict.
If you're restricted with requirement "keep patient id of the patient along with the medical speciality visited by the patient is stored in a list", use the following optimized and unified approach:The output:P.S. Make a habit of "good practices".
You're almost there.in your  loop,  is holding the string , or . Now you just need to use that to call the key in your dictionary:example: when  is 'P', to get the value, you'd use  to get the value . So we'll just include that in your function.Next,  doesn't work as you're thinking here. You'll need a way to count up the number of times a 'P' or 'E' show up, then you really just want that max value.I would also move your part ofoutside the  loop, as you want the max of that full list, where as it's currently doing  and  after each iteration, which isn't needed.Output:
