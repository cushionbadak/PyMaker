Natural Text
strong textWhen I learn the  attribute in Python, I created two simplest scripts to test it out.Script 1 (Name of Script: test1.py) When I run Script 1, it returns  as expected.Script 2When I run Script 2, it returns  which is the filename of test1.py, and this is the expected result as well.However, if I rename script1 from test1.py to abc.py, and update Script 2 to  and run Script 2 again, it shows nothing.I have tried other random filenames for Script 1  such as abcdefg.py, xyz.py, blabla.py and update the code of script 2 accordingly, and each time I can get the correct output such as , , , but whenever the filename of Script 1 is abc.py, running Script 2 will show nothing at all, why is that so? 
 happens to be a name of a built-in module. When you do  you are importing it, not your .Its documentation, in case you are wondering.As @user2357112 correctly noted in the comments,  seems to be a little special in this aspect. Naming a script with a name of a built-in module (,  etc) usually imports that script and shadows the built-in module. However  shows a different behavior which is probably a result of how soon it is loaded during the interpreter execution.
