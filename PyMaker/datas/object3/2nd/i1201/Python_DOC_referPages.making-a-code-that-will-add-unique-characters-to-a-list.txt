Natural Text
so the below code should be talking the unique characters in msg and the unique characters and making a list containing two sublists. An example would be should return                What I have tried to do below is made three lists and then ran a for loop to check if i is in the new list (unique) if not adds it to the list, same was done for unique_code. Then finally put the two lists together and returned but when I print I get none. Any help would be appreciated. 
You get , because  mutates  and does not return a modified list, but  (as all functions mutating the input should). You can do  instead.After having fixed your return, you should use a better algorithm. Whenever you check , this linearly checks the list  for the value , making it  in total.This is using the  recipe , which keeps the original order and is , because it uses a  to keep track of already seen letters:If you cannot use , you can also write it yourself (probably slightly slower):And if you don't care about the order, just use :
Swap your extend with append and your append with extend. I think you got them confused in terms of functionality.You append an element to a list.You extend a list to another list.Also, you used [item] in the second for loop but you were adding [i] into the list. Change that to [item] then below code works:
