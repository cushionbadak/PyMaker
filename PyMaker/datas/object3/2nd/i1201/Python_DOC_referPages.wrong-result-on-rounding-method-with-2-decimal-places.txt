I got confusing with the result of round() with 2 decimal places what happens with case b or Have I misunderstood anything?Answer:Because it needs to be used for monetary so the default convention of python round() (Banker's Rounding) doesn't right in my case
While it can be confusing, this is due to the fact that most decimal fractions cannot be represented exactly as a  type.For further reference, see: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html#tut-fp-issues
It is not wrong actually.It is Banker's Rounding and is an implementation detail on purpose.If you wish to retain the 'always round 0.5 up' method, you can do so by doing:
Recall your Physics / Mathematics lesson where they taught how rounding off works.If the last digit is a '5' and you round that off, it's preceding digit shall move to the next even digit if it is odd but shall remain the same if it is already even.
