I am trying to follow syntax of the pyparticleio.ParticleCloud package.  Using the following command, my code works correctly "particle_cloud.boron1.led('on')" (hardcoded values)I want to pass portions of the command, "boron1" and "on" as variable.  I'm trying to figure out how to use those variables to act in the same way as if i'd hardcoded the values.My python level is very beginner. 
If you set  to the actual object, you can call methods on the object. Example:
Python has a built in function called It allows you to take a string, and have Python execute it as code.A basic example based on the code you provided would look like this:This is a bit ugly, but there are different ways to compose strings in Python such as using  or  so depending on your real code you may be able to build something nice.Just be careful not to pass raw user input to !I can cause all kinds of trouble from errors to security issues.
I believe you could use  (in Python3: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#getattr ) :(BTW, I woudln't name the string 'on' with the label 'function_1' as the variable name implies that this option is a function when it is a string. Also, the above may now work depending on the properties of your library object ParticleCloud.)
