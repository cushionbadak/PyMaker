I want to calculate a value in the class that stays the same for all instances of that class and is calculated only oncefirst, What should I set as reference for  in  ? and  both are not correct (unresolved reference)what I need is, when the second instance is created, the  is not called again.
Class members are only initialized once - they are initialized before (and without) instances being created.You can test this yourself:Executing this prints  once, even without any creation of instances. Executing this print's  only once - and it does so right before asking for  - after inputting the program ends wihtout any more outputs.
