When reading emails from a specific folder (Office365), the body of the message is a random long string that makes no sense. Initially, I sent those emails to my personal mail as copy, to a specific folder. Reading from there I haven't had problems. But when I try to read directly from the main inbox, the messages are  long strings that makes no sense (so, I canÂ´t parse anything)I receive something like this when I read from my personal inbox:mymail:  b'Status from Device (x.x.x.x) to AnotherDevice (y.y.y.y), interface A B, in Protocol came up\r\n'But when I read from the main inbox:'QWRq4N5IGZyb20gVVREFxLXJlMSAuMTAuMjUsIDAxMDAuMTAwMS4w\r\nMDI1LjAwKSB0byBVU0FEQUxIERS4MC4xMC4xMMDAxLjAw\r\nMjUuMDQpLCBpbnZhY2UgMTAuMTA4AuMjI5IHRvIDEwLjEwLjIwLjEzMCwgaW4gSVNJUy9M\r\nZXZlbDIgd2VudCBkkNvbmZ3VyZWQgd2F0Y2hsaXN0OiI1OQ0K\r\n'
