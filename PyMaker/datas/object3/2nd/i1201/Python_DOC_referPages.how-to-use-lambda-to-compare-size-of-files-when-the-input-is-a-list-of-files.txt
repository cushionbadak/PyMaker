I have a function that gest 2 file paths:  path can be a simple  or a bit more complex - . If I want for example to check if  files exist I can do that using :However, if I want to check file's size, I'm using  and that's I'm not sure how to insert into a .What I want in the end is something like this: where the inner  would get the sizes of the each file in  but that wouldn't work. Can  or  or something else be useful here or must I write it in a function?Just to clarify - I want to take 2 paths, A,B where B may contain '*' and check if size(A) == size(B) if B does not contain '*', else compare size(A) with each and one of size(glob.glob(B)). One option I think of, is compare all files in B using , and then, if same, compare to A, but I don't know how to
One way you might be able to get away with this is the  library (the backport of  in Python3's standard library). To get a file's size, you can do , and it also supports Glob in the form of .So maybe something likeThough I'm not sure how to test it against your example.
