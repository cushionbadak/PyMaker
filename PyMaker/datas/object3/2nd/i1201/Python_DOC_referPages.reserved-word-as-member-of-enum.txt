I wanted to make a python Enum work having a reserved word as member.   I wanted to customize  to have the usual syntax returnSo how do I customize ,  or  to accomplish this? 
Instead of mucking about with the internals, you could use the  instead:and in use:
It's stored in a single underscore variable:This will also fix up the repr's, and the call by member value still works:Attribute access will still have to use the declared name, of course, because otherwise it would be a syntax error.To enable call by member name, patch it into the map:If you need more than a simple alias here, then you might want to remove the original name and/or take care to preserve ordering in the member map.
