I have a list which i have joined using the following code:Not sure why i did it that way but I used patternCore to filter multiple strings at the same time. Please note that Broker is a dataFrameNow I am looking to strip one string. Say I would like to strip 'DB'. How can I do that please?I tried this  but nothing is stripped Thank you 
Since  is a Pandas dataframe, you can use  with Boolean indexing, then use :A more generic solution, which works with objects other than Pandas dataframes, is to use a list comprehension with an  condition:Without returning to your input series, using the same idea you can split and re-join:You should expect the last option to be expensive as your algorithm requires reading each character in your input string.
I would like to mention some points which have not been touched upon till now.I tried thisbut nothing is strippedThe reason why it didn't work was because  returns a copy of the string with the  and  characters removed.NOTE: Not the characters in the occuring somewhere in the mid.The chars argument is not a prefix or suffix; rather, all combinations of its values are strippedHere you have specified the argument characters as 'DB'. So had your string been something like , your code would have worked partially(the pipe at the end would remain). But anyways this is not a good practice. Because it would strip something like  to  or  to  also.I would like to strip 'DB'.For this part, @jpp has already given a fine answer.
