I've used multi-threading a lot, while appending to the same list from different threads. Everything worked fine.However, I'm getting a problem with list appending when the threads are like 70 threads or more. Appending in the last thread gets stuck for like 5 mins (the processor is not occubied at this time, maybe 10 %. So, it's not a hardware problem I would say). Then appending occurs successfully.At this link, it says that list appending is thread-safe.My question is: Can list appending ever become not thread safe?Don't ask for a code or so. I just need a simple yes or no to my question. And if yes, kindly provide suggestions to fix that.
list appending in python is thread safe.You last thread gets stuck maybe due to other reason, for example: Memory allocating..My first step to fix the stuck is use  to trace the syscall.And you can use  to print all threads' call stack too.
