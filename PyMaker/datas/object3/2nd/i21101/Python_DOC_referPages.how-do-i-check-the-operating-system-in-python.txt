You can use : has finer granularity than .For the valid values, consult the documentation.
You can get a pretty coarse idea of the OS you're using by checking .Once you have that information you can use it to determine if calling something like  is appropriate to gather more specific information.  You could also use something like Python System Information on unix-like OSes, or pywin32 for Windows.There's also psutil if you want to do more in-depth inspection without wanting to care about the OS.
If you want to know on which platform you are: "Linux", "Windows" or "Darwin" (Mac) without more precision, you should use:The  function use  internally.

You can use .
There seems to be some conflicting information about how Windows identifies. Some sources are saying "Windows", and other sources are saying "win32".With that in mind...That might be true in Cygwin though. But you can always add a check to make sure "cy" isn't in there.
