How do I get specific path sections from a url? For example, I want a function which operates on this: and returns "hithere"or operates on this:and returns the same thing ("hithere")I know this will probably use urllib or urllib2 but I can't figure out from the docs how to get only a section of the path.
Extract the path component of the URL with urlparse:Split the path into components with os.path.split:The dirname and basename functions give you the two pieces of the split; perhaps use dirname in a while loop:
The best option is to use the  module when working with the path component of URLs. This module has the same interface as  and consistently operates on POSIX paths when used on POSIX and Windows NT based platforms.Sample Code:Code output:Notes:On Windows NT based platforms  is On Unix/Posix based platforms  is  will not handle backslashes () correctly (see last two cases in code/output) - which is why  is recommended.remember to use consider using The semantics of multiple path separators () is not defined by RFC 3986. However,  collapses multiple adjacent path separators  (i.e. it treats ,  and  the same)Even though POSIX and URL paths have similar syntax and semantics, they are not identical.Normative References:IEEE Std 1003.1, 2013 - Vol. 1: Base Definitions - Section 4.12: Pathname ResolutionThe GNU C Library Reference Manual - Section 11.2: File NamesIETF RFC 3986: Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax - Section 3.3: PathIETF RFC 3986: Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax - Section 6: Normalization and ComparisonWikipedia: URL normalization
Python 3.4+ solution: 
Note in Python3 import has changed to  See documentation. Here is an example:

A combination of urlparse and os.path.split will do the trick. The following script stores all sections of a url in a list, backwards.This would return: ["else", "something", "hithere"]
