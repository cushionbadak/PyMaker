I'm not allowed to use any built-in list functions or methods other than , , , and  though. This is the part that's really confusing to me.What would be the best way in going about this?
Hint 1:  You might want to study the Python code in the bisect module.Hint 2:  Slicing can be used for list insertion:
Use the insort function of the bisect module: 
You should use the bisect module. Also, the list needs to be sorted before using bisect.insort_left It's a pretty big difference.
This is a possible solution for you:
