How can I convert  into a list of tuples I am using  shell that does not support . So I am unable to use it. 
If  is unavailable, you can use the (unsafe!) :However, you should really overthink your serialization format. If you're transferring data between Python applications and need the distinction between tuples and lists, use pickle. Otherwise, use JSON.
If you don't trust the source of the string enough to use , then use .The code above is very straightforward and only works with 2-tuples of integers. If you want to parse more complex structures, you're better off with a proper parser.
'join' replace following characters '()[] ' and creates string of comma separated numbers'split' splits that string on ',' and creates list strings'iter' creates iterator that will go over list of elementsand the last line uses a list comprehension using 'zip' to group together two numbers
