Can anyone tell me how can I call for indexes in a nested list?Generally I just write: but what if I have a list with nested lists as below:and I want to go through the indexes of each one separately?
If you really need the indices you can just do what you said again for the inner list:But it is more pythonic to iterate through the list itself:If you really need the indices you can also use :
Try this setup:To print the 2nd element in the 1st list ("b"), use  - For the 2nd element in 3rd list ("g"): The first brackets reference which nested list you're accessing, the second pair references the item in that list. 
You can do this. Adapt it to your situation:
The question title is too wide and the author's need is more specific. In my case, I needed to extract all elements from nested list like in the example below:Example:The code below gives me the result, but I would like to know if anyone can create a simpler answer:Call of the method
Output: 
I think you want to access list values and their indices simultaneously and separately:
