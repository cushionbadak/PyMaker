How can I call the custom-defined function in a python script from a bash shell?I tried to use sys.argv[1], but not working properly.for example,here, I want to call the function 1 or function 2 by typing like$ script.py function1$ script.py function2
You are getting the name of function , but you are not running it. You should check first if the func name is one of your functions than execute it:A simpler solution:
I suggest to use argparse module: https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#module-argparseYou will thank yourself later.For your case - since you need to call only 1 function at the time - you can use positional arguments:As a bonus you get a nice help page when calling with -h argument :)

You can refer Display a list of user defined functions in the Python IDLE sessionThis will return list of available functions, Then you can check if any of these contain sys.argv[1], If yes then you can call your function as
