Recently when adding the debugger to my python 2.7.10 code, I get this message:This is after inserting the lines:in the code.I cannot figure out why this is happening. I've read up on Bdb and Bdbquit, but cannot figure out why this is happening in my code. Can anyone provide me with some hints of why this happens in general? I really want to get the debugger working again.
If you continue from the  prompt and allow your code to finish normally, I wouldn't expect output like the traceback you indicated, but if you quit , with the  command or ^D (EOF), a traceback like that occurs because there is nothing to catch the  exception raised when the debugger quits. In   gets set to  by the  method (and by  clauses in the various run methods). Dispatch methods called by   when  is , and the typical  clause for  is a simple  statement;  inherits all of that from .In short, exception handling is used to disable the system trace function used by the debugger, when the debugger interaction finishes early.One way to avoid that traceback altogether is to use  differently. Rather than calling  from your code (and not handling  at all), you can invoke your code within  (rather than vice versa), at which point the  exception will be handled as intended by pdb. That will also allow you to choose breakpoint locations without modifying your code (using 's  command). Or you can mix the two approaches; run your code under ,  calls and all, and those calls will be breakpoints that you can remove only by modifying your code.You can invoke your code within  by using the  command with your script invocation as its command line arguments, or with .
I ran into this when I left  and a  in my production code. When the  line was executed, python was waiting for my input to tell it to ontinue or step into, etc... Because the python code was being called by a web server I wasn't there to press  to continue. After so long (not sure how long) it finally raised the  exception.I didn't have anything setup to catch that exception so it raised a 500 in my web server.It took me a while to understand that my debug code running in an a daemon/background was causing the issue. I felt silly.
Apart from Eirik Fuller answer I would like to add that you can't be using  in something thats running in a different process. For debugging you can check this answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/23654936/7806805 but it seems very hackish or you can make your program run in a single thread. Consult the documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html. For multiprocessing issues you might even want to go through https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/46x9sm/why_is_pdbset_trace_crashing_whenever_it_is_in_an/Anyways your question lacks much needed context. Please add on to your question. 
One possible reason is that you are running the . When a process runs in the background, you can't send input to the process via terminal and hence pdb console can't work. Eventually, it raises bdbquit.
