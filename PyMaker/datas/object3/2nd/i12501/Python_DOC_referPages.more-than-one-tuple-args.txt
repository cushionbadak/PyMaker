I know you can use  in Python to allow a tuple or arguments. But how could one have two of these. Like  and ?Is this possible?
You can't have multiple variadic parameters of the same type in a function definition (e.g. , but, in Python 3.5, you can pass arguments in that form when calling a function.Python 3.4:Python 3.5:
I assume you mean in terms of function arguments, then no it isn't possible. The reason why is a tuple  can be of any length of 0 or more arguments. If you had another one, , how would you determined which arguments belong to  and which to ? You can however include a  which is a dictionary object of keyword arguments. For example:You can figure out what the args of  are. However, inYou cannot determine which arguments go into  and which go into . However, forIt's possible to differentiate the arguments that belong to  and those that belong to  because the arguments that belong to the  take the form of .
It is not possible to pass  twice when calling a function (up until in Python 3.5)However, what you can do is concatenate two  ( or ) as you pass them using . For example: The function definition can only have a single  definition, and all passed position arguments will end up in the  variable in the order they were passed.
