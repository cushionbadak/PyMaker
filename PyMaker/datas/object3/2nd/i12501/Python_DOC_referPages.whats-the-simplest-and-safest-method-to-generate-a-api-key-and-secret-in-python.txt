I need to generate a API key and Secret that would be stored in a Redis server. What would be the best way to generate a key and secret?I am develop a Django-tastypie framework based app.
EDIT: for a very secure way of generating random number, you should use urandom:this will produce bytes, call  if you need a string You can just generate keys of your desired length the python way:And then you can just call it with your desired length .You can specify what alphabet you want to use, for example using only  for key consisting of only lowercase letters etc.There is also Model for Api authentication in tastypie, might be worth checking out https://django-tastypie.readthedocs.org/en/latest/authentication.html#apikeyauthentication
If you're on Python 3.6 or later, the secrets module is the way to go:  The secrets module is used for generating cryptographically strong random numbers suitable for managing data such as passwords, account authentication, security tokens, and related secrets.In particular, secrets should be used in preference to the default pseudo-random number generator in the random module, which is designed for modelling and simulation, not security or cryptography.e.g. to generate a 16 byte token:
Adding answer as I can't comment on T. Opletals answer.You should not use random.choice as random isn't cryptographically secure. A better option would be random.SystemRandom() which uses the system source of randomness, on linux this would be urandom.
you can also use following module to generate random string
