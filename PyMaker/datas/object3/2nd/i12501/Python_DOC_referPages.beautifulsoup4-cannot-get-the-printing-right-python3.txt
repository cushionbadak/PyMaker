Natural Text
I'm currently in the learning process of Python3, I am scraping a site for some data, which works fine, but when it comes to printing out the p tags I just can't get it to work as I expect.That all works, but the printing is "bytes"Real sample text that is ascii encoded:Note that Announcement is p and the rest is 'strong' under a p tag.Same sample with utf-8 encodeI WISH to get:As you see, the incorrect chars are stripped in "ascii", but as some are  that destroys some linebreaks and I have yet to figure out how to print that correctly, also, the b's are still there then!I really can't figure out how to remove b's and encode or decode properly. I have tried every "solution" that I can google up.HTML Content = utf-8I would most rather not change the full data before processing because it will mess up my other work and I don't think it is needed.Prettify does not work.Any suggestions?
First, you're getting output of the form  because you are calling , which returns a bytes object. If you want to print strings for reading, keep them as strings!As a guess, I assume you're looking to print strings from HTML nicely, pretty much as they would be seen in a browser. For that, you need to decode the HTML string encoding, as described in this SO answer, which for Python 3.5 means:Among other things, this will convert any  sequences in the HTML string into  characters, which are printed as spaces. However, if you want to break lines on these characters despite  literally meaning "non-breaking space", you'll have to replace those with actual spaces before printing, e.g. using .
