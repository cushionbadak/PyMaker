I want to know if a number in a list is found j times consecutively ,this is my list :And this is what i wrote :But this function will check if any number is found consecutively,i want to add another parameter to this function so i can specify what number i want to look for in the list .n means there are n rows and columns and j is how many times is how many times the number needs to be found .
Your requirements are unclear. However, this would be a slightly modified version of your code which would yield what I believe you're seeking.target is the number for which you want to know if there are j consecutive entries.
No need for the  argument.
There are a few problems with your code:the  parameter is not needed, you can get the size of the list by using you should not use  as a variable name, as it shadows the builtin  functionwith  you are assuming that each sublist has the same number of elements as the parent listyour function also returns  if the number appears more than  times in a rowyou are doing lots of double work by using three loops instead of just twoYou can fix this, and also add the parameter for the number to be repeated, as shown in the other answers. However, using just loops and conditions, the resulting code will be very unwieldy.Instead, you can create a function as you describe using  and .  groups equal numbers, then you just have the check the  of those groups and see if  is long enough, and whether it's the correct number, for  of the sublists.This will return  if  appears exactly  times consecutively in any of the sublists.
