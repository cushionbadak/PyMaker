In Python 2.7, 3.4 and 3.5,  is capable of accepting a string:However,  can't do the same:This is because inside ,  uses  with a converter that uses  to get a Python integer, and that raises an exception on failure. However, in ,  uses   (Or  for an old enough Python) as a conversion first, and as the documentation says at https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/number.html, this is the equivalent of running , which can convert a string to an integer. Only then is it given to , by way of a helper function What is the reason for this difference? Is it a deliberate choice based on some history?The behaviour of  seems more helpful, and it's odd that it doesn't apply to both functions. Is this undesirable behaviour in  or ? 
The short answer is because humans are fallible and mistakes happen.  Some are doozies and get noticed quickly, others are minor and can go years without detection.Thank you for helping make Python better!
