Basically my question is-Im not sure how to take a list of foods:and returns        veggies - Food objects from foods that are vegetarian (list of Food)the problem is im not sure if Im supposed to make a new list and add the vegetarian food from the "foods" list to the new one or if the word "objects" has anything to do with thisalso how would I be able to go through the list to check to see if it is a veg or not a veg?this is an assignment that I have to do so I dont want any code answers please but if someone could explain so I could learn for future references that would be amazing hopefully my question makes sense and that I am allowed to ask this type of question, thanks in advance :)
You need to use dictYou can create a dictionary like this:And you can check if Steak is vegetarian food like this:This is a very naive approach. You can store boolean values in dictionary or define a check function which accepts the food name and return or print the result or you can even build a class which have a is_vegetarian method.
