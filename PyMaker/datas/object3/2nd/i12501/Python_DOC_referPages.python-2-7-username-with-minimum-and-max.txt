I am having trouble with this block of code. I just started programming in Python 2.7 and I would like to have some help.Here is the code:The username must consist of a number too. And I would like to have the user input the username again if the number of characters is 0.Thanks!
Basic versionThis could be a solution:Keep asking the user in a  loop until you get what you want.This checks if the user name contains at least one digit:This part is a so-called generator expression:The easiest way to visualize what it is doing, is to convert it into a list:It lets  run through all elements of  i.e. it takes on the values , , ...  in turn, and checks if this value is contained in .The built-in any returns  if any element is true:Return  if any element of the iterable is true. If the iterable is empty, return . An alternative way to check for a digit in a string would be to use regular expressions. The module re offers this functionality:Prints:In a functionYou can put this functionality in a function (as requested by the OP in a comment):
You can try something like this:I've managed to cover the case of the space and the username containing at least one digit. I've used regular expressions. Hope that helps somehow!Best Regards
