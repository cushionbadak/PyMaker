I have already checked some question-answers related to Unhashable type : 'list' in stackoverflow, but none of them helped me. Here is my partial code:where  is a list of lists,  is just a list &  is a python dictionary. The entire code runs well when ever I comment the line , but without that line being commented, it shows  error.
The error message does not correspond to the linebeing commented out. If anything, the culprit is the lineThe problem should be that you are trying to use a list as your dictionary key. Here is the problem in a simple reproducible way:The reason it fails, is because a dictionary is also be called a hashmap (in other languages). The key must be hashable, and in Python trying to use a list as the key throws your error becauses lists are not hashable (see "hashable" entry here).Avoid using a list as your dictionary key will fix the problem.
Here's my guess .... You mentioned that the error is with the line  .. That is probably because in either  or , you have a list within a list .... the items in a set need to hashable, and hence immutable .. for example you cannot do  ... that will give the unhashable type list error ... but you can do  because a tuple is immutable and hashable
