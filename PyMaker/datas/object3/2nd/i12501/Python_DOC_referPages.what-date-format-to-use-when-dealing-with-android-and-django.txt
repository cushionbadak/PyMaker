ISO 8601?For example django is good with this format:Or unixtime? It is important for me to have a timezone.Asking because I don't have experience dealing with server-client systems written in two different frameworks.
Django almost always internally stores dates in UTC time using a database field of appropriate date/time type for the underlying database. You cannot access this directly - when reading/writing the database it will be converted to/from a Python "datetime" object, described in detail in the Python docs. Converting between Unix time (specifically POSIX time which is specified in terms of UTC) and Python datetimes in UTC time is straightforward using datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp and time.mktime(t.timetuple()). Converting between Python datetimes and ISO 8601 can be done with the iso8601 package.If you need to support local time zone date/times, even if it's just one local time zone, you should enable time zone support as detailed in the Django time zones documentation. This will add complexity, but as the documentation notes, "This shields you from subtle and unreproducible bugs around Daylight Saving Time (DST) transitions."
The error message says explicitly what format should you use:It must be in YYYY-MM-DD  HH:MM[:ss[.uuuuuu]][TZ] format.If all you have is a Unix time then convert it to UTC time (represented by a  object) and serialize it using RFC 3339 time format (a profile of ISO 8601):If your android client doesn't understand rfc 3339, try variations: method provides even more flexibility.
