In Python 3.5, when I convert POSIX origin  to timestamp (in seconds) instead of  I get the following result:Expected  is produced by:Both results are quite unexpected to me. What could be a reason for such a behaviour?
According to the docs: Naive datetime instances are assumed to represent local timehttps://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.htmltimestamp: https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.timestampYou get a negative count so I guess you happen to be at UTC-3 (10800 / 60 / 60) (and you get a 0 when adding 3 hours)Make a timezone aware date and you should be back at 0.
