Despite my obviously beginning Python skills, Iâ€™ve got a script that pulls a line of data from a 2,000-row CSV file, reads key parameters, and outputs a buffer CSV file organized as an N-by-2 rectangle, and uses the subprocess module to call the external program POVCALLC.EXE, which takes a CSV file organized that way as input.  The relevant portion of the code is shown below. I THINK that subprocess or one of its methods should allow me to interact with the external program, but am not quite sure how - or indeed whether this is the module I need.  In particular, when POVCALLC.EXE starts it first asks for the input file, which in this case is buffer.csv.  It then asks for several additional parameters including the name of an output file, which come from outside the snippet below.  It then starts computing results, and then ask for further user input, including several carriage returns . Obviously, I would prefer to automate this interaction for the 2,000 rows in the original CSV. Am I on the right track with subprocess, or should I be looking elsewhere to automate this interaction with the external executable?Many thanks in advance!
If your program expects these arguments on the standard input (e.g. after running POVCALLC you type csv filenames into the console), you could use  [see https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen ] with stdin redirection (stdin=PIPE), and use the returned object to send data to stdin.It would looks something like this:You can also use the tuple returned by  to automatically check the programs stdout and stderr (see the link to docs for more).
