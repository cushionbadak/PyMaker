I have an xml string (which I am fetching from a CSV) here from which I need to identify the values and names from it. The logic I thought is to extract all strings which are in between of  and  for values and then remove the extracted substring which contains  or I am yet to think on how I can extract parameter name as well. I am using python.Below is the xml string that I read from csv file.Any help is appreciated.Note: This is not a whole xml. It is a post body data that I am fetching from a CSV file. It is a string basically when I fetch it. So I cannot use XML parser here.
