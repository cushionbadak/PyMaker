I am experimenting a bit with python's asyncio Protocols. I found this example from the official docs and wanted to slightly modify it and reproduce its beahviour. So I wrote the following two scripts:and:When I run async_test.py I get the following output:And it just hangs.If I uncomment the  method, the output is the following:And still the process hangs. What I think is happening is that for some reason the child process () closes the pipe (as seen in the output above) but does not terminate so that the parent can unblock from . I really don't understand the reason behind this behaviour, considering that my code is mostly copy-pasted from an example in the python docs.
