This list shows what methods you need to implement for your class to be "regarded" as Sequence: , , , , , , and . So why does this minimal implementation does not work, i.e. why ?Is there an additional method I need to implement that I overlooked? Did I misunderstand abstract base classes? Subclassing  makes  return  of course, but that kinda defeats the idea behind abc, doesn't it?
Use the source, Luke! does not implement its own , and all the implementations of  from the parents of  have checks like this:You can however explicitly  your class as a :As for the reason why  does not implement , see issue 16728 (which title was initially "collections.abc.Sequence shoud provide __subclasshook__"). The issue can be summarized by saying that a sequence can be many things, depending on the needs of who uses it:Many algorithms that require a sequence only need  and .
