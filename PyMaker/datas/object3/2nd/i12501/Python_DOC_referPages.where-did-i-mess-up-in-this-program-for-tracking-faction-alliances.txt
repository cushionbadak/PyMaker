I have a program that models kingdoms and other groups (called 'factions' in my code).I want to be able to call a factions become_ally() method to add factions to the ally lists, like this:What actually happens is this:Whenever I try to call become_ally(), the code should check to make sure they aren't already allies. This is the part that isn't working. Every time I call become_ally(), it prints "They're already allies!", regardless of if they actually are.I also tried to use , but that had the same problem.I strongly suspect that the problem is with my use of , but I don't know what terms to Google for more information. 
You can't use mutable arguments as the default argument to a function.When the default is used, it's the same  each time, so they have the same ; mutating one changes the other because they're actually the same thing.Change to:Alternatively, copy the  argument unconditionally (so you're not worried about a reference to it surviving outside the class and getting mutated under the class):
Change this function.  Check your own data not that of the passed in object.AlsoIs a bug waiting to happen. Your  list will be a static list shared between all instances. Instead use
