Help me. I'm stuck. I have a  of . The attributes of that class are , , , . There some points that has same , and . So, i need  as points identity. Actually, I want to get nearest neighbor of my point using tree of . I have no problem when I construct , but when I want to know my point nearest neighbor, the result is list  of nearest neighbor whereas I want  as my result because there are some points have same , and . This is my code: Please give me any suggestion? 
Use a dict (or collections.defaultdict) to record a mapping from  tuples to lists of .Armed with this dict (let's call it ), given a  you willbe able to look up all the  at that location.The keys in the  dict are  tuples which we can form into a NumPy array to be passed to :Now, we can iterate through each location and findthe nearest points:Note that  returns a list of indices (that index into). The actual locations are given by . Here we'retaking advantage of NumPy fancy indexing -- made possible because  isa NumPy array.For each location in , we can now obtain a list of  by looking up the associated point using our dict, :Putting it all together:yields output like:
