I'm struggling to get my head around multiprocessing and passing a global True/False variable into my function.After get_data() finishes I want the analysis() function to start and process the data, while fetch() continues running. How can I make this work? TIA
You should run the two processes and use a shared queue to exchange information between them, such as signaling the completion of an action in one of the processes. Also, you need to have a join() statement to properly wait for completion of the processes you spawn.
You example won't work for a few reasons :Process cannot share a piece of memory with each other (you can't change the global in one process and see the change in the other)Even if you could change the global value, you are checking it too fast and most likely it won't change in timeRead https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipc.html for more possibilities for inter-process-communications
