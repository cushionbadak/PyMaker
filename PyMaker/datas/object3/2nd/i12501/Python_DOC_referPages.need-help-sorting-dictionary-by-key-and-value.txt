I'm working on a python school project and I'm having trouble sorting dictionaries. My dictionaries are currently formatted like so:  How can I sort the by: AlphabeticallyBy highest scoreBy highest average scoreI'm fairly new at python so anything to lead me in the right direction would be greatly appreciated!Edit: Originally for the alphabetical sorting, I got as far as using  but which sorts the keys but does not keep the values.
1.I am guessing the first sort is based on the Alphabetical order of the keys in dictionaryIf you have tried  you will get the answer for your first questionFor this one, you need get the max_score for each student through the lambda function:This one is similar with the second oneBut I think your professor never recommend you ask question in here to help you finish your homework.
