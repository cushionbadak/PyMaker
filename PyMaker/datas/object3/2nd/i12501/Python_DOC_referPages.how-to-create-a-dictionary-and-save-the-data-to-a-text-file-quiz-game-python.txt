Natural Text
This is python and I am using idle version 3.4.2.So at the moment my code works but I would like to adapt it to be able to:Save the most recent three scores for the name (as they re-run the code and the scores are saving in the text file). However there is an issue that whatever "name" is entered, it re saves on its own line with the score, rather than "appending" (I know this is because it's not saved in the form of a list/dictionary, but how would I do that? - or I read that you can "split" the line?)That is my first question and if anyone can help I would be so hugely appreciative, I am new to python so this is ab ig challenge for me! Any comments or suggestions are very welcome!! 
If you want to keep it human readable write it in a json file:Loading is almost as easy:
If you want to save the user's score to a list...You may want to read in the file before the game starts as well. Then, you will need to populate the list with scores that are in the text file.Finally, when the game ends you'll want to add the user's score to the file. In this case, I'll keep it simple and not include the person's name for an example, you can still add the line to the list though.And then if they view the scores, just print off the value of my_list, separating each element in the list by a new line.
Use the  module to store your data. Organise your  relation into an dictionary, then call  to save it to a file.When you need it back, call  and it will load the data from the pickle file. This approach is better than you having to devise your own parsing algorithm.
If you're ok with changing the look of your file, try saving the file as json.At the top of your code, load in the scores from the file:Then you can modify scores in your dictionary and write back to the file:This code doesn't store more than the latest score, but you can explore options for saving more than one score per name. I suggest taking a look at defaultdict.
Some answers suggest storing the scores as JSON (good idea) or pickling them (bad idea! it's dangerous). This answer assumes you want to keep the flat-file, oldest-first format.You're opening the file in append mode, so you won't be able to change any of the content. To make changes, you'll first need to read from the file:Note that this reads all the lines; if your file grows very large, it won't all fit into memory and you should read line-by-line and write as you go.For each line:If it's another person's score, you have no reason to touch it, just write it back verbatim.If it's this person's score, keep it iff it's one of the two most recent.It's slightly easier to keep track of the most-recent scores if we start with the most recent line, so let's do that:Finally, add the new score.Now we can write the lines back to the file:
