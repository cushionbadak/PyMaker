I am trying to create a basic mathematical quiz and need to be able to store the name of the user next to their score. To ensure that I could edit the data dynamically regardless of the length of the user's name or the number of digits in their score, I decided to split up the name and score with a comma and use the split function. I'm new to file handling in python so don't know if I am using the wrong mode ("r+") but when I complete the quiz, my score is not recorded at all, nothing is added to the file. Here is my code:Please let me know how I can get this system to work. Thank you in advance.
Yes  opens the file for both reading and writing and to summarize: when the file will only be read for only writing (an existing file with the same name will be erased) opens the file for appending; any data written to the file is automatically added to the end. I will recommend instead of comma separation to benifit from json or yaml syntax, it fits better in this case.scores.json:The solution:scores.yml will looks as follow:Solution:to instal yaml python package: 
Modifying a file in place is generally a poor way to do this. It risks errors causing the resulting file to be half new data, half old, with the split point being corrupted. The usual pattern is to write to a new file, then atomically replace the old file with the new file, so either you have the entire original old file and a partial new file, or the new file, not a mish-mash of both.Given your example code, here is how you would fix it up to do that:
