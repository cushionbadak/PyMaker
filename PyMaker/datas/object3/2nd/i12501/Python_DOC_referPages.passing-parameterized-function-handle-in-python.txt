I have a general function that defines a form of an ODE that I plan to integrate using , for example:I have several objects in my code that all have dynamics of the form defined in , but with unique parameters  and . I would love to be able to just pass a unique handle to  with those parameters already set when I initialize my objects, so that when I update my objects, all I have to do is something like  for some simulation time .For example, if I define a class:Can I do something with Lambdas when I initialize instances of  to basically assign parameters  and  at initialization and never need to pass them again? I am a bit stuck.
If you have:you could define something like:and should be able to initialize MyThing with:then you could call this helper with only y and u parameters:
Solution with lambdasIt looks like I can make this work using lambdas to generate unique function handles when I initialize my objects. For compatibility with , I need to define my functions so that the first two arguments are time and initial state:Next I can initialize objects of  using lambdas to set  and  as:The function handle that gets assigned to  is now the function handle returned by the lambda (this may not be the right way to say this) with values for  and  set. Now in , I need to make some changes to get it to work with :One thing that tripped me up a bit is that any extra arguments to your ODE need to be passed as a tuple to . This seems to work pretty well for what I want. There is also the more object-oriented approach using , which allows for step-wise integration of the function and is great for my simulation purposes. For this, I set the object's ODE and update it with something like:
