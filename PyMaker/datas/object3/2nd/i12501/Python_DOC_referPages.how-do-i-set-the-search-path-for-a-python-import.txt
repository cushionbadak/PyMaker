I'm using Windows 10 with VS2015 and Python 3.4. I have created a module called . Now I want to . That works OK if  is in the current folder. But I need  to be in a different folder which is used by all of my scripts.I have tried a few approaches but none would find this.py. One approach was to set my Windows CMD PATH.Can someone tell me how to set the search path for imports?
