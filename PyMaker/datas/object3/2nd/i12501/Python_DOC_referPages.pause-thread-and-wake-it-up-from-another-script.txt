I want a thread to wait for a message from another script.I don't want to use  as it creates time gaps and if I need my thread to wake up and continue running, it might delay too much and I'm aiming for fastest performance. I don't won't to use  because it will eat up my CPU and I'm also aiming to keep my CPU usage as low as possible (as there will be more thread doing the same at the same time).In Pseudo-code it should look like this:The purpose of this is to use data that wasn't available before being called, there is a script that checks for the data availability (a single thread running) and many which await for the data they need to be available (the single script checks it, and should call them if the data is available). It's kind of like  in c++, only I want my other, external script to be able to wake the awaiting script.How can I achieve something like this? What should  contain?
If you have two different scripts, probably the best thing to use is . Here's an example of what I mean:This allows the caller to actually communicate information with the runner. You could also set it up to listen for multiple incoming connections and toss them in the pool to  from, if that's something that you need.But if you really just want to block until another program calls you, then you could make this even more simple by removing the parts between  and  (other than your own work, of course).
