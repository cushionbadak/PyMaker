the instructions are: write a simple python program that is controlled by a while loop. The sentry variable must evaluate to something other than true or false. There must be an indication of whether the loop is continued or if it is exited. I am having trouble understanding the part that says "sentry variable must evaluate to something other than true or false". I thought that all while loops evaluate to true or false.
Are you looking for something like this? The code below evaluates if the variable "i" is equalled to 100 and if it isn't, re-iterate over the loop adding one to the counter. It indicates if it is currently in the loop or if the loop is broken.   
Try something like this:It the sentry variable, myList, is list and will allow the loop to continue executing until it is empty.   Note that pop will remove the last element from the list at each iteration of the loop.
