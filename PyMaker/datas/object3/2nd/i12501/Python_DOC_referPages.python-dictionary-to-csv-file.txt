I am writing the contents of a dictionary to a csv file. The k,v pairs of my dictionary are {int: list of ints}. I am seeing a funny thing when it is written to the file  => when the size of the list is one, it prints as a list. When the size of the list is greater, it prints as a string (in double-quotes). Here is an example output (as seen in the output csv file):I use the following code to write to a file:I am positive that all values are list of integers.I create the dictionary this way (for brevity, I have shortened the code):What could be going wrong? I tried to print the dict values at all stages...and they are just lists. Not sure how they are being transformed to strings. I just do not want the double-quotes in my output csvfile.Any help is appreciated. 
The lists being sent to the csv file as string representations of lists.  When there is more than one item in a list it needs to be quoted in the csv file so the commas that delimit the items in the list are not mistaken for the commas that delimit the fields in the csv file.  The only datatype in a csv file is string.  If you reread that csv file back into python using the csv module, you will get back  as the value for row 2 and  for row 3.If you would like to avoid having your lists quoted you could use a different delimiter by setting the  argument when creating your csv file.  Tab delimited () might work nicely here.
the dictToCsv need to be fixed this way this will produce a csv file that looks like:First element of each line is the key, subsequent elements are the associated list values
