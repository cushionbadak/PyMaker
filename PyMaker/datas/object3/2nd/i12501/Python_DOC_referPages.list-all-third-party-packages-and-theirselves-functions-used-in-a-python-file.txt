I have many python packages, wrote by my colleagues and I want to write a tool to check which third packages they rely on. Like this and the tool should work like this I have no idea how to do that, all I can come up implementation of this tool is read a Python file line by one line as string, and use regex to compare it.Could you give me some advises?If you don't know what I mean, please comment your question, I will fix it as soon as possible. Thanks!
You can parse your files with the  module and check all  and  statements.To give you an idea, here's an example:Your script could work like this:Parse the source file via Visit each node using If a node is an  or  object, then inspect the names and do what you have to do.Using  is way much easier and more robust than regular expressions or a custom parser.
