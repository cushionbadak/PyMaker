I have a relatively simple class which just changes the values of variables depending on the state.Initially I was calling the function within the class like so:After realizing I need to initialize it now looks like this.But am now receiving an error specifying that it has been given 1 argument but expected 0. I am almost certain I am missing something very trivial. If someone could clear this up it would be great, thanks 
Class methods (that is to say: any  block defined inside a class definition) automatically get passed the instance caller as their first argument (unless it's defined as a  but let's not muddy the waters). Since your function definition for  doesn't include any arguments, Python complains that you gave it an argument () that it doesn't know what to do with.As @BrenBarn mentions in the comments, your class doesn't make a whole lot of sense from a design perspective if it's just modifying global state, but that's the reason for the error anyway. If you really need this (hint: you don't) you should consider wrapping it in a module, importing the module, and defining all your  functions at the top-level of that module.Â
