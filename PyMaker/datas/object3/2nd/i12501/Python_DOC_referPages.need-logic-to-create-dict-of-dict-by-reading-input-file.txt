I have a configuration file which contains these lines: My script should read from the configuration file and create a dictionary of dictionaries in the same format. Based on this dictionary I can proceed further with my automation.
To solve your problem you need a parser. There are various libraries that can be used for parsing in Python, see Python parsing tools by SO veteran Ned Batchelder for a list of what's available.However, your data format isn't too complicated, so it's easy enough to write a simple parser that doesn't rely on any 3rd-party modules. To break the data up into individual tokens (aka lexical analysis) we can use the standard shlex module.The code below implements a very simple recursive decent parser. It was developed & tested on Python 2.6.6, but it should function correctly on Python 3. You might like to encapsulate it by putting it into a class. IMHO that's probably not really necessary, but I guess that depends on your actual use case.This code uses the  module to print the parsed dictionary; that's not strictly necessary, but it does make it easy to print nested dictionaries nicely.The code incorporates some error checking, but it can easily be fooled into accepting weird data, so you may wish to enhance the error checking if you can't guarantee that the input data will always be correct. output 
I'm not sure why you'd want to do that, but may I suggest JSON?Try this, save your document (dictionary) as a valid .json file and in python just do thisThe data variable should have the same data structure that is stored. If you want something more complex like saving Objects, try pickle https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html
This pyparsing code will parse your config entry into a mapping you can use like a dict or an object:prints:Note that those values that are valid floats or ints will have already been converted from strings as part of the parsing process.
