As in title, how can I sort objects by single criterion?I've heard about  parameter,  parameter, and Decorate-Sort-Undecorate pattern.Which one should I use in modern Python, and how?
In modern Python, the best way is to use  or  with  argument.When you pass  argument, sorting function, instead of comparing elements directly, compares whatever  returned for them.So, you can pass as  any callable that takes element to be sorted as single positional argument, and returns what the element should be sorted by.The callable will be called once for each element.Some simple examples:Sorting with  is roughly equivalent to Decorate-Sort-Undecorate pattern:This creates temporary list () of 3-element tuples,which have form: , where . Then,  list is sorted.Tuples are compared by first non-equal element. This is , or if s are equal, . Because there are no equal indexes, elements are never directly compared.At the end, elements are extracted from  into new list, which is returned.Random thoughts:Order of sorted elements can be reversed using ,s and functions from  module are often passed as ,before 2.4, there were no  parameter. There were only Decorate-Sort-Undecorate pattern and slow  parameter,Sorting a Python list by two criteria.
