I iterate results from SQLThe row has more than three elements.Is there a way to do that in a single line:?
If you want your row with a "readable" mapping, you could map the results using a mapping list and the function zip. The mapping specifies how the n-th entry in row is labeled.That way you can map as many items as you want to a dict and use itAs a guess, I would bet that the SQL framework you are using also provides some methods to return the resulting rows as dicts with their corresponding field names as keys. Which framework are you using?Also if you want your values in variables, you can slice the row. This allows you to only assign the first n values.
