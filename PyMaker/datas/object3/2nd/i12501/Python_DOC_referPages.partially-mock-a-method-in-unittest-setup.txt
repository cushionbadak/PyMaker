I am trying to understand the mock/patch framework, but have a problem. Here are my simplified codes:Essentially I want to mock only  inside the test, but not . I got some idea from https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock-examples.html#partial-mocking, but  is still not mocked. Thank you!
In the example that you linked the key problem is Unfortunately  is written in CThat is why you need to mock the module and wrap what you don't want to mock (You cannot patch C methods directly).Is all other cases (patch python objects) you can use just :Anyway take care that your patch will be active just in the  context, out of it you will find the original reference. To have a better control of the context it you can use also decorators,  and .I strongly encourage you read carefully  and where to patch.
