I am learning python and I have as simple list as thisand I am just trying to unpack it, which throws me syntax error.I tried changing the order of variable as well but same error. Any suggestion pls.
What your are trying to do does not work in Python2 because it does not have support for extended tuple unpacking - you pretty much have to use slicing. Using Python3, you are allowed one wildcard:Demo:Python3.5 comes with some additional unpacking generalizations
Here is a quote from PEP-3132For example, if seq is a slicable sequence, all the following  assignments are equivalent if seq has at least three elements:In Python2.7, only the first version is legal syntax.Since you already know  is a list, you can just writeThis will work for Python2.7 and Python3.x
