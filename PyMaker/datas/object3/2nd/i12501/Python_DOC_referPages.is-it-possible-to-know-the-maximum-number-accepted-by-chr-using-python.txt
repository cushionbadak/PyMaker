From the Python's documentation of the  built-in function, the maximum value that  accepts is 1114111 (in decimal) or 0x10FFFF (in base 16). And in factMy first question is the following, why exactly that number? The second question is: if this number changes, is it possible to know from a Python command the maximum value accepted by ?
Use :An integer giving the value of the largest Unicode code point, i.e.  ( in hexadecimal).On my Python 2.7 UCS-2 build the maximum Unicode character supported by  is 0xFFFF:but Python 3.3 and newer switched to a new internal storage format for Unicode strings, and the maximum is now always . See PEP 393. is the maximum Unicode codepoint as defined in the Unicode standard. Quoting the Wikipedia article on Unicode:Unicode defines a codespace of 1,114,112 code points in the range 0 to 10FFFF.
