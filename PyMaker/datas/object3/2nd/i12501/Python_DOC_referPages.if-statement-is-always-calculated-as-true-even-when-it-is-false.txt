I have the following loop:where: is a dictionary in the form of and  and  are dictionaries in the form of .Â The loop always returns  regardless of whether  is in  or not, but doesn't if  is not . I have been trying to figure this out for quite a while but cannot seem to spot where I have gone wrong.EDIT:I have also tried:which acts the same way.
After much stress, I found the simple reason behind my error and I am kicking myself for missing it...What my loop was supposed to be doing is making sure that ALL  are not in . Of course, it was evaluating as true nearly every time because there was a much higher probability that the first  checked was not in  and so the statement is true and  is returned after only checking one .
