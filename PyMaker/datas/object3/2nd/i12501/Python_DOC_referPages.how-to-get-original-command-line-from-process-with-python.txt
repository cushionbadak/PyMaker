This question already has an answer here:What's the reverse of shlex.split?                    4 answers                I wish to get the original command line for a process as in , I've tried to use  but it provides parameters tokenized, which I'm not interested into, and joining them doesn't produce the expected result all the time, as can be seen from result's second print.Is there a way to achieve this preferably in a portable way (maybe using other library or doing it differently)?EDITThis is for sake of comparison with an already stored command. Another solution to my problem could be that just  would be ok if I could get the static command string () without the quotes that are around args to do the comparison. Meaning, if there were a function that did the shell param tokenization that psutil is doing, it would solve my command comparison problem.
Using shlex.quote will reassemble the array into a shell command line, writing spaces and other special characters. 
With some work you could use Lib/pipes in 2.7. https://docs.python.org/2/library/pipes.html
