I have a serializer with an create() function. When I do a POST request, then I want to get this function called and create a new object. When I do it in the browser, it works and it also calls the function. But inside the test, it says that the function is not called. I think that I have done something wrong with the patch, because in the API it is only set as an serializer_class and the class is likely called somewhere inside the framework. Another thought was, that I do not need to test this, because it should be guaranteed by the rest_framework, that if I do it this way, the framework should call the function with the correct parameters.
Your current code is mocking the entire Serializer object, which is probably overkill and could stop the create method ever being called if it's expected to be called by internal logic on the serializer.Instead you want to just patch a single method - like this:Now your test method receives the MagicMock object instance that has replaced the create method.So your test method becomes:
