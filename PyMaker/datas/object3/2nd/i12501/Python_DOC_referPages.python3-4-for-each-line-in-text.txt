Natural Text
I have this code:It prints the line where "Hello, its me" is. I would like to be able to print the next line, and the line after this one. How can I print the next x each lines and maybe the x lines before that?Would there be a way to print the last 2 sentences? Sentences are seperated with a "."
You can use the built-in :Note that the empty string in  is important - it helps to avoid the  exception being raised in case we are at the end of the file.
