Natural Text
I am in need of some help, I'm currently doing an online python course and i can seem to get the desire result to complete the assignment.basically, there is a text document which i need to call by using "raw_input" i then use"open()" function and then i have an empty "list()"Now i run a "for" loop for each line in my .txt doc, i need to "r.strip()" all the white space, which leaves me with a 4 live .txt document ( .txt file will be at the bottom of the ask ) now i have to ".split()" those lines into words. now from the i need to loops through those words and ".append()" each word that isnt already in the list, then ".sort()" then print ... hopefully by that stage it looks as the desired output.Just to make me feel a little better this is the first time im doing any sort of coding. so if you could explain where and why im going wrong that would be great.CODE SO FAR - currently produces an error.TXT DOCUMENTp.s - Theres no point in changing the .txt to one line because the code it wont work in the grader. Ive tried (got the desired output, wrong code)Please, you help would be greatly appreciated.if there is anymore info you need, ill try provide it.
This will read the file, add words to list, sort the list, and then print it. will add the  into the list . will sort the list  alphabetically.Check out the document => Lists
use with keyword as it's a better practice as it would close your file after operation.and for the unique portion use set() which only accepts unique elements
You could also make use of  which is like a list but without duplicates. This means you don't have to check for duplicates yourself, since  will do it for you auto-magically.eg:
Try list comprehension to generate list, use set to remove duplicate entry
