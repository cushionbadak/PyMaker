I have a list of integers called shoesizes and quantities. The integers in the shoesizes list act like bins which have a quantity (in the same index) in the quantities list. I want to reorganise the lists so that I have the shoesizes in ascending order with all the quantities for each shoesize summed together.So the desired output would be:
Since you need to sort anyway,  can be used to do this pretty nicely:Which outputs:It's also possible to do this with  (or just ), then sorting the  of the ; unless the number of bins is huge, the performance differences are unlikely to matter; if you didn't want to sort in the first place though,  makes more sense by avoiding the sort entirely. Example code:
You're creating a dictionary-like structure with duplicate keys. I would accumulate the values like so:
