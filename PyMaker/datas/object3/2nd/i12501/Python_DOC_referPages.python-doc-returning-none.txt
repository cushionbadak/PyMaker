Just recently I have been getting very a bizarre issue, which I have found no resolve to. For example, if I run the following code in the interpreterI get 'docstring,' no surprise there. Now if I run this in a *.py file, I get None.I have tried multiple files with the same results; but why does the interpreter return the docstring and not any files? Any help would most certainly be appreciated.Note: I have tried triple quotes, double and single, and any other variation I can muster, with no luck.Solved:Not sure how exactly, but the command I was using was 'broken' in that shell instance. Working fine now
The docstrings are stripped if you run the interpreter with the  switch:    Discard docstrings in addition to the  optimizations.This can be also controlled by the  environment variable:If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying the  option. If set to an integer, it is equivalent to  specifying  multiple times.Thus you could get this effect if you had a Python wrapper that specified , or  was set to say .However, this setting should also apply to the interactive interpreter:You can test the optimization settings at runtime via :If this number is greater than or equal to 2, then that is why your docstrings are gone.
