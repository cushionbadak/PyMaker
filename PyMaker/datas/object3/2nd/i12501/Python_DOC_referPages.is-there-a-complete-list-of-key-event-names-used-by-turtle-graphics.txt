While playing around with Python's Turtle module, I used some key events as the official documentation states:Parameters: – a function with no arguments or None – a string: key (e.g. “a”) or key-symbol (e.g. “space”)Now the interesting thing is that when you call 1) the  method and pass a not registered string (like an empty one (), or , etc.) as  parameter:No matter what key is pressed by the user, the program outputs "", which was by the way the problem in this question.Unfortunately I can't find more information about this behavior in the documentation ore elsewhere on the internet. So I wonder if there is a complete list of all supported key-name-strings used to program key events?1) The basic setup used in the question:
I scanned through the  source and came to the same conclusion as mgc, that the keys are part of , not . Not wanting to read through the entire  source, I did some googling and found this full list of keysyms in the Tk docs, as well as this abbreviated list for Latin-1 keyboards (it is missing the individual letters, but they are also valid key identifiers, such as ). I'm not sure if they are case-sensitive or not, so you'll have to do some experimentation.
