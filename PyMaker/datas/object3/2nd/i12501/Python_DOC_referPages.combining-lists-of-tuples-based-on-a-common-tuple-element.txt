Consider two lists of tuples:Where Each tuple contains two elements:list of some strings (i.e )A common element for  and : strings , , and so on.I would like to combine them into following:Does anyone know how I can do this?  
You can use  function and a list comprehension:
@Kasramvd's solution is good if the order is the same among all elements in the  lists. If they are not, it doesn't take that into account.A solution that does, utilizes a :In order to get a list of it, simply wrap it in a  call:
We can do this in a single comprehension expression, using the reduce functionIf the lists are large, so that  imposes a severe time or memory penalty, it might be better to pre-compute itThis solution does not rely on all "keys" occurring in both lists, or the order being the same.If returned order is important, we can even doto ensure that the order is the same as in the original lists.  Again, pre-computing  gives
