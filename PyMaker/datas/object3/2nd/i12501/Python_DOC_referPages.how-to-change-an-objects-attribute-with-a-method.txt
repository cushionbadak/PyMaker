I have this code that stores a person's name, age and funds. I am trying to write a method that can take "age" or "funds", along with a number, and increase the given attribute by that number. works fine: calling it increases the age of Andrea to 33, just as expected. However,  gives an error, saying .  gives similar results.If I just say  (without the quotes) I get a NameError, which is what I expected.By my understanding, giving the parameter  to  should mean that the  mentioned becomes , so that  references  instead of . Apparently, I was wrong.Now, I could just use  instead, but then I'd have to make different methods for age and funds, and even more methods once I add other features to , like location, gender, and nationality.What do I need to do so that I can pass the name of an attribute to a method and have it change that attribute?
