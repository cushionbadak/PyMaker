I would like to derive from dict and overwrite the method missing. I would like to do some stuff and then still call its super function. Something like this:Which however produces: Of course I could still make a working program using:But I would much rather call the super function. Because code could (or maybe at a future version of python will be) executed in  other than raising the KeyError.
There is no ; just drop the call to  (and raise a ). The method is optional and has no default implementation.Alternatively, if you want to support multiple inheritance properly, you could catch the  exception:
subclass from  which already features a missing method.https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict(key)If the  attribute is , this raises a  exception with the key as argument.If default_factory is not , it is called without arguments to  provide a default value for the given key, this value is inserted in  the dictionary for the key, and returned.If calling  raises an exception this exception is  propagated unchanged.This method is called by the  method of the dict class  when the requested key is not found; whatever it returns or raises is  then returned or raised by .Note that  is not called for any operations besides  . This means that  will, like normal dictionaries, return  as a default rather than using .
