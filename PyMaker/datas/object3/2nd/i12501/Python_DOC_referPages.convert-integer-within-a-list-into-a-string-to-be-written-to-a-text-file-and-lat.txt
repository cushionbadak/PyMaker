Natural Text
I am trying to make a  file where I can store , , and . Thus far, the only way I have been able to retrieve the values AND modify them when the program runs is by opening them with  and then assigning them to a variable as an integer within a list (see below).My issue is that I can't seem to find a way to write them back to a text file as they are in list form. Can anyone point me in the right direction?The text file is in this format:Nothing else is written in it other that the three 0's, followed by My code is as follows:If I assign these without  output becomes:  when printed, and I can't modify the values with +1.My result is:I cannot get this to convert to string, and write in in such a way that it will be retrieved in the same format as I need it to be as to be able to process i every time the program runs.I'd rather just import the values in the text file as integers, modify them, then write them as integers, but I haven't found a way to do that yet. I know there must be better ways to do the above.
You should use  instead of  in this case.  split the string by empty letters (spaces, newlines, tabs, etc.) and return a list.However, it looks like that you don't need a list here and just want remove that , then, you can use . Which removes the empty letters after and before the string.Demo:Then, it's an int object. So you can just totally drop these list comprehension and use . However, you can just use  function to convert it to a string object when you write it back to a file. Remember also add a  if you don't want them all in one line:
You want to use  instead of  to write an iterable object (such as a list of strings), similar to how the method for obtaining a single string is  and the method to get a list of strings is .
