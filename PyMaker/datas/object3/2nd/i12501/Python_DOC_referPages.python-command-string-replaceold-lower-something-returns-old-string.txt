Natural Text
This is a string I would like to replace the lowercase letters to a certain uppercase letter, say, 'C'. the command I am using is : problem:the resulting string is still the same as the old one, b is 'b' and not 'C'
Your condition is too complex for simple "replace" method. Use regexp instead:It will print "GCHMCLYELCASNFECHVAQG"[a-z] means "any letter from a to z" - add extra lower letters for it for your language, if needed. For example, for russian this pattern will be: [a-zа-я]
Currently, you're trying to replace a lowercase copy of the entire string with . You're also seemingly not assigning the result of  with anything, which won't work.  doesn't modify in place, it returns a new copy of the string with the replacements applied.You'll need to iterate over the string and replace any lowercase letters.
Will replace with 'C' only the whole string If you want to substitute all the characters with a given property in a string what I suggest is to use regular expressions, in your case it will be:
 is equal toSo  searches string c1 for any occurances of that whole string of lower case characters, and if it finds any then it replaces each one with .Note that  is also a method on strings themselves ever since Python 2.0 or so,  would do the exact same thing.You can use a translation table:Maketrans takes two strings of characters with equal lengths, and translate() then translates each occurence of a character in the first to its equivalent in the second. is , and 'C' * len(lowercase) is simply a string of 26 Cs.
