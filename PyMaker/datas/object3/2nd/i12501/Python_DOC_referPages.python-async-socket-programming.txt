Now I have two threads, thread 1 is main thread and thread 2 is a task thread.I need thread 2 to do all the network issues, so I put all the sockets in thread 2 and set them to no-blocking. Thread 1 is used to push request to thread 2 to do the job.At first i write something like this:Obviously,when there are no requests and tasks,thread 2 will waste cpu.I don't want use sleep(),because when thread 2 is sleeping,it can't handle requests in time.Then I think maybe I should change the request_queue to a local host socket,like this:But this looks like a little tricky,I don't know whether this is a good way or not.All I want is thread 2 can handle request in time, don not waste cpu time and process socket events in the same time. Anyone can help?
For async networking look to Tornado, Twisted or Gevent. Also this article may be usefull for you.Example with Gevent:And Celery is most appropriate for background job execution.
