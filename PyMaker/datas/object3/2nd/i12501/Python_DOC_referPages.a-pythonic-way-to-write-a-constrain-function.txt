What's the best way of writing a constrain function? or is there already a builtin python function that does this?Option 1: Option 2:
I do not know if this is the more "pythonic", but you can use built-in  and  like this:
In case you need to do this for a lot of numbers (arrays full of them), you should probably be using Numpy, which has a built-in clip function. For simple Python programs, go with Delgan's answer.
If you can process a bunch of values at a time, you might try a list comprehension:or even NumPy:
