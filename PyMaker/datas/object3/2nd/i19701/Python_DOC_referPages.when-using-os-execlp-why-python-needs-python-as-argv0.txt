The code is like this:I read this question: execlp() in pythonBut I'm still confused. The answer said:The first argument is the program to execute (found on the PATH). The  rest are the sys.argv arguments to the program.However, if I run:  and  the  of this process would be , where the  doesn't exist. Then why should I add  as the second parameter of ?
When python is executed, it creates  for you. The values in that list are based on the arguments passed to it by the operating system, but it leaves off the  value from that list.In other words, when Python is invoked, it sets  to everything but it's own executable.When you invoke a new executable via , you still need to include Python in that as that is what executable that the OS will run. The first two values of what you a pass to  are still required, whatever you find in  later on.
The second python is a name for python, it can be any string, but it has to be there. See the second paragrph of http://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html?highlight=os.exec#process-management
