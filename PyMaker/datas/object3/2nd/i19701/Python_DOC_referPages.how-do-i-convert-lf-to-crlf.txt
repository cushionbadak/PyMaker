Natural Text
I found a list of the majority of English words online, but the line breaks are of unix-style (encoded in Unicode: UTF-8). I found it on this website: http://dreamsteep.com/projects/the-english-open-word-list.htmlHow do I convert the line breaks to CRLF so I can iterate over them? The program I will be using them in goes through each line in the file, so the words have to be one per line.This is a portion of the file: It should be:How can I convert my files to this type? Note: it's 26 files (one per letter) with 80,000 words or so in total (so the program should be very fast).I don't know where to start because I've never worked with unicode. Thanks in advance!Using  as the parameter (as suggested), with this in my code:I get this error:Can anyone help me with this?
Instead of converting, you should be able to just open the file using Python's universal newline support:(Note the .)
You can use the replace method of strings. Like  EDIT :in your case :
You don't need to convert the line endings in the files in order to be able to iterate over them. As suggested by NPE, simply use python's universal newlines mode. The UnicodeDecodeError happens because the files you are processing are encoded as UTF-8 and when you attempt to decode the contents from bytes to a string, via , Python is using the  encoding to convert the bytes read from the file into a Python 3 string (i.e. a sequence of unicode code points). However, there are bytes in those files that cannot be decoded with the  encoding and that causes a UnicodeDecodeError.If you change  to  you should no longer get the UnicodeDecodeError.
