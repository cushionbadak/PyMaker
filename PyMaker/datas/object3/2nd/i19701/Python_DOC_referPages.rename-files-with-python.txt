I am trying to use python to rename over 1000 files in a windows directory that have this naming convention:The desired naming convention is: The only important things I need from the original name are the title and date....I have tried using different variations of string manipulation and I am not getting anywhere. I need help getting started.I understand I should use the os module to rename files, but what procedure should I try and use to do this task?Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
This function should do exactly what you want, you just need to feed it the names.Note: you probably want to add a file extension on to the filename, otherwise it might go wonky and everything.If you run this on the same file more than once, you'll get a file overloaded with braces, and you don't want that, so here's a reversal function:That should give you the proper filename again.
To rename files, use ; to iterate through a directory, use  or .
It looks like the general format of your titles is:in which case I would do this (not tested):
If the original naming convention is consistent, you could split the original filename string on the '.' character, and then look for a valid year, add the braces, and join it with all the preceding tokens to form the new name.See this question for how to rename a file using python.
