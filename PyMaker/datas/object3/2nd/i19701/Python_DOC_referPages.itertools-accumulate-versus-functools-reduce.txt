In Python 3.3, , which normally repeatedly applies an addition operation to the supplied iterable, can now take a function argument as a parameter; this means it now overlaps with . With a cursory look, the main differences between the two now would seem to be: defaults to summing but doesn't let you supply an extra initial condition explicitly while  doesn't default to any method but does let you supply an initial condition for use with 1/0-element sequences, and takes the iterable first while  takes the function first.Are there any other differences between the two? Or is this just a matter of behavior of two functions with initially distinct uses beginning to converge over time?
It seems that  keeps the previous results, whereas  (which is known as fold in other languages) does not necessarily.e.g.  would return  whereas a plain fold would return Also (just for fun, don't do this) you can define  in terms of 
You can see in the documentation what the difference is.   returns a single result, the sum, product, etc., of the sequence.   returns an iterator over all the intermediate results.  Basically,  returns an iterator over the results of each step of the  operation.
 is like  but returns a generator* instead of a value. This generator can give you all the intermediate step values. So basically reduce gives you the last element of what accumulate will give you. *A generator is like an iterator but can be iterated over only once.
