I have a code such that:And output:Why in the latter case I see a character code, instead of the character?How I can transform Byte string to Unicode string that in case of an output I saw the character, instead of its code?
In strings (or Unicode objects in Python 2),  has a special meaning, namely saying, "here comes a Unicode character specified by it's Unicode ID". Hence  will result in the character Ð².The  prefix tells you this is a sequence of 8-bit bytes, and bytes object has no Unicode characters, so the  code has no special meaning. Hence,  is just the sequence of the bytes ,,,, and .Essentially you have an 8-bit string containing not a Unicode character, but the specification of a Unicode character.You can convert this specification using the unicode escape encoder.
Loved Lennart's answer. It put me on the right track for solving the particular problem I had faced. What I added was the ability to produce html-compatible code for \u???? specifications in strings. Basically, only one line was needed:This all came about from a need to convert JSON results to something that displays well in a browser. Here is some test code that is integrated with a cloud application:
