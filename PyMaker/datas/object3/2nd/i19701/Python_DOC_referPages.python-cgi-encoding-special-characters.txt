This prints "Test: Â£17" when run from the local console, but only prints "Test: " when run from the web browser. How can I rectify the issue when loaded through the browser? Thanks!
Python will encode unicode values to bytes when printing to the console. Encode explicitly when sending to a browser, by writing directly to :Note that HTTP headers should use a  (carriage return, newline) combo, really. I've also added the encoding used to the  header so the browser knows how to decode it again.For HTML, you really want to use character entity references instead of Unicode code points:at which point you could also just use ASCII as your encoding.If you really, really, really want to use , then re-open  with the correct encoding:You could simplify that somewhat with :then use  without the extra keywords:Also see the Python Unicode HOWTO for details on how Python sets output encoding, as well as this question here on Stack Overflow about printing and encoding.
