What is the quickest and cleanest way to convert an  into a ? For example, change  into  and  into . I have a variable which is an , and I want to be able to compare the individual digits so I thought making it into a list would be best, since I can just do ,  to easily convert the list element back into int for digit operations.
Convert the integer to string first, and then use  to apply  on it:or using a list comprehension:
The shortest and best way is already answered, but the first thing I thought of was the mathematical way, so here it is:It's just another interesting approach, you definitely don't have to use such a thing in practical use cases.
There are already great methods already mentioned on this page, however it does seem a little obscure as to which to use. So I have added some mesurements so you can more easily decide for yourself:A large number has been used (for overhead) Using :Output: Using list comprehension:import timeitOutput: Code taken from this answerThe results show that the first method involving inbuilt methods is much faster than list comprehension.The "mathematical way":Output: Code taken from this answerThe  method (does not provide the right output):Output: Code taken from this answerThe answer by Duberly Gonz√°lez Molinari:Output: Code taken from this answerRemarks:In all cases the  is the fastest method (and is therefore probably the best method to use).  List comprehension is the second fastest (but the method using  is probably the most desirable of the two.Those that reinvent the wheel are interesting but are probably not so desirable in real use.
Use  on a number converted to string:

you can use:First convert the value in a string to iterate it, Them each value can be convert to a Integer 
If you have a string like this: '123456'and you want a list of integers like this: [1,2,3,4,5,6], use this:or if you want a list of strings like this: ['1','2','3','4','5','6'], use this:
It prints  object.
