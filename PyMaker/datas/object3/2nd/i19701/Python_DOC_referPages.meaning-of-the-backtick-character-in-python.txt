I'm just getting started with python. Can somebody interpret line 2 of the following code snippet?  I don't understand the  bit. I tried to replace the backtick character with a single tick , but then it broke. Just a detailed explanation of that line would be great.
Backticks are a deprecated alias for the  builtin function, so the second line is equivalent to the following:This uses a list comprehension to create a list of strings representing numbers, and then uses  to combine that list of strings into a single string, so this is equivalent to the following:Note that I used  here to be consistent with the backticks, but you will usually see  to get the string representation of an int (they happen to be equivalent).
 iterates over all numbers from zero up to and excluding 1,000,000 in backticks converts each number to string using the  function. merges all those strings into one without any separators between them. stores the result in .
