My goal is to create a hollow diamond using python.Sample input:Sample output:But so far, I have the following code that is not working right. Please help me to modify the code to achieve the goal above:The code above return a result that is very far from my goal.I am actually converting the code from this post: http://www.programmingsimplified.com/c/source-code/c-program-print-diamond-pattern  written in C language and will modify later for the hollow one but I can't get it... There is something wrong with my conversion..
Your problem is that you keep using . The print statement (and the function in Python 3) will add a line-break after what you printed, unless you explicitely tell it not to. You can do that in Python 2 like this:Or in Python 3 (with the print function) like this:My solutionI took my own take at the problem and came up with this solution:
A Hollow diamond is the solution to the equationon an integer grid. So Hollow diamond as a 1-liner:

this is not pretty, but its a function that does what you want: first i check to make sure its an odd number,then i create a list of the lines from the center downwards.then i create the last point.then i return them as as a string, with a mirror of the bottom on top without the center line.output:
Made it in one single loop ;) 
The previous answer has got two corrections, which've been done here :Note : Now this works for both python 2.5x and python 3.xIf you wish to know the difference in the two answers, then google it!
