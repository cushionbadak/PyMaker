I'm working on creating a word cloud program in Python and I'm getting stuck on a word replace function. I am trying to replace a set of numbers in an html file (so I'm working with a string) with words from an ordered list. So 000 would be replaced with the first word in the list, 001 with the second, etc.This method below works when moving through a relatively simple string:I am working my way through a html file (I put a portion of the file in a string below) and instead of replacing each instance of 000,001,002, etc. with successive items in the list it replaces all of the numbers with the first item. Why does this method work on the above string but not with the one below. Any help is appreciated.  Thanks!
Something like that is much better written as (for your non-HTML):
Unfortunately, your approach is completely wrong for these sort of problems as they are good candidates for Template Engines.You can experiment with number of available template engine or I can suggest Jinja2 which will serve your purposeHere is an example with Jinja2
