You could use :
Using csv.writer in my very large list took quite a time. I decided to use pandas, it was faster and more easy to control and understand:The good part you can change somethings to make a better csv file:
If for whatever reason you wanted to do it manually (without using a module like ,, etc.):Of course, rolling your own version can be error-prone and inefficient ... that's usually why there's a module for that. But sometimes writing your own can help you understand how they work, and sometimes it's just easier.
Ambers's solution also works well for numpy arrays:
Make sure to indicate  when create the writer; otherwise, an extra empty line might be written into file after each data line when data sources are from other csv file...Here is my solution:
How about dumping the list of list into pickle and restoring it with pickle module? It's quite convenient.
