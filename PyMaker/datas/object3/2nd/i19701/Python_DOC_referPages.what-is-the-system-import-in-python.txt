Long story short, a piece of code that I'm working with at work has the line:with a later bit of code of: is an XML parser in Java (it's included in a different import), but I don't get what the  bit is doing. I mean obviously, it somehow holds the feature that we're trying to pull out, but I don't entirely see where. Is  a standard library in Python or Java, or am I looking at something custom?Unfortunately, everyone else in my group is out for Christmas Eve vacation, so I can't ask them directly. Thank you for your help. I'm still not horribly familiar with Python.
This isn't from the standard library, so you'll need to check your system (Python has plenty of introspection to help you with that).You can tell as Python modules in the standard library use lowercase names as per PEP-8, or by searching the library reference.Note as well that Python has it's own XML parsing tools that will be much nicer to work with in Python than Java's.Edit: As you have noted in the comments you are using Jython, it seems likely this is Java's  package.
millimoose indicated the correct answer in his comment, but neglected to submit it as an answer, so I'm posting to indicate the correct answer. It was indeed a custom module built by my company. I was able to determine this by typing  into the interpreter.
