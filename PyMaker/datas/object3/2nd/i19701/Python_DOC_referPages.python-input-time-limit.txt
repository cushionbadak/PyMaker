I have a homework assignment to do and I really need a solution. I have been trying to do this since yesterday but I do not know how.Program has to generate and print a letter or a number and then a user has to type it as quickly as possible and press ENTER. The game is over after 30 secs.Well I do not know how to put time limit to a game. I was searching through stackoverflow and I did not find anything useful. Please help me.**Here it is what I have done so far. I tried code from the answer by SYSS.STDER, but it does not quite work because when the 30 secs are over, the game should also be over, but here in this code the game is over when I type last character. LOOP WILL NOT STOP UNTIL IT FINISHES AND WE DISCOVER THAT WE ARE PAST OUR DEADLINE. THE TASK NEEDS TO BE INTERRUPTED IN PROGRESS AS SOON AS THE TIME ELAPSES.
Here's my way to do it:
Since you're using Windows you can use the  function to check for keypresses inside timing loops:
use "timeit" module available in python for better result.
