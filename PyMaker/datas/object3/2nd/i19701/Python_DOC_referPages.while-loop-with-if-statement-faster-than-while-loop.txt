I am doing some testing regarding the speed of if-statements in loops and their effect on speed. Something I found was that consistently, the if-statement improved performance. My code:A sample output would be:Which is completely counter-intuitive. The while-if-loop is working ever-so-slightly faster than the standard while-loop. This happens almost every time I run it; perhaps 1 in 20 times take longer. Does anyone know why?
I'd guess that the compiler would remove the if True block since it is constant.When I run I get mostly the opposite results from you.  I may just be random effects of the execution environment.1355519587.20.8327970504761.043823957441355519590.030.8638999462131.093472003941355519593.720.8316550254821.053898096081355519599.710.8314521312711.417834997181355519602.990.8152809143071.057243108751355519605.720.8264040946961.057004928591355519608.940.8272969722751.07807898521
The dis shows that there are more steps to the if statement while loop.
