I have a [program:x] running and it prints / sys.stdout.writes a lot of things. None of which comes up in either in the AUTO childlogdir of [supervisord] or in stdout_logfile of [program:x] Am I missing something?How do I capture all that is printed or stdout-ed from [program:x] ?In my program I am explicitly doing both,Relevant supervisord.conf file
Python output is buffered. Setting the environment variable  in you  will disable buffering and show log messages sooner:or add the  command-line switch to  command:Alternatively you can flush the  handler explicitly:On python 3.3 and up, you can add the  parameter to have the function do this for you:
You can run your program like this:this will produce unbuffered output
If you have python based script that you can't or don't want to change to flush output on a regular base then you can use unbuffer from the Expect package.For a Django application in a docker container I've lately used it like that (from a shell script run from supervisord):
