Having a list like thiswhere each number denotes the boundary of an interval ( being implicit at the beginning of the list), what is a pythonic way of finding out to which interval a given number  belongs to?So the intervals areIf , then the corresponding interval is , for , it's .
Using the  module of course:The module uses binary search, which requires a sorted sequence. With such a sequence you can divide the sequence in half by picking an index mid-way between the first and last, to see if the value you need is in either half. You then continue dividing the selected half until you found a matching insertion point. That lets you find the insertion point in O(log N) time for a sequence of length N, i.e. very fast.
