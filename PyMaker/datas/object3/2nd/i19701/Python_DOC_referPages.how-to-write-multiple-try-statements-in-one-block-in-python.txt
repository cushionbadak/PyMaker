I want to do:If do() fails, execute do2(), if do2() fails too, exceute do3() and so on.best Regards
I'd write a quick wrapper function  for this. usage: 
If you really don't care about the exceptions, you could loop over cases until you succeed:This at least avoids having to indent once for every case. If the different functions need different arguments you can use functools.partial to 'prime' them before the loop.
It seems like a really odd thing to want to do, but I would probably loop over the functions and break out when there were no exception raised:
You should specify the type of the exception you are trying to catch each time.and so on.
Here is the simplest way I found, just embed the try under the previous except.
