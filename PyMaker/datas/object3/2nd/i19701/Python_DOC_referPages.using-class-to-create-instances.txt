Is it a good idea to use  to create new instances within the class?The following code is an example of doing this:Using the actual class name sounds like duplicated code to me. If the name of the class changes I'd have to change it in all occurrences, even though modern IDE's can do that for you.btw. What kind of variable is ? Shouldn't you only be able to access it with ?
To support the zero-argument form of , the compiler adds an implicit reference to the class if  or  are being used in a class method. See Creating the class object.The example code you found (ab)uses this little factoid to create new instances of  when adding.Personally, I'd use  instead, as that is the proper API method of determining the type or class of any object.  will use  where appropriate:That is a good idea if you want to support subclassing. Any subclasses of  will return the correct subclassed type when being added together. Using  does not do that, as it will always be pointing to , even for subclasses:Of course, if that was your intention all along (to bypass subclasses), I'd still prefer using the explict class name over using ; explicit is better than implicit.
