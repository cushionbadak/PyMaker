I don't know a lot about Django or Python, but I know it's problematic using a simple for loop in a template.I'm wanting to do the following and wondering my options are - is there a simple way to do this in the template?Then: Thanks,
If  is a list, you are looking for the  filter:If some_list is , the output will be .Of course, on an optimization note, it would generally be better to do this at a view level by not fetching more records than you need.
If you need all the data but want to display it in chunks, you can split up your list like thiswhere n=any number, in your case it would be 10Then all you need to do is loop through the chunked list in the template.
