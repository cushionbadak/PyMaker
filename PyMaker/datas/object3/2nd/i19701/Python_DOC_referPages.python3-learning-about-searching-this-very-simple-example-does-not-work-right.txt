here's the code:for some reason, this doesn't work the way i thought it should work.when i run this, it will say "not found."  however, if i change the value i want to find to the first item in the list, the 3, it comes back as "found."i have tried this with strings, and i get the same results.can someone please tell me what i am doing wrong?
Because if in the first iteration the item doesn't match, you go into the else branch returning "not found", thus exiting the loop.Try this:or simply:
@hyperboreus pointed out the cause of the error (the  branch executing before all items are seen).To find an item in a sorted ("ordered") list you could use  module that performs binary search () instead of linear search  () e.g., for a million items binary search would require around a couple dozen operations against a million operations for the linear search.
