In Python, if I define a list as    xx = [1,2,3,4]then I can reference the data in that (vector) as xx[0] and get 1, xx[1] and get 2, etc.If I have a data file that has csv ... Datafile is -->  xx,1,2,3,4Is there a way for me to read the Datafile, and make that first element of the Datafile (xx) the name of a vector that is [1,2,3,4]?  I would like to be able to be able to see xx[0] as 1, xx[1] as 2, etc.This is all Python lists, not dictionaries - I'd prefer to keep this as simple as possible.
You can do this, but the real question is, should you? The answer is, quite simply, no. Dynamic variable names are a recipe for trouble, and you are much better off using a dictionary. It will make your code simpler, not more complex. One simply does:Use the  module to load in your data, then construct a dictionary. This can be a simple dictionary comprehension:If you really need the order, then you can use  to do the job.Do note that this nice unpacking syntax only works in 3.x, so for 2.x, you will need to do something more along the lines of .
You should start with looking into Python's csv library.
