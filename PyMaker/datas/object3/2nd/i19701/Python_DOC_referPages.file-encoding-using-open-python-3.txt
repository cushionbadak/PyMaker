I have a script which uses open() to create multiple files.All files are created successfully and it seems that there are no problems,but when attempting to run res.py, it crashes displaying following error:When opening file through IDLE, I get 'Specify file encoding' window:This is line 38 of res.py:So, can I set encoding to file during creation, something like this:If not, how can I fix this problem?
This is not a problem with how you open and write files in Python. It's a problem with Python trying to read your python source files. You need to specify an encoding for your source file so that Python can read the  file correctly.You need to figure out what encoding your editor used when writing this file. Add that as a comment to the top of the file (first or second line):See the Unicode Literals in Python Source Code section of the Python Unicode HOWTO.Note that the error message you gave is not complete, the following text is part of that:The linked PEP 263 explains source code encoding in more detail.
