Is it possible to time out python 3 input?  I managed to do what I want in Java, but how can you do it in python?  Can you use jython and manage to compile it so that it doesn't need a jython installation to run (I only have python available on the target computer)?Thanks.EDIT:I was able to throw an error to cause the thread to halt.
I'd post this as a comment if I could...  Look into the datetime module, http://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html - You can use datetime.now() and timedelta to accomplish the same thing as you have above.
