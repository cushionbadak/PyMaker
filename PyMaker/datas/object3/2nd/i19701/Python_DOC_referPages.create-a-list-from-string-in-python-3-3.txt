I have a string like this (with n number of elements):How can I convert it to a list like this? I would like ',' to be a separator.
you mean ? you could just split it like . this also removes the whitespaces after .
You can use  but as others have noted, you'll have to deal with leading and trailing spaces. Possible solutions are:without regex:What I did here is use a list comprehension, in which I created a list whose elements are made from the strings from  by calling the  method on them.This is equivalent towith regex:Also, try not to use  as variable name, because you are thus shadowing the built-in function.You can also just  on , but you have to be absolutely sure there's always a space after the comma (think about linebreaks, etc.)
Use the split function.
If I understand correctly, simply do:You will probably need to trim each resulting string afterwards since  does not care about whitespaces.Regards,Matt
