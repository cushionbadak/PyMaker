 will give you the index of the first time the value is shown in the list, but I am looking for a way  that will return the index of that specific item, regardless of whether it is repeated, for example, if  were to use it like so:would returnAny help appreciated
Are you looking for ?
use enumerate
No, it's not possible for  to know whether to return 0 or 3 depending on which 1 it was called with.  is a primitive type, so any  is just the same as another .As proof, you can use the  operator:So when the hypothetical function  is called, it won't know which  you meant, regardless of how you called it.
