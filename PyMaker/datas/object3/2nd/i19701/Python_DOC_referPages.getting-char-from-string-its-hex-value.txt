Natural Text
I currently get a string as a parameters in my method,i would like to extract the char in the I index and get it's hex value.Currently i'm doing :but i get an error :Any ideas please ?
You need to encode the string to bytes:You'll need to pick a suitable encoding, one that can represent your text properly; I am presuming that your unicode characters fall in the 0-127 range here.If you encode to a different encoding, the result will be a hex representation of that encoding. UTF-8 will use between 1 and 6 bytes per character for example.Alternatively, you could use the  function and format the result to hex:and it'll work with any unicode character. It'll use the Unicode code point for the hex representation, so between 1 and 4 bytes (the latter for  wide characters). Depending on your maximum character width, you may want to pad the bytes to prevent ambiguous code points; say you need to encode up to codepoint  then you'll need to use 2 bytes for every codepoint, or 4 hex characters:
