So, to keep it simple. Ubuntu 12.10 has python 3.2 pre installed and it is linked to "python3". I downloaded python 3.3 and it's command is "python3.3". However, I downloaded pySide for python3 from synaptic. Using "from PySide.QtCore import *" fails on python3.3. BUT, when I ran just "python3" (aka 3.2) everything works fine. Synaptic just installed lib for python3.2 which is default for python3 in ubuntu. How can I force synaptic to install modules for python3.3? Thanks
Try working in a virtual environment with virtualenv. This will keep your python versions/packages separate from each other in case something goes wrong. Use pip to install PySide.EDIT:A possible solution is:To install virtualenv,The page for PySide on PyPi has a guide for different platforms on how to install pyqt with virtualenv. Best of luck.
I think you should install the pyside from its source files that have  and then run the command  and  because if you install by apt for example, it will use the default interpreter which is 3.2 that you mentioned.
