According to what I've read, sys.path should be set by PYTHONPATH. In Python, it works that way, but not in Jython. I can circumvent with  but I'd like to know why Jython isn't playing nicely.
Jython does not use PYTHONPATH: you can see here a discussion.From 2.5 onwards there is a variable that does the same: JYTHONPATH. Before that you can use the trick you already know.Source: Jython and PYTHONPATH
