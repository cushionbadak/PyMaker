I was trying this code as mentioned in docs.python:where  was defined asBut 12,11 and 10 all are two digit numbers. So why is it showing 0-2, 22-24, 29-31?Whats the deal with this output. Whats the benefit if any?
As stated in the doc too:span()    Return a tuple containing the (start, end) positions of the  matchPrefer using  to display match content:
The span maps nicely onto a slice. ie the end index is not included
Looking at the documentation of , , and ,  returns a tuple of the start and end of the match.For MatchObject m, return the 2-tuple (m.start(group), m.end(group)). Note that if group did not contribute to the match, this is (-1, -1). group defaults to zero, the entire match. and  are the indices that indicate where the matched substring exists.Return the indices of the start and end of the substring matched by group; group defaults to zero (meaning the whole matched substring).So  will return just that tuple. If you want to display the actual match, try .
