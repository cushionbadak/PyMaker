I have a script (see below) that checks (more or less) linkpositions on a website, it works fine but as soon as the source url on which the link lies is not a 200 response it will quit, I just want it to jump ahead to the next or give back some message "error" or even better give me back the http status code. I need a quick solution, if anyone can help me that would be super awesome :) = list of websites that contain a link to a certain page = domain for which to check whether a link is there or not and if yes where is it located roughly.Python-Shell
I'm not familiar enough with the lxml.html library to see if you can get anything more detailed about why the URL failed to load.  (Hint -- I would use the "requests" library to load my urls, then pass the results off to the lxml parser.)
