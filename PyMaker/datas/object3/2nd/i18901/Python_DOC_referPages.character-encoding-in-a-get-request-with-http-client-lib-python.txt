Natural Text
I am a beginner in python and I coded this little script to send an HTTP GET request on my local server (localhost). It works great, except that I wish I could send Latin characters such as accents.When I insert the words with accent in my parameter "params", this is the error message that appears:UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character '\xe9' in position 14: ordinal not in range(128)I don't know if there is a solution using http.client library but I think so. When I look in the documentation http.client, I can see this:HTTPConnection.requestStrings are encoded as ISO-8859-1, the default charset for HTTP
