I have an array of integer, and I need to transform it into string.What function can I use for it? I tried with str(), but it returns '1234'. 

You can convert a  of small numbers directly to a :If it is an iterable, it must be an iterable of integers in the range 0 <= x < 256, which are used as the initial contents of the array.And you can convert a  directly to a  (2.x) or  (3.x, or 2.6+).In fact, in 3.x, you can even convert the list straight to  without going through :constructor arguments are interpreted as for bytearray().So:If you really want a string in 3.x, as opposed to a byte string, you need to decode it:See Binary Sequence Types in the docs for more details.
