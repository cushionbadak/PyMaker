I am stuck on this problemGiven an array of ints, return True if the array contains a 2 next to a 2 somewhere.I know the basic idea (there are syntax errors) but I can't implement it. I would also like to know what type of problem this is, eg. graph, search?
In Python 2 use:  if you want a lazy 
I have just corrected your code. It runs in linear time so don't see any reason to work on it further.Here is the running code on codebunk. http://codebunk.com/bunk#-Ivk7Xw2blX3cIWavI17
You can use :
I would do this:This uses a similar idea as the other answers, but works with a generator (as would be preferred in cases like this).

Use  to get both index as well as item, iterating over list only returns it's elements not index.
This uses the idea that  might be faster due to being implemented not in Python.  Didn't measure it, though.Concerning your questions:  Your code suffers from not using  at the  loop init.  The way you put it,  will not be the indexes but the elements of your list.  And it also suffers from using  for comparison (which actually just is assignment).  Use  for comparison.This is not a graph problem, it is a simple search issue.  There are quite nifty  solutions (besides the straight-forward one) for finding strings in strings (what you actually do).


This was the simplest solution I came up with. Using a for loop to check if the iterated number,  "and" the one very next to it,  as well.: this line prevents it from going out of the range through the for loop as the  on the final loop will check out of the range.
Potentially the simplest solution:Suppose . It then follows that . The zip() function, when called as , zips them into an iterator of the same tuples as below:And it should be clear how  is true. This is the same result as .
