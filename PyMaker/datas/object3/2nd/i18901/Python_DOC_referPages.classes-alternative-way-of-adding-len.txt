I am building a string Class that behaves like a regular string class except that the addition operator returns the sum of the lengths of the two strings instead of concatenating them. And then a multiplication operator returns the products of the length of the two strings. So I was planning on doing at least that is what I have for the first part but that is apparently not correct. Can someone help me correct it.
You need to derive from , and you can use  to get the length of the current instance. You also need to give  a parameter for the other operand of the  operator.Demo:
 is not a class. It's not anything*. There is no context where  will work  unless you define . Secondly,  does not have an  parameter.You need to fix both of these issues. You could import a module called , but it's not something that just exists in global scope.
