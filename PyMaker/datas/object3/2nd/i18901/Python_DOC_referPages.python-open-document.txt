Natural Text
I am currently biulding a project in the language python which can open text documents (.txt). However I have come across a problem. I tried to open the document by using the following code:But it's not working.

 is not the contents of the file - it is a file object. You can print the entire contents of the file using ; you can also iterate through it line by line (much more memory efficient):You can find more at the Python Tutorial page on files.
Check out the "with" pattern for working with files, as it handles closing the file nicely as well, even in cases where exceptions cause the halting of the script:more info in the python docs
 is a  i.e sort of a reference to the file that contains other information and not just the contents. There are several way to access the contents of the file.1. Iterate over contentsThe behaviour can sometimes not be what you want. If the file consists of more than one line it will iterate over the lines. If the file contains one line, it iterates over the characters2. Use readline()f is an instance of  which has a readline method. It reads and returns chars until a newline is encountered. There is a  argument for the  function. To read words from the document you could do this: 3. Use read()Reads and returns chars until  is encountered.4. Use readlines()Read and returns a list of lines from the file
Try the following, it should work:
