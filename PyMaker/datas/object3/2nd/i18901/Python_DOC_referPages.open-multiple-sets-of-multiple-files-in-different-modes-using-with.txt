This question is related to this question: How can I open multiple files using "with open" in Python?I could have three sets of files: files1, files2 and file3I can open files1 and files2 for reading and file3 for writing by doing this:In Python 3 (not Python 2), how could I achieve this, if I had hundreds of sets of files?I had a look at the contextlib module, but I'm not sure, how I would do this in the most Pythonic way.http://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.ExitStack
I think the  class you linked to is exactly what you want:This structure will guarantee that all open files will be closed if there is an exception raised at any point, including during the opening of the later files.
