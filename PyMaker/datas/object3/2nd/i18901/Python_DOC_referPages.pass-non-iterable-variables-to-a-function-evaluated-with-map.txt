I am working in python and trying to convert a function with this structure:Into a mapped function:The issue I am having is passing constants through the  function, currently I don't know how to do it. I want this structure so I can easily use the Ipython parallelism tools.Assume:The actual function completion over all iterables takes ~1.5hr (thus the desire for using a parallel  functionThe function is complex and cannot use list comprehensionEssentially, if it wasn't already obvious I am a MATLAB programmer making the leap to python and looking for a good substitute for the  function in matlab. 
For one thing, if you map your function over a , no parameter is an iterable. To your question, you can bind positional parameters (from left to right) to a function using functools.partialFor binding any positional parameter, use a lambda expression like stated in hkpeprah's answer.
If you know the parameters ahead of time, you can use a lambda likeAlternatively, if you don't know the parameters, you could wrap a lambda expression
You could use closures:PS. I'm guessing you're using python 3.x for this, or else xrange + generator comprehension would be much better than range for large values! (equivalent code in 2.7 btw):
