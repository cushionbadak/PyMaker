I use python 3.3.2 on windows everyday, so i added C:\Python33 to my PATH in order to be able to call "python foo.py" from console and get python 3.3.2 to execute it.But sometimes, i also need to use python 2.7. How could i add a "python27" entry to my path, in order to call "python27 bar.py" and get python 2.7 to execute it ?
Run it using pylauncher:Or add at the top of bar.py:then:will use Python 2.7 version. If pylauncher is configured to handle Python scripts; you could just call:Orif .py is in PATHEXT
