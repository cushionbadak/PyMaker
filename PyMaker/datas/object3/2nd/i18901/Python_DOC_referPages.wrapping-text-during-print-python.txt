Natural Text
I am printing a few variables in a row. One of the variables is a very long string that I want to wrap the text (currently it's printing half a word at the end of a line if it has to) so I would like the whole word to start on the next line if all of it will not fit o nthe previous line.For example:I need item.decription to wrap. I can wrap the whole lot if that helpds, but I don't want to end up with characters left on the screen fro mthe wrap operation in any case. I tried:but this doesn't work. The words don't wrap and I get square bracket characters and random commas instead in the output. How should I accomplish what should be a pretty simple wrap?
Use  instead, it joins the lines with newline characters: returns a list of wrapped lines.
