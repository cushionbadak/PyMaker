Natural Text
I would like to count the occurences of missings of every line in a txt file. file:But I would also like to obtain the amount of elements for the first line (assuming this is equal for all lines).The problem is when I try to identify the amount of elements. I did this with the following code:How can I read the first line once without removing it for the further operation?
Try . This will reset the file handle to the beginning of the file.Complete example would then be:Even better would be to read all lines, even the first line, only once, and checking for number of elements only once:BTW: wouldn't the number of elements be ?I'd recommend using , as this also handles tabs, double spaces, leading/trailing spaces etc.
Provided all lines have the number of items you can just count items in the last line:A better way to count is probably:because this also counts items separated with multiple spaces or tabs.
You can also just treat the first line separately
