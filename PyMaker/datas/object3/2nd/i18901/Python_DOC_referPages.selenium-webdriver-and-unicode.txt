It's my 2nd day with Selenium 2 library and the pain with Unicode never seem to subside.I'm just doing the most basic operation, want to print the page source:Sure enough, I get an error:How can I please encode this to  ?
You have options, based on this similar question.You can either convert the source to all ascii losing the Unicode characters in the process.Or, and I think you'll prefer this, you can encode it to utf-8 like this:.
Instead of , use  to return a printable representation of the object.
