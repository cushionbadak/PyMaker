Output:I want both values to be different.Is there a way to make a variable's value non-changable (constant or static)I don't want frmEnv.SCHEMA value to change ever once a value is assigned to it.
what you're trying to do is totally wrong as other people explained. But if I try to read what you got in mind (though I'm rarely good at telepathy), maybe what you want is to have a copy of the first module?you may then want to use the  module, and change the copy of your object:You may also want to load a module using its file name using the  module, and give it two different names in the current environment so they are actually loaded two times. It should have the same effect as a copy, but would be a lot more dependent on the filesystem placement of files, thus being a lot less elegant (that's why I'm not giving an example). And it'd be a lot harder for the reader to understand why you're doing that.HTH
A python module is only imported once; the second import just returns the already initialized module-- its code is not executed a second time. This means that your  and  are two references to the same object.If you explain what (concrete task) you're trying to accomplish, someone can tell you how to do it. This is not the way.
