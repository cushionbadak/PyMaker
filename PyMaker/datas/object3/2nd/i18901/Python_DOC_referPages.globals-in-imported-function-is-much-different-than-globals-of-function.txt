File a.py:File main.py: have much more elements than . At the first look it seems that built-in functions and types are in . Why these two dictionaries are different?
You are looking at the module namespaces. The  globals differs from  globals because they both live in different modules.You'll see the same global namespace if you use  (for globals in ) and  (for the globals of module ):Each and every module gets its own namespace,  are not interpreter global, they are module global only. Importing a module means you are importing a reference to that namespace, or creating references to names in that namespace.From the datamodel documentation on module objects:A module object has a namespace implemented by a dictionary object (this is the dictionary referenced by the  attribute of functions defined in the module)and on function objects:: A reference to the dictionary that holds the function’s global variables — the global namespace of the module in which the function was defined.The  key of the main script merely points to the  module, in imported modules that has been expanded into a dictionary. These are the same thing, really.
