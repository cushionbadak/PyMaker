Please what's wrong with my code: Display "2013-01-01 00:00:00", Thanks.
A week number is not enough to generate a date; you need a day of the week as well. Add a default:The  and  pattern tells the parser to pick the Monday in that week. This outputs: uses Monday as the first day of the week. While you can pick your own weekday, you may get unexpected results if you deviate from that.See the  and  behaviour section in the documentation, footnote 4:When used with the  method,  and  are only used in calculations when the day of the week and the year are specified.Note, if your week number is a ISO week date, you'll want to use  instead! Those directives require Python 3.6 or newer.
Adding of 1 as week day will yield exact current week start. Adding of timedelta(days=6) will gives you the week end.
To complete the other answers - if you are using ISO week numbers, this string is appropriate (to get the Monday of a given ISO week number):, ,  are ISO equivalents of , , , so this outputs:Availabe in Python 3.6+; from docs.
Here's a handy function including the issue with zero-week.
