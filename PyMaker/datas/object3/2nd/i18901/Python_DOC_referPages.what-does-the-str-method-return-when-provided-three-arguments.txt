You're reading docs for version 2, but looking at code using (or matching) Python 3.The docs for version 3 say:Return a str version of object. See str() for details.Following the link the following is said about the  and  keyword arguments:If at least one of  or  is given,  should be a -like object (e.g.  or ). In this case, if  is a  (or ) object, then  is equivalent to . Otherwise, the  object underlying the  object is obtained before calling . 
That's not the built-in  function. Look at the imports at the top:Kenneth has defined his own  module for compatibility between Python 2 and 3, and he overrides several builtins including .As you can see in that module, in Python 2 it aliases  to , so it pretty much works the same as the Python3 .
To add to daniel-roseman's answer here's the documentation and what does it do.. Since  in the stated code represents .
