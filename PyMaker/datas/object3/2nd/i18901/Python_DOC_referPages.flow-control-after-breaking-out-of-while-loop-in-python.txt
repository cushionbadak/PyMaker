I am pretty new to both programming and Python. A few times now, I have created what feels like an awkward program flow,  and I am wondering if I am following best practices. This is conceptually what I have wanted to do:What I've ended up doing works, but feels off somehow:Is there a better way?
You're looking for  loop:From docs:A  statement executed in the first suite terminates the loop  without executing the  clause’s suite.
Use an  clause to the  loop:See the  statement documentation:A  statement executed in the first suite terminates the loop without executing the  clause’s suite.
If you think about it, you might already have a perfectly good condition to use without setting a flag: the condition at the top of the while loop (or, rather, the  of it). Assuming you don't change the truthiness of your condition during the same iteration as a , this gives you:This makes sense if you think of  as a repeated : instead of happening once, a while keeps going until the condition becomes falsey.But, like the other answers have mentioned, the analogy goes further: just like you don't have to spell all your s as  accepts an  that is executed if the condition at the top is tested and found to be falsey. So,And, same as the / case, this doesn't imply any further tests of the condition than what would happen anyway. In the same way that an  attached to  won't run if the true-branch makes  falsey, an  attached to a  will never run after a  since that explicitly skips ever checking the condition again. This makes the  equivalent to a decicated flag in every case.This also extends to  loops, even though the analogy breaks - but it executes under similar enough rules: the  is run if the loop ends by having run its course rather than hitting a .
