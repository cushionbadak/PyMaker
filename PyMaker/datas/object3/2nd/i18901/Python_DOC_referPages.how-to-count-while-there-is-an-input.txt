Python comes with a collection specifically made for counting, called .If you want the results in order from least common to most,  has a function that sorts by count, . Unfortunately, it's backwardâ€¦ but you can fix that by calling :Or, if you'd prefer them sorted by name:
Just for fun a one-liner to do this:This probably isn't the way to do it in real code.
Demo:
You can just use a simple python map.  This functions:
