I'm looking for a better way to handle optional  value (missing value) in a statement like this:in order to prevent: This is what I'm doing now:and I don't like it. Is there a better way? A solution for this small problem using  or  would help too.
Create a wrapper that checks itself when  is called.
One way would be to write a simple function for this, e.g.:Or you could write a function that would accept and format multiple arguments:EDIT: Or, with Python 3.6+ f-strings:or, using precision when obj is a float, and str(obj) otherwise:where, in all cases:If you wanted to convert all floats passed as  arguments that way, you could create a custom handler, but that seems like overkill and prone to converting things you may not want.
