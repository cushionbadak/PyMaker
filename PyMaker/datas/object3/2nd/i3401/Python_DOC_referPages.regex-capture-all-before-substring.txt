Natural Text
I have a string:I'm trying to split this up to capture the number of kills, and the information before each  to get this output:Getting the number of kills was simple:Getting the text has been harder. From researching, I have tried to use the following regex, which just gave the beginning of a series of capture groups:I then changed this to add in "any number of characters before each group".This just gives the entire string. How can I adjust this to capture everything before "any number of digits-space-Kill"?Let's get the dupes out of the way. I've consulted the following. The second in particular looked useful but I've been unable to make it suit this purpose.Extract Number before a Character in a String Using Python, How would I get everything before a : in a string Python,how to get the last part of a string before a certain character?.
