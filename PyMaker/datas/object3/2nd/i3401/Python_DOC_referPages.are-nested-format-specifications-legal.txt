Recently, I came across the following oddity.  Nesting -enclosed format fields seems to work in both Python 2.7 and 3.6, but I can't find anything in the docs to say that should be so.  For example, I get the following result on both 3.6 and 2.7:Has anyone seen this before, and is it an intended feature?  Normally, I'd dismiss this as an implementation quirk, and maybe report it as a bug. Two things, though:  Python docs don't always put all the information in the place I'd look for it, and this is a Very Nice Feature to have. 
This is documented at the end of the introduction to the "Format String Syntax" section:A format_spec field can also include nested replacement fields within it. These nested replacement fields may contain a field name, conversion flag and format specification, but deeper nesting is not allowed. The replacement fields within the format_spec are substituted before the format_spec string is interpreted. This allows the formatting of a value to be dynamically specified.Some examples of this feature can also be found at the end of the "Format examples" section, such as:
