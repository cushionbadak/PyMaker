Suppose there is a library that makes various database queries:I want to execute those 2 queries concurrently without having to add  to the method signature or adding a decorator.  These functions should not depend on asyncio at all.What is the best way to utilize those non-async functions within ?I am looking for something of the form:Thank you in advance for your consideration and response.
If some function is blocking and not async by nature, only proper way to run it inside  event loop is to run it inside thread using run_in_executor:It does job.If you however want to avoid using threads only way to do it - is to rewrite / to be async by nature.
I presume you are after concurrency and hopefully do not insist on using  module itself in which case this little example could be helpful:It runs both  and  in parallel and collects their results in a list in order in which they've been mentioned in an assignment to .
