I installed it seperately because python3.6 wasn't upgradeable to 3.7.When I type: , it gives me:  as my current version.The problem is that I can't seem to import dataclasses.my import statement is:  as instructed hereThis is the error message it's giving me:I even tried installing the dataclasses module with pip3: . Not sure if that's necessary though.Any suggestion on what might be the problem?[EDIT] Just tried it with a python3.6 console and it worked fine .. weird.

This command will run the script at  to set up the necessary environment variables and other things for youTo deactivate, simply run  after activating
