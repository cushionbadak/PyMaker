My Python script  has this function for example:I am using Python C-API in Objective-C as follows:After this, I am not really sure how I can convert the  to retrieve my dictionary. For doubles and strings, we usually use the  and ,  functions but I can't seem to find a  or equivalent method. I don't have much experience with Objective-C so maybe I am not looking at the right place.Can someone help me figure out how I can convert the  to a NSDictionary?I am basically looking for a C way of accessing the dictionary first (a map for example) which I can then use Objective-C methods to convert to NSDictionary. Similar to how I used PyUnicode_AsUTF8String, PyBytes_AsString and stringWithUTF8String all combined together to get a NSString out of the Python String. Looking for something similar for dictionaries. I have figured out a way to achieve this but I don't know if this is the best possible way of doing this. I modified my python script to use  to return a string representation of the dictionary. Then in myObjective C- code, I first get the string, then use  to convert the json string to a NSDictionary. This works for now but I am curious if there is a better way of doing this without having to return string instead of dictionary from Python. This seems more like a workaround solution to me. Here's what I have now:app.py:Objective-C:
Use  to iterate over key / value pairs of the dictionary.You should also provide the Python hash and equality functions if you are still going to be using s. Otherwise, you should try and coerce them all into native types.(This is in pseudo code since I don't really know Objective-C, but have used the C-Api and Python)Another alternative would be to just use the Python API to access values of a dictionary. So iterate over all the values with ,  to access string items with simple s, and  to access an arbitrary Python value.
