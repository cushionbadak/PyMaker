Natural Text
Right now I am trying to read and parse a file using Python 2. The creator of the file typed a bunch of lines in the terminal, with (Ctrl A)s within each line, and copied those lines into a text file. So the lines in the file look like "(something)^A(something)". When I use the readlines() function in python to read the file, those "^A" strings cannot be recognized. I tried to use io.open and codecs.open and set the encoding as UTF-8, but "^A" is clearly not an UTF-8 string. Does anyone know how to read these special control command strings from a file using python? Thank you very much!
Simply read the file in binary mode like so: . Ctrl-A will be the value 1.
These control characters are part of the ASCII character set, with numeric codes ranging from 0 to 31 (or 00 to 1F in hexadecimals). To strip them out from a string, simply use regex substitution:
