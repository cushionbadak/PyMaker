I've recently stumbled upon coding task, and I've struggled to get it right. It goes like this:Given a non-empty string  and a list  containing a list of non-empty words, determine if  can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words. You may assume the  does not contain duplicates, but each word can be used more than once.For example, given:Return , because  can be segmented as .I came up with a pretty naive solution, that works for this particular example, but it is not hard to make it fail, for example by adding a word to  that other word in the list starts with (i.e. ). There are plenty of other things that can mess up my solution, but anyway here goes:Do you guys have an idea of how to fix it? Or maybe there is a better approach to this problem? 
This is my solution, using a generator expression for brevity, and recursionThis code states that the string can be segmented if we can find a word so that the string begins by this word, and the rest of the string can itself be segmented.
As a function:It may be an optimization to make the groups non-capturing ( rather than  so that  doesn't have to keep track of matched words, but I'm not going to time it. If your words aren't all just letters you may want to pass them through  (as in  instead of ).If you are going to have mixed-case and you want those to match pass the  or  flag (as in  instead of ).See the  documentation for more.
