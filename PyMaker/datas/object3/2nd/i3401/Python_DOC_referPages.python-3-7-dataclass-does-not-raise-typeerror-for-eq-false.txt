I was trying out the new  in Python 3.7The  decorator can be passed arguments to control the dunder functions that are added to the class.For some reason, the decorator does not seem to raise  for  argument.As per the docs:If I understand correctly, if i pass ,  function will not be added, and a  should be thrown when comparing two instances of the same class. Instead, the  parameter seems to have no effect.The above does not raise  and always evaluates to .The other arguments(eg: , ) seem to behave as expectedIs there some gap in my understanding?I am using docker image 
In python3.7, given the following dataclass definitionthe expected result for  is . This is correct since setting  only overrides the default python-object equality function, which just checks for identical references (the same as ) in this case.The dataclass specification is a bit lacking here. It explains the  parameter witheq: If true (the default), an __eq__ method will be generated. This method compares the class as if it were a tuple of its fields, in order. [...]but in order to understand the issue you ran into, you also need to know that the basic python object already offers an  function:
When you don't define ,  will resolve to .  That is what's happening when you create a dataclass with . is False unless , i.e. unless the two are the same object.
