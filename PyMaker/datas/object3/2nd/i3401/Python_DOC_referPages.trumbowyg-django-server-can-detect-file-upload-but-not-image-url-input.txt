I'm using Trumbowyg, a WYSIWYG JavaScript editor which has a feature of rendering images from URLs pasted in. It also has an upload plugin which enables uploading local images and custom server side handling.  My python/django function  can successfully detect the uploaded image - however when I use the URL image input, my python function cannot detect it. Trumbowyg simply renders the image without going through my python backend.Here's my code:Why can in detect the uploaded image but not the URL input?
As already pointed, Trumbowyg doesn't send the URL to backend if the user uploads the image using a URL. But if you really want to host the images on your own server, there's a way you can do that.When the user submits the form, you'll receive the content of the textarea in your backend. You can then read the content and look for  tag. At that point, you can check if the  value doesn't start with your S3 bucket hostname, you can download that image using  or  library, save it to your bucket and replace the  value.Since the submitted data will be in HTML format, check out the excellent Beautiful Soup. It will make parsing HTML easy.
