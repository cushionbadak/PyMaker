I have a list similar to the following:These are votes and each vote is corresponds to an id from this model which contains the choices of a poll:I'm using Counter to count the votes and I end up with this:Each key in this dictionary corresponds to an ID in the  model. How can I replace the key names of the dictionary with the corresponding  for each ID?I would like to end up with a dictionary that looks as following:EDIT:Additionally what if I wanted to do the same procedure to the list I already have.to something like this:
Well we can first load a dictionary that maps s to :Here with  we thus make a filter (which is, strictly speaking, not necessary, but will reduce the amount of work both for the database and the webserver, unless the number of s is huge). Then we want it to return s, so for every element a list with two elements: the  and the .We use the  constructor, which can fetch an iterable of 2-lists (or 2-tuples), and converts it to a dictionary where for every element the left item of the sublist/tuple is the key, and the right item is the value.Now we can use this to construct a new dictionary:Note that in case there are two s with the same , then it will only retain one of the elements in the counter.In case the s should be different for every two s with the same , you can enforce that at the model level with :
to get the name of your choice : so you have to iterate over your ids, get the choice_text and use : to rename your keys to the corresponding choice names.
