I have a speck file (can be editted like a txt) of the format What I need to do is to create "n" number of files, each named rot_"n".speck with the the only change within the file being the rot_0001.sgi being changed to rot_00"n".sgi. I am aware that probably quite a simple python loop can perform this. But I do not know the form it would take. Can you help?
You are right you can use a FOR loop to accomplish this. I used the following code to write 4 files named . I used the file you presented above to create the files.If because you are always reading in the same file each time you could also use string replace.I found this SO answer helpful.
