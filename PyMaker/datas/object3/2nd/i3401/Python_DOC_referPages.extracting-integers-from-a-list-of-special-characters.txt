I have the following list in python. I want to extract integers form this, so that I can get a new list  . I am using python 3.x and I have tried the solution given in the link How to extract numbers from a list of strings? but unfortunately I am getting an empty list . Can somebody help me?
Use  with a list comprehension:
Someone messed up this data really bad. We have the following:Let's try somethingNow  is . This looks like a task for :Et voil√†, the list is back: .To put everything together:Whoever created this mess of data used a combination of castings to string and list. Check for yourself: 
If list comprehensions like andare beyond you, you can use a simpler approach.  Iterate through all items in your source list, try to convert it into an integer, add the result to a list.If errors occure, it is not an integer and you ignore that element and do not add it to the result list:Output:ReadUp:error handlingfilter(function, iterable) - just for completeness sake if you want to look it up.
A more efficient solution:Please read Python List Comprehension Vs. Map.  is faster than list comprehension when dealing with non-lambda functions.
