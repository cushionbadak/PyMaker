I have wrote the following program. I made its setup. It installed successfully. Now, I want my program to start at startup without manually copying its shortcut to startup folder i.e C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup. I would like my program to run automatically at startup like many commercial programs (like utorrent, Internet Downloader Manager, etc) do. How can I do that?Python Code:
To avoid adding it to the startup folder, you can place your file elsewhere and create a Registry Key in the current user's startup Registry folder. To do soâ€”utilize the  module. It's well documented and fun to use!winreg.CreateKeyEx(key, sub_key, reserved=0, access=KEY_WRITE)winreg.SetValueEx(key, value_name, reserved, type, value)winreg.Close() Basic UsageCoded with version .
