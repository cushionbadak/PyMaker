hi I have a string as and I am trying to match the first occurance of english-yify my pattern is but my code returns the entire string, pls helpmy regex available here
Your string is in fact html - you should use html parser instead. I suggest the excellent lxml.html parser.To answer your question, regexes are greedy by default, that means your  part will grab as many chars as it can to satisfy the condition. So you will get the first  and the last  and everything in between.
