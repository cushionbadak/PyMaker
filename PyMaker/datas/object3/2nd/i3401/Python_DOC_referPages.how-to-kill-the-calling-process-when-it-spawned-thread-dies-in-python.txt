Natural Text
My python script calls another python scripts method (which runs an infinite loop and performs some activity) and runs it as thread. I want to kill my calling python script as soon as the thread dies
Are you using the module ? If so, you could periodically check the status of your thread via the method . If your infinite thread is killed somehow, your permanently checking main thread (possibly notified by another thread initialized like this) can also terminate.
