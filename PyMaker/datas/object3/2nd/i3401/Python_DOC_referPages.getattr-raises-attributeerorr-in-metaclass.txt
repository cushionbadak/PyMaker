I'm toying with python to understand how it works, but there is something weird. I'm defining a  method in my MetaClass, and I expect the fourth argument (which is a dict of attributes of the class-to-be), to contain methods defined in my class-to-be body.I have this code : The output is:So  in  the result is, as expected : How you can see, it contains the 'foobar' key.However, the next line raises . Why ?I tried  which returns false too.
A dictionary doesn't expose the keys as attributes. The dictionary will become the namespace for the class being created, but it is not yet part of a class. Classes (and their metaclass) have a  method that translates attribute access to dictionary lookups, but that's not available on the dictionary object itself.Just use dictionary subscription access:or call , store the return value, then look up the attribute on that new class object:Note:  does not produce an instance! It returns the  proxy object, attributes on which will be looked up on the metaclass Method Resolution Order (MRO).  is such a lookup, finding the next  attribute in the metaclass's MRO. In this case that's , and calling that method produces the actual class object.
