i'm making a small program where user creates an account but for some reason in this part of the code pass does nothing can somebody please explain this?
 does nothing by definition. That's what it's for: as a no-op, a placeholder for when the syntax requires a statement but you don't want to do anything.I suspect what you want here is , which will loop.
