My task is actually quite simple, but I cannot figure out how to achieve it. I am intending to use this in my ML algo, but let's simplify the example. Suppose there is a generator like the following:The above, will yield us , ,  and .Suppose that the above generator returns individual "samples". I want to write a generator method that will batch them up. Suppose, the batch size is . So if this new method is called:And then the output of this batch generator would be:  and  and then  and . Tuples/lists does not matter. What matters is to how to return these batches. I found this  keyword that was introduced in Python 3.3, but it seems it is not useful in my case.And obviously, if we had  nums instead of , and  is , we would omit the last yielded value from the first generator.
My own solution for this could be,Another solution is to use  as @Bharel mentioned. I have compared the time it takes to run both of these solutions. There is not much of a difference. I guess it can be neglected.
Under itertools you have a code snippet which does just that:Instead of calling a method every time, you have an iterator that returns batches, much more efficient, faster, and handles corner cases like running out of data too soon without losing it.
This was exactly what I needed:
