Natural Text
I am trying to split large csv files in smaller chunks and load the data to sql for further analyse on the chunks. But when I am running the following code, the text qualifiers are getting misplaced and it is hampering the csv file and we are unable to load the data:Even though the script is running properly for smaller mock_data sets(below 1000 lines), it is not working properly for large datasets. Lets say the dataset is as follows:When I am running the script the smaller chunks are getting generated like following:The text qualifiers are getting misplaced. Any solution?Please note: I have tried using other codes to split the data but the issue is same for other codes and data. 
In Python 3.x, you should open your CSV files using the parameter . A tab delimiter can be specified using . For example:To force quoting on all of your fields, use . This would then give you an output as follows, where all fields are double quoted, and are separated with a tab character:This can be verified by opening the file with a text editor. If the data does not look as expected, it implies an issue with your  file. You would need to provide a link to a smaller sample from it that recreates the problem.
