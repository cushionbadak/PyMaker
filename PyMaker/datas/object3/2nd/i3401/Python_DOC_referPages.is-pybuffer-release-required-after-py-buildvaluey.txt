If it makes a difference, I am interested in an answer regarding Python 3.The docs state (here and here) that  should be called after  with , .Nothing of the sort is written about . Is it an oversight, or in case of  a  is enough?Here is my specific case:
I think no:In both the  and  functions,  refers to a string and length, rather than a buffer, and therefore there is no underlying buffer object to be released.The documentation for  says:When memory buffers are passed as parameters to supply data to build objects, as for the s and s# formats, the required data is copied. Buffers provided by the caller are never referenced by the objects created by Py_BuildValue().The purpose of holding a lock on the buffer used by  is that you have got a reference to some data out of Python to C, and you want to process it in C without any chance of it being modified by Python. In this case you have copied some data from C into Python and so there's no need to protect the original data from modification.
