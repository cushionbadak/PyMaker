I want to make properties from an attribute of my class accessible directly through the instance of the class (without inheriting from it). So basically if I have:Instead of doing  I want to be able to do . Based on this answer here, I tried the following in class B:But when instantiating and testing it out, I get one of those weird python moments:Why are both 'foo' and 'bar' printed out when creating the instance ?How does the 'foo' property point to the same getter as 'bar' ?
 and  are printed when you create the instance because doing  and  will both call the property object to get a value.Both of the attributes you set up in  use lambdas to get the correct  from .  This is a common mistake when calling lambdas.  Because the  value is inherited from the outside scope, it isn't frozen when the lambda is evaluated.  Instead, it is simply the same  reference as the enclosing scope's , and changes accordingly.  So all of your lambdas will have the same  value.You can define a  method instead.  This method is called when ordinary attribute lookup fails.
