I am currently learning Python through edX platform, I came across two terms that got me confused: required argument and optional argument.Can anyone feel so kind to explain the difference between the two?Take function round() for example,the quiz stated: "The function round has two arguments. Select the two correct statements about these arguments."here are the options:number is a required argument.number is an optional argument.ndigits is a required argument.ndigits is an optional argument.According to what I have learned, I know that you have to specify input in order to get ndigit, such as round(1.68 , 1) >>>>1.7If I just wrote round(1.68) >>>> I will get 2Thus, to my understanding, ndigit is an optional argument, meaning that you have to choose in order to make it work, otherwise, the function will only work what is it required, like an autopilot programPlease give me some feedback if I am wrong, or share some link where I can learn more.I am not the native English speaker, so the words "required" and "optional" really seem confusing to me at one point. I hope to learn more from you all.By the way, I got the right answer, I'll keep learning Python, hope to work in this field, cheers!
The docs for  define the function as The square brackets are common notation to show which arguments are optional.In the case of , if the  parameter is omitted or  it reverts to a predefined behaviour - in this case rounding to the nearest integer. on the other hand is required; the function cannot be called without this argument and will raise an error if it is missing.
