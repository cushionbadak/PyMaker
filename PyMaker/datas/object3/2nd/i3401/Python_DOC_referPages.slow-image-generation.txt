I'm relatively new to python an I build a Tower of Hanoi solver which print the solution as an image (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi)It works as expected but generating the image is extremely slow.Here is the code:As said before, it takes a extremely long time to generate the image.How can I make it faster and why it is so slow?Thanks
your block for generating the image is in the for loop. unindent it and you divide by 3 the execution time. the rest (.04 second on my old desktop, which is not that long) is PIL import overhead. i think the only way to be faster is using ppm image format (but it gives huge files) and not using PIL. anyway, you should still listen to @PixelEinstein's advice and try codereview
