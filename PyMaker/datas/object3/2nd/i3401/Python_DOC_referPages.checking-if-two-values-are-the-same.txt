In my Python game I and making a dice rolling game, i got the part working where if you guess the number right it works, But i'm trying to develope a Higher or Lower partBut in my code if the value is 3 and you say higher it'll say you've won.example but I should've lost here instead of winning. 
Put parentheses like this:However you had better to do like this:
Better yet, since you have already defined the higher and lower numbers, you might as well use them, like so:line 39:line 49:
This line:Is evaluated something like this:So the  part is (currently) only affecting the first of your  tests.  The code will enter the block irrespective of the value of  if  is 2 or 3.This is because the  operator has a higher precedence than the  operator.So you probably want something like:oror
