folks!Many thread created here about regex and unicode but unfortunately it doesnt work in my case.I have the string:and I'm building string as:If i try search:It returns None.Why i got such behavior of the regex ?
According to the Python  docs,  second argument is the position in the string where the search is to start.See the values you sum:There is no match in your string after Index 34.So, you can either pass the  and  flags in a call to :or use them as inline modifiers inside the patternor use plain  where the third argument is flags:Python code demo:
You need to pass the flags to the compilation phase.
