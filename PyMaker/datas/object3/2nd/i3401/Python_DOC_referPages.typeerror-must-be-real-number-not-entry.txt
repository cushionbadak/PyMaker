I am creating a code to create a calculator but I keep on getting this error: Does anyone know why my code does not work? I don't really understand why it cannot be and entry since I am collecting the user's input? I was researching but I could not figure out how to correctly incorporate the user's input into the code.Here is my code that I used:
There are a number of problems with this code:You need to store the results of those  calls.As suggested by Joel, you need to convert them to  or .You should create the results  once at startup, and  the text in this callback, instead of creating a new  every time the user hits .Instead of repeating all of the same code 6 times, just calculate a  in the  chain, and then use it at the end.I already explained most of this in my answer to your previous question.The result should look something like this:result_label = Label(window, text = str(n_textentry ** m_textentry), bg = "white")result_label.grid(row = 13, column = 0, sticky = N)As I mentioned before, you probably want some error handling for the case where the user leaves one of the entries blank, or inputs text instead of a number, or divides by zero, etc. The simplest way to do this with a  around the whole  function:
Try converting user input to a  or . It looks like you're trying to apply a mathematical operation on user input (the  object), but mathematical operations are not supported for  objects.
