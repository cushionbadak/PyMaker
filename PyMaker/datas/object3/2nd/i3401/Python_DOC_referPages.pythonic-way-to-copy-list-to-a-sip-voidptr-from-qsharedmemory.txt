I am using PyQT5 and the QSharedMemory class. I am creating a shared memory which can hold up 6 1-byte elements. To copy these elments in the shared memory array I am looping over the elments from the python list like the following snippet:Which seems very unpythonic and boilerplate-code like. I am wondering if there is a more suitable way of achieving the same result?When usingor:It will fail with the error message:The whole test code for reproducing looks like the following:
Here's a simpler approach using struct and memoryview that reads and writes the data with a couple of one-liners:
After a bit of fiddling about, I managed to produce one combination that functioned for me:This relies on the buffer protocol for reading both ways. It is likely you can use the array directly with your , and  has been renamed to  in later versions. In Python 3.4, this worked: replaced , but knew the elements were 4 bytes large, so it required an additional cast.
