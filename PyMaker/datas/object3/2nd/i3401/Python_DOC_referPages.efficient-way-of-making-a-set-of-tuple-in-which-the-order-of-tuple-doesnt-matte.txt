I want to make a set of tuples in which the order of tuples shouldn't matter.For eg.- If the tuples I want to add is :It should output like this:Is there any efficient way of doing this in python?
You can apply  and then , followed by conversion to :ExplanationThere are a couple of good reasons why you should not convert each tuple to  as an initial step:Tuples  and  would become equal after conversion to .Even in the case where we are considering tuples of length 2, we would be adding an assumption that  and  are equal.
