I found out this question has been answered before, but not very clear to me.I understand data type can somehow called user defined class actually it is same as class in python.But in some books dictionary (dict) is called data structure some books call it data type.What is the difference?
A dictionary (or map or associative-array) is a data-structure with keys and values. In Python, that data structure can be used as the  datatypeSo, to answer the question more broadly, all languages have built-in data types.Not all languages have built-in data structures, but they generally can be implemented by using the data types that are availableCan we construct a class for specific data structure? Sure, for example, I would make a  or , but as mentioned, those are composed of more simpler types. 
Data structure is a general computer science concept. It is just a way of organizing data to make certain operations easier or harder.Data type is a concept specific to a programming language. In a way, it is a concrete implementation of a data structure in a particular programming language. But the actual definition of what constitutes a "type" varies among programming languages. For example, in , you can define a  and use it as a type. There are also basic types like , ,  etc. In , you can use the built-in types like ,  etc. or define your own types using classes.
