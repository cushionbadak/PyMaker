This question already has an answer here:Python: multiplication override                    2 answers                I wrote a class in python like this I want to overwrite the operation , so I can achieve function like:so I tried code like this:however, I was disappointed to notice that this function only works whenif I wrote:it says:TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'int' and 'Vector'How can I get the function that works both on  and ?thank you so much.
This is exactly why rmul was designed.
 works because  means "call the  function of my vector object with an  argument". But  doesn't work because that tries to call a multiplication function of an  object with a  argument:  doesn't know about your  class, so it throws an error.You need to define an  function on  to fix this.
