Our team is a small group of data analysts doing report development in a variety of languages including mostly SAS and Python. We are limited in what we can install. As such, we don't have a formalized version control system in place but can manually handle version controls, forking, merging, etc. since we typically manage our own scripts from start to finish. Now, however, I am working in parallel with a new member of the team and finding it increasingly challenging to manage different versions.I am looking for a simple way, using Python (3.6 via Anaconda) or Windows (7 or 10), to find the line-by-line differences between two files. I want to see the contents of both files with the differences highlighted.The files are stored in a shared folder and will get updated by multiple people in parallel, but as mentioned, there is no formal version control system. I know there are other utilities to install, and I know I could create something on my own, but I want something that doesn't need to be installed and doesn't need to be a custom utility.
You are welcome to use the difflib library. It even has a command line interface.The file you need to run, , resides in  under your local python installation.These are the parameters:Producing an HTML will probably yield (pun intended) the best results.
