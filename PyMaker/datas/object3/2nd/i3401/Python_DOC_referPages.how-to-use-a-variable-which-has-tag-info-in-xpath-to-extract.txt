I am writing a scrapy code, which takes the url, the tags where my data to be scraped is stored from a csv file. That tag I am assigning to a temporary variable like z(having h1), av(having title), an(having td) etc. When I am using that variable in xpath , it does not extract anything out of that tag. Can anyone help me?
Since you're using variables, you should denote them with  and supply their value as a keyword argument per the docs.Alternatively, if you prefer, use string formatting.
