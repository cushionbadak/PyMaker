I have a QTableWidget populated with QtableWidgetItems.I want a searchbar, where I can type in and as Response the Table should be refreshing and only showing the items that match partially with the string in the search field.Im using finditem for that, but i want that only one column is used for the search. How can I do that?
Iterate the table manually.    You will have to implement better matching criteria. You can use string functions like  and  and others if you want to do it yourself.
