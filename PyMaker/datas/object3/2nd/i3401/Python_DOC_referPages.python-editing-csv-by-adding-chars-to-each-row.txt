I've got this dataset in a .csv file:https://www.dropbox.com/s/2kzpzkhoiolhnlc/output.csv?dl=0for each row, if numbers are less then 51 than I need to add ? until having 51 chars in that row. For example, in the first row I have 19,3,12, so I have to add 48 ? to have a row like this: In the second row I have just one number, so I have to add 50 ?, the same for the other rows. Could you help me please?EDIT: I've tried with this but didn't work, it just added "" to some rows:
you can do it with just text file manipulation if you want, no need to use pandas or csv module for this simple case.
Use pandas to read the file in and set the number of columns you want. The following code reads in a file and assigns n columns. The extra elements will by default have value np.nanIf you want them to have a different value you can assign it with Then you can just write the dataframe back into the file and it will have the shape you want
