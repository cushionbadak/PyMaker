Natural Text
How do I remove the superscripts from all of the text? I have code below that gets all visible text, but the superscripts for footnoting are messing things up. How do I remove them?for example ,  are visible superscripts. 
The BeautifulSoup function  returns a list of all single discrete HTML elements in the input ( is the proper function to use in BeautifulSoup 4 and preferred over ). The next function, , goes through this list and removes the items for which its callback routine returns . The callback function tests the tag name of each snippet and returns  if it's in the not-wanted list,  otherwise.If these superscripts are always indicated by the proper HTML tag  then you can add it to the not-wanted list in the callback function.Possible pitfalls are:It is assumed that the literal (semantically correct) tag  is used, and not, for example, a class or a span that merely specifies  in its CSS;It is assumed that you want to get rid of all elements that are in this superscript tag. If there are exceptions ("the 20th century"), you can check the text contents; for example, only remove if its contents are all numerical. If there are exceptions to that ("a2 = b2 + c2"), you will have to check for a wider context, or build a whitelist or blacklist of inclusions/exclusions.
