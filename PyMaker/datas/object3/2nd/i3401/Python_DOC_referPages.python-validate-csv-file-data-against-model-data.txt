I get csv files containing share price data. A sample is as below.  Every row contains data for a minute.  Problem:-Sometimes, a minute data is skipped. e.g. row for "2014/01/01 09:18:00" would not be present.This hampers my program logic ahead.  What I require:-is to validate the csv file whether rows for every 1 minute are present between 09:15:15 to 15:30:30 for every date.  If not, copy previous row and insert for that minute (which is not present).Can anybody pl. help?Thanks.
Here is sample code you can use:The output is:But you should make sure start and end minutes present (or adapt the code).Update: fixed case if multiple minutes missing
you could basically read two consecutive lines and get time delta. If it is not 1 minute, means you're missing a line. Just write to the csv with a new line character at the end! you could also write everything to a new CSV file.
