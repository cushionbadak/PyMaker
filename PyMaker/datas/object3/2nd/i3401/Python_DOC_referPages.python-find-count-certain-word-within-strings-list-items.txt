Hello dear Programmers,I want to find certain words within List Items. My Input looks like this:I want to find and count \tNN\t or \tADJ\t or \tVFIN\t.The position of the words that I want to count is always the same, like you can see in the example.I tried the following code, but I get the following error: ValueError too many values to unpack (expected 3)Actually, I can see why this code is not working. But I don't have another approach. So my goal is to count the Part of Speach tags that are between the \t.So at the end I want to say: There are 5 NN, 4 ADJA...
