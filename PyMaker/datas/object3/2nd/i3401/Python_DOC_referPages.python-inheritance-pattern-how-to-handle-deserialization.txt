Say we want to serialize  below:If this serialization pattern is terrible and you have alternatives, please let me know. However, at the current stage I'm not sure how to re-assign the superclass's member variables as 's attributes(since 's state might be different than during initial construction). I know I could do something like , but it just doesn't feel right. What is the python-idiomatic way to perform something like this?
Borrowing the dunders from :There are a few other changes here, like not hardcoding the class name in the  classmethod, serializing to string instead of file (for testing), Using consistent / instead of one of each.
