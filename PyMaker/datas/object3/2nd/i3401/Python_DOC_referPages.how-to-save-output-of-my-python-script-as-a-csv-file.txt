Having a bit of an issue trying to figure out how to save the output of my python script as a CSV. When I run this script, the file does not appear in the location that i need in order to access it. Any suggestions?The last portion of this script here is where i am having a problem. The path_out should be on my local "C" drive as a CSV file. Please help.
Assuming you are on Windows, the documentation on os.path.join says:On Windows, the drive letter is not reset when an absolute path component (e.g., r'\foo') is encountered. If a component contains a drive letter, all previous components are thrown away and the drive letter is reset. Note that since there is a current directory for each drive, os.path.join("c:", "foo") represents a path relative to the current directory on drive C: (c:foo), not c:\foo.This should fix your problem:
