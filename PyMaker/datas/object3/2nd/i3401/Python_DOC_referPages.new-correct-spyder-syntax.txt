I'm new to Python. Trying to implement some code in Spyder."Python 3.6.3 |Anaconda custom (64-bit)| (default, Oct 15 2017, 03:27:45) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)]"I'm trying to implement some code from a video on Neural Nets.The code is returning SyntaxError: invalid syntax. My question is 2 part:What is the correct syntax?Where can I go to familiarize myself with the standard format? It looks like there are multiple syntaxes that work depending on the version/type. Maybe I'm just looking in the wrong places. 
First learn to format the code when you are asking a question because it's incmorehensive the keyword "True" goest with the first letter in uppercase and second you have to go "==" instead of a single "="
