What is the difference between a python built-in and a normal object? we often say that in python everything is an object. for example, when I do this in Python 3.6:I have two questions:is built-in function an object? if not is this why getsource throws TypeError?why can't I find scandir in python3 documentation as a built-in?
You can't access the source of builtins and other modules that were written using the C API, since there isn't a Python source for them.From the documentation for Return the name of the Python source file in which an object was defined. This will fail with a TypeError if the object is a built-in module, class, or function.
