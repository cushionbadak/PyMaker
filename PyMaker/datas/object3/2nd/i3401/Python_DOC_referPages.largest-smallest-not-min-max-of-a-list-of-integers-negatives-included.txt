(I couldn't find any min/max examples using negative integers)Hello. I am trying to write a simple program that will find the "largest" and "smallest" of 3 user-defined integers. This would be too easy if I am just intended to find the minimum and maximum. I think I am being asked to write a program that finds the min/max of absolute values of these numbers and then remembers what number generated the biggest/smallest, even if it was negative.This sounds slightly complicated though and this is an introductory course. Can someone tell me what the simplest solution to this problem is?Currently my program only finds min/max:
Simply use  with  as the key function, and the smallest number will be the first item of the resulting list, while the largest number will be the last item.
