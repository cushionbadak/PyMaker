This is my main function. If I receive new offer, I need to check the payment. I have HandleNewOffer() function on that. But the problem with this code happens if there are 2(or more) offers at the same time. One of the buyers will have to wait until the closing of the transaction. So is this possible to generate new process with HandleNewOffer() function and kill it when it`s done to make several transactions at the same time? Thank you in advance.  
I'd recommend to use the Pool of workers pattern here to limit the amount of concurrent calls to .The  module offers ready-made implementations  of the above mentioned pattern.This logic will handle as many offers in parallel as many CPU cores you computer has.
