I have a file that looks like this - and I need output file that looks like: I can loop through the file clubbing the key values pairs for the grouping fields  Col1 and Col2 into a list and dropping it into a dict but was hoping there was a more pythonic way of doing it. There are questions answered using pandas aggregation but i can't find a neat (and efficient way) of building that nested map. Also, the source file is gonna be large, like 80m records crunching down to 8m in the resulting file. I can see those eyes lighting up :) 
Using :Produces:It looks like you're parsing some of the values to literals -- the int you can do with , but I'm not sure how you want to deal with turning  into .(Assuming your have a list of iterables, maybe from the  module:)

 +  + Assuming of course,  isExplanationFirst you  using Then  this output to dictionaries and rename the axis altogether Finally, use  to get your list of dictionaries
