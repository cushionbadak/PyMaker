So let's say I have these lines of code: The letters are supposed to be inputs from the user in the bash terminal. Showing the help method works and it is able to show all of the strings.The -f input works and shows the contents that I need in that function, however the code just spits out the content from function 1 and not from function2 and so on. How do I get these different letters, -f, -n, -e, -m (if inputted) to carry out that function and spit out that information? Also is there a more efficient way to do this without using argparse for a beginner Python scripter? 
I highly suggest using argparse.If you prefer not to, creating a dictionary of flags is also possible:By creating a dictionary, you're able to just look up the keys.It results in cleaner, faster, and more maintainable code.
To test if any one of two values is in a list, you can't use the  operator with the  operator. You need to test each value separately using the  operator, like this:
