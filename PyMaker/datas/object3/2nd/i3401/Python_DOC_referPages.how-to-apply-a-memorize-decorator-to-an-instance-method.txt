I'd like to use a memorize decorator on a class method.  calls  but  doesn't seem to know about . When  calls  it is missing the  obj so it complains about missing args.How can I change this memorize decorator so that it is able to pass the caller's  to the function?Python3.5.2Output:
You need to pass  (i.e. ) to  (i.e. ). But  won't allow you to do this: it receives only the key.You can rewrite it using function-based decorator:(I'm using functools.wraps not to lose the original name of decorated method).In this approach  will be passed to  as positional arg and proxied to .
