I am trying to do the following in python: There is this function which takes named arguments.My input string is via command line and should look like this This should resolve to the call the above function using the named arguments. What would be the easiest way
Here's one way, with limited error checking, but I definitely recommend checking out :The argument processing is straightforward, building a list for positional arguments and a dictionary for keyword arguments, then unpacking them into the  call.I also created a  dict that will allow you to access functions by name in a safer way than going through .
