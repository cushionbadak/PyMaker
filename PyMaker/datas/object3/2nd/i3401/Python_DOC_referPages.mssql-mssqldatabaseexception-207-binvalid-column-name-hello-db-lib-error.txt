I do not know where is wrong,but now I use "executemany",then there's no error.Modified code：
You were converting the CSV data table in an odd way. The most important bug being the SQL query quotations around values (hence the 'Hello' is an invalid column error). I re-coded the snippet so you could see each change, comment, and update; I hope I helped. Good luck!I simplified converting data with  to combine two instances of  (of same length) created from  column and row.Coded in Fixed Query OutputSQL Insert w/ CSV DataTable
