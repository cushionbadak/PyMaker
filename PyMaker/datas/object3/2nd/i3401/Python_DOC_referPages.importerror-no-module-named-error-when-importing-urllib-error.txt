I am just getting my feet wet in the art of webscrapping and I am following the tutorials from this source. For some reason I cannot import the error module from 'urllib' to handle exceptions. Since this is a built-in library, I am confused as to why this is an issue.yields the errorI have tried the same code with another IDE (IntelliJ) and it works as expected leading me to believe that this could be an issue with Google Colab itself. Could someone weight in and possibly help me find a solution to this problem.I am new to programming, so if this is a juvenile question or if this is not the appropriate place for this question, I apologize in advance.P.S. I have double checked that the runtime is Python 3 
Just try this:Always remember to try to search the docs of a particular library it helps a lot.
