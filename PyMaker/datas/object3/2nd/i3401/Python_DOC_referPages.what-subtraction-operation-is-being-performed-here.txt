I have a  with a number of columns, and a . Both have the same .::If I attempt to subtract the series from the dataframe, I get the following result:I also get the following warning:I know that I can achieve element-wise subtraction using What I don't know, however, is:What operation is performed using ?Additionally, it seems very counter-intuitive to me that subtracting a  from a  with matching  types / contents, doesn't do an element-wise subtraction. What is the rationale behind not doing this?
Reading the docs you so nicely linked to we find this:axis : {0, 1, ‘index’, ‘columns’}For Series input, axis to match Series index onAnd the default value is . This gives us a hint of what happens when you do a substraction, i.e.:orNone of which will work as you want. Now let us look back on the yellow box. The other alternative is  and we would match the index (which sounds exactly like what you expect), i.e.:or Why? This is a design question. The designers might aswell have set  as default but for reasons unknown (and probably because it is more frequently used and that the underlying package behind pandas, numpy, does operation that way) they chose . The numpy behaviour is easily tested by doing this:  which indeed operates on columns where as you are interested in rows (index).Short why: numpy works like this.The most elegant solution for this is to use  and specifying . (or 0, but index might be more readable in this case)
