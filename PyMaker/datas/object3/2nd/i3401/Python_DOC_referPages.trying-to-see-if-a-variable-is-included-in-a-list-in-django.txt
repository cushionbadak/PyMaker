I am trying to find if a selected country is in a list of tuples by using the following command in my view:if I print second_tier.profile.country I have and when I print COUNTRIES I get:So the if statement is supposed to return True, however it comes back as False.
You currently searching for a string in a tuple of tuples. You need to make sure  is all strings to make this work. You can use some simple list comprehensions to transform your nested tuples.Using tuple unpacking:Using indexing:Which takes the first element(country) from each of the tuples and puts them in a list.Then you can do:and it will return .Alternatively you could just loop over  and match  explicitly:You could also use  here:Which returns  is any match was found. Note: Since your just doing a simple lookup, you could convert the  to a set, which will allow a O(1) lookup instead of a O(N) lookup. I also used  above to discard values that are not needed, such as the second item for each tuple. 
You have a tuple of tuples, then you need to iterate in COUNTRIES.
