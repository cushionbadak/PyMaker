I need the index of the first open parentheses and last closing parentheses...without using any loop.. example :
Use  and  to find the indices of the two characters. Using  its simpler to find the last character and avoids the possibility of out by one errors other approaches may be susceptible to. There is also a  which works a similar way.Whether you prefer using / or / is a matter of preference on how you wish to handle the absence of the / strings. If you want an exception use  if you want a -1 in the returned tuple use  .output
This function finds the indices of the first opening and final closing parentheses:It does so by using the  string method, which returns the lowest index of a character in a string. For the closing parenthesis it reverses the string to find the last occurrence of that character.
