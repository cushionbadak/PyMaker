I'm trying to write clean and concise code, and in a lot of code I look over sometimes I see people are inconsistent in their code. What I'm asking is, is there ever an instance where thisis more appropriate than thisor is it just a matter of preference?
The big functional difference between the two examples you gave is that when you concatenate with , the operation will fail if the object on the right side of the operand is not a string:For instance will cause the following:This is true even if the object on the right side implements the  method: Using format however will automatically convert a passed argument using the  method:There are some situations where this behavior might not be desirable or necessary, such as when you are simply concatenating a string literal with an object that is expected to be a string.In all other cases I agree with the post cited in the comments which provide plenty of good reasons why formatting is more idiomatically correct and potentially more efficient.
if you know you are dealing with simple strings, then, yes, Simple is better than complex. Formatting capability is great, and something like is a definite code smell.  Your example isnâ€™t and the extra complexity of the template based version is a slight extra cognitive load which I would avoid, or at least not strive for, despite using templating extensively.
