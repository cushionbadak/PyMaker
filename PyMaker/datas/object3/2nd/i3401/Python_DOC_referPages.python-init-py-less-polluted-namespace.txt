I have a directory structurewhere  is justand Now, when I do , I get access toNice! However, one also hasalthough it's never explicitly imported. I suppose it has been imported along with .Is there a way to make  available as  without adding  to the namespace? (And without putting everything in in .)
This behaviour is documented in chapter 5 of the Python Language Reference. If you really want to disable it, you can do this in :which removes  from 's namespace when imported.However, this isn't common practice as far as I know; is there a particular reason you're wanting to do this?
