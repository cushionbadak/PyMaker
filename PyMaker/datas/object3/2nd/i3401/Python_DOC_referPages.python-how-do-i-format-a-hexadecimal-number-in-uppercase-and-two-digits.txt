I needed to do a hexadecimal counter.I tried to do it this way:The counter is working. The only problem is that the output looks like thisand I would like it to look like thisHow could I do that?
This is explained in the Format specification Mini-Language.To get uppercase letters:'x'   Hex format. Outputs the number in base 16, using lowercase letters for the digits above 9.'X'   Hex format. Outputs the number in base 16, using uppercase letters for the digits above 9.To get 2 digits:width is a decimal integer defining the minimum field width. If not specified, then the field width will be determined by the content.When no explicit alignment is given, preceding the width field by a zero () character enables sign-aware zero-padding for numeric types. This is equivalent to a fill character of  with an alignment type of .So, you either need to set the  to 2, the  to , and the  to , or, more simply, just use the special  prefix before the .So:While we're at it, this is pretty silly code. First,  is already an , so why call  on it?Meanwhile, if the only thing you're putting in a  string is a single format specifier, you don't need , just :Or, alternatively, the whole point of  is that you can throw multiple things into one format string:Or, if you're using Python 3.6 or later:
