I am trying to generate random values in a range of [1800,1600] over a certain period. That range is very strict, but I need to have a smaller range that is flexible over the period. An example of what I am looking for would be:for the first 10 days, select a random value between [1705,1695]for the next 10 days, select a random number between [1695, 1685]However, I would like the range to either randomly increase 10 or decrease 10.So far, the only way I have been able to do this is by manually setting a range and then random generate values for a certain time period with the range. I would like the range to be able to be randomly selected.
I've taken a shot at the problem as you've described it. This will generate random numbers for  periods of 10 days.Here is a plot showing the results of generating numbers for 10 time periods of length 10. You can see that each period is bounded by a range of 10.You might have to make some small adjustments based on your needs. When the bounds bump into the limits, they remain the same.
