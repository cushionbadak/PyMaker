So, I'm fiddling around with Python's  and I'm creating new futures using . When  finishes, it returns. Since I created my loop using  I'd expect that a thread created by  will be destroyed once it's function finished. But when I watch the Python process in Process Explorer I see that the threads are never destroyed. Threads at process start: 7Threads after some work was done (and finished): 25What's going wrong here?
