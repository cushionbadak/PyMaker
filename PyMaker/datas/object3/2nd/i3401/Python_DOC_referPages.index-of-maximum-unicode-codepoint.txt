Is this number in the stdlib somewhere?  At the moment I'm parsing it from  ( on Python 2) which seems lame.The valid range for the argument depends how Python was configured â€“ it may be either UCS2 [0..0xFFFF] or UCS4 [0..0x10FFFF].  I'm not sure if other ranges are possible.
This is :An integer giving the value of the largest Unicode code point, i.e.  ( in hexadecimal).Changed in version 3.3: Before PEP 393,  used to be either  or , depending on the configuration option that specified whether Unicode characters were stored as UCS-2 or UCS-4.
