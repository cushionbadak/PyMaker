I need to convert to some Python 3 code to Python 2 codeas you can see above, I want to know whether:equals to and the documentationdoes not make any sense to me.
Short answer: no, it's not equivalent.Longest answer: First, Python2 has no "bytes" type - Python3  are Python2  and Python3  is Python2 , so the right question would be: is  equivalent to .Then, the answer is still no. Py3  and  ARE instances of  indeed, but so are any instances of a class implementing , so you can have objects that are  without being  or  ((Django orm's  class would be a perfect candidate). and this doc: https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Sequence make not no sense to meIf you follow the link in this doc, you get a verbal definition of what a "sequence" is:An iterable which supports efficient element access using integer  indices via the getitem() special method and defines a len()  method that returns the length of the sequence  (..)  Note that dict also supports getitem() and len(), but is considered a mapping rather than a sequenceAccording to this definition, to test if an object is a sequence, you have to test whether it's iterable, have a  and a  method and is not a . This won't be an exact equivalent of the py3 code, but it's the closer you can get (at least without more context, cf below):Now the real answer to your problem might be a bit different: there's the (more or les) formal definition of what a "sequence" is, and there's the context in which the code you're porting is called and the author's intent. The author might have assumed that his function would only ever be passed lists, tuples, strings or bytes, in which case the test intent was indeed a misguided (I'd even say broken) and undocumented attempt to check for strings and bytes. Or the author might have assumed that his function would just never be passed a string or bytes, but then I can't understand why he would treat lists and tuples differently from other sequences.To make a long story short: you will have to study the context,  or eventually ask the author for clarification - if possible, of course.
