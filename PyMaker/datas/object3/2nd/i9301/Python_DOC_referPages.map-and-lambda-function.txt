I'm currently doing a hackerrank problem. The objective is to find the cubes of the first  Fibonacci numbers. The user inputs . So for example, if the user inputs 5, the output should be [0, 1, 1, 8, 27], since the first five Fibonacci numbers are [0, 1, 1, 2, 3].I've written the following code:I'm given the following code (which I cannot edit):The problem is that my code fails the test cases because it returns a map object instead of a list. How can I ensure it returns a list instead?
Just add ,I undeleted my comment because this is the is solution to map object, I don't think you can modify it before you actually called. as Ewoud said,  function acts differently in python3 and python2.
You can just put list(...) around it, so(I havent tested the rest of your code)Edit: If you are not to change the main function you either have to change the print or map function or use python 2.
If you can't edit the main function then use Python2.X instead of Python3.x. In Python3.x, map() function return iterator.Here's [a link] https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map
This should give you more than you need. I added a few extra bits like looping  and input validation just in case. Hope this helpsGeneral FormulaF(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)Get User inputCreate Fabonacci List based on user inputExtra Add in to loop the programMain section:Calls the functions defined aboveDisplays the outputs.
