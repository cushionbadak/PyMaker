Pandas is a great tool for working with tabular data. Here, you'd do:A few gotchas to look out for: if you have white space in the column names, you'll need to either clean that up, or use the exact column names in the above code (e.g.  instead of ).
Using :Output:
Here's a fairly readable way to do it that converts each row read into a  to simplify field access:Output:
