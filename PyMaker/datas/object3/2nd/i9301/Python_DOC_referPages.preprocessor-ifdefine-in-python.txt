How can I do something like in Python?
Python does not contain a preprocessor like the C family of languages. However, as a scripting language, as long as every line makes syntactic sense, you don't need to worry about symbols (functions and all) not being defined. You can also  libraries inside blocks such as those in  statements, and the imported symbols will be available with normal scope rules.One solution that I have used before is having the different parts in different files, I find it works great:
Short version: You can't.At least not without rolling your own script wrapper that executes some sort of home rolled preprocessor. You can do normal runtime tests, and you can define methods conditionally (which is sort of like compile-time definitions), so the same name refers to different functionality depending on top-level configuration, but the closest thing Python has to a compile time preprocessor is the  special variable. is processed during bytecode compilation as a constant  or  depending on whether Python in running with "optimizations" turned on (passing  when invoking Python has only two effects that I know of: making  be , and removing  statements).
