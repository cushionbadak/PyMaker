This question already has an answer here:How to get all subsets of a set? (powerset)                    13 answers                I am trying to implement a function to generate the powerset of a list . The general idea is that we walk through the elements of  and choose whether to include  or not. The problem I'm facing is that  ends up being equal to  (a singleton list with ) because (I think)  returns . This isn't a homework assignment, it's an exercise in Cracking the Coding Interview.
Take a look at the  example from the  recipes:For a  of integers up to the length of the given list, make all possible  and  them together as one object.
resultSource code for  can be found here which has a few neat optimizations:https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.combinations
Here's a recursive solution that does not use any modules:
