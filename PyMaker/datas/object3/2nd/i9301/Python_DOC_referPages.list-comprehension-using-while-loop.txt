Is there a way to use a while loop in a list comprehension.For example, I have a single line Fibonacci generator:but I'd like it to stop at a certain outcome, rather than just run a certain number of times. (i.e. all Fibonacci sequence numbers below 4,000,000)This is a question about list-comprehension, not about lists in general.The more generic phrasing might be this:
python don't have such feature of using  in a comprehension (which is like a map combined with filter), but you can accomplished that using other tools like making a function that do what you desire or using your best friend the itertools module. For exampleexample 1, with itertoolsexample 2, with a functionoh, I forgot to mention, but your formula for getting the Fibonacci numbers, even if mathematical correct, is doom to fail to get the real value for a large enough n, because floating point arithmetic rounding errorsthe point of divergence is very easy to found (using the above )so for all n>=72 what you get are not Fibonacci numbers...if you only care for all numbers in the sequence below 4,000,000 then that is not a problem of course as the limit is n=33
