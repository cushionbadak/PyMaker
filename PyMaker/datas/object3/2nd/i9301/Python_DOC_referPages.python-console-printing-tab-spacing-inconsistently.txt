I want to have real tabs in a print but  only puts spaces.Eg:How would i fix it so i can have all the firsts and all the seconds lined up. Eg:
You can use formatting to align the strings instead. For example, you can tell python that the first column should be 20 characters long, and the second should be 10, left aligned.For example:will print:The first formatting descriptor () here is saying: left align,  at least 20 characters,  because it's a string
Instead of using tab (), I suggest to use string formatting using printf-style formatting or :or
The Python  function sends strings to standard output. What standard output does with those strings depends on the output device. The default interpretation of  is to advance to the next tab stop, which by convention is the character position which is the next multiple of 8 after the position in which  occurs (counting character positions from the left beginning with 0). For example, if I run:I get:I got the above in IDLE.  occupies columns 0-7.  is in column 8, hence the next multiple of 8 (the next tab stop) after the tab is in column 16 -- which is indeed where you see . In the next two lines -- the next tab stop after the first word is in column 8. This shows that (at least in the IDLE shell) Python is using real tabs.Tabs in this sense are somewhat annoying. They can only be used to align variable-length string data with a certain amount of annoying difficulty. As others have indicated the solution is to not use tabs but instead use 
Compute the maximum width needed for each column and then use string formatting to compose a format which specifies the desired width:yields
