Is there an easy way to sort a list within a list so that the values go from least to greatest or vice versa? I can so far only find information on ordering the lists themselves based off the leading value.Here is an example: 
What you have is a list of lists, no tuples involved here, You can also do it with a combination of built-in methods  and :In Python3,  returns an iterator, so if you need it as a list, you need to convert it back with , otherwise, if you are using it in a loop then no need to convert it to a list. It saves memory this way.Edit:Replying to your comment, you can do something like:Or more compact but less readable:
Use a list comprehension to sort each element (each  object) in : is now:You could also do this:Then use  on that  object to actually turn it into a list...
it depend if you want to order them in-place or you want a new copy with the list orderer for the new copy, the other answer already show you how, for instancefor ordering them in-place use a for-loop and call  on them
