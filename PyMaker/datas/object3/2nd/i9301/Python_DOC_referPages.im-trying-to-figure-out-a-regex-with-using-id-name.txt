Questions:Why does it matches only 'xy'? Does \2 always refer to "x" within the group (.......)+??Answer Question 2 first:In this regex, you are using:Will try to match with yes-pattern if the group with given id or name exists, and with no-pattern if it doesnâ€™t. no-pattern is optional and can be omitted. For example, (<)?(\w+@\w+(?:.\w+)+)(?(1)>) is a poor email matching pattern, which will match with '' as well as 'user@host.com', but not with 'In the regex given , there is only one group before the question  that asks whether the second group has matched.  Since there is only one group the conditional will always be false, and thus will always try to match Answer Question 1:Yes, since there is only one group, the conditional will always match , and the entire regex only match (DOCS)
I find this website a good resource for learning about and testing different regex patterns.
