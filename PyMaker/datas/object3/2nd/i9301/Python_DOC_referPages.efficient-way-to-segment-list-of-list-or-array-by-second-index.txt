I am trying to segment a list of list into blocks based on the type of data in the sublist's second index (namely  or ).Example Data:This can be treated as a list of lists, as I said, or as a numpy array (i.e., ). Whichever is easier.I am trying for something like this (doesn't need to be identical):Sloppy attempt:Then I could simply pull out the data for based on  (which now contains ).However, it is hard to put into words just how terrible and ugly that code is. Something better would be great.
I might use :which gives me.. and I just noticed that I was using  as the index to group on, and you want  instead.  Well, that's left as an exercise for the reader. ;-)If you wanted finer control over the output (e.g. to handle the case where the start and end indices are the same), it'd be easier just to loop over the key/group pairs returned by  and yield whatever you like. Also note that  finds contiguous groups.  If your data is not necessarily contiguous, you could sort first instead.
