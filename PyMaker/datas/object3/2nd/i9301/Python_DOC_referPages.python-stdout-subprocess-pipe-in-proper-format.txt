My is code using Getting result in below format.But i want to count and get the columnnames which has the only  and  and Store them in variable want to use in further process . The number of   of  and  is dynamic.For example:-In this case i should get 3 variable 
In your case, I would go for regular expression where (?m) indicates multiline search,C(\d+) - C character, followed by numbers(?=.+[CB]LOB) - non-consuming unspecified character sequence, followed by BLOB or CLOBThis one-liner will give you list of all columns you are interested in.EDIT:This is a break-down - I replaced output with constant stringNext time, you should come more prepared
