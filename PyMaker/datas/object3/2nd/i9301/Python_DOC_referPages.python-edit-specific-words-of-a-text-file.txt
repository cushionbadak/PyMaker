Natural Text
My program is a basic Tkinter game with a scoreboard type system. This system stores the username and the number of attempts each user has had in a text file.For example, when it is the user's first time, it appends their name to the end of the text file as   [joe_bloggs, 1] with joe_bloggs being the username and 1 being the number of attempts. As its the user's first time, it's 1.I am trying to look for a way to 'update' or change the number '1' to increment by 1 each time. This text file stores all the users, i.e [Joe,1] [example1, 1] [example2, 2] in that format.Here is the code I currently have: Thanks in advance. 
A simple solution would be using the  module of the standard library:Output:Next session:Output:A “shelf” is a persistent, dictionary-like object. The difference with “dbm” databases is that the values (not the keys!) in a shelf can be essentially arbitrary Python objects — anything that the pickle module can handle. This includes most class instances, recursive data types, and objects containing lots of shared sub-objects. The keys are ordinary strings.You can convert the whole content into a dictionary:Adapted to your use case:If you don't always want to check if the user is already there, you can use a . First, create the file:Later, you just need to write :An example with multiple users and increments:Output:
You can use standard ConfigParser module to persist simple application states.
