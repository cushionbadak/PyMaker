It's been a while since I've used regex, and I feel like this should be simple to figure out. I have a web page full of links that looks like the string_to_match in the below code. I want to grab just the numbers in the links, like number "58" in the string_to_match. For the life of me I can't figure it out. 
Instead of using regular expressions, you can use a combination of HTML parsing (using  parser) to locate the desired link and extract the  attribute value and URL parsing, which in this case, we'll use regular expressions for:Prints .
I would recommend using  or , it's worth the learning curve....But if you still want to use regexp
