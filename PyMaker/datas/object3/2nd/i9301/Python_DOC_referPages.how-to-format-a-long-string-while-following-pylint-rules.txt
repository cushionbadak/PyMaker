Natural Text
I have a very simple problem that I have been unable to find the solution to, so I thought I'd try my "luck" here.I have a string that is created using variables and static text altogether. It is as follows:However my problem is that pylint is complaining about this string reprensentation as it is too long. And here is the problem. How would I format this string representation over multiple lines without it looking weird and still stay within the "rules" of pylint?At one point I ended up having it looking like this, however that is incredible "ugly" to look at:I found that it would follow the "rules" of pylint if I formatted it like this:Which is much "prettier" to look at, but in case I didn't have the "str()" casts, how would I go about creating such a string?I doubt that there is a difference between pylint for Python 2.x and 3.x, but if there is I am using Python 3.x.
Don't use so many  calls. Use string formatting:If you do have a long expression with a lot of parts, you can create a longer logical line by using  parentheses:This would work for breaking up a string you are using as a template in a formatting operation, too:
