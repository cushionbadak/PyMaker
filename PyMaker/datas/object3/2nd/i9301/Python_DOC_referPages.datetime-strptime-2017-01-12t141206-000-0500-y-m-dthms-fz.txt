Assuming Python 3, the format  may not be a valid format character for  on your platform.  The  docs reference  for the formats, and  isn't in the  list.  However, the format string reference says that The full set of format codes supported varies across platforms, because Python calls the platform C libraryâ€™s strftime() function, and platform variations are common.On my test system, which is Cygwin with Py 3.4.5, I used:and got I checked the man pages for  and found that I don't have , and  should be lowercase.

if it is a string, e.g. load from a JSON file, you can try returns:
