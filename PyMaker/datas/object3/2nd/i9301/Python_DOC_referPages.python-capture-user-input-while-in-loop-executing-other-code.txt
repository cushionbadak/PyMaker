I am running sequential code in a loop that is doing various computations, and occasionally printing out results that I monitor in the console. What I'd like to do is be able to hit keyboard buttons, while the program is running, and then save and process that input (e.g. as a command to change some parameter) on the next start iteration of that loop. Here's the structure of the code I'm running: Would the solution involve some notion of threading or interrupt? I could probably come up with a solution that involves file I/O, which wouldn't be terrible, but I was thinking maybe Python has something simpler that would work. Thanks!
If you want python to do two things at once (get user input and compute) at the same time the easiest thing to do is use separate threads (separate processes are harder and not necessary in this instance). The high level  library is quite easy to get started with and I suggest a once-over of the docs, but here's a quick example:
Use a thread to run the  function and pass  to it as a thread argument:Any modification to  in the main thread will be seen by the code in the thread. Be sure to protect access to  using a :Putting it all together:The  class allows us to create an object to which we can add arbitrary attributes.
