I ran the following code in Python3.5.2 and got the corresponding output I'm unable to understand what is the meaning of this output.Why didn't the output come like thisWhen i used a list to contain these tuples the output was satisfactoryNote : I'm a newbie in python and when i posted this question i didn't know about map function so i didn't refer this question Why does map return a map object instead of a list in Python 3?
That's purely a choice of design in Python 3 because  is often used in loops/list comprehension, so no need to generate a full-fledged list and allocate memory for a temporary object which is very likely to be unused afterwards.Most people use  so they don't even notice the generator aspect, and the memory/CPU footprint is lower.To get an actual  or , you have to explicitly force the iteration like you did.(note that as opposed to ,  or ,  has always been a generator, even in python 2.7, good choice from the start)
