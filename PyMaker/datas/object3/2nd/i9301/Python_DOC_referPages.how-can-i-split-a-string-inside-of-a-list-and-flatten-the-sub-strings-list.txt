I have a python script with this list:I have tried this:To get this:Unfortunately my code keeps overwriting the the elements in the list, and I'm left with this:How can I modify the script to allow me to split a string inside of a list and then insert the new sub-strings into the position of the original string without overwriting the other elements in the list?
It would probably be easier to make a new list:
split will return a list, you don't need to check if ';' is in the block:So now the only thing you need is to add all the list together, with the function sum. 
You can create a new list to hold the results instead of modifying the original list while looping through it:Inspired by @Jblasco's answer, you can also use :
You may achieve this via using nested list comprehension expression:where content hold by  will be:
in place editing of lists while iterating over it is not a good idea.As the other answers say, make a new list. If you're into list comprehensions (and make your head explode a little), try this:
out:Just  the list together and  again.And in the Document,  a list is not recommended:For some use cases, there are good alternatives to sum(). The  preferred, fast way to concatenate a sequence of strings is by calling  ''.join(sequence). To add floating point values with extended  precision, see math.fsum(). To concatenate a series of iterables,  consider using .
