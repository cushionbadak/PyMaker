I need a way to determine the space remaining on a disk volume using python on linux, Windows and OS X. I'm currently parsing the output of the various system calls (df, dir) to accomplish this - is there a better way?
Note that you must pass a directory name for  to work( works on both files and directories). You can get a directory namefrom a file with .Also see the documentation for  and .
Install psutil using . Then you can get the amount of free space in bytes using:
You could use the wmi module for windows and os.statvfs for unixfor windowfor unix or linux
If you dont like to add another dependency you can for windows use ctypes to call the win32 function call directly. 
A good cross-platform way is using psutil: http://pythonhosted.org/psutil/#disks(Note that you'll need psutil 0.3.0 or above).
From Python 3.3 you can use shutil.disk_usage("/").free from standard library for both Windows and UNIX :)
If you're running python3:Using with  name-regularization works:Orgiving you the total, used, & free space in MB.
You can use df as a cross-platform way. It is a part of GNU core utilities. These are the core utilities which are expected to exist on every operating system. However, they are not installed on Windows by default (Here, GetGnuWin32 comes in handy).df is a command-line utility, therefore a wrapper required for scripting purposes.For example: 
The os.statvfs() function is a better way to get that information for Unix-like platforms (including OS X). The Python documentation says "Availability: Unix" but it's worth checking whether it works on Windows too in your build of Python (ie. the docs might not be up to date).Otherwise, you can use the pywin32 library to directly call the GetDiskFreeSpaceEx function.
Below code returns correct value on windows
I Don't know of any cross-platform way to achieve this, but maybe a good workaround for you would be to write a wrapper class that checks the operating system and uses the best method for each.For Windows, there's the GetDiskFreeSpaceEx method in the win32 extensions.
