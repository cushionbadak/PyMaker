I have a test that passes in Python2 and fails in Python3, I'm trying to find out why. The test fails at the following line:With the error:If I debug the test, and print the object in the debugger, I can see the following:If I do the same in Python3 debugger, I get this:Any ideas why this might be happening? The object looks exactly the same if I print it in the debugger without the , why is this failing for Python3?
So I found the answer after some digging, this indeed is a difference between Python2 and Python3, a nuisant one at that.It turns out the type  in the code is actually a named tuple. In Python2,  is added as convenient property wrapper of , but this isn't done in Python3:https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.somenamedtuple._asdict (find  here)https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.somenamedtuple._asdictSo it looks like  is in fact the source of truth, and should be used for portable 2to3 code.It's worth mentioning that  is also a wrapper that exists in Python2 only.
I wrote a little function, I'm probably missing a few edge cases but it satisfied the few little testcases I wrote (probably broken for multiple inheritance)
