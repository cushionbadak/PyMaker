What is the intended way to change directory using the Python  (Documentation) functionality?Lets assume I create a  object as follows:Currently I just know the following, but that seems to undermine the idea of .
Based on the comments I realized that  does not help changing directories and that directory changes should be avoided if possible.Since I needed to call bash scripts outside of Python from the correct directory, I opted for using a context manager for a cleaner way of changing directories similar to this answer:A good alternative is to use the  parameter of the  class as in this answer.If you are using Python <3.6 and  is actually a , you need  in the  statements.
In the Python 3.6 or above,  can deal with  object directly. In fact, the  object can replace most  paths in standard libraries.os.chdir(path) Change the current working directory to path.This function can support specifying a file descriptor. The descriptor  must refer to an opened directory, not an open file.New in version 3.3: Added support for specifying path as a file  descriptor on some platforms.Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.This may help in the future projects which do not have to be compatible with 3.5 or below.
For those who do not fear a third-party library:then:or if you want to do it without the context manager:
