I need to read a single char from stdin and then unread it so that the next time an input method is called, that char should be included in the result. In C++, cin.putback does this. What is the equivalent in Python?Please note that I don't need to intermingle different input methods/functions.
In Python 3,  has a property called  that is an instance of  and so has a  method.  This should allow you to do , which would let you look at the next character in standard input without reading (consuming) it.
There isn't a simple analogue in Python.Your best bet is probably to read the characters into an list in your program, and then later consume them from that list.
I found a Python module called CIn which does exactly what I want. It is available on GitHub: https://github.com/abhishekkr200802/CIn
