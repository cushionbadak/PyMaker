This question already has an answer here:python and / or operators return value [duplicate]                    4 answers                I'm a beginner and this is a relatively simple question but I'm having trouble trying to figure it out. When you type "True or 5" into python, it returns True, and when you type "5 or True" it returns 5. Why is this? Why don't they return the same answer? Thanks!
Basically what happens with  is it looks to the left operand and evaluates  on it. If that returns , the left operand is returned. Otherwise the right operand is returned.SoIs equivalent with:And chaining results in a chain of  statements like:is equivalent to:As you might notice, if you do the math with booleans, you see  indeed behaves as a logical or operator. But it is more advanced in the sense that you can feed it all kinds of values.For  the standard builtin  is used.The same holds for  by the way:Is equivalent with:
The  operator short-circuits when the first value is truthy (i.e. evaluates to ). When that happens, that first value is returned.So,  short-circuits on the , so it returns .  short-circuits on the  (because 5 is truthy, which is nonzero for integers), so it returns .
 returns the first operand that's truthy (or the last operand if they're both falsy). This can be used to check for the validity of data, and default if a value is, say, .Especially in languages like JavaScript, this is a common idiom to give a function optional parameters.
