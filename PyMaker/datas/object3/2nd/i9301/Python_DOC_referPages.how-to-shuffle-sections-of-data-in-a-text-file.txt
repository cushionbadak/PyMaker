Natural Text
I have a text file which contains the pixel values of document images. The data mentioned between Begin & End tags consist of a unique id, the ground truth value and the feature vector for each line of the document image. However, I want to shuffle the sections of data as units. Can anybody point out a method as to how I can randomize or shuffle this data?and so on.I need to shuffle the entire content between the BEGIN and END tags. 
I'll assume that the section delimiters are supposed to be uniform, and the variations in the delimiters in the data given in the question are typos.Shuffling the sections is easy, once we split the data into sections. I've created some fake data with 5 sections to illustrate the process.outputThe lineallows us to iterate over the lines in the  string as if we were iterating over the lines in a file. To use this code on an actual file instead, replace that line withand indent the  block so that it's inside the  block.
