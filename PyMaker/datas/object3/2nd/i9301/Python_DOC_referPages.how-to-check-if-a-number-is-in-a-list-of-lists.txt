so I've been having trouble checking if the number 0 is in a group of lists within another list. These rows make up the maze for a pacman type game I'm making so the point of this is to check if pacman has eaten all of the coins.Here's my code:So I have tried  But the if statement will execute whether 0 is in (maze) or not. Any help would be appreciated, thanks.
You'll have to loop through each list in  and check whether there is a 0 or not:The great thing about the  function is that it stops looping through  once it finds a 0.
With your first attempt, your only testing for  in the top-level list. Of course, the top-level list only has lists, thus, your test fails.You must iterate through each sublist in . You could use a manually for loop, which is a valid option:but Python provides a better way with the  function(which is basically a better implementation of the above function):Return True if any element of the iterable is true. If the iterable is empty, return False[...].But you must also use the  operator(know as  in other languages) to negate the possibly return true value of . Thus, the full solution would be:
 was already mentioned but you could also flatten your lists (for example using ) and check if the item is contained:Like  this stops as soon as one is found. Just to mention it because it's something that is often overlooked: generators and iterators (like ) generally support the  operator.
Loop through the sublist. Also use  It will check if there is any 0 in the list
as long as i understand your problem you can use the following code:
