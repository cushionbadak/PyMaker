Natural Text
Using this to work out a shortest pathWhat i'm trying to do is rather than have the nodes and distances in the program is to have them in a text file and have it load them rather than the ones in the program. Is what i have so far however for the life of me cannot fine how to then take this data in data[] and put it into the graph so it can be used for the algorithm. Any direction would be appreciated!In the code it is listed as this;However i would like to put this in a text file so it can be changed easily. An example of the text file id like to use is;
You could do something like this:File: graph_info.txtCode: your_code.py
This is really just refining Emerson Cardoso's excellent answer. Since you're creating a comma-separated values file, you should use the  module to parse it. Also I don't see a big need to create a list of the vertices/edges before parsing them -- all you should need is a set of the vertex names so you can create any vertices you haven't seen yet.Â
