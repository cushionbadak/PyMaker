It is for a dynamic ring topology project. Specifically, I need to name each node: s1,s2...sz, and name each host h1-1,h1-2,...hz-n. So z is the number of the nodes, and n is the number of the host connected to each node. So I have a list of the nodes, I am trying to use the node as a key to have another list of hosts, then I can put them in a dictionary for use. Just how can I achieve this goal? The example graph is as below:
I think you are looking for something along the lines of this:This will print ['s1', 's2', 's3'] and {'s2': ['h2-1', 'h2-2'], 's3': ['h3-1', 'h3-2'], 's1': ['h1-1', 'h1-2']} if you use 3 and 2 as command line arguments. Note that dictionaries are unordered.Or use this:
