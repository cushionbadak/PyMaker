This question already has an answer here:How can I read inputs as numbers?                    19 answers                I am learning Python and it is my first programming language. So I tried making a number guessing game where the goal is to guess a number that is within 1 and 100. Every time the player inputs a guess, the program will update the range of possibility. Example: the answer is 50, the player guess 40, then the program would prompt the player to guess a number between 40 and 100... until the player gets the number. Here is my working code:This code works as intended, however within the While loop for the assignments of variable 'low' and 'upp', the program would not work if I put 'upp=guess' instead. A TypeError would occur, and it seems like 'upp' (or 'low') has become a string instead of a number.My question is how did the variable 'upp' become a string while the variable 'guess' is a number?
All data using the  function in python is by default interpreted as a string. In order to change it to an int, simply use , which is what you already are doing. It's just a little technicality in PythonRead this for more info:The function then reads a line from input, converts it to a string (stripping a trailing newline), and returns that.https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input
You can convert string to int and vice versa any time by :Output: 55Output: "55"
