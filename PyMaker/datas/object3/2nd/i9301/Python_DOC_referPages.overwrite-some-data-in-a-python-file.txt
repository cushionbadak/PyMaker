Natural Text
I was hoping someone could help me, I am currently trying to add some data into a text file, however the way I am doing it isnt giving me what I want. I Have a file with 20+ lines in it with text and want to overwrite the first 30 characters of the file with 30 new characters. The code I have deletes all the content and adds the 30 characters only. Please help :)is there something wrong with this to why its reoving all of the original data too instead of simply overwriting over it?
One way is to read the whole file into a single string, create a new string with first 30 characters replaced and rewrite the whole file. This can be done like this:Ideally, you have to check that file contains more than 30 characters after it's read. Also, do not use file and other reserved names as variable names.
