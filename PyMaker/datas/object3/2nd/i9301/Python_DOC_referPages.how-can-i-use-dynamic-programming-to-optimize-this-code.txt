Daulat Ram is an affluent business man. After demonetization, IT raid was held at his accommodation in which all his money was seized. He is very eager to gain his money back, he started investing in certain ventures and earned out of them. On the first day, his income was Rs. X, followed by Rs. Y on the second day. Daulat Ram observed his growth as a function and wanted to calculate his income on the Nth day.The function he found out was FN = FN-1 + FN-2 + FN-1×FN-2Given his income on day 0 and day 1, calculate his income on the Nth day (yeah Its that simple).INPUT:The first line of input consists of a single integer T denoting number of test cases.Each of the next T lines consists of three integers F0, F1 and N respectively.OUTPUT:For each test case, print a single integer FN, as the output can be large, calculate the answer modulo 109+7.CONSTRAINTS:1 ≤ T ≤ 1050 ≤ F0, F1, N ≤ 109
a simple way to optimize is to cache the results of your function. python provides a mechanism for just hat with its . all you need to do is decorate your function with this:you can tweak  a bit for your needs. and it plays very nice with the python garbage collector as it stores  to your objects only.test cases:prints:to get your answer modulo an integer (not clear about the modulus in your question) you can do this:
You could just start execute the function and assign  to  and result to . Iterate over this  times and the desired result is in :Input:Output:
Someone gave this answer to me and it worked but i don't know how?Complexity O(logn)
