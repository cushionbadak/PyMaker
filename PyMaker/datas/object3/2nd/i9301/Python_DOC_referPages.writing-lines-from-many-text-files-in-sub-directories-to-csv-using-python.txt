I want to derive some statistics out of a large amount of data files that all reside in their own folder. Using python, I want to create a single csv file, look for the data files starting from a root folder at a fairly high level (new folders are added all the time), and write a row with some key values from every file. I've done this before using the  method combined with , but it's giving me problems this time around. When I run the code below, (with a file called XY.txt in my D:/temp/ folder) I get an error that reads: 'unexpected unindent' at the line that reads  I have moved the indentation around but that just moves the mentioned error with it. Can anybody advise me on how to achieve the desired row writing?I'm setting this up with rows so I can extract many more items from the .txt file, but I have not included those in the code above for clarity. *updated code to reflect answer: now the  sequence is ended with the  statement, in which all the information collected during the  loop is written to a line.
try attempts to run the block of code, if it fails then it runs the block of code in except. There is an optional finally clause which runs irrespective of whether the code in try succeeds.For example, the function in the following code snippet will return 2 when executedI would recommend an except clause which would print out a helpful message if the code fails.Reference : https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#exceptions
