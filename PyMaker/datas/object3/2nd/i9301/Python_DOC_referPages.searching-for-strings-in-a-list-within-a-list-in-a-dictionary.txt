I am trying to determine best way to search the values of my dictionary keys. I cant seem to find a function that will allow me to search for specific strings within a list of lists.  I am trying to get the program to display semesters that a certain class type was taken. i.e. input "ENGR" and have it return that it shows up in "fall14","fall15", and "spring16". Can someone point me in the right direction regarding the pulling of data from a list within a list? I am thinking I may need to restructure the way I defined my keys.
Assuming that the string you want to compare will always be at the 0th index of your nested tuple, you may match the content using  like:which will print:
You need to go another level down. Your loop gives you a list of sets. You then need to iterate over those sets
Give this a try. You need to keep drilling down into your data structures.
