I have a list of dates: I want to convert these dates to a datetime format i.e Jan2016 = 201601My first thought was to create a dict of months and their associated numbers and then map that over the list. Here is my current code:The output of this code is a dict like so:What is the most pythonic solution to this problem?
As @Martijin commented, you can not have a datetime as , but if you want a string instead, you can use  and  from datetime module to convert:In case you are not familiar with conversion specification,  stands for month abbreviation names,  Year with century,  Month as decimal number(0-12)
hello you can try with  a map()ouput:['201601', '201602', '201603']
You can use the following:For your list, you can combine the above with a list comprehension:Note: Since the day is missing in your dates list, 1 would be used for day (for  items).
