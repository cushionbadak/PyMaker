I have a database of badly formatted database of strings. The data looks like this:when it should be like this:The problem I have is that when that doubly escaped strings comes from the database they are not being decoded to the chinese characters as they should be. So suppose I have this variable;  and if I print that  the result is a string of codepoints What can I do at this point to convert  to actual unicode characters ?
First encode this string as  and then decode it with  which will handle the  for you:You can then strip the  if necessary
You could remove the quotation marks with  and  at every . This would give you the characters as strings representing hex numbers. Then for each string you could convert it to  and back to string with :
Based on what you wrote, the database appears to be storing an eval-uable ascii representation of a string with non-unicode chars.Python has a built-in function for this.The only difference is the use of  instead of  for the needed internal quote.
