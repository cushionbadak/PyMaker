This question already has an answer here:Parsing boolean values with argparse                    13 answers                I am trying to use the argparse module to make my Python program accept flexible command-line arguments. I want to pass a simple boolean flag, and  saying  or  to execute the appropriate branch in my code. Consider the following. When I tried to execute it with  I got the resultWhy is this?!! The intflag seems to be parsed correctly, yet the boolean flag is invariably parsed as  even if I mention explicitly in the command-line arguments that I want it to be . Where am I going wrong? 
You are trying to turn the string  into a boolean:That won't work because the string  is a non-empty value. All non-empty strings have a  boolean value.Use a  action instead:Now when you use that switch,  is stored, otherwise the default is  (set by ).
