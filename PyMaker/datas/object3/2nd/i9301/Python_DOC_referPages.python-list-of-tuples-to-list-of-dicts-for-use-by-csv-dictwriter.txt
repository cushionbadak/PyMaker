i have this scenarioI need to create below structureAny better way of doing this(like a python expert)above code will give the desired result, but i am looking for a one liner solution some thing like belowoutput: but this gives list as individual dict's rather than a combined dict. Any ideas???
You could write a generator that iterates over data. Then for each item in data use  to generate iterable of  tuples that you pass to :Update The example above uses generator expression instead of  since the code writing CSV would only need one row at a time. Generating the full list would require much more memory with no benefit.
