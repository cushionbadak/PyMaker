This question already has an answer here:How do I do exponentiation in python?                    3 answers                I am running this little loop on a Jupyter notebookNo matter what I enter as an argument, I seem to always get an output around 0.003What is going on?One guess is that python understands that the result of the loop will simply be count = reps, and quits the loop?But if I run this insteadIt does take longer as I increase the argument, even though the result of the loop is still quite simply count = reps*sin(reps).
 is xor and not exponentation:That's a big number but not like with exponentation: , that returns:That also takes a "while" to iterate over.A good reference for the operators and their precedence is avaiable in the python documentation:^     - Bitwise XOR**    - Exponentiation
