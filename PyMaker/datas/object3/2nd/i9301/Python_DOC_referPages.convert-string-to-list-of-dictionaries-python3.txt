Using Python 3.5.2, what is the best way to convert a string into a list of dictionaries? I'm scraping a site, with the following being returned as a list of length 1:(Formatted for readability) I tried converting that to a str, assigning it to 's' and then using  json.loads(s), but that didn't work.I'd like to have a list object whereby I can access values with something like:Thanks
We can now retrieve data by key:
Use the re module to preprocess the string, then use the json module to parse it into a dictionary.Assuming you have the data converted to a string, and you are know that certain rules apply to the content*, you can try the following:The regular expression  will parse the string and identify all characters  that are not preceded by  or followed by the same, so that the  in the strings in the data can be escaped properly.*by rules i mean, that you have to know, that the used regular expression finds the correct characters - if the data source can provide that consistency, the code above should work (extend the  and  parts with the necessary characters to match all data
