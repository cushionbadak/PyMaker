Natural Text
I've looked at other questions and found out how to find what line a word is on in a text file but when using it in my code it doesnt do what i want it to do.So i run this and type in the username i used in my signup program and its meant to check what line its on so it knows which password is paired with it. But for some reason the readline bit doesnt know what line to read to set the variable.
You can use linecache standard library's module to go to a specific line directly PS no need to open the filefor your case  
As the commenters pointed out  does not take in a line number as an argument. One way to read a specific line is to iterate through the file until you reach the desired line.Line-by-line explanation:Opens the  file in read mode (denoted by the ) and assigns its file object to a variable named .Normally if we wanted to simply loop through a file line by line we could doHowever, we need to know the line number associated with each line so that we can find a specific line. enumerate() let's us associate each line with a line number that gets assigned to the variable . The  argument in  specifies that  will start at  instead of the default, . In short, this statement says that we are going to loop through the lines in  and count them as we go.Our for loop will go through each line in the file, but we only care about the line with our username/password. Here we check to see if the current line number  is the line number we're looking for.If it is the line number we're looking for we set the  variable to the contents of the line.Keyword to exit a loop. After we have found the line we are looking for we don't need to go through the rest of the file, so we  to save time.
