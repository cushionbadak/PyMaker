This question already has an answer here:how to create a random array from a list, each value in the array is not duplicate in python                    2 answers                I've struggled with this small piece of code for a while now. I'm trying to get the program to randomly generate 5 numbers. The problem was that the program could generate the same number twice. I'm trying to make sure that there is no duplicate numbers within the 5 generated with an algorithm. However, the code still prints duplicates. Any ideas what I'm doing wrong??

I think the easiest way to do this is to use :This does sampling without replacement, which seems to be what you want.Note that  selects a sample of size  from a population  (list or otherwise), and the bounds of  are , while the bounds of  are  - so you need to add 1 to the end of your  call.
You could just use built-in numpy functionality:Documentation here. Note that  has a  keyword as well to switch between sampling with and without replacement, like so:Note that all of these rely on  to build the array to sample from, so that you'd sample from  - if you want to sample from 1-10 you can do:
You can add each random number to a list and then check in that list to see if it has already been made:Note that while this method is simple to understand it is not very efficient when you are wanting a large subset of the original set of numbers, for example trying to get 1000000 numbers from the set of numbers 1 to 1000000 would take a long time due to trying numbers already added to the list.
