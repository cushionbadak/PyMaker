I have a model in Django that uses uuid this way:The thing is, when I generated 2 objects, one after the other, I got this:And then:From what I know every uuid is generated at random, but the probability of collision is very low, how are they exactly generated when I get these 2 uuid that are almost the same? (it differs only in the last number of the first block) and how probable is this?. Is there a more secure way of doing this? The thing is that I have a set of clients that each get a unique uuid by e-mail, if they could just change one character and get to another client's uuid that would be a problem.
You're using , which as the docs state:Generate a UUID from a host ID, sequence number, and the current time.You should be using , which generates a random uuid.
It uses  to do it (that's your default value). See the docs:Generate a UUID from a host ID, sequence number, and the current time.  If node is not given, getnode() is used to obtain the hardware  address. If clock_seq is given, it is used as the sequence number;  otherwise a random 14-bit sequence number is chosen.There are other algorithms, maybe  is what you are looking for.
