I am running some code in which I am expecting user to insert fraction which will be computed and stored as a float value in a variable.I am using the following command. It works fine when I give input such as :But something like  gives me an error. I know what the problem is, I would like to know if there is an alternative way to input a fraction which gets solved and stored as a float in a variable.
As noted by Josh Lee, wrap it in a  () and then cast it to :this accept floats and strings that have a form of:as noted in its docs.You should of course wrap it in a  to guard against unexpected input that doesn't abide to that form.
