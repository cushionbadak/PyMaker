I want to delete the achievement  from the list - but I don't know the category name(). The achievement will always be one level down, but maybe in a different category other that python. How can I do this?
What about using del, and the .keys() method?  I don't know how your dictionary is going to be structured, but assuming that "name" will always refer to the achievement you want to delete:Unfortunately, you will need to iterate over every top-level element in the dictionary, to search through all the sub dictionaries.
