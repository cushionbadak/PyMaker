This question already has an answer here:Limiting floats to two decimal points                    22 answers                I wrote a very simple code in Python.I need to print all the numbers between  and  (including  and ) in steps of . The integers should be without the suffix , i.e. the output should be:Here is my code:Here is my output:I don't need all this zeros .
Taking advantage of Python's string formatting capabilities, you can reduce your whole loop to one line:Output:ExplanationThis gives you  for multiples of 10 for  and  for others:Now, you can use this for the keyword argument  to determine the number of decimals in your output:
You can print the floating point numbers rounded to 1 digit after the decimal point like so:The second line formats d as a string representation of a float number rounded with 1 digit(comming from the ) after the decimal point. 
You could use round or format 
Change your last line into:This will format your numbers showing only one decimal position.
Output:
you can use the  notation. That will limit the number of decimals to be printedOUTPUT
