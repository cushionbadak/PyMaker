I noticed that when writing to files in Python, the contents are written to the file once it is closed.For example:In this example "testing" will be written after waiting 20 seconds.How and why does this happen? Why not just writing to the file simultaneously?
You are seeing the effects of buffering.  Disk I/O uses buffers to improve performance, and you have not written enough data to the buffer for it to flush.Write more data, or close the file, both cause the buffer to be flushed. Alternatively, set the buffer size to a very small number (the number of bytes the buffer will hold):The options  and  have special meaning;  would disable buffering altogether (only available for binary mode files) and  is the default for text files (using line buffering, write a newline to flush).That also means that if you have a text file, you could write a newline to trigger flush:Last but not least, you could flush explicitly by using the  method:
