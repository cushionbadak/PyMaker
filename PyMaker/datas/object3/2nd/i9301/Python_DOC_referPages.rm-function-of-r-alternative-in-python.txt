How to remove the variables in python to clear ram memory in python?R :python:How to clear the single variables or a group of variables?
python memory cleanup is managed by the garbage collector. on CPython it is based on reference counting. you can call the garbage collector explicitly like this:this can be done after calling a function that uses large variables in terms of ram.Note that you do not have to call this function explicitly as the garbage collector will be called eventually to free up ram automatically.if you still want to explicitly remove a variable you can use the del statement (as written before) like this:del statementto better understand what  does and its limitations lets take a look at how python stores variables on ram.the above code creates a reference between the name  to the list  which is stored on the heap.  is just a pointer to that list.in this example we have the reference  and the list on the heap , but what is this new  variable? its just another pointer, meaning now we have two pointers to the same  list.returning to the  statement, if we delete one variable it wont affect the list or the other variableso here we will not free up the list, only decrease the reference counting to the list but we still have  pointing to it.to overcome this we can use the weakref module to point  to the list and when  is deleted the list is also deleted.Bottom lineuse  after heavy memory functionsuse  to delete all pointers to a specific object to free it upuse  module to avoid holding objects on the ram after all other references to them are deleted
