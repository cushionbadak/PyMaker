I was wondering how I could limit something like this too use only 10 threads at one time
Use Python's ThreadPoolExecutor with max_workers argument set to 10.Something like this:`The  will automatically allocate threads as needed, limiting maximum number of allocation to 10. The first argument in  is the function name, the arguments are simply passed as comma-separated values. waits for all threads to complete execution.
Use the  and tell it that you want 10 threads. ...and you will have all the results in .
(for both Python 2.6+ and Python 3)Use the  from  module:The only thing is that it is not well documented...
I wrote this nested loop to cap threads to a variable.This code relies on a preset array of commands to process.I have borrowed some elements from other answers for thread launch.
