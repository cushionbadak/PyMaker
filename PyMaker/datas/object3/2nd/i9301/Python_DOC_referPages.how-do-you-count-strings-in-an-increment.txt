This question already has an answer here:Counting repeated characters in a string in Python                    15 answers                I have an array of number which I changed to stringI should have ['1', '4', '2', '3'].I wanted to count how many 1~9 there are in the array so that 1 = 1 time(s), 2 = 1 time(s) ... 5 = 0 time(s), 6 = 0 time(s)...My solution to this wasbut since it is a string, this method does not work.I tried using then as you might have guessed, it's only looking for r.So how would you go about this?Thanks in advance.
the python  module offers a  for just that:and then print withif you insist that also the digits that do not occur in your string appear in the counter, you can initialize the counter will all digits set to zero:
I guess...
Here's another possible solution which generates the results as a series of tuples:Output
