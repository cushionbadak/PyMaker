Natural Text
I'm trying to find a certain word in a file and want to print the next line when a condition is met.The string 'P/E' will be present 4 times in the file, each time in a different line.When executed, the code prints the next line after the first 2 occurrences of 'P/E' normally. It then again goes back and prints the same first 2 occurrences again and exits. The loop is not proceeding after those first 2 occurrences; it kind of repeats the process and exits.I checked the data file to see if my output is the actual result, but all next lines are different after 'P/E'.How can I resolve this? Thanks.
 with just one argument only finds the first occurrence.  You'd have to give it a starting point to find elements past the previous index,  takes a second argument that tells it where to start searching from.However, you don't need to use ; that's very inefficient; it requires a full scan through the list, testing each line until a match is found.Just use the  function to add indices as you loop:Be careful, there is a chance  is not a valid index; if you find  in the very last line of the  list you'll get an . You may have to add a  test.Note that using  reads all of the file into memory in one go. Try to avoid this; you could loop directly over the file, and remember the previous line instead:
