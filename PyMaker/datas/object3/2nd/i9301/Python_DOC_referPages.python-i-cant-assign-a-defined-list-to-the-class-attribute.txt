basically i have to return a list of runners with the same speed category when initialize a runner, but I can't assign the lists I defined above to the class attribute, is there anyway to fix it?
You have to explicitly specify the class when accessing class variables:
You can use a dict, set each catgory name as a key and the value is a list of all the runners in that category.here is a simple implementation 
There are couple of things you have to modify in your code:The indentation of the  method needs to be indented within the class definition.As @Tamas points out you need to explicitly state that the variables are class variable.As @taoufik mentions, it might be convenient to define a dictionary instead.A  method should not return anything (except ). Since your requirement is to return the runners, you could add an additional method as @taofik suggested (or you can just print them once created as shown below).Here's an updated version of the code. Hope it helps.
