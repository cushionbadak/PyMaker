Natural Text
I am a new python developer and I having a bit of an issue with dictionaries. When I attempt to scrape the data for the dictionary from a website there is blank spaces in the data, such as this code snippet, showing the data with the space, just to clarify I am trying to grab the number before 'ref'So my question is how do i remove the blank spaces before and after the 'a' classes text
Your PNG shows that the space is in a URL. I would useurllib.unquote(string)https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html#url-quoting
