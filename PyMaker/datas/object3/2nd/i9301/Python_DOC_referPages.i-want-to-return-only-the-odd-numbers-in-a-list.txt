My issue here is that the code filters out the even numbers correctly which is what I want, however it stops at seven and doesn't display number 9  which is what I would expect it to do. I've tried going over my code but I can't seem to find the issue    
You should just directly loop through your values instead of indicesOtherwise if you wanted to use  you would have to index into your For brevity, list comprehensions are well-suited for this type of task
Is a simple list comprehension that returns
This is because you are starting your range() function of your for loop from 0 and ending at len(numbers)-1 (which is 9 in your case), python range() already will run till end-1: for eg: will print no's:012345678and that's why your 9 is not here in the output.you don't have to start your loop from 0.If you are starting from 0 you can arrange your for loop like this:1)2)Or you can code like more pythonic way.
