Actually, it should be capital S:
ValueError: Invalid format stringYou're using the wrong formatter i.e. it has to be upper case 'S'  - here's datetime's  reference.UnicodeEncodeError: 'locale' codec can't encode character '\uff33' in  position 1: Illegal byte sequencethe \uff33 is basically the the full width latin letter 'S' - the one you edited to get rid of previous .Solution/way-outs:1.Use raw string i.e. prefix your string with an 'r'2.If you're using  to convert from unicode to encoded text / bytes - instead use   to encode the string.
