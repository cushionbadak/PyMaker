With this code I am trying to generate simple multiplication tables. The program should ask for input and multiple that number in a range up to 15 and the generate the multiplication table for the number. After the if_name_ == 'main':      line I end up with a syntax error after the colon. I normally program in python 2, so python 3 is a bit new to me but I'm not sure what the difference is. Below I have listed the short but full code. Any help would be much appreciated. 
As @Maroun Maroun said right, it has to be  . But you wont need it. Just write it at the bottom : Should work, too.EDIT: In the official docs :https://docs.python.org/3/library/main.html
should be :Notice that both variable  and  has two underscores around them and that there must be a space between the if keyword and the start of the condition.
