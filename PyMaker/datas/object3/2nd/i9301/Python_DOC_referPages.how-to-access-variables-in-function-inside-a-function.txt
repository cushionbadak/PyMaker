If you're using Python 3 (and it looks like you are), there's an amazing way to tackle this issue:Here,  isn't global as it would've been defined outside both functions otherwise. It also isn't local to  as it's defined outside it. So, it's non local. More info about :Python nonlocal statementPython 3.6 docsQuick guide about  in Python 3
