How would one go about turning a list with tuples inside it, in the form of,into a list with ints in it, like,in the most efficient way possible? I've tried with recursion but it's too memory expensive for large lists (thousands of tuples).
You could use  for converting every tuple:Update Since question was asking for efficient method here are measurements for suggested answers:Output:
One way to approach the problem is to cast to string each of the integers in sublists, join and convert to :Or, using the power of tens (a variation of already posted answer by @AChampion):
It's relatively simple to convert a list of digits to a number. Convert them to strings  and convert back to . Or you can do it more mathematically:Note: don't use  as a variable name as this will hide the python  type.
You may also use little bit of mathematics to achieve this. Here I am multiplying the digits in tuple with power of  in reverse order to get the number.
