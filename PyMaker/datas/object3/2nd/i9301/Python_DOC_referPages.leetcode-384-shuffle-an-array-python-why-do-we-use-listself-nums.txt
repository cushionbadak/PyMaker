This question already has an answer here:How to clone or copy a list?                    20 answers                Why do we use ? I tried to use , but it doesn't pass through the LeetCode solution. I don't understand why we put  in front of . My guess is that  is already a list.
Calling  here will create a copy of  (see How to clone or copy a list? ):This means that  leaves the underlying list of numbers untouched while returning a shuffled list (since  shuffles the input in place).Keeping this list untouched allows the  method to work.
 creates a new list since shuffle does a in place shuffle. So  holds a copy of the original list which gets shuffled and returned and  holds the contents of the original list.
