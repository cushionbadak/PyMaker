This question already has an answer here:Python using enumerate inside list comprehension                    7 answers                For a task in school we have to develop a programme that will take a piece of text from the user turn this to a list and then find all positions of a word that the user has searched for within the text.I have found multiple ways to nearly do this but they all have a slight downfall somewhere along the line. Apart from one but this has one line I do not understand and therefore I was wondering if anyone could explain this to me.The line of code is 
The  function creates the indices corresponding to the position of an element in a sequence.So if you have the list , enumerate would generate  (actually it creates a generator, but that's not really important for now).According to the python docs, enumerate is equivalent to:The tuples are then unpacked into . If x is equal to the ,  is added to the list.
