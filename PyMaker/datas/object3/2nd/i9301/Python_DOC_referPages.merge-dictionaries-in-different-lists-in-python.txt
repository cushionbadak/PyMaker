I need to merge two lists with dictionaries in them:There are 56 elements in the first list (56 dictionaries) and 14 elements in the second list (dict2). What I want to do is inset first element from dict2 to first four elements of dict 1 and repeat the process until all 56 elements in dict1 have {Place:x}. So eventually what I want to get is:and so on..When  is exhausted, it should start from first element again.So I updated question. My first take on this problem was to increase number of same key:values in dict2 to:     and then use the same method mentioned below to merge dictionaries. But I believe there should be a way to do this without changing dict2.
We'll use  and  to pair up elements from the two lists. If you don't want to modify the original list, it's a little more complex.
You can use :If the number of items in your dicts are not the same, you can use  with  param set to :
Using modulo:
How about simply creating an empty dictionary called  and simply updating it with the list of existing dictionaries you want merged, for example:
