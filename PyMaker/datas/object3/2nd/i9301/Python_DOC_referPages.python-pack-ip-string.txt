I want to kind of implement my own  specific function to pack an IP string (i.e. "192.168.0.1") to a 32-bit packed value, without using the  built in method.I got so far:My question is:How do I get from that  to , (this is what I'm getting from ?(And also - How is it possible that there is a NUL () in the middle of that string? I think I lack some understanding of the  format)
You can use string comprehension to format as you like:or as a one liner:
An alternative:Can you use  and  (python 3.2)?Note that you may actually only need the integer.Can be shorter obviously, but wanted to show all steps clearly :)
Based loosely off @Stephen's answer but returns a string with the actual bytes rather than a string with literal slashes:Works in Python 2 and 3. Returns a  rather than a string, matching best practice for Python3.
