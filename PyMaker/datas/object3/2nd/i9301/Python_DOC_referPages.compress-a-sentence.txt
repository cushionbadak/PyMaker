i'm working on a compress and decompress code of the user's sentence.I have made this code:But something seems wrong. It works with the out put of: b'Please enter a sentence 'gn h b'\x1f\x8b\x08\x00Z\xedxX\x02\xff+N\xcd+I\xcdKN\x05\x00\xd5Nf\x9d\x08\x00\x00\x00'b'sentence'Why does it show b'sentence' instead of the user's sentence and when it's asking for a sentence why does it have b'  ' instead of Please enter...I got told the b'   ' will make the sentence compress in the future step of the code.Any help?Thanks
 does not turn  into a  value. You need to encode a string to bytes instead. Pick a codec that suits your use case; here encoding to UTF-8 probably is best as it can encode all of Unicode, with a reasonable small size for western text:Note that  always returns a  type, giving it a  prompt won't change that.Note that when you decompress the data again, you'll still have a  object. If you want to turn that back into a  object, decode from  to  using the same encoding:
