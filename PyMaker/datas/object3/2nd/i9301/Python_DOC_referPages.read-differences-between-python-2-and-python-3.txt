With the following MWE:I get the following output:Can you explain why?  is the expected decimal number of  in ascii and UTF-8 as far as I can tell.
Python 3's  defaults to universal newlines mode (), while Python 2's  only enables universal newlines mode if the mode string include .In universal newlines mode, a sequence  (old Mac),  (UNIX) or  (DOS/Windows) are all recognized as newlines, and automatically converted to  so line endings have a consistent representation to simplify string manipulation.If you want universal newlines in Python 2, you can either use the mode string to enable it or use , which is a near exact equivalent of Python 3's built-in  ( on Python 3 is just another way to say ).If you want to disable universal newlines handling on Python 3, pass  an argument of  (for universal recognition for the purposes of breaking lines when reading/iterating, but no translation of line endings) or  (for example) to mean only  is recognized as a line ending at all, and again, no translation of line endings is performed. Passing  is required to properly handle certain file formats; the  module performs its own line ending handling, and  ensures no information is lost before it reaches the  reader.
