Natural Text
I done this code below and had some help with the compression part. The code is not working and I don't understand how to fix it. In my class we are still beginners so i'm not too good. Also when its asking the user for a sentence, why is it stating as b'_' instead of Please enter a sentence?it gives me this error message and I don't understand it:Thanks.
