I'm working on a small command-line game in python where I am showing a progress bar using the tqdm module. I listen for user input using the msvcrt module to interrupt the progress. Once interrupted, the user can restart by entering 'restart' into the command line prompt. The second time the progress bar is shown, instead of updating the same line with the progress, it creates a new line each time. How would I get it to show the progress on the same line? This code snippet illustrates my use of the progress bar.
Try using  in place of the standard This will print above the progress bar and move the progress bar one row below.I tested this using below code, pressing  will print into stdout but not break the loop.It was not 100% clear what you are trying to achieve, since the  function of yours only checks the type of the provided string. type() built-in functionEDIT: to include  parameter of  as noted by Paul Netherwoodtqdm.tqdm.write()
Try using 
Try  instead of .
