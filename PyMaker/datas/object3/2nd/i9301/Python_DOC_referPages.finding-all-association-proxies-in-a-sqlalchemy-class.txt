I know an easy way to get all proper SQLA columns from a class A (that inherits from db.Model) - I can do  at runtime. However, A also has several association proxies, and I don't know of an elegant way to get a list of those (other than just running on all of the class' attributes).Is there maybe a way to use SQLA's inspect for this?I'm using python 2.7 and Flask-SQLAlchemy.
There is a way using the runtime inspection API. With it you wouldn't even need to poke at the internals of  through :For a list of association proxies you could for example do is a collection of  attributes, which includes mapped attributes as well as attributes declared by extensions. To differentiate between extensions, and non-extensions, inspect the  constant attribute.
