Creating a subprocess seems to need to close some fd from caller, e.g., if caller opened fd 0,1,2(stdin,out,err) and fd=3(file named "a.txt"), and subprocess.Popen sets "close_fd=True", likeDoes it mean:(1) fd 0-3 are closed in subprocess?(2) if fd 0-3 are closed, how could subprocess print lines to screen, or communicate its input/output with caller by :Just a bit confused. Explanations? 
Only  is closed. From the Popen docs:If close_fds is true, all file descriptors except 0, 1 and 2 will be  closed before the child process is executed. (POSIX only).
