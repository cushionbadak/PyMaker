I kept getting the error . Most people suggest sometimes numpy is not compatible with other existing math functions. but I changed every math function to np functions. The error states:My code:
You don't need  here.  Use . Furthermore, consider getting into the habit of not using the * operator with imports.To your comment of "why shouldn't I use the * operator": there are a ton of good discussions on why this can create trouble.  But here is what the official documentation has to say on that: when you use :This imports all names except those beginning with an underscore (_).  In most cases Python programmers do not use this facility since it  introduces an unknown set of names into the interpreter, possibly  hiding some things you have already defined.Your own example illustrates that.  If you were to use:Both have an  function that gets imported into the namespace as . Python might then have trouble knowing which  you want to use and, as you saw here, they are quite different.  The same applies if you have already defined an  function yourself, or any other function that shares a name with any in those two packages.In general, be wary of any tutorials you run across that use  consistently.
