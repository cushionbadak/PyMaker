This question already has an answer here:How can I add a background thread to flask?                    2 answers                I am working on a Flask application which needs to return HTTP 200 OK under 2 seconds. But my app has to initiate some work after sending HTTP 200 OK.The problem is respond function takes more than 2 seconds to process data it received. I need it to send an HTTP 200 request first then start it's work.EDITBelow is the code for respond function.
You need to offload the heavy lifting to the background so that you won't have to hold up the response. This is typically done using a task queue like Celery.http://www.celeryproject.orgYou can also consider some lightweight alternatives like Huey.https://github.com/coleifer/huey/blob/master/README.rst
