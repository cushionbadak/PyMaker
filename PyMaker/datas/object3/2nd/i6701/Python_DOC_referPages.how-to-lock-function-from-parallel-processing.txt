I allowed 2 processes in celery and in each process There is a requirement for calling API request And it should not call at the same time. API server blocks concurrent request.Can I lock that function if it is running in one process?I need to lock fetchaddress function if it is already called in one process.How can I achieve this?Is there any alternate mechanism to avoid parallel calling of API request running in multiple processes.I am using celery==3.1.14, python 2.7
You could coordinate with a Lock.Are you maybe saying you're not sure how to wrap a function with a Lock decorator?
