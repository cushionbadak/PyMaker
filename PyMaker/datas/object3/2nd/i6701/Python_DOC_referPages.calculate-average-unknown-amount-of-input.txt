I am doing an ultimate beginner's course in programming, using Python 3. I have to do an assignment. The assignment is the following:Write a program in Python that reads numbers from standard input of the Linux shell, and displays the average of these numbers, with one digit after the decimal point. Tip: use the round function with two arguments.I honestly have no idea how to calculate the sum of an unknown amount of input. Everything I can find is for if you know how many numbers will be input.So far I have this:but I feel I'm completely on the wrong track there. What happens now is that all the characters in the loop get counted for the sum, so you get But I need, of course, .I am 100% a beginner, I haven't ever done any coding before, and this course is supposed to be for people like me, but I don't believe them any more. 
You were doing average and sum outside the for loop in your code. I just moved them into the for loop. For every iteration , the sum and average both will change, so they have to be in the for loop.Printing the sum, average values can be done outside the for loop.This is the correct method
