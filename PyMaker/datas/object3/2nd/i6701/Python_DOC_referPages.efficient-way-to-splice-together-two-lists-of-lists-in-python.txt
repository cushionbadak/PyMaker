I have two nested lists in python, for instance:I'd like to be able to put in an index corresponding to the flattened version of the lists, and return the "crossed-over" list:e.g. index is 5, output is the new listI can do this by doing a triple nested loop but I know there must be a quicker way in python, likely using the iterator?EDIT: I am asking how to more efficiently do the following:lst3 result:
I'm not exactly sure what you mean by a "crossed-over" list, but it seems that you're trying to do some sort of regex of the list.  But you also mention that you want a flattened list, even though your output is not flattened.So, I'm not really sure what you're asking for.  But if I use solely the title as a means to guess what you're looking for, then the answer is fairly simple, using list comprehension:This will give the following result:which is a combination of the two lists.  Not sure if it's a "combination" in the way that you want, since that can be interpreted many ways and I cannot tell exactly what you want.
