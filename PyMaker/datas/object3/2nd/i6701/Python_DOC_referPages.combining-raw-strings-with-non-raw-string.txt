Natural Text
I want to use input from a user as a regex pattern for a search over some text.  It works, but how I can handle cases where user puts characters that have meaning in regex?  For example, the user wants to search for Word : regex engine will take the  as a group.  I want it to treat it like a string .  I can run  on user input and replace the  with  and the  with  but the problem is I will need to do replace for every possible regex symbol. Do you know some better way ?
Use the  function for this:4.2.3  Module Contentsescape(string)Return string with all non-alphanumerics backslashed; this is useful if you want to match an arbitrary literal string that may have regular expression metacharacters in it.A simplistic example, search any occurence of the provided string optionally followed by 's', and return the match object.
You can use re.escape(): re.escape(string)      Return string with all non-alphanumerics backslashed; this is useful if you want to match an arbitrary literal string that may have regular expression metacharacters in it.
Unfortunately,  is not suited for the replacement string:A solution is to put the replacement in a lambda:because the return value of the lambda is treated by  as a literal string.
