I'm new in programming and i need helpi have a hex file like this:43 52 53 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 01 30 00 00 0010 87 01 00 13 00 00 00 10 00 00 00 00 00 00 0040 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00i need the python code that let me read the little endian "10 87 01" do math , overwrite the result in the exact offset and save itlike  10 87 01 + 40 01 = 50 88 0143 52 53 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 01 30 00 00 00 50 88 01 00 13 00 00 00 10 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 40 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00hope its clear
you can use the struct library to handle little endian as shown in the doc at https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct.pack_into For your specific task, I don't know if I understood correctly, because you didn't specify what kind of data do you have in your binary file... let's assume we have signed 32 bit integers, my code would be something like this:Hope this helpsAll the bestDave
assuming you have your math function working to calculate the new pattern, you could use a function like this:I may be not optimized but it should work as expected
