In Python Language Reference, Chapter 3 Datamodel, why is "instance method" listed under "callable types", while "static method object" and "class method object" are listed under "internal types"?Callable types These are the types to which the function call operation (see section Calls) can be applied  ...Instance methods  ...Internal types A few types used internally by the interpreter are exposed to the user. Their deÔ¨Ånitions may change  with future versions of the interpreter, but they are mentioned here for completeness.  ...Static method objects  ...Class method objects  ...Shouldn't static and class method objects also be callable types?
No, 's and s are not callable, no rationale to do so was found. They are meant to be invoked via the descriptor protocol and (usually) return a callable:this isn't the most common form, though. Usually a descriptor is invoked automatically upon attribute access, as the descriptor how-to states:A descriptor can be called directly by its method name. For example, .Alternatively, it is more common for a descriptor to be invoked automatically upon attribute access. For example,  looks up  in the dictionary of . If  defines the method , then  is invoked according to the precedence rules listed below.
The  objects are not callable:However they implement the descriptor protocol method . The  method then returns an actual callable object.When you store the  object into a class attribute, and then look it up, the  method is called implicitly.
