Suppose I have the following code excerpt:My question is: Suppose  is from a class I defined previously, how can I specify this in the code such that my interpreter knows prior to running the code what the object class is ? My goal here is to have the auto-completion of my IDE (I use VSCode) recognize the object so I can auto-complete and easily search the methods and attributes of that object.
It depends on the version of Python and IDE, but in general looks like an additional statement with assertion instance type is the only way so far. This will trigger VS autocomplete settingsThe following issue is tracking that feature: #82.
