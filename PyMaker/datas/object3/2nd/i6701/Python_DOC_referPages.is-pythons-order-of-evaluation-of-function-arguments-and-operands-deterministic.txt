C doesn't guarantee any evaluation order so a statement like  might execute , , , and  in any order (although  would be executed after all of them)What about Python? My experimentation for Python 2.7 shows that it appears to be left-to-right order of evaluation but I wonder if this is specified to be the case.Test program:which prints
Yes, left to right evaluation order is guaranteed, with the exception of assignments.  That's documented here (py2, py3):Python evaluates expressions from left to right. Notice that while evaluating an assignment, the right-hand side is evaluated before the left-hand side.In the following lines, expressions will be evaluated in the arithmetic order of their suffixes:If the language were not making some choice about this, the evaluation of one argument could mutate another argument and result in unspecified behaviour, so all implementations of Python must follow this spec.
