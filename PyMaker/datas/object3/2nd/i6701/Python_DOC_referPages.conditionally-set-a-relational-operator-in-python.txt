I wish to create a function which filters a data set, and I wish to pass into that function the logic of whether to search ,  or .  Is there a preferred method for this in Python, or do I need to create 3 different unique code bases for each using  for example
You can use python's built-in  module:Following @Nick A comment you can do this:
As already mentioned in the comments and the other answer you can use the  module which wraps the comparison operators as callables.In case you want to pass in a string you could simply get the appropriate callable with :and then call the  with the values as arguments. That works because your strings are already what the functions are called. No need to create a dictionary in this case.
As commented by aws_apprentice, pass your function and you can use them as your comparators.Documentation: https://docs.python.org/2/library/operator.html
