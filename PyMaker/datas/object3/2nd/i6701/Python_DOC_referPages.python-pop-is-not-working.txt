I've gotten a little rusty with python. A friend is taking some tests to prepare for his exams and he's given this piece of code: He's asked what will the screen show and the correct answer is 7. How is it 7? I've even written the code and run it. It is 6. Is it a new version returning the number + 1 or something? Or maybe the answers given by their teacher are just wrong.
Neither Python 2 nor Python 3 return  (both return ).The most obvious answer is that it was just a typo by the teacher or your friend when they sent you the example.is equivalent toBoth return the last (= top) element of a stack.With  you append a  to the stack â†’ you push the  on top of the stack.Therefore if you executethe result will be  and cannot be .For a more detailed explanation of how and why lists in python can be used as various datastructures (stack, queue, ...) consider taking a look at the documentation:https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html
I've running your code here, using CMD and python 3.6.2, and this is the output:Surely, the correct answer is 
The answer that is given by the teacher is wrong. list.pop([i]) - Remove the item at the given position in the list, and  return it. If no index is specified, a.pop() removes and returns the  last item in the list.Take a look at the documentation of popOutput:
This must be a trick questionreturns This is because you  6 to the  or  of the .A  command follows the  rule which means when  you  an item from the  you will be taking out the last item.Therefore with  being the last item appended, when you  the  the return will be the last item, in this instance
