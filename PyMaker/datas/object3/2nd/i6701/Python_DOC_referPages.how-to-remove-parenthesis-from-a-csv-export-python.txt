So I have a school assignment to create a GUI which allows me to add students to a database which I have made. I figured out how to search for students but I am struggling with being able to add students. I am required to export this data to a CSV file. I have managed to export it but it comes with commas, speech marks and brackets, which I don't want. This is my code so far for the section that doesn't work:
Change  from  to :  class csv.DictWriter(f, fieldnames, restval=”, extrasaction=’raise’, dialect=’excel’, *args, **kwds)  Create an object which operates like a regular writer but maps dictionaries onto output rows.  The fieldnames parameter is a sequence of keys that identify the order in which values in the dictionary passed to the writerow() method are written to file f.
