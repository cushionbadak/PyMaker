Natural Text
I'm making a text encrypt-er that randomizes the pattern of symbols used (abcd) but after the first if statement, the program no longer works. New, old, get , and tag are the 4 letter to symbol translations. I tested out only the first if statement by itself and it worked perfectly fine. Also any tips in how to shorten the code would be much appreciated.P.S - The hi input is to not let the Python console close.
1st Error: You have used variables in following statements without initializing them first2nd Error: If statements do not allow two relational operations to be performed on a single variable without using a logical operator for joining the two (in case of  relational operations you should use  logical operators to combine them all)Eg. Check if integer a is greater than 2 and less than 5So you will have to change your elif statement by seperating the two re
Try this:Doing what you did will compare 2 to the expression (rand <= 4), which compares to a boolean, or 0/1.
The very first line:  our_str should be converted to integer.Your conditionals are not right.   it doesn't work this way. instead use  or There are other errors as well, you can check the console and remove all the errors.like you are using  without even initialising it and so on...
