I wanted to use a string in global scope inside a function.I read somewhere that different scopes have different values for their respective local variables even if they have the same name.But in my case, I am getting something like thishttps://i.stack.imgur.com/hyqZk.png (this link contains the image)
From the Python FAQ:In Python, variables that are only referenced inside a function are implicitly global. If a variable is assigned a value anywhere within the function’s body, it’s assumed to be a local unless explicitly declared as global.Though a bit surprising at first, a moment’s consideration explains this. On one hand, requiring global for assigned variables provides a bar against unintended side-effects. On the other hand, if global was required for all global references, you’d be using global all the time. You’d have to declare as global every reference to a built-in function or to a component of an imported module. This clutter would defeat the usefulness of the global declaration for identifying side-effects.So the  function can see the variable in the global scope, but if you try to modify the value of , you get an  because the name doesn't exist in the local scope and you may not modify the global variable from inside the function.
Have a look at code belowoutput1However if you try to update the value in the function, that will exist only in local scopeoutput21so string outside printstr still holds 1to update value globallyoutput22We have to use global keyword to refer the global scoped variable, I hope this clarifies your doubt
