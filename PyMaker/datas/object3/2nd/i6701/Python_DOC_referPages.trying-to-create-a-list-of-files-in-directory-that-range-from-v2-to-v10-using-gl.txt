I'm trying to create a list of files within a directory that match the version of specific .csv files within the directory. The file names are "NH [V2].csv" and they range from "NH [V2].csv" to "NH [V10].csv". How can I create a list that only takes the range that goes from 2-10 but excludes all others e.g. "NH [V1].csv"This is what I have so far, however it's returning an empty list.I'm trying to to then import all those .csv files into a data.frame as one would do in R.Thanks in advance.
Instead of wrestling with the limitations of  patterns, you can use  and a regular expression to provide the filtered list of file names:
If you know exactly the names you want to match, maybe you don't need  for this job.A simple comprehension could do the trick :
Try this one:Based on this answerBut still, this won't match V10 as you requested, so you can do something like (assuming that you have multiple V* in nested directories )In otherwise if you got only 10 files under current directory - @PRMoureu 's answer would be better suited for that purpose
