I'm undertaking a problem from Project Euler (#188) and I've run into a wall. The problem's specification is as follows:My solution in python is as follows:It works perfectly for smaller inputs, but once exponentiation gets very large, the program works for such a long time, that I get a timeout error. Is there any way around the obvious inefficiency of python 3's exponentiation, or am I perhaps doing something else wrong? Any help is appreciated!
The numbers involved are just too large. You are trying to brute force the problem, which won't work - some numbers involved may actually take up terabytes of space - or even so much memory that it wouldn't fit in the observable universe. Python can't help you; there is some answer involving smarter math. Try out printing some exponentiation results - for example, the powers of three. Look at the remainders. There will probably be some repetition or pattern. Follow and generalise that.
