There is the code: can be None or np.ndarray, so I want to check whether  is None or np.ndarray, but if I pass np.ndarray into , it will raise a error,because np.ndarray==None should use  or . So what should I do?
Checking for ndarray typePreferred over : use .From PEP 8:Object type comparisons should always use  instead of  comparing types directly.In your example: use Checking if  is Option 1: Use .  This explicitly checks that  is None.Option 2: Use .  This takes advantage of the "Falsiness" of , but it also would evaluate to True if  is other "Falsey" values such as , 0, or an empty data structure.
Try this one:
The reason it raises the value error is that with a recent enough version of Numpy the  override of arrays does an elementwise object comparison even when comparing to None.With Numpy 1.12.1:and with Numpy 1.13.1:The error is quite self explanatory. Numpy has a different view on truthiness of an array compared to how plain Python sequences behave.In order to check if an object is the singleton value None, you should use identity comparison as also explained here:
