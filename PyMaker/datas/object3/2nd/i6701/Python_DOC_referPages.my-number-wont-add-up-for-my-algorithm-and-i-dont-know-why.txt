Once I input my number and lets say I put in 5 for the width and 5 for the length, my perimeter would come out as 5555 instead of 20. I'm new to coding so any help is greatly appreciated.
input() function gives you strings, you need to convert them to integer before doing any calculation. Try:Python can do multiplication operation between strings, which repeats them. IE:  gives you  because it is a string. While  gives  because it is an integer.
You are capturing the data from input() which is a string. You need to cast it to a number.  When you have a string aka "12" and you run "12"*2 it will output "1212".From the help function
Since data types don't need to be explicitly mentioned in Python, you'll have to type cast (forcibly convert to some other data type) your inputs for them to be considered as integers.This should work!
I'm not sure which version of python you're using, but on 2.7.13 that I have on my computer, your code works just fine. Check which version you're got, and let us know.
