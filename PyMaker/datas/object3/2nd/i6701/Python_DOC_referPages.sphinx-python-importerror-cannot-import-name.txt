I am using Sphinx. When executing the command , my files that define an abstract class or are derived from an abstract class are getting an error.ErrorCode referencedMinimal example:File:  File: The result is that the documentation for those abstract class dependencies are nearly empty, whereas classes not using ABC are fine.It doesn't have any problem importing any other package.
Thanks to pierre-de-buyl and mzjn. You indeed identified the problem:Although ABC and abstract classes are defined in 2.7 documentation, and are present in /usr/lib/python2.7, you must force sphinx to use python 3.xUnfortunately I have not found an elegant method to do so, but my method descibed below solves the problem:Uninstall sphinxInstall sphinx with python3:or(in contrast to  or )Create a sphinx documentation the way you are used to (maybe someone has a better idea to force sphinx to use python 3.x?)
