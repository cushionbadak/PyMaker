IÂ´ve got a piece of code that creates an image using matplotlib in Django and saves it to the root directory. I need to change the folder where matplotlib saves the image to /static/img folder.Any idea how to save them there?Thanks in advance.
Try this:Note: From your code, it appears that while you're saving the image you're not giving it a unique name. So, if you create a new image, it will replace the older image. If that is the desired behaviour, ignore this. If not, you can use  to generate unique names for your images.
