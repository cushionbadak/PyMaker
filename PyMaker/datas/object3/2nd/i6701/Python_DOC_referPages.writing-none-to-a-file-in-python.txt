Natural Text
I have a txt file that contains rows of JSON objects.I'm parsing this file in Python, and I'm writing a file that every row in it will be a record (Comma separated) I've built from the JSON object.Now, when I'm building this file - some of the values can be Null (or None in Python). So this is what I write:But I keep getting this error: So my question is - How can I write "Null" values into the file, in a string, so when I load the file into the table - the value in that position will actually be Null?How can I keep this value in a file?Thank you!
If it's Ok for you to have an empty string when you have  value, you can write:Please, don't use  as a variable name because you shadow a built-in function/classOr more generally, if you have a list of items:Or use the CSV module. With JSON, you could also have integers,  and . To convert that in string for a serialization in CSV, you could use:Here,  and  serialization is prohibited.
Use . The error you get is in the line above . When concatenating items to form a string, all items being concatenated must also be a string. This would mean, you'd need to do something along the lines of:It is worth noting that you shouldn't use , , or  to name variables as it shadows the inbuilt classes with the same name.You might also consider using , or, as mentioned just have an empty string  instead of . Furthermore, look into the  module on how to write to a CSV file. Here's an example from the  documentation:
