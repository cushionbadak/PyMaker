This question already has an answer here:Make Python Sublists from a list using a Separator                    4 answers                Let say I have this list:I want to end up with:So, I want to split the list into sub-lists based on the space that in there in .
 is the perfect weapon for this, using the  property to separate the groups, and filtering out the groups with space.result:if you know there are 3 variables (which is not very wise) you could unpackbut it's better to keep the result as a list of lists.
You could do this using a for loop, putting the resulting sublists in a dictionary (as opposed to creating variables on the fly):
Well, you can use  module to group items according the fact they are space or not.For instance, you can use  function as a predicate to group the items:You get:Based on that, you can construct a list by excluding the groups which key is  ( returned ):You get this list of lists:If you are not familiar with comprehension lists, you can use a loop:You can unpack this result to 3 variables:
is there something relevant to str.isspace but for the new line, i.e.  instead of the space on the list it will be "\n"? +  solution on extended example:The output:
Just for fun. If you know that the words don't have any space, you can pick a special character (e.g. '&') to join and split your strings:If you want the most reliable solution, pick the  one.
