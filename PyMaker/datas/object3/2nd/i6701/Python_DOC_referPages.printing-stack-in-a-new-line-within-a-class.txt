I have a linked stack class and I'm having the problem of printing the elements in the stack, with each element in a new line. The str function in the linked stack class is printing every element in a new line which is what i wanted but it even prints an extra new line at the end.The output i get is:I'm looking for a way to improvise the str function in the Linked Stack class in order to get rid of the redundant new line at the end. Any help is much appreciated.
Why not simply trim the return value of  like so  ? Since you always append a new line after adding an element to the string.On a side note, it could be nicer to write your function like so:
You could move the addition of the newline until after you get the next item, and check it is not None before you then append it.A further optimisation then is to move the break condition to that point:
