So I have made some code that follows. It is suppose to let a server and a client communicate... but it doesn't work.Can someone explain why, or better yet fix my code???Server.Client.It doesn't return any errors so I am confused why it doesn't work.
First of all, in your server-side code, you're having a while True before starting your thread, so it can't work.Then, if you succeed starting your thread by moving the code, its  will see an empty list, so it will not loop, and just exit right here.Starting from your code, here's something that works:The client:The server:Note that this is suboptimal, starting one thread per client is not the way to go. The best way to handle this kind of situation is to keep everything in a single thread and use a select-like function to know what to do. However select is a bit limited too (like 1024 connections max, hardcoded in the libc), so the way to go is to use epoll / kqueue / whatever better than poll / select, and there's a module for this: https://docs.python.org/3/library/select.htmlYet using the select module is still the old, manual, cubersome way to express your needs, you should take a look at the coroutine based API of asyncio which enable a clear way to express the intention.The asyncio equivalent may look like:And, server side:
