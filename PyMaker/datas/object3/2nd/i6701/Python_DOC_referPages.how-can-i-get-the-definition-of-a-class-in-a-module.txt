Why can't I get the definition of  from module  in the following code?How can I get the definition of a class in a module? Thanks.
In general, this is easily done with  which accepts a module, a class, a method, a function, a traceback, a frame,or a code object. The source they represent should of course be written in Python else an error is raised.In this specific case, you just happen to be unlucky because while  is defined in  the  name is :This throws  off because it won't look in  that contains s definition but, instead, in  which merely imports all definitions from :Normally,  doesn't have an issue finding the source, for example, on itself:In this specific case, though, it does (due to  returning .) You could replace  with  for a tricky way to see the source:but this doesn't make me feel very comfortable.
Return the source code for the specified module.So you should return the whole module, as  is defined in the module of , so your code should be this:and you can see the definition of  in the print result.
