I am learning Python this semester and this is my homework.Can anyone tell me why my code is wrong?QUESTION:You want to know your grade in Computer Science, so write a program that continuously takes grades between 0 and 100 to standard input until you input "stop", at which point it should print your average to standard output.MY CODE:When I run the code, the Python keeps giving me this messages:
Change  to 
You are using Python 2.7, so use  instead of .  The latter evaluates the input, so  will return  instead of the string .  Entering  tries to evaluate  as a variable, which doesn't exist.Another note,  and  are both integers, so  performs integer division in Python 2 (Python 3 gives a float result).  If you want a floating point average, use .  One of the variables must be float to get a float answer.You'll also find that  is a string, so test for  first, then convert it to an  to test the grade .  You might want to think about handling errors.  What if the user types ?
You can evaluate first the string stop, try capture the input with :I added different conditions for correct execution, check the lines, for example  for verify that the input value is a numeric value, when this evaluation we can work normally with any math calculation. for the error division by zero if the user write  in first iteration.In the last line you can use two different ways to print the values:or 
You're running this program in Python 2 where  evaluates the user input. So if you enter "stop", Python tries to find the variable  which doesn't exist and raises the .There are more problems and you need to restructure the code. The first thing you should do is to change  to  which just returns the user input as a string. Then you need to check if the user entered "stop" and break, otherwise convert the input string to an int and then increment the  and .    total = 0    count = 0
