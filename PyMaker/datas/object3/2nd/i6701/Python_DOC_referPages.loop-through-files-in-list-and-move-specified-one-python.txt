I have this code which show me all the .tif files in a folder I give.How can I move some specified ones (to another folder) ? I mean, I want to move all the .tif files which result of width*height is less/more than a certain value.What I tried was to loop through the array and, after set the codition, move the files. All the result was a loop fail which blocked all the system :)It follows...How can I also set  (my .tif array) as directory of files from which cv2 can read ? And, more imporant, how to set a file at once ?The files which satisfy the condition (images with values of 320*30px) should be moved to another directory. How to do it after the program decided that the file is ok to be moved ?ThanksTip: this is a next step after this other piece of code: Exclude images of certain dimensions from process (OpenCV, Python)In this case, take a look at . I want to move a series of files like that (but in .tif format..)
I recommend using  for moving files. To move them You can use  - I Personally use so try something like this:EDIT:So i personally like , here i'm looping through the files, and if files endswith , I will read the file with  get the height and width, and check if that condition is met. You'll have to provide where you want to copy the files to. (Take note of  -  for some reason likes the slashes like  instead of )
