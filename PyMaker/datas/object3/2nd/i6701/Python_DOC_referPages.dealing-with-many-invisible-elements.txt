I'm writing a script that automatically gambles for me (I know, it's a project, I don't expect to make any money, it's against T&Cs) and I've decided to use Bet365. I've encountered a lot of  errors. The first I encountered when trying to login as it wouldn't let me input a password to the password field. I got around that by sending JavaScript commands:Once I do this I try to find any offer of 1.33 by doing:which does indeed find me an element. When I try then to perform  it gives me an  error.Is there a way to get the path of this  element so I can send another JavaScipt command to select it on my betslip? Or any other clever way to get past these errors?
Selenium will locate elements that are not visible but will not take an action on them (clicks, etc. throw an error). The design is that Selenium will only take actions on an element that a user could, e.g. a user can't click on an invisible element.You can filter the collection of elements down to only those that are displayed (visible).Then once you have the filtered list, loop through it and click on each one or only the first or whatever you want.NOTE: The code above is untested and I'm not a python guy so it may not be exactly correct or very python-y. You may need to tweak it a little.For filtering reference: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions
