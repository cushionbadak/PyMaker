Natural Text
I have a problem where the user can input any number of (x,y) co-ordinates within parentheses. For example, User A can input I want a generic pattern matching to check if the input entered by the user is valid. Input is valid only if it follows the above format. That is, . I am new to regex matching and I tried like . This does not seem to work. Also, space should not be there after the last co-ordinate entry. Can someone help me how to get this?Thanks in advance.
I included support for multi-digit numbers, just in case:
If you want to validate the whole input, I'd suggest the use of .Either the whole string matches, or nothing matches. By default,  starts from the beginning, and will return a  object if the string is valid, or  otherwise. The  result will be used to evaluate the truthiness of this expression.Note that the whitespace character has been made optional to simplify the expression. if you want a strict matching, I recommend looking at DYZ' answer.Regex Details
