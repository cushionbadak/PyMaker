I am getting "list indices must be integers or slices, not tuple" error while trying to generate list from list of tuples.list of tuples have the following structure:The first element in the tuple is a time series, other elements are state of some variables.The loop for converting from list of tuples to simple list is following:Where lst has format as described above.For some reason it throws an error:I understand this is novice question, but other solutions on stackoverflow do not work.Thanks in advance.
Python's  loop is a Foreach construct; you iterate over the elements of the list, not an index.So  is one of the tuples from , not an index. Use it directly:You could simplify your code by using a list comprehension:
When you iterate on list, its fetching one by one element, so value of  is your every tuple, just access  index of it and append
let me help you understand, what has gone wrong in your code:Hence the . What you probably wanted to do is:Even though this will work, there is no need for that. There are more pythonic way, which can be found in @Martijn Pieters answer.
