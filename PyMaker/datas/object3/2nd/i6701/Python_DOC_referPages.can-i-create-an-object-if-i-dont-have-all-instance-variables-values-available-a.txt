My actual code has several class variables (12) and many calculations are performed on the data that exists in my list of already-created objects. I find myself needing to add another variable to the class, , which is not known at object instantiation.Is there a way to add  to the  class, but not pass a value for it when the object is instantiated, and assign  a value later? What is the safest way to handle this?
Can I create an object if I don't have all instance variables values available at init time?Yes you can. How ? As Kyle and user2357112 say this is not an advisable design, but I guess, given the code you have shown that what you may want is doingWhich may be, depending on what you really want to do, one of the safest way of calling .Another strategy may be to create a property atribute which actually get element from cached values, as followsWhich would lead to use it  as followsAnother strategy mentioned by Paul isUse caseBut all the proposed ways of doing what you say involve a default value, arbitrarily  here.
