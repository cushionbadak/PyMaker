This question already has an answer here:What is a subtraction function that is similar to sum() for subtracting items in list?                    2 answers                What I want to do is subtract all the items in that list by order:
You could use the  function:Or using  instead of the :Note that in Python 2.x  is a built-in, so you don't need to import it.
You can iterate through the array and subtract:Or, as vaultah pointed out:
With  and  functions:This not pretends to be better than posted  solution, but gives an additional feature - intermediate subtraction results for each pair (the 1st item stays as starting point):
Yet another way of doing it, assuming items as input list.
