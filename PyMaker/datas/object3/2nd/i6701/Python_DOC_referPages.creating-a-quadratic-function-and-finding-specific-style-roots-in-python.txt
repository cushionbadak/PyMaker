I have created a quadratic equation in Python with the aim of finding the roots of the input. I am hoping for very specific output but don't know how to convert/round floats with the way I've written my code or how to get the code to return 1e-9 for example. Any thoughts are much appreciated.I am currently getting:as output and would like to get:
Your desired output requires three different formatting styles of your resulting numbers: fractional, decimal, and scientific (or exponential). You could pass another parameter to your function that either tells your function how to format the numbers or performs the formatting itself (the parameter in this case would be a function).For example:
That doesn't quite describe a quadratic equation. That's a linear  equation. It's hardly fair to call a routine that wants to divide by  when you pass in . Raising an exception would be correct. Perhaps numpy's permissive behavior isn't doing you any favors here.Consider expressing numbers as rationals if that is really what you want.
