from your codewhere split_date is datetime.date(2008-04-12), I get this error   here  takes argument as format  for more. so you should writeand as you sample input the first column has no name so you can follow to access the first column like thiselse you give the column name as  or whatever you wantand lastly This is occurred basically you try this  to the series of for more
Here is a solution:Add the label "Date" to the data file for the first column.When you do a comparision such asboth sides must be of same type.
