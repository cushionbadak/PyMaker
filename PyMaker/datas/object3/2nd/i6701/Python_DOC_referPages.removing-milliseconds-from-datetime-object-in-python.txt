I am trying to remove the milliseconds(28109) from this string  in Python. code:Error:
You already have a  object, you do not need to parse it again. The  call was enough.Remove the  line. I also changed your  call, it is a method, you just call it on the  object you have.I suspect that you printed the return value of the  call, and got confused. The  conversion of a  instance formats the value as a ISO 8601 string. Note that even if you did have a string, you used the wrong format (there is no timezone in that string, so  does not apply).If you needed a  object, rather than a formatted string, you could also just have converted your timestamp to an integer; the microseconds are captured in the decimal portion of the timestamp:
You can use  as well to achieve what you want.'09/12/2017 10:33:55 PM'
