Natural Text
I'm using selenium to iterate through the different combinations of a variable's parameters and download the data from a website. However, the for loop function stops working when there's no data; I also notice when selenium stops the webpage contains a text labeled "Cannot produce results.". Thus, I figured to use an  statement with selenium to search for "Cannot produce results" and skip to the next loop if the aforementioned text were found. An example would be something like this:However, this code simply stops the function at continue, doesn't complete the download portion of the code, and iterates through the rest of the loop. Any idea with how to solve this? Also, please let me know if the question is confusing.
After our discussion in the comments I believe I see at least part of your issue.   The python  keyword does not mean "continue with the rest of control flow" it means to "continue to the next iteration of the loop, skip everything after".For example, in the following piece of python code:The result would be:And not, using your previous logicThus to fix your code on the continue, you would need to flip the logic so that you skip if the condition is not true, for example:While I've personally never encountered someone who had made the same error as you, I certainly emphasize as semantically it does appear to make more sense that "continue" would refer to continuing on with the next part of the program.  Pythons choice in  comes in large part from historical usage of  as a keyword, particularly in C.   In this case, we can see  as more of an extension of the  statement into a "skip".
