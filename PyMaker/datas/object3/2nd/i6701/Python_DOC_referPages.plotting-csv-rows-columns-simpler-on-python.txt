I have a csv file I am trying to read. The first row in the excel/csv sheet is the column headers "Jan|Feb|Mar..." etc. Then below each column header is float data. I have the following code:How can I condense this code so I can easily plot a bar graph with the months on the x-axis and the data on the y-axis?
For me, the easiest way is to use pandas library, as it provides plotting abilities straight from the dataframe.Edit:If you have data in excel, there is no need to provide sep as it is for csv file.To read excel file it's as simple as:http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.20/generated/pandas.read_excel.htmlSome examples:Pandas documentation of barplot:https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/visualization.html#visualization-barplot
Fake data / setup:csv.reader objects return rowsYou can use zip() to transpose the data into columnsYou can associate the columns with their header, again using zip, and add a legend to the plotIf you just want to get the data into a container and have the columns associated with their headers, put it in a dict:
