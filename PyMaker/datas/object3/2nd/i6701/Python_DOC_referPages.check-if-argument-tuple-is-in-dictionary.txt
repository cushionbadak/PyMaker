I'm really struggling on unpacking and iterating over the tuples in this dictionary.  Essentially, the function takes a two coordinate position (Wx, Wy) and checks to see if it is in one of the tuples located in either list, in the dictionary, bonuses.  I feel like I'm overthinking it, or am just way off.Thanks :)
You can use  :Demo:This works because , when combined with the  unpacking operator applied to , effectively flattens the dictionary's values into a single list for which membership can easily be tested with .Your function can be simplified further if you have it return a boolean:
You can compare tuple to tuple directly:1- iterate over the values of the dictionary.2- check if  is in the values, and return  if it is3- if pos was not found anywhere, return 
You can just do this instead. (Assuming pos is a single tuple)
