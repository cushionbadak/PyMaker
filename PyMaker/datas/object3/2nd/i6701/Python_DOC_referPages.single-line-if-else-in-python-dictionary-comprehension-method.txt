I just tried a list comprehension like thisand it worked, but when I tried a similar dict comprehension, it throws an error:What could be the reason? How can I use dict comprehension using ?The error this produces:Note: The example I used here is just a random one, not my actual code.I can do this with alternative an solution, but I'm only looking at dict comprehensions now to learn.
You are using a conditional expression. It can only be used in places that accept expressions. In a dictionary comprehension, the key and value parts are separate expressions, separated by the  (so the  character is not part of the expressions). You can use a conditional expression in each one of these, but you can't use one for both.You only need to use it in the value part here:However, you'll get a  exception because the  dictionary has no , , and  keys.See the Dictionary displays section of the expression reference documentation:[...]A dict comprehension, in contrast to list and set comprehensions, needs two expressions separated with a colon followed by the usual “for” and “if” clauses.
