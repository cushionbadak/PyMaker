So I'm using  to find the median value from a list of tuples like this: The  themselves come from the collections.namedtuple, and individually they look like this: This is the method where I determine the median: Here is how the structure is created: The full script can be sound here.At the moment the output is like this: The question is, how could I output the entire record, the entire , associated with the median value, as opposed to just the median value itself? 
You can get the index of median Pair, but it needs one more lines:1) If you allways have , the median is unique and belongs to the pairs:2) If you may have , then you have to choose:2.1) Either you want the median Pair that is the nearest value of the real median value (i.e. the 50 percentile, that is not contained in the dataset)  2.2) or you want both the right and left median valuesIt works with this minimal working example, just edit the way to get the median value acording to your needs.
The question is ill-posed, because there is no value that is really associated to the median: it could happen that the  value is not present in the original array, e.g.  equals .Instead, what you could do is to find the value of  closest to the median, using , e.g.:For your code, this might be something like:unless, of course, you want the value to be printed only if the  is actually present in the array, in which case you either check  or you use  as outlined in some other answer.
