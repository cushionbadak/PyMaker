Sometimes we have to represent our objects of classes with it's attributes. Mostly we usefor string representation which generally return characters.But I have a class with no attribute that has characters. I wanted to represent that with the only attribute which is a DecimalField. Please help me to get the right syntax to represent my objects.
The  should always return a string. What you could do is following:
You can convert the value of the  to :or alternatively, if you have more complex values, you could use the method :The documentation says:Convert to a string, using engineering notation if an exponent is  needed.Engineering notation has an exponent which is a multiple of 3. This  can leave up to 3 digits to the left of the decimal place and may  require the addition of either one or two trailing zeros.For example, this converts Decimal('123E+1') to Decimal('1.23E+3').
