Natural Text
Let's say I have a class:and outside the class I initiate a while loop:I'm stuck at the point where if the command is 'quit', I need to stop the whole program from running. The problem I'm facing now is that since I initiated a while loop outside the class, how do I 'False' the loop in order to stop the whole program?I'm looking for either a break method or perhaps creating another function to quit the program entirely but not the  or  method which I'm guessing I'm not allowed to do so.
Using  or a similar "nuclear" function anywhere in a class is usually a bad idea. (And so is having a  loop.) Instead, let the loop break naturally and gracefully.First, your  must return a sentinel when it receives a . The value of the sentinel is application-dependent; let's say it is :The loop should watch the returned value and break when the sentinel is returned:
You could just move the quit command outside the  function.It's often good to decouple the quit action from other application commands. Your  class need not know about the application quit mechanism (and could therefore be reused in other apps with a different quit mechanism).I also made it so that it will not be case sensitive. So ,  or  will all trigger the action.
