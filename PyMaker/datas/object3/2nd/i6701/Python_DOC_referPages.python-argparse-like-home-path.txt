I have a question, where I can't find an answer for. This is my codeblock:How can I access the '--home-path' argument like the test argument?
Just replace the  with  in the attribute name:This behavior is documented under  in :For optional argument actions, the value of  is normally inferred  from the option strings.  generates the value of  by  taking the first long option string and stripping away the initial   string. If no long option strings were supplied,  will be derived  from the first short option string by stripping the initial   character. Any internal  characters will be converted to  characters  to make sure the string is a valid attribute name.
