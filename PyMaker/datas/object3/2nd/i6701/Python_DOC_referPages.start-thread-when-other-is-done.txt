This question already has an answer here:Python execute threads by order                    1 answer                Is there any condition indicating that thread is done? In some case I need to start one thread only when another is finished.
Simply use the  method of the thread to wait for it to complete. Then start the next thread.There is also a new(ish) feature from python 3.2+ called . They allow you to execute functions in other threads (or processes) and manage the execution without resorting to low level entities such as threads. An example of this is shown below.
