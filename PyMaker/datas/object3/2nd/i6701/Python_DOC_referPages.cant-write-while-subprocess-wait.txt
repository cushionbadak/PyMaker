I am codding a music player system using omxplayer, everything is done but i have a problem, I need to detect when the music is finished by subprocess.wait() until the end of the process and I have to write bytes to the process such as 'p'.encode() to pause, 'q'.encode() to stop etc...The problem is that I can't write bytes to a subprocess while waiting for it... If anyone knows how to detect the end of a process and writing to it at the same time, you're welcome !Here is my code:Thank you really much for your answers!Best regards, Julien
I think you can change this lineto a while loopThat is keep polling whether the omxplayer process finished. If not, check if there is a key press.
