So I stumbled upon a problem (solved it eventually via experimentation) with checking for the existence of strings inside a tuple.evaluated   even if neither were in tuple.gives me the desired result.What did the first variant actually evaluate?Edit:  @Cricket_007 ... the question you pointed to in your dupe report didn't cover the , therefore I believe this not to be a dupe.
The difference is the  container checking,If you break this statement:   returns True because testing  returns  as long as the string is not empty returns True only if the string is contained in the tupleThe first condition always returns True. The second line tests both variables for  containment first, and then performing  between the results
