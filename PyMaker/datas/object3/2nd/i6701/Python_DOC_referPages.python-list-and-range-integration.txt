Ok, a simple one!I have a list as follows:Please can someone explain to me in English what this is?  I get that it is a list, there is a range (0-8), but I can't get my head around it and google is getting fed up with me.Would a more 'pythonic' way be:
From the python3 docs:Rather than being a function,  is actually an immutable sequence typeSetting items in a range like you showed is not Pythonic, and I'm surprised it actually works.  (EDIT: it would only work in python2, where  returned a )The second option you showed is called a  literal, and is definitely the more Pythonic approach.
You've produced the same thing in the bottom code in one line to that of 10 in the top line. So yes, this is definitely a more efficient and 'pythonic' way.
