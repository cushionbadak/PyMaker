I have a list that contains dictionary objects:What I want to do is to extract the  inside , and assign it to  itself, and repeat this for all dictionary items in the list:I know I can do this using :I just wanted to know if there is a more efficient way of doing this. For example, would using comprehension list work better for this?
Is that what you want?
You could also use map and a lambda (although it's not really any more readable (or any faster) than the list-comp):
