I am a newbie in python and I was trying to figure out, how do I differentiate between 2 lists which are as shown belowAnd The Problem is, that both the lists have  element, and I want a solid Condition which satisfies that if a list has an item which is a string and not . It is also possible that list has 7  and just one item is a string.
You can just use  with the list as argument :If there's any element which is truthy (i.e. non empty), it will return .
It seems you want to filter empty strings from a list:I want a solid Condition which satisfies that if a list has an item which is a string and not The condition is .  To clarify,  is an empty string.  During iteration, if the  is , the condition is  and thus the item is excluded from the result.  Otherwise, the condition is  and the result is added to the list. See also this post.This behavior is because all objects in Python have "truthiness" - all objects are assumed  except for a few, such as , , ,  and empty collections.
I need a condition which is satisfied if there are no , in the  string.You can use  for checking this. 
The easiest way to see if there is not a  in your list is to use :Which would display:
