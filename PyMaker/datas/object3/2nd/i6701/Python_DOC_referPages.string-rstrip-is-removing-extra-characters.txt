Why does this statement remove the  in :But this statement does not remove the :This statement removes all of the E's at the end:When I turn the rstrip into 2 separate statements, it works fine:
 removes any trailing instances of the characters you supply from the string you apply it on until it finds something that doesn't match. This is stated in its documentation:The chars argument is not a suffix; rather, all combinations of its values are strippedUsing  it will remove  from the string and then all s (or s or s or s) since those fall in the character set you've given (and no other character that isn't in that set has been found).When you use  the first call to  strips off  and then stops because  isn't in the character set .  is then removed when the second call to  is made.
