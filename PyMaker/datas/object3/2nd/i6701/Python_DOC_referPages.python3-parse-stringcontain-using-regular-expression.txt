Let's say string has  like this  appear => one of  appear =>  not always appear.I want to parse string and want to return list.ex1) str = 238Z!32Z#11234XI want to return [238Z!, 32Z#, 11234X]ex2) str = 91X92Y93ZI want to return [91X, 92Y, 93Z]below is my code.but I got empty list .what's wrong with me?
Dont use the  and  in regex.  matches start of line,  matches end of line. That means your regex will only match string that begins and ends a line.Output:If you wish to not get a tuples, but instead whole strings that were matched, don't use capturing groups:Output:
You should not use  or  anchors as they will require your string to match completely with one pattern.Also don't use capture groups if you want to get the desired result:['238Z!', '32Z!', '11234X']
First,  and  are metacharacters used to match the start and end of your string (not the pattern). So you have to remove them so that your regex can find all the corresponding patterns.Second, the  function will return a list of groups if your pattern contains at least one. Groups are defined by the parentheses in your pattern. You should use a non-capturing group .Another advice when writing a regex. If you want to match a list of characters, you do not need , you can use  which has the same meaning.Moreover, you do not need to use parentheses if you want to quantify a single element.  is equivalent to , and you will not have any group problem anymore.Your regex would then become:
