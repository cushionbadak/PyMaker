Is it possible to read values from a file with an iterator, so that the file is automatically closed at the end of the iteration?Creating such an iterator using the  statement doesn't seem to work.
If you want to use  you need to do:However if you don't reach the end of this iterator, you will never close the file, so in essence it's not very different from:When processing a file it's best to go through it all at once if you can, and then close it once you are done using it. Keeping a handle on an open file is usually not a reliable solution.
The fileinput module does that for you. Opening and closing files is handled automatically.You can give a list of multiple file paths to the  method and it will iterate over their lines like it was reading a single file.
