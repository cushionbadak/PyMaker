I'm wondering if this is possible in python.I'm accessing a list in this way:This is fine. Is there a way to use a variable? I mean:Thanks for your suggestions.Some details:I have a situation where I have something like this:But since I need to pass "[0]['name']" as parameter, I'd like to understand if this is possible.Thanks,cips
In general it is dangerous to use  but you essentially need to convert your string to perform your indexing.So first you can get your list as a  using then if you concatenate that with your index operationthen  the whole thing, it should do the trick
This is a simple matter of extracting the indices/keys from the string  and then using those keys to index the list/dict structure.
I hope not to be out of context, but maybe you can use a function like this if you canconvert  to :If you want to convert  to  you can try this:It will convert the indexes to the right type, to work with either list or dicts.
Regarding your most recent edit, you cannot pass a string that contains the index and key. However, you can use  to convert the entire expression to valid Python:Output:
you can use the function eval('a[0][name]'), it will evaluate the string inside as a python code.here is the reference:https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval 
You can use exec commandI hope it works
