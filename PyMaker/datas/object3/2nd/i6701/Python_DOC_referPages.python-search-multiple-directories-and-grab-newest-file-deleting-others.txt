New to python and would appreciate a little help.I would like to go through 10 directories and copy the newest file from each directory back into a single folder. There may be multiple files in each directory.I can pull a complete listing from each directory, not sure how to narrow this down. Any direction would be appreciated.inside the STATES directory will be directories for each state (i.e. CA, NY, FL, MI, GA)**Edited if it is helpful, the directory structure looks like this:'/dat/users/states/CA/''/dat/users/states/NY/''/dat/users/states/MI/'
You can use  instead of  to traverse all of your folders. For each folder you get a list of the filename in it. This can be sorted by date using . This will result in the newest file being at the start of the list.Pop the first element off the list and copy this to your target folder. The remaining elements in the list could then be deleted using  as follows: is used to safely join a path and filename together.Note: If it is supported on your system, you might need to use something like:to sort based on the creation date/time.
