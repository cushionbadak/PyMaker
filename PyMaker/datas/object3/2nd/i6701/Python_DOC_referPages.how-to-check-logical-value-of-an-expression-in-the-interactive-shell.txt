Sometimes I want to check the logical value of an expression, so I type it in Python (or IPython) and get the result:But in other cases it doesn't work that way (here string is None):So I check the logical value like this:Is there a shorter way for checking the logical value of an expression?Any function that returns True or False the same way it will be evaluated in an if-condition?
Is there a shorter way for checking the logical value of an  expression?Yes, it's the  function:
All expressions except those that produce  are echoed.If you execute an expression that doesn't result in data being echoed, then you probably have a  result. You can test for  explicitly:Using  produces a non- result.If you just wanted to test for the boolean value of an expression, use the  function; it'll return a result following the standard truth value testing rules:Again, this is guaranteed to not be  and echoed. You can't distinguish between  and other false-y values this way, however. An empty string  will also result in , for example.Another alternative is to explicitly print all expression results, using the  function:This then produces the exact same output as echoing does, with the single exception that  is printed too.
Yes, create a boolean directly from the expression, which will always be  or :
 or  will return the boolean you need.
