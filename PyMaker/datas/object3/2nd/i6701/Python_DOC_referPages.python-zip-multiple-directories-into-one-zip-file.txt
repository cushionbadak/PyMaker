I have a top directory  which has multiple sub-directories under it as below:I am trying to create multiple zip files(with proper zip names) from ds237 as per size of the zip files. I have written a logic which creates a list of sub-directories . I have created the list so that the total size of the all sub directories in the list should not be > 5gb.My question: is how can i write a function to zip these sub-dirs (which are in a list) into a destination zip file with proper name.Basically i want to write a function as follows:I linux i generally achieve this by:'zip -r compress/sub01-08.zip ds237/sub-0[1-8]'
