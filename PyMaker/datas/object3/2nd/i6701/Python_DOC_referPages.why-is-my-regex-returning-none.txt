My regex is only matching when I don't include 'or' options; however I need to include that because I will need to match different strings.But if I do this instead it works:I can't figure out why the first attempt isn't matching anything. Anyone know why?
It is matching; it returned a match object, not ; and you call  on that match object.However the problem here that there are now 2 capture groups. The first is in the first branch, and the second in the second branch.You can store the match into a variable, then use the  property to get the index of the last matched capturing group:
In the first regex, group 1 is before the , so it’s in a branch that contains . No part of your string can match that (you don’t have a literal  followed by a literal ), so that entire branch fails. The other branch succeeds, but it has a different group number to let you know which alternative worked.
