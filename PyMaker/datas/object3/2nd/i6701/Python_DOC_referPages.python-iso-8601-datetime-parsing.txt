Moreover the questions involved are very old and take older versions of python where ,  directives in  are not available.
The pendulum library does a good job with these.The page to which I've referred you in the link says, 'The library natively supports the RFC 3339 format, most ISO 8601 formats and some other common formats. If you pass a non-standard or more complicated string, the library will fallback on the dateutil parser.'
