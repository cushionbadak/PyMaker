Natural Text
I'm currently teaching myself pandas and python for machine learning. I've done fine with text data thus far, but dealing with image data with limited knowledge of python and pandas is tripping me.I have read in a .csv file into pandas dataframe, with one of its columns containing url to an image. So this is what shows when I get info from the dataframe.the image column contains url to the image. The problem is, I do not know how to import the image data from this and save it as numpy array for processing.Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance!
If you want to download the images from the web and then, for example, rotate your images from your dataframe, and save the results you can use the following code:If instead you want to show the pictures you can do:The resulting pictures are birds and butterfly which can be seen here as well:
As we don't know your csv-file, you have to tune your  for your case.Here i'm using requests to download some image in-memory.These are then decoded with the help of scipy (which you already should have; if not: you can use Pillow too).The decoded images are then raw numpy-arrays and shown by matplotlib.Keep in mind, that we are not using temporary-files here and everything is hold in memory. Read also this (answer by jfs).For people missing some required libs, one should be able to do the same with (code needs to be changed of course):requests can be replaced with urllib (standard lib)i'm not showing code, but this SO-question should be a good startanother relevant SO-question talking about in-memory processing with urllibpandas can be replaced by csv (standard lib)scipy can be replaced by Pillow (although internal storage might differ then)matplotlib is just for demo-purposes (not sure if Pillow allows showing images; edit: it seems it can)I just selected some random images from some german newspage.Edit: Free images from wikipedia now used!Code:Output:
