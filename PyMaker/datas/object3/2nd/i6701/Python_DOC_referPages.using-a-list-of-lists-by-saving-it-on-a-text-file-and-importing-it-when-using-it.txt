So I'm coding a program that's based around the idea of booking cinema tickets, currently it works fine however I'd like the program to save the booked seats when it closes so I can have different screens and restart the program and have the same bookings. I planned on doing this by saving it to a text file each time it's used however I have had problems finding a good method to do this. This is what my list looks like
You can use the  module:
I would suggest you to put your data set, which in your case is seats into a pandas df and save it to csv from there. Later you can just load the data set from the already saved csv.You can play with it as you like its easy using pandas, look at the pandas doc for more infolink: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.htmlHope this helps!
The task of converting structured data to simple byte sequence that can be written to a file or transmitted is called serialization. Python offers several methods. JSON seems to be a good choice for this case. It is very simple and the output is human readable, so you could verify your program. There are some limitations regarding the supported data types, that you should be familiar with.
