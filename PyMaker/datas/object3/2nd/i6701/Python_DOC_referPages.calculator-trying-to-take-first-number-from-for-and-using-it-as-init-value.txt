I'm trying to take the first number from a list and use it as my initial value. When I started doing subtraction, I realized that you actually don't start at 0 as you do with adding number, but you start with first number written in 'for'.For example, when you add 0+4+5, then 4+5 is actually the same thing; when subtracting, it's different to do 0-4-5 and 4-5. I'm just starting with Python and programming in general, so I'm wondering if this is even possible.  My code:
You can get the first number that was entered by accessing  ( or   in my example ), you also only need to subtract the values after this index so you can use  ( or  in my example )
There are a few ways you can do this:You could get the first number separately:Alternatively, you could use indexing:Or, if you wanted to use a loop instead of reduce:
You can do , but you can also skip the inifializer altogetherIf you won't provide it, the first value will be takenhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.reduce
Another option is  in Python 3.  This allows you see intermediate calculations.See also this post comparing  and .
