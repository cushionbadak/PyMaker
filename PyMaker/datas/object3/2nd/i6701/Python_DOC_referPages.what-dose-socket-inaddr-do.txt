I have an issue  with  socket.INADDR_* constant of Python socket I cant understand what dose these constants do? For example:What does the above options do?
Those constants refer to IP addresses. Refer to your system Unix documentation for what they mean, as indicated in the Python documentation. I don't think  or  are real constants.A few common constants are: (127.0.0.1) - your local host, via a special network device known as the loopback device (0.0.0.0) - any address used for binding (accept connections to any IP on the machine)The IP manual has more useful information on these constants.
