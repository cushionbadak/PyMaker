I am not sure what I'm doing wrong. Here is my code:I would like to see the following:However instead I get:What am I doing wrong?
String slicing is done with a , not a .Try the following:
You have to do it in a simple way
You're not paying attention to what python is telling you.When you run your program, you get a traceback:The last line in the traceback tells you what the problem is, namely that string indices must be integers. Then as you read upwards you'll see that the problem is on line 4:If you work your way through the expression, you might try something like this first:that would tell you that there's something wrong with what's inside the . You know that both the result of 4-3 and 4 are integers, so the next thing that you can try is check what that expression is:Ah hah! So it turns out that  is a tuple. If you read more about tuples you'll see that they're actually not defined by parenthesis but by commas. What you probably wanted was a slice, which you get by replacing  with .However, if you try that:You'll see that you've got something wrong:If you think about it for a moment, and adjust your statement to this:You'll see this output:If you notice this starts out at . It's not the output that you're really looking for. You want something more like this:Do you know how to do that with a range?
