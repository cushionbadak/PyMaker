I'm trying to work out the last digit of a bar code however I'm having trouble with the second and last while loops.They don't assign any new values to the variables  or . It instead leaves them as 0 and I don't understand why.It prints out what ever 7 digit number you put in however it doesn't output the total or multiple of 10 as anything. They just come out as 0.My teachers only solution to this was a lot of if/else statements.
I am not sure what exactly you are trying to do here, but I can tell you what the problem is for which the value of  is not changing. The problem here is in the  for the  loop. ie, the .As you can see, the control never enters the while loop as the condition returns .Instead just do  . That should solve it.Note : the use of  in the code is wrong, as the scope of the  and  are local itself.Edit :The reason for the odd behaviour is due to comparison operators having the same precedence and due to the chaining of the operators, where in for python something like  is equivalent to .According to Python docs :Formally, if a, b, c, …, y, z are expressions and op1, op2, …, opN are  comparison operators, then a op1 b op2 c ... y opN z is equivalent to  a op1 b and b op2 c and ... y opN z, except that each expression is  evaluated at most once.We know here :And due to the chaining of operators the whole condition in turn becomes  . And since  is , the condition in the end evaluates to  .
Comparisons are of equal precedence.. are evaluated as So in your case  is evaluated as  implying either   1.   =>  OR   2.  => So it is always For reference see...https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#comparisonsAnd please do the needful for the usage of
