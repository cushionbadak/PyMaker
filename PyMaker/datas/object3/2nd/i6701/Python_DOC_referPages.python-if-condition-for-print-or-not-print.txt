Here is a basic math problem. I want to calculate least amount of banknotes to be paid.Here is my code and working well. But i want to print only if that type of banknote is used. For example if total amount is 101 dollar than program prints But i dont want to print the ones with 0 value. I only want it to print This was an example of my struggle. I can not code this kind of loops or conditions. Thank you very much for any help.
All you need is an if condition. As an exercise, you should try to write DRY code. Using loops and lists would look like this
Instead of writing an  statement for all of these just  them together and use a  loop:
Use if the value is 0, it won't print anything.
One way to do this would be to make an array to store the values of all the bills to loop through however this would require a bit of a rewrite, to make it work with what you have currently you need an if treefor example you can continue this logic down for all different bill sizes 
Speaking simplistically, just add an if statement around each print statement checking for a 0.Continue that for each item.
