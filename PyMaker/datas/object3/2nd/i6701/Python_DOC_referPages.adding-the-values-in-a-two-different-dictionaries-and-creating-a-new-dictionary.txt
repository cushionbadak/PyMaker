I have the following two dictionariesandI need to collate and sum the scores for keys a and b in both dictionaries to produce the following output:The answer could be 'done' using one of the following two methods (and there may be others I'd be interested to hear)1. Using the creation of a new dictionary:finalscores={a:30,b:30}  #adds up the scores for keys a and b and makes a new dictionary OR2. update the scores2 dictionary (and add the values from scores1 to the scores2 corresponding respective valuesAn accepted answer would show both the above with any suitable explanation as well as suggest any more astute or efficient ways of solving the problem.There was a suggestion on another SO answer that the dictionaries could simply be added:print(scores1+scores2)Is there any pythonic way to combine two dicts (adding values for keys that appear in both)?But I want to do this in the simplest method possible, without iterator imports or classesI have also tried, but to no avail:
For the first solution:This iterates through a set of all keys in both dictionaries, creates a tuple with the values of the key in both dictionaries or 0 and then passes said tuple through the  function adding the results. Finally, it generates a dictionary.EDITIn multiple lines, to understand the logic, this is what the one-liner does:For the second solution:
