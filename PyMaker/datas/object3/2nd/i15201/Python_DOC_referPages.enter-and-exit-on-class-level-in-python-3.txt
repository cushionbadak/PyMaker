I am unsuccessfully trying to get the magic -statement methods  and  running on class-level:However, this will result in an :Is it possible to use the  and  methods on class-level anyway?
 and  are special methods, and as such only work correctly when defined on a object's type, not in it's instance dictionary.Now  is a instance of , and  and  do not exist. Therefore you get an attribute error.To make this work, the methods would need to be declared on the metaclass of the class you want to use. Example:Now  is an instance of  ( == , and therefore  and  do exist).However defining a metaclass just to use an instance of it as a context manager seems a little over the top. The more straight forward solution starting from your example would be to just useOr if you want to reuse the same instance later:
It seems that CPython doesn't call a bound method like , it seeks over instance type, doing something like  than calls it. And since  is a special  object (not a  itself), it doesn't contain  method. I tried to workaround that using metaclasses, but wasn't successful.  doesn't work either.See here: https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/2545fdbd4b4a6a77b132fccf816578f59b609be5/Objects/typeobject.c#L1362Py_TYPE is similiar to _PyType_LookupId walks over  (no  call here)Python 2 implementation is different, but main idea about getting  applies to it too
