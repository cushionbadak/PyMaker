I understand % is to replace something in a string by s (but actually who to replace?)Maybe more intriguing is, why the  become  automatically after  is replaced by  itself?
The  you see in that code is a "conversion specifier" for the older printf-style of string formatting.Most conversion specifiers tell Python how to convert an argument that is passed into the  format operator (for instance,  says to convert the next argument to a decimal integer before inserting it into the string). is different, because it directly converts to a single  character without consuming an argument. This conversion is needed in the format string specification, since otherwise any  would be taken as the first part of some other code and there would be no easy way to produce a string containing a percent sign.The code you show is a quine (a program that produces its own code as its output). When it runs , it does a string formatting operation where both the format string, and the single argument are the same string, .The  in the string is a conversion specifier that does a  of its argument.  on a string produces the string with quotes around it. This is where the quoted string comes from in the output.The  produces the  operator that appears between the two 's in the  call. If only one  was included in , you'd get an error about the formatting operation expecting a second argument (since  is another conversion specifier).
Think about \\ and \.
