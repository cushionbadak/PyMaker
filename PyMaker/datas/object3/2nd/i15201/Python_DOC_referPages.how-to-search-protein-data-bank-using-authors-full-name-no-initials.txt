I am trying to search the protein data bank with author's name, but the only choice is to use full last name and initials, therefore there are some false hits. Is there a way to do this with python? Below is the code I used:
I just published a Python package, PyPDB, that can perform an advanced search of the RCSB Protein Data Bank by author, keyword, or subject area. The repository is here but it can also be found on PyPI:For your application, I'd suggest first doing a general keyword search for PDB IDs with the author's name, and then search the resulting list of PDBs for entries containing the author's name among the metadata:The keyword search for "actin network"Now iterate through the results looking for the author's nameYou can imagine using fancier regular expressions to improve slight variations in the way an author's name or initials are used. There also might be a nicer way to write this code that bundles requests.
