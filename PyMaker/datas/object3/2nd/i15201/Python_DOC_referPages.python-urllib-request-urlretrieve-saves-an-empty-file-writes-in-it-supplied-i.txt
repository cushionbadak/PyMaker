Natural Text
This is the type of file I want to download and save:http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=nuccore&id=562868704,585641505&rettype=fasta&retmode=text...and this is the test code: It creates the file but is then empty, i have no clue what the problem is. Thank you for the help.
Your resulting URL contains a space; you put it there yourself with:If I replace that with an empty string instead your code appears to work:Rather than use string concatenation, you can use a list and use the  method to build your value:I used the  method with an XPath expression to list all matching Id nodes.
