I am trying to install the  module on my Mac, however when I open  and import the  module, I get the error:To install it, I used in my home directory... ... and it is installed successfully.Note that I have both Python 2.7 and Python 3.4.0 on my computer, in case this is what is causing problems. I want it installed for Python 3.4.0.
To avoid conflicts between parallel Python 2 and Python 3  installations, only the versioned pip3 and pip3.4 commands are  bootstrapped by defaultYou can try  or  to use the Python 3.4, see docs here https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.4.html#bootstrapping-pip-by-default
