I'm trying to parse some options when running a Python script.However, when I run thisThe  yields this.Why is it parsing options as arguments?
 requires that all  options come first.  instead came after a non-dash option. will be parsed correctly.You may want to switch to using the  library instead; it is far more flexible and can parse optional command line switches in any location, as it also handles required arguments explicitly.
