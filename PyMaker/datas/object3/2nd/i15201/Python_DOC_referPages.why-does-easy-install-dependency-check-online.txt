I have been distributing a python 2.7 package distribution as an egg. We've been pointing people to easy_install knowing it has a limited shelf life because we use Windows as well as Linux and don't distribute on PyPI. when our users invoke the installation:easy_install mypack.eggthe last thing that happens looks like an online check for dependencies. This has cause folks to report a bug when easy_install can't find a registered listing on PyPI. Why is this dependency check happening? Is it because we don't have an explicit "requires" section? I don't mind that easy_install would look for dependent packages that I specify, but this seems different ... it is looking for a dependency list.
From the easy_install documentationYou can use the --allow-hosts (-H) option to restrict what domains >EasyInstall will look for links and downloads on. --allow-hosts=None >prevents downloading altogether.For example:will attempt to install SomePackage using only eggs and source packages >found in somedir and disallowing all remote access. You should of course >make sure you have all of SomePackage’s dependencies available in somedir.or in the egg configuration:--no-find-links Blocks the addition of any link.This parameter is useful if you want to avoid adding links defined  in a >project easy_install is installing (whether it’s a requested project or a >dependency). When used, --find-links is ignored.This doesn't answer the question "why does this behaviour exist?", but helps to change it.
