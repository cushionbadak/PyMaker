Below is the script I'm trying to write.  I've made other working scripts, including simple if-statement scripts, but I wanted to experiment a bit and try making a script that relies on string inputs instead of integers or floaters.It goes without saying that I'm still learning and won't require this to do my job, but thanks for trying if you decide to take a crack at it.  I spent about an hour with another novice coder trying out tiny adjustments.  I'm almost certain it's futile to have the input equal a string to start with, creating my strife.
 returns a string already, so you don't have to convert it to string again. No need  this.Also your intention is wrong. It must be;Your whole script must be like;Used  function from  module. So it'll wait which seconds do you want as you see it's 2 seconds now  Also you can use  function to place like;It's my favorite function since it's pretty usefull, check it here 
2 things to get you up and runningIs wrong this will assign a string "yes" to answer. As it is it won't run. UseAlso take away the unneeded quotes at the end ofinsteadYou should only enclose string literals in quotes and you'd usually have an even number of quotes.The final thing is all these  calls aren't required if the value is already a string. It will work like this but you are doing unnecessary work.
Here is the complete script in it's entirety. I was stringing the inputs when I didn't have to, like an idiot.  I also had 3 typos to correct.
Here is right version:In your code your  is wrong, you should use  to replace .Code like this:is
