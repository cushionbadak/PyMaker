How can I check if the letters of a word that the user entered are all in a list?This doesn't seem to work:
For example like this?cf. Python - verifying if one list is a subset of the other
Use sets; either test for an intersection or for a subset:oror if you wanted all characters in  to be in  (so only , ,  or  can be used, use the inverse:Demo:where an empty  is considered false when used in an  statement, a non-empty  is considered true.
