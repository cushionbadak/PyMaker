I'm trying to write a file's hex size in the header of another file. When I convert the length to hex I get   so it writes  to the file.The file's length is stored in 2 byte intervals though, so I need it to format the string to this . what the easiest way to do this?I tried this but I know it's not correct and not the proper method. 
You are converting a number into bytes, not hex. Use the  module to do this:This produces an unsigned short, 2 bytes, in big endian order; for the length  that'd produce :
Assuming the integer is an big endian unsigned short, use  with the big endian flag.In this format string,  is the big endian flag, and  is unsigned short.Example:You can find all the  format characters here.
