I am attempting to communicate with a device using Python's telnetlib module. I seem to be able to establish a connection and pass my query to the device, however, the output is not what I expect.Here is my simplified code:After executing this code, all the terminal displays is: mpa:? -- not the processor information I was expecting.When I use a Telnet client, after establishing the connection, I get an mpa:? prompt, which indicated the device is ready for my command. I then type in 'v', which should produce an output in this format:After the query, the mpa:? prompt is displayed, ready for the next command.In place of , I have also tried , but this times out with the following error message:Would anyone be able to point me into the right direction, or let me know what I'm doing wrong?Many thanks!!
I have resolved the problem by adding a while-loop to print each line after a new line and carriage return has been read in:
