I am trying to write a script to parse a map file generated by a compiler/linker, that looks like this:I am currently writing several regular expressions (python's re module) to parse this, but I want to write them in a very easy-to-read way, such that it's very simple to parse.  Essentially:However, I don't know how to get the length of the matched string, as in my  pseudo code.  I don't see anything in python's documentation of re.  Is there a better way to do this type of parsing?
For what you are trying to achieve, use the  method.Or just the  method.Another option is to use regular expression objects which can take  and  arguments to limit the search to a portion of the string.Begin the search for  at the end of the match for .Searching for  starting at the end of the match for , will not produce a match.For long strings and multiple searches, using a regular expression object with a start position argument will definitely speed things up.
You can use the  method.  The entire matched string can be retrieved by :Demo:Note however that this will raise an  if there was no match:You may wish to implement a check that makes sure the match was successful before you go calling methods on the match object.
