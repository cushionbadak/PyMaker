I am new to python. This is my code:It's always repeating even though I don't want it to. My aim is to make it work only if ,, or  is entered, otherwise it should display the error message and repeat the question.
Your code doesn't properly call the functions nor does it assign global variables for conversion. In addition, you shouldn't use the  keyword, which checks for equivalent references in memory, you should use the  keyword which checks for the existence of an element in your tuple.
There are several problems:You are reading the input in a function, but never returning it.Your test fails, because you are comparing a method () with a tuple. You have to call the function and check wether the result is  a sequence type:Finally, there's no need to call the  function recursively:and then in the "main" part of the script:(don't use  as variable name, since it is a keyword).
 is a function which you need to call, otherwise you only get a function reference back. So do . â€“ The  (or ) operator checks for identity. On the left side you have the user input, and on the right side, you have a 4-element tuple with possible characters. Those two will never have the same identity. You want to use the  operator:
