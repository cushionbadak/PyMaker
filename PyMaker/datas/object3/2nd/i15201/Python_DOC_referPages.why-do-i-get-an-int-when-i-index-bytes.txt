I'm trying to get the first char of a byte-string in python 3.4, but when I index it, I get an :This seems unintuitive to me, as I was expecting to get .I have discovered that I can get the value I expect, but it feels like a hack to me.Can someone please explain why this happens?
The  type is a Binary Sequence type, and is explicitly documented as containing a sequence of integers in the range 0 to 255.From the documentation:Bytes objects are immutable sequences of single bytes.[...]While bytes literals and representations are based on ASCII text, bytes objects actually behave like immutable sequences of integers, with each value in the sequence restricted such that [.][...]Since bytes objects are sequences of integers (akin to a tuple), for a bytes object ,  will be an integer, while  will be a  object of length 1. (This contrasts with text strings, where both indexing and slicing will produce a string of length 1).Bold emphasis mine. Note than indexing a string is a bit of an exception among the sequence types;  gives you a  object of length one;  is the only sequence type that contains elements of its own type, always.This echoes how other languages treat string data; in C the  type is also effectively an integer in the range 0-255. Many C compilers default to  if you use an unqualified  type, and text is modelled as a  array.
