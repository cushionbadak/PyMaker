Is there a better way in python to generate a list dictionaries, containing values from lists, than using nested  loops?Example:I'm trying to figure out how to make a list of dicts that contains every combination of three lists.  Using nested  loops in the example above, this is 26 x 10 x 4 loops.  I looked at using , but only merges lists and doesn't give every unique combination.Is there a pythonic way to get it done quicker than 26 x 10 x 4 loops?Is there a way to accomplish this lazily via a generator?  If so, how?
To produce the generator you requested:As this is a generator, it will be evaluated only when needed:
You can use  to compute the Cartesian product between all provided iterables:
funnily enough it is itertools.product
