I have made a bit of code which adds the results of test scores from a text file to a python dictionary in the format of this:And i want to work out the average of everyones scores and this is what i have tried so far:This is the error:I do nut understand what this means fully and dont know how to fix it?
It is rather unwise to mix both strings and list of integers in you data-structure. You should try something like that instead. This will help further calculations:Set the doc of  for the details.Since I don't have your input data file, I cannot really test it, but this should produce something like that:After that the rest of your code should work as you now uniformly have list of integers. Whatever is the number of "scores" for the same player.
Not sure what all the code is doing but using  a defaultdict and storing all scores in a list will be easier to sum and average,a defaultdict will add the name and append if that key  does not exist or just append each score if it does, it is more efficient than using :I presume your next loop is to find names with the same average scores so again we can use a defaultdict using averages as keys and appending names that have the same average:If you don't want to actually use the common_dict you can do the grouping of names in the previous  loop reversing the logic using scores as keys and appending names.You can also let the statistics module take care of the average replacing the code with:
