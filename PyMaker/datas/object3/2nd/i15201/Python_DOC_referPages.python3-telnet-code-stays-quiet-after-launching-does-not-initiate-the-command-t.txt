I need to Telnet into my router and issue a reboot command on it. And it has to be achieved with Python. Here's the code I've got:  When I'm initating it in command prompt it'd just stay blank, no errors whatsoever. It's as if it's loading something for so long, but the router would not reboot. The script sort of hangs.  Thanks for helping!
I faced the same issue today, 1.5 years after your question. In my case, the issue was resolved by removing the extra space, i.e.:becomes:It seems, the problem exists because of the extra space that is not output by telnet serve and thus read_until is not able to find the specified string.
To my mind, there is something wrong with string passed to router. They must not be byte (the  prefix is not needed). Try removing it. String encoding also seems strange.
