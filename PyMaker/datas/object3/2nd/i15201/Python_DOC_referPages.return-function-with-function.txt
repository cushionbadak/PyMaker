I would like to do something like the following:I get invalid syntax on this. What is the Pythonic/correct way to do it?This way I can call  without having to call  which is a little more messy IMO.
A  expression is a very limited way of creating a function, you can't have multiple lines/expressions (per the tutorial, "They are syntactically restricted to a single expression"). However, you can nest standard function initions:Functions are first-class objects in Python, so once defined you can pass  around exactly as you can with a function created using , and either way they get access to the "closure" variables (see e.g. Why aren't python nested functions called closures?).
It looks like what you're actually trying to do is partial function application, for which  provides a solution. For example, if you have a function :... then you can create a  function1 with one of the arguments pre-filled like this:... which works as expected:1 Technically a  object, not a function, but it behaves in the same way.
You can't have a multiline lambda expression in Python, but you can return a lambda or a full function:
