Natural Text
I've made a little script to calculator percent; however, I wish to actually include the '%' within the message printed...Tried this at the start - didn't work...oFile.write("Percentage: %s%"\n" % percent)I then tried  which didn't work.I'd like the output to be:   Percentage: x%I keep getting "TypeError: not all arguments converted during string formatting" 
To print the  sign you need to 'escape' it with another  sign: 
Or use  function, which is more elegant.4 years later editNow In Python3x  requires  parenthesis.
The new Python 3  approach is to use format strings.This is also supported in Python > 2.6.See the docs here: Python 3 and  Python 2
Format is more elegant but the modulo sign seems to be quicker!http://inre.dundeemt.com/2016-01-13/string-modulo-vs-format-fight/ - shows that modulo is ~30% faster!
