I've got a small script that's trying to execute an external command. But for some reason, the function that I made to execute the command is being completely skipped over! No errors seem to be raised, it just doesn't execute. I've got a few debug print statements inside it to verify that the function gets entered, but they never print. And I've got a print statement outside of it to verify that the script isn't dying. So what gives?
 uses , so if you want it to execute all the way to the end, you ought to call it like . Or just delete the  line, since you don't seem to need it anyway.Or
As @Kevin said, the main (but not the only) issue is that  is a generator. To consume it, you could run: .Though the function  is broken: there is no point to call  after  returns (the latter waits for the child process to finish and returns the whole output at once).It is not clear what result you want to get e.g., to run the  command and to store its output in a variable, you could use :To discard child's stdout/stderr instead of saving it, use :For the code example, to read output while the child process is still running, see Constantly print Subprocess output while process is running.
