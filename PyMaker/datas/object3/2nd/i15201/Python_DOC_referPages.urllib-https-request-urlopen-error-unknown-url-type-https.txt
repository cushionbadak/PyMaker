I have a script on python3.4 and it has been fine until the website I download the file from decides to use https and now I am getting error but can't figure out how I can retrive the file. My script import the following library and uses the urlretrive to get the file previously. Since it is now forwarded to https with 302 redirection. I am getting some error.My error:-
Most likely your Python installation or operating system is broken.Python has only support for HTTPS if it was compiled with HTTPS support. However, this should be the default for all sane installations.https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.htmlPlease clarify how you installed Python. Official Python distributions are available at python.org
