Natural Text
I'm currently trying to make a text-based game, and I'd like to add a feature where, based on the user's input in the command line (or Python shell), it detects a corresponding method, and returns it.For example, when the user types in  in the command line:Or something like that.I know that if I make a class, and a method called , the user would be able to type in  to call the same thing, but I'm trying to make it as simple as possible for the player, assuming they know nothing about python.Currently I have something like this, but I'm not quite sure exactly how to make it work:
You are very close!First, you have to use  and not  to declare a class:And then, use  in order to get user input.
There are several options; you could use the  function to turn strings into attributes on your instance; this includes access to methods:This translates  into  and finds the corresponding method to call.To list all the possible methods, you could use the  function, together with the  predicate function to list all methods your class offers; you'll have to filter these as you don't want to present the  method to your visitor. Perhaps you could overload the  attribute for functions for this purpose; it contains the function documentation string:Demo of the latter:
