I have a C++ dll which I'm trying to use it in Python, until now there are no errors, system seem to be doing what I wanted, but when I try to access , the Intellisence in the Python IDLE shows the following,from the above pic, it's clear that the intellisence doesn't show up any available functions of the dll, but when I checked the same TestDll.dll with  it has 45 functions, but none of those functions are available with python.Please Note: There are several questions on this topic, I tried the following suggestions but no use,incompatible version of Python installed or the DLL [TestDll.dll & Python both are 32 bit versions]I think ctypes is the way to go [Same Issue, cant see any functions, but loads the dll]Now my question is how do I load all the available functions(as shown by dumpbin)?Edit 1Based on eryksun suggestion, I was able to make some progress. The  comes along with a header file (my bad I missed this file earlier), from which I could see the available Exported Functions. now I've tried the following,until now it's fine, but when I try to define the argTypes, not sure how to do it for structs?any suggestions are much appreciated.
Based on your header, here's a dummy C file (for Windows) that can be used to test a  wrapper.  You mentioned C++ but the example was a C interface, which is a good thing because  works with C functions not C++.x.cHere's the  wrapper.  Note that  does not inspect the DLL and automatically load all the functions.  You have to declare the functions, parameters and return values yourself.  See ctypes:structures and unions for the  syntax.Also note that for a DLL with  functions use  instead of .x.pyAnd the output:
