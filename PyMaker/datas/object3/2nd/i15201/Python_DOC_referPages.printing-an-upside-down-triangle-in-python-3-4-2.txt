This question already has an answer here:Print a list in reverse order with range()?                    17 answers                So, for my programming class I am supposed to write a program that outputs this: I have been able to make it so that the program outputs the triangle right side up but even after looking for help online, I haven't been able to find the solution to turning the triangle upside down. Here is my code: And this is the output I get:Can someone help me out? I am a newbie so this is kind of tough for me even though it's probably pretty simple for you guys.Thanks in advance! 
You're very close. You can use the  function, but step using  to walk from  to .You can also make a string by multiplying a character by an integer.Testing
Range with a negative step will do the trick (end, ini, step) with step=-1, also you can eliminate one for loop by using lists and join instead:Edit: @Cyber answer is much better, didn't know you could use "times" operator directly at the string.
