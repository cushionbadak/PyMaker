Providing that I have this list which contains a number IP addresses:Then after receiving a packet I want to check if its source address is included in the predefined list IpAddressesI have tried two alternatives, but both didn't work:First: Then, I tried to convert address into string before making the comparison:I am not familiar with python syntax, so please could you show me how to do this.
since the address object appears as a tuple only the 0th index appears in your list so you should check for its existence (also you can usually skip the parenthesis on an if statement unless it makes the if statement less readable)
