I think you want something like:For example:See the docs on  for more information.
You can use  for this.
I believe this is what you want to do ... a. Get an email address as input from the user and add it to a file. As an aside ... you may want to do the following before you write it to the file... - ensure that the email address is a valid address (use regex to enforce this) - ensure that the email address does not exist already (you don't want a file full of duplicate addresses)etc...and,b. Print out how a specified number of results from your subscriber list. You need to either put your Here's a quick example of what you can do to read x number of lines from. I've used a lot of syntactic sugar .. which you can choose not to use.. 
Your code is really close â€” you just need to let the iteration of the number of lines control the loop, not the number of them in the file:To be more robust, inner portion of the loop probably should be wrapped in a  to handle the case were the file contains less than the specified number of lines gracefully.
