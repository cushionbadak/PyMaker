I'm trying to use 's . From Python 3.3 on, you can specify a  keyword argument. If you add that argument in older versions, it fails. To get around this, I used the following:Is there a better way of doing this?
Rather than test for the version, use exception handling:Now you can conceivably upgrade your standard library in-place with a patch or a backport module and it'll continue to work.
I would do something like this:UPDATE: The idea of  of other answers is nice, but it assumes that it fails because of the   argument. Here I present an extra-smart test for the availability of the argument. What if future versions of this class add more and more optional arguments? (Disclaimer: not claimed as portable):
Here is another slightly different approach:Now in the rest of the code you can just use:and know that the  argument is being used if available. This does still rely on static version checking, but means that all of the version-specific config is in one place and may reduce duplication elsewhere.
