I'm working on a Python Application that reads from a binary file, pulls a byte that then references a list. This is essentially what I'm doing.The problem is that the file I'm reading from, the 8th bit denotes a positive value, rather than making the number negative. For example, I hope to read b'11111111' to read as 255 and not as the negative number that it's producing. I'm not familiar with the struct module, and not sure if I'm doing something wrong with using the module, or if it's a feature of Python that I'm not sure how to create a workaround for.
For an unsigned character, you'd want to use the  format character, not  (see Format Characters section in the  module documentation. Since  always returns a tuple of values, even if only one is specified by the format string, a  can be added to the end of the expression as shown to retrieve that first and only element.
