I am trying to create a 2D Array class and want to make the matrix iterable. Does anyone know how to go about doing this? I am a new to classes in python and still getting the hang of things. Also, how would str be implemented in my main? If i just use print(customMatrix) will that go and use the str method?Heres what I'm working on. I know some of it isn't correct :)
Actually there is a  keyword which is handy in this case, It can be thought of as a return statement which saves the previous state while returning anything ,so when you call the method it first yields  on the second call to this method it would yield  and so on..
Read up on generators and the yield keyword, they're fun to use!
