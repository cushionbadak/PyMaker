I am totall newbie to python so if the question will be totally newbie please excuse me.I have simple landing page  and have a form there:So can you provide a simple basic example of  for me How to get data from this form ( I want to send this data via email, but as first step i just have to get it) ?: I am developing on windows.I don't know about such things as will my server be able to execute cgi scripts or not.
If your web-server doesn't support Python CGI scripts, you could use some micro-framework.For example, using Flask:(Please note that you use a textbox named , but you call it . I did the same.)Then run it and use  instead of :It's a more popular way, especially if you consider growing your site. If you won't need anything else, you could go with CGI and python-supported web-server.Actually, it would make sense if you provide some more information on what you're trying to do. Do you want to create your own website and have no idea on how it works? I guess it'd be easier for you to jump right into the web-frameworks like Flask or Django.If you aren't sure you'd like to progress in web-development and just want to learn Python and its builtin libs, you can set up some webserver or take a look at Python's webservers manual.
