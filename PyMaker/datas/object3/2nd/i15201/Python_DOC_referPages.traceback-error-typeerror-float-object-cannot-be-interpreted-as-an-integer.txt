Could someone help me figure out the problem I have with this?I can't seem to figure out why it won't give out the warning that You are not in range when I code 5.4 marbles. Between 0 and 100, I should be allowed to give decimals, but for "How many marbles" I would like to receive that warning to try again. 
Use  method. It returns boolean if parameter is whole number or not.For example Check this documentation.
You need string's isdigit method.Something like this?Also, in case of python, instead of doing 0<=x and x<=100, you can do either 0<=x<=100(my preference) or x in range(0, 101). Second one is not recommended though :-)Also a flaw with your for statement logic. If a user gives two bad inputs, they are not considered. You need a while there also.To be honest, the cleaner practice would be to put the input validation in another function and call it in the marbles function.
