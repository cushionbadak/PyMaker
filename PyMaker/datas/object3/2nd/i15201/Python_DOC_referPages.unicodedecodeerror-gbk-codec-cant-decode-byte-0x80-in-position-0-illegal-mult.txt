I use python 3.4 with win 7 64-bit system. I ran the following code:The wrong message is I changed the line 7 as:The wrong message became .The message finally points to the Python34\lib\codecs.py in decode(self, input, final).I further changed the code as:Well, this time is .What is the problem and how to solve it?
Pickle files are binary data files, so you always have to open the file with the  mode when loading. Don't try to use a text mode here.You are trying to load a Python 2 pickle that contains string data. You'll have to tell  how to convert that data to Python 3 strings, or to leave them as bytes.The default is to try and decode those strings as ASCII, and that decoding fails. See the  documentation:Optional keyword arguments are fix_imports, encoding and errors, which are used to control compatibility support for pickle stream generated by Python 2. If fix_imports is true, pickle will try to map the old Python 2 names to the new names used in Python 3. The encoding and errors tell pickle how to decode 8-bit string instances pickled by Python 2; these default to ‘ASCII’ and ‘strict’, respectively. The encoding can be ‘bytes’ to read these 8-bit string instances as bytes objects.Setting the encoding to  allows you to import the data directly:It appears that it is the  array data that is causing the problems  here as all strings in the set use ASCII characters only.The alternative would by to use  but then all the filenames and top-level dictionary keys are  objects and you'd have to decode those or prefix all your key literals with .
