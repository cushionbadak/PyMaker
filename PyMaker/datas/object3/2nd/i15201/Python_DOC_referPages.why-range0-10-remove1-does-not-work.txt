whydoes not work?I know the question is pretty short, but I do not have any idea why this thing does not work..Is it possibe to write it in one line?
 will return either a list or a  object (depending on your Python version).Python 2.x will return  as  will modify the list in-place and so returns . Your list is created and the value  removed, but as it is never assigned to anything, it's garbage collected.Python 3.x will return an  as  objects don't have a  method. If you convert it to a list using  you'll have the same issue as Python 2 though.A way to get what you want would be to use a list comprehension. In the list comprehension you'll iterate over  but use an  statement to only add a value that isn't 1, such as:
Because the  method operates "in place", and doesn't return anything.
The problem is that  is an in-place operation, and therefore returns . It does indeed do what you think it does: create a list from  to , then removes the element , but that is a temporary list that is not assigned to any variable.As an alternative, a list comprehension could achieve this
Why  does not work is already covered.I'd like to present an alternative to the  method:While the list comprehension is considered more pythonic,  might sometimes be closer in expressing the underlying problem.
The result is  because  doesn't return anything. You could workaround that by using a  function and the  operator. In Python 2 this one-liner would work:or this in Python 3: Both execute faster than using a list comprehension would (although it's not quite as readable):
