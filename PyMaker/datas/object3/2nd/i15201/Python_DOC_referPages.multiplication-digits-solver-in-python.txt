I am creating a program in Python that finds the digits that can match the letters of the following multiplication, for example:OTTO x____ISTOP( meaning OTTO x I = STOP )Here is the code I've been working on, but it doesn't seem to stop...Please help and I hope you fully understood what I meant. Thanks!
There is no need to reinvent the wheel. Use  to create 5-permutations of the digits, then check the result.
