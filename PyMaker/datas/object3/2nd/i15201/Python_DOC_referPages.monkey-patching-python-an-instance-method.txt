This question already has an answer here:Adding a Method to an Existing Object Instance                    17 answers                Mocking out methods on any instance of a python class                    4 answers                I'm trying to monkey-patch a class instance, but don't quite see how I can patch a class method no problem.But say I only wanted to replace  in the instance, what's the easiest way to do that?

Doh!
Methods only get the  arg passed automatically when received from the class (not from the instance dict), so you'll need to pass an 1-arg function there:(You can simplify that with .)
