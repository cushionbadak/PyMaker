I have an RGB image and I am trying to perform a simple thresholding for it using something like this:What I would like to do is now make a binary mask where the RGB values in the original image which are less than these threshold value should be set to 0.What I cannot figure out how to do is how do I set the mask indices (x, y) to zero where the Somehow I need to get the (x, y) pixel indices from this original image which meets this criteria but I am not sure how to do this.
NumPy's  performs . When applied to arrays, the  is applied element-wise. Since the comparisons, e.g. , return boolean arrays, the result of  here is the same as . The parentheses are needed because NumPy's  has higher precedence than .
Be careful - OpenCV uses "BGR", not RGB.so using yields the BLUE channel, NOT the RED channel!
