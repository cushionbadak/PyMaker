Consider the following:I expect it to act like this python code:However my output is simply:I can imagine it is actually calling the function like:What I'm looking for:Why?What is the minimal change can I get to have my expected output?
The issue appears to be with the way  works (which seems to be used by ). From the docs (emphasis mine):Py_BuildValue() does not always build a tuple. It builds a tuple only  if its format string contains two or more format units. If the format  string is empty, it returns None; if it contains exactly one format  unit, it returns whatever object is described by that format unit. To  force it to return a tuple of size 0 or one, parenthesize the format  string.This means that instead of building the format string  with  into  and calling  (expanding to , it builds , and so  expands to , as you thought. The solution is also in the docs:To force it to return a tuple of size 0 or one, parenthesize the format  string.So, just change:To:And you get the desired output of .
