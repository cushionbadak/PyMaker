Natural Text
I am a fairly new programmer.I am currently trying to find data from .txt files and add them to a string or array, which will then eventually be added to a .csv file.The data I am looking at are currently present in this form, numerous times at random intervals within each .txt file:' Line Flux:                        3.0008e-19 +/- 2.6357e-21 [W/cm^2]'Hence, after reading several ways around accessing this I have come up with a code that doesn't produce any errors, but doesn't print anything either:Is there anything glaringly obvious that I am doing incorrectly?Thanks for reading. Any helpful replies would be greatly appreciated.
getcwd returns a string, so i think this is where your bug is. You are iterating through each letter of the string. Perhaps you need listdir. You may want to check this link too.If that is not the case you can try inserting the "print marker" and see if it opens a file at allAlso,  is removing all characters that you provided to it. Including .  is equivalent to  Instead you can use regular expressions: Parenthesis in the pattern indicates which part of the match to be returned.
This should work:I used with open to ensure the file is closed corretly.Python slice notation to stip the first and last characters.Changed flux to a list instead of dict.I also moved the print statemnt out of the for loop so that it only prints the completed array.
