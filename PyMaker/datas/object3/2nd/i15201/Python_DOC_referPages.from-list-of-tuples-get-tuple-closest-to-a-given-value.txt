Given a list of tuples containing coordinates, I want to find which coordinate is the closest to a coordinate I give in input:Please let me know...
For your datathe shortest Pythonic answer is:with a function  returning the distance between the points  and  as a float, which you have to define yourself.Now you have to decide how you calculate the distance: using simple , some geographical formula or a dedicated library.
If I understand you right, you want the coordinate from the list that has the least distance to the given coordinate. That means you can just loop through the list like that:To calculate the distance between two variables, just use Pythagoras.I hope this helps!
