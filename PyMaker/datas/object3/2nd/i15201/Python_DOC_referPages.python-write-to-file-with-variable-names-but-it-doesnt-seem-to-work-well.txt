Natural Text
 In response to the previous question, I am now trying to do something different. I am trying to write the user's name and their score to a text file that I called, just for testing purposes (newfile.txt):This is the code so far:    I am trying to write the name and the score in the form name:score, so for instance since my name is Taylor and if I got a score of 10, I would expect the file to show Taylor : 10. Why is this not working?
 takes a single argument. You need to create a single string to pass. Instead ofYou could use  to create your string.As a side note, I would recommend using the  keyword to handle file opening and closing for you.
How about put the content you want to write to the file in a new var? And  only take a parameter of string type but  is an int type:Besides, make sure close the file or it will not close until your program ends.
