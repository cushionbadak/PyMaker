Try a list comprehension which allows you to effectively and efficiently reassign the list to an equivalent list with quotes removed.
You can easily strip off the quote characters using a list comprehension and :Demo:
What is creating your file in the first place?  It looks as though you have a kind of CSV where either all elements, or at least all string elements, are surrounded by quotation marks.  As such, you have at least a couple of choices for moving the quotation-mark removal "upstream" from what most of the other answers here are suggesting:Use the  module:Include the quotation marks in your , and chop off the leading and trailing quotes first:The first option may be somewhat more "heavyweight" than what you're looking for, but it's more robust (and still not that heavy).  Note that the second option assumes that your file does NOT have a trailing newline at the end.  If it does, you have to adjust accordingly.
Maybe we should go back to the source.Apparently your file contains the text  (etc). We can delegate the parsing:
