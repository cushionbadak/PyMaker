Basically, I'm trying to make a program that will calculate the average speed between two points that are 200m apart, and of course convert that into mph so I can say whether it is above or below the speed limit. I'm having problems making it so that it adds random numbers to the value of datetime.now() as it is telling me "NameError: name 'random' is not defined".There's probably an incredibly simple solution to this, I'm just very unsure of how to use the random in this instance.I'm not really sure how to go about fixing this, thanks for any help.Here is my code so far:
Because you imported like this:you don't need to reference the namespace. Instead of this:Try:This is because when you import like , it adds them to the current scope. Just like how  would add the variable  to the scope with value ,  would add  to the scope as a function.
You imported the name  (among others), not the name :This adds ,  and  to your globals.Simple remove the  prefix and use the  global directly:Note that you can simplify your code here; there is no need to add to  then subtract that again. Just use: produces just  again.
