I've been trying to get an output of average score(value) for each name(key), unfortunately due to being new to python I was unable to implement the  function within my code successfully ;/ I was wondering how could I calculate an average for each key which has multipile values such as :Also after calculating how would I be able to print the keys in order of average score, from highest to lowest. Would I have to input the calculated average into a list or is there a different way?This is my code so far:
Using python3.4 you can use statistics.mean:You can also remove the , already creates a key/value pairing of the name and the list of all scores. If you might have repeated names you would need to use setdefault first or better yet use a defaultdict.Also using  is unnecessary and less efficient that just using .Or just calculate the mean once and use itemgetter as the key to sorted:

use  and  to find average from list.e.g.code:output:-
Well a simple solution using  and  could be(I am assuming you get the values from file correctly and can get a dictionary):-
