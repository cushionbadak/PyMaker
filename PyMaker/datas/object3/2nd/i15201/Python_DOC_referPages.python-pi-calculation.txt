I am a python beginner and I want to calculate pi. I tried using the Chudnovsky algorithm because I heard that it is faster than other algorithms.This is my code:For some reason this code yields the vakue of pi up to only 15 decimals as compared with the acceptable value. I tried to solve this by increasing the precision value; this increases the number of digits, but only the first 15 are still accurate. I tried changing the way it calculates the algorithm and it didn't work either. So my question is, is there something that can be done to this code to make it much more accurate or would I have to use another algorithm? I would appreciate help with this because I don't know how to operate with so many digits in python.  I would like to be able to control the number of (correct) digits determined and displayed by the program -- whether 10, 100, 1000, etc.
It seems you are losing precision in this line:Try using:This happens because even though Python can handle arbitrary scale integers, it doesn't do so well with floats.BonusA single line implementation using another algorithm (the BBP formula):
For people who come here just to get a ready solution to get arbitrary precision of pi with Python:
