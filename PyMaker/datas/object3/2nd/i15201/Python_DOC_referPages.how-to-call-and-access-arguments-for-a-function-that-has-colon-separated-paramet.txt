I'm attempting to write a python function that computes the number of minutes given the days, hours and minutes.The function is to be calledI'm confused as to how to assign numerical values to the , , and  so I can then manipulate those variables. Any help or suggestions would be really appreciated.
The function  is using  python3 function annotations:You can still just pass args like you normally would:Or pass a dict:
Might be a job for a  (part of the  library). A  allows you to access the different members of the tuple by names you have given them. Example: Now to convert to minutes you can simply do this: Or you could also change your desired function signature a bit, and do it this way which seems a little more straight forward: EDIT: Didn't realize the point of the question was to understand what the colons are doing. The colons and strings following the arguments in the function signature are not a dictionary; they are function annotations, which I believe are new in Python 3.
