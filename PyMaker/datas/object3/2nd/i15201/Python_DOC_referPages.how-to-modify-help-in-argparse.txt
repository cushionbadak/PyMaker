When you runfoo.py -h ORfoo.py --help,you will get a "help" message about how to use foo.py and what arguments that it takes. Is there a way I can append to this message? Printing __doc__ for example?
Sure,  gives you a lot of customization possibilities.  To "append" to the help (print more after the help message is done), for example, use the  named argument.where  stands for "whatever other named arguments you want to pass to the parser constructor", the message in question will be printed on  after the help about arguments.See https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html for a few thousand words about  (written as a reference but with lots of examples) and https://docs.python.org/3/howto/argparse.html#id1 for a few thousand more (written as a tutorial).  Maybe half those docs are about how to fine-tune messages for  or error cases!-)
The help-formatting function, , looks like this:So, you can eithercustomize the strings used (they can be passed as constructor arguments, you're probably interested in ), orreplace the default  (the  constructor argument) to customize how these strings are transformed into help textthe  module bundles 3 alternative classes.
