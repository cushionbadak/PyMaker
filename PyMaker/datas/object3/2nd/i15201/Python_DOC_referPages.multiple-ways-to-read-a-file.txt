Natural Text
I am not sure if there is a difference in the way the file will be read in the two scenarios below on line 2.  The first scenario has a  in the open command, and the second one does not.  Both output the same result.  Are these just just different ways to achieve the same result?Scenario 1:Scenario 2:
Yes, the two code pieces are equivalent.   is the default mode for .  From the docs: is an optional string that specifies the mode in which the file is opened. It defaults to  which means open for reading in  text mode.
there is no difference
You might consider using  to open the file which, among other benefits, auto closes the file. It is also better to count your target string line-by-line rather than reading the entire file into memory:Shorter, less memory, more 'Pythonic'  On a side note,  will count all occurrences of that substring even if part of a larger string. Example:Consider either splitting the text for a full match:Or a regex:
from the python doc,it's the same.but if you wanna increase the readable,it's good to add the 'r' mode :)
