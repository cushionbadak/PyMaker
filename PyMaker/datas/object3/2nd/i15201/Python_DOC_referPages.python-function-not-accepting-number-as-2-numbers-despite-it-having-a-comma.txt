This is probably going to be fairly obvious but for some reason it just DOESN'T work. The function I have is like this:the function that's plugging into that is:which comes out with a number that's in a (n,m) format When I try to plug that (n,m) into the first function though, it doesn't work? I think it should because it's separated by a comma, and that's what the first function calls for, but I don't know. 
Try this:A tuple, like  is a single thing, and therefore it counts as only one argument.  It does NOT work like this:Instead it works like this:...which means you didn't provide an argument for num2.However, writing:explodes the tuple into two arguments:
Try calling hours() with the  to unpack the tuple:Here is the relevant section of the docs:https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#unpacking-argument-lists
It's a bit hard to tell based on the wording of your question, but I think what you're saying is that this:doesn't work as expected, where  returns something like ?If so, you need to use what's commonly called the splat operator, python's syntax for unpacking arguments:The  operator, when used on an input parameter to a method, expands out a list/tuple/iteratable and uses the results as positional arguments to a method. I.E.If you omit the  operator, a tuple would be passed together as a single positional argument, rather than being unpacked.
