In order to manage all my python paths for my project and have them available as soon as I start python interpreter, I created a project.pth in the project home directory having relative paths in it,Actually, to be read, I need to do a site.addsitedir(my_project_home_dir) each time I start the interpreter. I tried setting PYTHONPATH or create a .pth in site-packages pointing to my project home directory, but project.pth is still not read automatically when I start the interpreter.The only thing that works is to put my project.pth in site-packages, but by doing that, I have to transform my project relative paths to absolute paths.So it there a master .pth file where I can specify my project home directory so I can have my project.pth located in that directory to be read automatically ?
While I know this doesn't specifically answer your question, might I suggest a different approach? The use of virtual environments (venv).Given a project (I used pyscaffold) to create. - Create a virtual environment at the highest level (python -m venv venv). - Add PYTHONPATH to your venv\Scripts\activate.bat file. - PYTHONPATH should contain at least three entries (path\to\MyTestProject; pat\to\MyTestProject\src; path\to\MyTestProject\tests). Activate your virtual environment from cmd by "venv\Scripts\activate.bat". - From within your modules, import from src (import src.mytestproject.package1.module1)You will have your paths available to you each time you activate your virtual environment - and, you will have all the goodness associated with a virtual environment as a bonus. 
Finally I found 2 ways : 1) First, note that .pth files also accept lines beginning with 'import' and execute them. So the solution was to create project.pth inside site-packages importing a module in my project home dir that do actually the site.addsitedir()2) Other possibility : use the environment variable PYTHONSTARTUP : it will execute any module you want at python startup. You can specify a module that do the site.addsitedir() or even directly add paths into sys.path
