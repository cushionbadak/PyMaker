In PyCharm I don't see any variable I can use for this purpose. However, PyCharm seems to hide some of the dunder variables. (for example,  )I would like to do something like this:Where  is defined.Rather than this:The root questions are really:What variables/information is available while defining the class?How to properly programmatically add attributes to a Python class in the class definition?Links to relevant docs are appreciated.
Thanks to @alex-hall for the comment.PEP-3155 says that: is the name of the class is the module name
