In the old days, we used a 'found' variable when iterating through a list to signify that you found a match. There is now the pythonic construct of using an 'else' with a for loop to eliminate using the 'found' variable. For example, this works beautifully:But, I have a nested for loop AND I need to store all items that do not exist in the second array (m below) but do exist in the first array (l below). I'm just not sure how to go about implementing this construct. I don't want to (if I don't have to) use a 'found' variable... Any ideas?
If you want all the elements in  that are not in  you may do a comprehension (as @PatrickHaugh suggested) or a set operation.The comprehension:If you prefer to use a set operation:Note that  and  here are .
There are a couple of ways that you could do this. The cleanest and most effiecient way is actually to probably use s. E.g.If logging is important to you, you count use the  key world:Also, I'm assuming that your last line isn't indented properly. At the moment your example would give
