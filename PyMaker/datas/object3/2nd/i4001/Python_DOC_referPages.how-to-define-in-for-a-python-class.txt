If I had a list of some python class that had a string field, is there a way to compare a string to a list of objects of that class using ? I was curious if there's a way to do something like this:by modifying the  method, or maybe even there's an  method I'm unaware of
You intuition about defining a custom  was right. You can achieve the following, which seems to be your objective here:I also want to point out that there is the  method, which allow you to define the membership operator's behavior (). However this is a method on the container type, so here defining this method for your class  wouldn't do anything, since the  is applied to the list, and not its individual items.
Your guess about modifying the  is correct. It's definitely one way to do this. You just need to check the value of 's argument with the respective attribute of your object. So as a very simple way you can implement something like following:Note that this  method doesn't have any restrictions like type checking or some other error handling. If you think that they're needed in your case you can consider using  and or other condition checking as well.Demo:
