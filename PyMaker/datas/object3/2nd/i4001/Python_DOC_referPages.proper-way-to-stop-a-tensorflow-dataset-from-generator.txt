I would like to use a TensorFlow Dataset built with  to access a formatted file. Most everything works except I don't know how to stop the Dataset iterator when the generator runs out of data (the generator just returns empty lists forever when you go out of range).My actual code is very complex, but I can mock up the situation with this short program:If I know the number of records in advance, I can tune the number of batches, but I don't always know. I've tried putting some code in the snippet above where I have a comment line like . In particular, I've tried raising an , but TensorFlow doesn't like this, even if I explicitly  it in my execution code. I also tried raising a , but I'm not sure how to instantiate it: the constructor requires three arguments - 'node_def', 'op', and 'message', and I'm not quite sure what to use for 'node_def' and 'op' in general.I'd appreciate any thoughts or comments on this issue. Thanks!
Return when you meet your stop criteria:This is in line with the behavior specified in the Python 3 documentation:In a generator function, the return statement indicates that the generator is done and will cause StopIteration to be raised. The returned value (if any) is used as an argument to construct StopIteration and becomes the StopIteration.value attribute.
