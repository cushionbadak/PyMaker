Heyo! I am trying to change the filenames of all of the pictures in folder to a new naming schema so that a program I am using can recognize it. the current naming schema is 'cam1_###.png' where the ### is the number in the sequence. For example, the first photo is named, "cam1_000.png".What I am trying to get to is the following naming schema: 'cam1_r###_####_rgb.png' where the 'r###' and the '####' increases by one everytime. For example, the first image in the folder, 'cam1_000.png", would be renamed 'cam1_r000_0000_rgb.png' and the 100th photo would be renamed from 'cam1_099.png' to 'cam1_r099_0099_rgb.png'I feel like this should be super easy, but I'm having trouble with the formatting :/ here is what I currently have:Thanks in advance for any advice/redirection! 
You can trying using  to make your output filename easier to define. You can also use  to provide the necessary zero-padding.In addition, you should use  for a counter.Finally, it's useful to split the name and extension from your filename using .
I would suggest using a format string here. You create a string representing the pattern you want to use, and then call the  method of that string with the value(s) you want to substitute in as arguments.In this case, I think you could useIn the format code , the  tells it which argument to  to use (zero-indexed, so  means the second argument, ), and the part after the colon tells it how to format that argument:  means include leading zeros,  means fill up three characters, and  means to format it as an integer.Note that you'll first need to split the filename into the base (e.g. ) and extension ().
I'm dumb, so this is what I got... hopefully, this will help anyone else trying to do this :D
