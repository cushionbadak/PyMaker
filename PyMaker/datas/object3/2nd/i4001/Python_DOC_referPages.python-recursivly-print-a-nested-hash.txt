I would like to print nested hash in Python, from this:to something like this:I am not really familiar with Python, and after couple hours I'm still stuck.I currently working on this function:I'm trying to add each line to a list to be able to use it later, but I think I don't have the right aproach with my shared variable (line), because at each dict the recursive call is made with one more dict key from the same level of depth, so I got this :What would be a Pythonic way to do this?
Using a generator ( statement) you can do that recursively like:Code:One thing to note is the need to re-yield the results from the generator that was recursed into.  That is done here using:Which is equivalent to:Test Code:Results:
I got this to work, but its a bit hacky, using  adds one element, and  adds all elements in a list. Hope it helps:Output:
Pretty straightforward recursive implementation.
