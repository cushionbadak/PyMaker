I am using glob to get a list of all PDF files in a folder (I need full path names to upload file to cloud)also, during the upload I need to assign a "title" to the file which we be the items name in the cloud.I need to split the last "\" and the "." and get the values in between. for example:a item in the list will be: "c:\User\username\Desktop\pdf\4434343434331.pdf"I need another pythonic way to grab the pdfs file name in a separate variable while still in the for loop. however the above split will not return my desired results but something along those linesI am using a for loop to upload each pdf (using file path)
