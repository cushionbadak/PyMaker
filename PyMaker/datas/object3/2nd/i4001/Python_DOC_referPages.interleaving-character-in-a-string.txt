I'm currently tasked with replacing  with .I've tried  but end up with .How can I fix this?
You want to use the  method along with .First   by a space to get:  Then for each of those entries, separate each character with  using :Then turn it back into one string separated by a space using , and your resulting code is:Output: What your code is doing:First, notice that the first parameter that you pass into  is not a space, which is what you presumably intended for it be, but the expression , which is an implicit way of doing string concatenation.Thus,  becomes , which replaces each occurrence of  with .The result of such an operation may at first seem somewhat ill-defined, but in Python, since you can think of a string  as being equal to , replacing each occurrence of  with  would yield what you see: a  between each letter and a  on the ends.Passing a  as the first parameter to  doesn't work, because it will replace spaces (specifically, the space in the middle) with , so you'd get .

Have you tried to trim the string "SUPER MAN" before passing it to replace()? And then you can always use a StringBuilder (assuming you're using Java) and then use DeleteCharAt() method to manually remove extra '^'.
