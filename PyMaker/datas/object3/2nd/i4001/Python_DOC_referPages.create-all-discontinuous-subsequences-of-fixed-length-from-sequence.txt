I have a sequence like the following:I want to make all discontinuous subsequences of length 5 for this. Because there are 5 possible reading frames, I want a list of 5 lists like the following:All of the characters will not be present in each list, and for this example, the 5th list will only have two entries. This is okay.How can I make a function that generalizes this to all possible lengths of the subsequence?Thanks!Jack
Through nested list comprehension:
Although the single list comprehension is the better answer, here is a 1 approach.GivenCodeOutputDetailsGoal: make several sliding windows of the sequence and split them into chunks.In the first list comprehension, the results are shrinking sliding . For demonstration, here is an example of the full cascading results:Notice for each window, the left side slides, while the right side is fixed.  In other words, the window size shrinks by 1 for each iteration.  These shrinking windowing are achieved by the  parameter in  (see the docs for details).  Since the process repeats, only the first windows of a given  are selected via .The second comprehension simply chunks these windows into groups of a , discarding invalid chunks ( or containing the fillvalue , a default in ).1 is a third-party library installed via .
