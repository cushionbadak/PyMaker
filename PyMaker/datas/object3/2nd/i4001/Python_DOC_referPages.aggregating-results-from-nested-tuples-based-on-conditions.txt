i have a nested tuple and i want to get a table with results, i'm trying to use comprehension on this but i'm not getting the best results.output example:Can anyone give me some help?
You can use a dictionary comprehension:Output:
This is a pure Python dictionary-based solution:Result:
You can easily invert your flat goals list into a dictionary indexed by the team name and bracket the first and second half immediately so you don't have to do multiple iterations over your data, something like:As to how this works - the  will call the passed factory () to create a new key whenever a non-existent key is encountered so each team will start with a  list as its value. Then, as we iterate over the data, all we need is a simple  check as an index selector - in this context, it will be treated as an  producing  for  (hence the first half) and  for  (hence the second half) thus enabling us to select the proper index for increment.This results with a nice dictionary whose keys are holding the team name while its value is essentially just a two-element list counting the goals in the first and the second half.If you want to print the data, just use  to get to your desired table look, something like:Which will give you:As a bonus, for extra neatness, you can get the biggest string length of the  keys and dynamically pad the left-hand side based on your team data.
If you're ok using third party libraries (pandas), which has the distinct advantage of actually displaying a table (which you could export to a variety of formats such as CSV, HTML, etc):
