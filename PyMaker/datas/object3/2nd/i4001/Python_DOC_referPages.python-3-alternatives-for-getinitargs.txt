Is there are short enough way to call the  constructor of a class during unpickling in Python 3? The usual way to do this was using  like soHowever, the  will be ignored in new style classes and in Python 3+, all classes can only be new style classes. There is the  but it will pass the arguments only to the  class method which is not the same. A python 2 call of the above illustrative example will result inwhile a python 3 call will error outand ignore the  method.I don't think Python 3 will easily regress in that regard so hopefully I am missing something obvious.EDIT: Replacing  with  does not solve the issue.
If you want  to unpickle your object by calling , going through  for initialization the same way a normal call to  would, then tell it to do so in a  method:Demo.
