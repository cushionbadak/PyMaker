Natural Text
OK, so this seems like a really basic question, but I can't find a workable answer anywhere, so here goes.I have some text:It doesn't contain any line breaks or other formatting. I want to wrap my text so it displays properly in my ipython output window when I run my code. I also want it centered, and a bit shorter than the full window width (80 chars)If I had a short text string (shorter than the line length) I could simply calculate the length of the string and pad it with spaces to get it to centre, or use the  property to display it correctly.If I had a text string that I just wanted to wrap, I could use:and set width to whateverSo I would have thought I could simply then:but it doesn't work. Everything is still left justified.I'm sure I can't be the only person who has tried to do this. Can anybody help me out?
The problem is that  expects a single-line string, and  returns a multiline string.The answer is to  each line, before joining them up.If you look at the docs for , it's shorthand for:So, you can just skip that shorthand and use  directly. For example, you can write your own function that does exactly what you want:Although if you're only doing this in one place, to immediately print it out, it's probably simpler to not even bother ing it:
 is a list of strings so loop over the strings and center them.
