This function receives a string as input and should return the number of syllables in the string.This function has following conditions:1. Number of syllables is equal to the number of vowels2. Two or more consecutive vowels count only as one.3. One or more vowels at the end of the word are not counted. This is what I've so far but clearly I'm still missing a lot. I'm not sure how to continue here, so I hope you guys can help.
I suggest you the following simple code:  I also provide a one-line style solution using regex, easily readable too if you know a little bit about regex. It simply counts the number of groups of consecutive vowels that are followed by a consonant:  
To check the last vowel you can try something like this (I wouldn't iterate as you're going to loose whole syllables): -> EX: Italian word "Aia" (threshing floor)-- sorry but I didn't manage to put 'code' into comments so a posted an answer
I would go for:Stolen from LaurentH:            
I think we have return 1 if there is previousLetterIsAVowel and N returns 0. Example word Bee.In Addition to Laurent H. answer
