I'm new to python and having some issues with blocking.   I have a script that I'm calling with options.  I'm able to see the arguments come in, however, I have been unable to get the program to work correctly.  In the code sample below, I'm trying to grab the arguments and then run the piece of code after the "#if ip address is not defined qpid-route will not work" comment.  If I change the indentation after the comment, I get expected indentation or unexpected indentation errors.The problem is that the way the code currently is it will run the elif opt in ("-i", "--ipaddress"): code and then will continue and run the code through to the bottom and then come back and run the -s loop code and then rerun the code to the bottom.   To fix this, I tried a break or continue command and all I get is indentation errors on this no matter which level I align it with.  Can someone help me format this correctly such that I can pull the ipaddress and scac values that I'm grabbing from the arguments and then run the code after the "#if ip address is not defined qpid-route will not work" comment as a separate block.
This statement  on line 40 and below has indentation different to that of the rest of the code. You'll see line 38 also doesn't match the indenting of the above if.
