What is required?Test if any of *.csv file is generated in the current directory. Note that the csv file is named after date/time so its not possible to get the file name in this case.ProblemTried the os.path.isfile([exact_path_to_file]) and it works. However what we need to find is if any one of the .csv file is generated if so, assertTrue else assertFalse. In case of assertTrue, will delete the file.Is this possible with python?ReferenceThe closest of this is using a regular expression like this post however for this simple check is it really required to go for a regular expression?
Use the  module to list files in a directory matching a pattern:If  is a non-empty list, there are matching files.Under the hood, the  module transforms the glob pattern to a regular expression for you (via , runs  on the given directory, and returns only those names that match the pattern, as full paths:
You can use  to get all file names and  to get file extensionFor current path, ,  will both do (or even leave out the parameter). To delete all *.csv files, just go through a loop
