I am currently developing a terminal tool which analyse the output of an command. I write the tool in python.Now I would like to start my tool as an argument within every command, example: In this case,  is the command and I would like to start my own project  with the argument  which analyse the output from the project and writes its own output to a file. Now my question:How do I get to start my own program  from the argument  and how can I catch and read the output from ?
Adding -analyse as an argument will pass it to program.py.  I don't think that is what you are looking for.  I think you are looking for .  Then just read the output from stdin.Throw  at the top of analyse.py and change the permissions to executable to make it simpler yet: 
argparse is the standard library module for dealing with command line arguments. I'd advise that you structure your script arguments in the following way:Choose a character, say , to indicate the name of the script you wish to run through your tool. This would be called in the following way:Then you can use  to simply execute the file specified after the  argument and do whatever you wish with the output.
