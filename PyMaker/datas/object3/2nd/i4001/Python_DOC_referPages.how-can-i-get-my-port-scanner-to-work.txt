I am trying to make a port scanner that searches a port that is input against all odd numbered IP address in the range of 10-255.My current code isn't working, and I am receiving this error;I thought   would fix this but it did not.Am I missing something? My current code is below:
I think you'll find that the ip address has to be a string. For instance '127.0.0.1' not an int, the port is an int though.
