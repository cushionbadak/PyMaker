I am trying to pass multiple arguments to some scipy stats functions in python eg. stats.kruskal but the problem is sometimes I got only three arguments sometimes i got many more and I do not know how to pass it dynamically. Here is what I got so far:My first idea was to create string with these arrays but it does not work that way.Here is example of the same code but less automatic which works fine but as I said before I will not get always only three arguments and know data so well. I want this code below more automatic to work with every data.
