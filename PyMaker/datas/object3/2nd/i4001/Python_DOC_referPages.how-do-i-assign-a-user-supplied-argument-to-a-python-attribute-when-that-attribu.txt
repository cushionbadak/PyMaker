I may be doing all of this completely wrong, but I'm a google taugh python programmer, so there's that.I have a created a class called "create" that builds an object.  Properties of that object are instances of another class (settings)This lets me call the complex properties of each of my objects settings individually.  For example, see if a setting (filter) is required for execution by checking a.filter.IsRequiredTo adjust the settings, specifically 'value' I am taking input from the user.I can reference the overall object with a string by using eval.Now the issue.  I'm trying to change 'filter' based on user supplied input.How can I assign a user supplied variable to the 'value' of 'filter' in this example?
What you mean by  is:
Your weird class style aside (you should read on class inheritance in Python), you should not use  for pretty much anything (read Eval really is dangerous) - if you need to access a variable by name from the global namespace use :Second, if you want to access an attribute of an object by name, use , so:
