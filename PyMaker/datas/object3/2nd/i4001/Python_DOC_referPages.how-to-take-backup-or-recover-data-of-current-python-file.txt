This is an sample program. here the dictionaries are copied to the file named save.txt. Actually I am running this program in raspberry pi and if the power suddenly gets off, the datas stored completely gets erased. I want my program to start again from the previous end of the program or I should have an backup from where I can restart my program. 
If your program terminates abruptly, buffered output might not make it from your program to the operating system. If power is cut, buffered output might not make it from the operating system to disk.The first is handled with flush on the file object, and the second by fsync in the io module.This is somewhat slow, of course. You can also use  to eliminate buffered IO and skip the need to flush (but you will still need to fsync).(Even so, there are still no guarantees: Hard drives are known to report that a write has completed when it is actually on volatile storage inside the hard drive.)How your program recovers after being interrupted is an entirely different matter. Perhaps it can read the output file to determine where it left off. (When resuming your writes, remember to use append  mode so as not to truncate your output file.)Also try the sqlite3 module: The underlying SQLite database is robust against power failures.
