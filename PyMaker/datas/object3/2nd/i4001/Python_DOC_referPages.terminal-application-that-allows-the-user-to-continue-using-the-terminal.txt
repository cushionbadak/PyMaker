How would one go about creating an piece of software that shows a status bar (e.g. with a news ticker) within the terminal window while allowing the user to continue using the terminal normally?Is it simply impossible to have an application run and display information while returning control to the user, or could you hypothetically accept input from the user, relay it to the system, and relay any output to the user?Are there any (python or JS) libraries that would help in the creation of such applications?
What have you tried? What method are you using to display data in the terminal? What research have you done? I suggest reading up on curses and using  to run your commands, but I cannot be more specific without understanding more about the problem.Edit: if you're okay with having a script in the background that prints a status update periodically, then it's much simpler.It depends on whether you're using Windows or a UNIX-like OS. Assuming UNIX, this link will tell you how to run a script in the background. To summarise : just add  to the end of the command.
