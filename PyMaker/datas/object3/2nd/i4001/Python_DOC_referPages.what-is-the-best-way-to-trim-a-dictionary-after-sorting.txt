I want to reduce the number of items in a dictionary. So I need to trim dictionary after sorting by value. My question is how? So I to trim this dict so only the top TWO entries are retained—I've tried—But is this the best way? And to display or compare the values in dictionary, is there smart way to ordering by value? Note that it is not just sorting of values, it is sorting of dictionary using values.I want to have only a few elements with maximum values. That is, from  to such as  Effectively retaining only the top TWO elements and discarding the rest.
The way you suggest is certainly pythonic.  The only issue I can see is that you need just the two biggest elements, but still have to sort all tuples in the dict: this could be done more efficiently with 
Yes, this is more or less the most obvious way to do it. You could aim to get rid of the lambda for a cleaner solution using .
