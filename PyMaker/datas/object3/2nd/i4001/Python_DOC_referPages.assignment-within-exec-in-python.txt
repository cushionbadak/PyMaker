I am trying to build calculator using PyQt5 and I get string which I need to evaluate and assign it to a variable so that I can Pass that variable to widgets as an answer . So far I can evaluate the expression but can't assing it . How can I do that ? so far I have following code:-When I try to run it without global, it runs without error but x remains 0 and If I ran it like this I get this error:-I am very new to python So can't figure out whats going on 
is not valid python code.If you want to assign to a global variable , you should writeTry changing your code asTo modify global variables with exec, you need to use globals() function.EDIT: Add globals() function. 
Hmm,  and  are evil. When you use them on a non sanitized string, you implicitely accept to execute almost any Python expression...But that have not exactly same usages:  is meant to execute some code, while  will return a value. Here the correct way would be:That is not a correct usage of a global variable anyway because it is only used to get a value from a call, so the correct way is to have the function to return the value, hence  instead of .But remember:  is evil so never use that in production code.
