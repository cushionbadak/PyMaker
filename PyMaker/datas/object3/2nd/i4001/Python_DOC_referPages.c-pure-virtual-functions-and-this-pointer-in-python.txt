I'm a former c++ coder and have made the plunge into python for several months, which has been great.  I'm doing a bit of code porting and have come across a problem of which i'm not sure the best path.  There are many ways to skin a cat - but i'm looking for advice on what would be the 'best' and/or most pythonic way to do something similar to the section of c++ code below.I've cut the code to a trivial 'reproducer' just to highlight what was happening. Essentially there is a well-defined interface of callbacks the server will call when certain events happen.  When a server is created, it is provided a callback interface as an argument.In the below case, the client has implemented these callbacks on itself, and thus when it is creating the server, it provides the *this pointer.Is this something similar in python? Any suggestions would get greatly appreciated.So here's an attempt at porting to python.  Note that in the real world example, there are 20+ client feed handler functions, hence why i want to force the interface using the @abstractmethod.Edit: The above code sample now works as per the c++ code.
Python sample code below C++ in OP now working.
