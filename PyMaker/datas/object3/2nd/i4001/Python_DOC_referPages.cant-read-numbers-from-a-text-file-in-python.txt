Natural Text
I have to read a list of 12 grades from a text file. Each grade is on a new line in the text file. I have to find the lowest grade and drop it(in the text file as well), then find the average score of the grades. I am having trouble making the text values into integer values so I can find the average. I also can't figure out how to find the lowest grade and drop it.Here is my code:Thanks for any help you can give!
So this is just one way to take all of your values and calculate the average.Here I just put all of your values into notepad and read through itThen I used a for-loop to go through each line and put the grades into a list    I used another list for converted each value

This is one way you can structure your logic. You need to convert values to  pre-processing. Using  is recommended instead of using  and  explicitly.
