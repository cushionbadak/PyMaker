I'm writting a module called  that has many internal functions, but ultimately boils down to a single external function . When using this module/function, I'd like to doinstead ofIs this possible? What do I need to put in  to make this happen?
Python doesn't allow a module to be callable.See this StackOverflow question about callable modules.
Make the name of your module in the  dictionary point to the function instead of your module. would look like thisthen you can use this module from a different fileThere are probably reasons for why you shouldn't do this.
It is not strictly possible. Python module names are ment to help the programmer distinguish between modules. So even if you had one function,  in your module , using  will still need a . You're probably better off just using . However there may be a way around this. Python also has built-in functions, and you may be able to add your own functions to this. Doing so might require rewriting the compile though.So conclusion: writing  isn't all that ugly and is a lot easier and prettier than the long way around.
