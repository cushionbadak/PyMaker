Looks like  is a bottom-level directory. That means that when you call  with the  path, the  variable will be an empty list , so the inner loop  does not execute at all.My advice would be to re-write your function to iterate over the files directly, and not the directories... don't worry, you'll get there eventually, that's the nature of a directory tree.However, on more recent versions of python (3.5+), you can use recursive glob:Source.
