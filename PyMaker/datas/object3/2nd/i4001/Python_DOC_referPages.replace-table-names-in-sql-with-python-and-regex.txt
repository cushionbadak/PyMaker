I need to update a number sql queries to point to a new set of tables. I am having a hard time finding the word ends, i.e. the end of the table names, with python's re. The white space character and the end of the table names can be a newline or a space. The script is not finding matches for the regex.sub() method. I have tried using "\s" instead of "\b". This does find the table names well but then when I replace the string I am losing the original white space character. What am I doing wrong? 
Python string literals use the backslash as an escape character. The string literal  will contain the backspace character (ASCII 0x8), just like  will contain a newline. It will not contain "backslash b", as you would need for the regex to work.To get "backslash b" you need to escape the backslash in the string literal, or use a raw string, which is  or , respectively.Commonly, raw strings are used for regex in Python, so you don't need to double every backslash.Read https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literalsSide note:  works because - in contrast to  or  - it means nothing special in a Python string literal, so it actually becomes "backslash s" for the regex.
