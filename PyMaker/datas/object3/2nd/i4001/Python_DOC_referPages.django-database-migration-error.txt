I have a Django project connected to Gmail API.When I try to do database migration it returns this:I have also tried 'makemigrations' and old one 'syncdb', but first one gives the same error and the second one isn't used anymore.I use SQLite3. This is in my settings :"quickstart" is a file from which I call a function. I guess all the names are correct, so I don't know what's the problem. This is error was before but I decided to think about it later.Thanks.
It's definitely related to this line:Looks like you're missing the  module. Is it related to some tutorial? Maybe you forgot to activate your virtual environment?Update:You should use local imports or provide the full path to the package if you have such a project structure https://ibb.co/fdvaRJ:or Or you could put your  module one level upper and just useas you do now.Don't forget to check out the official guide on packaging and modules in Python: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages
I did some manipulations with that quickstart file. First I created in every folder 'init.py', then I created an empty folder in app directory and dragdropped there 'quickstart.py' and created there an empty "init" file too. Didn't work: the error just changed from ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'quickstart' to ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'api.quickstart'. Then I deleted all "init" files created 2 minutes ago, put 'quickstart' file back to the root folder of my app and also drag'n'dropped an "init" file.The error became just like " from quickstart import goImportError: cannot import name 'go' ". What I did next is just changed "from quickstart import go" to "import quickstart" and then called go function like "quickstart.go()"Too much text so images for better understanding:https://ibb.co/fdvaRJhttps://ibb.co/kzgPmJhttps://ibb.co/jyjVty
