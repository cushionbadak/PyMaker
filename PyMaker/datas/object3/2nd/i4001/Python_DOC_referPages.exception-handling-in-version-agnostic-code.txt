I have a simple task at hand...handling exception so the code does not throw IncompleteRead when using urllib/urllib2 between python2.x/3.xfor python2for python3now since the module itself are different, how to do a try-except when i have no idea which python version will my users be running? I cannot check for python version within my try-except as well...or can I?is there a way to catch its super class so it becomes same for both python version? if yes, how?
You can:Then use:in both python2 and python3.
Unless you need Python 2.5, you can use new-style except: statements in 2.x.So, the only difference is the module names. You can  both manually, as in Sraw's answer. But you should probably be using , , or , as the official porting docs and most other dual-versioning and porting guides recommend, and this is exactly the kind of thing that they're good for.With :Or, with :Or, even better, just write the 2.7 code:â€¦ then run  on it, and it automatically gives you the  code above.
You could do a try ... except on the import in an init module and then split your code into python2 and python3 modules:Oh request doesn't do what you want, perhaps you mean 'requests' and requests doesn't have a 'urlopen' method you need to use 'get()'.
