I want to determine the imports of each python module in a library for use in a custom configuration management framework.  I've seen tools like snakefood, but I'd prefer to compute a dependency graph during normal program execution, instead of as a ~compilation step.So far I've tried writing a custom Finder and Loader.  Both approaches work as expected the first time a module is imported, but don't trigger on subsequent imports thanks to the  cache.I can override  for notifications every time a module is imported, but it seems like this approach is ill-advised since PEP 302.Is there an import hook I can place in front of  cache lookups?  Or another way to quickly compute dependencies on the fly?
It's possible (if hacky) to reassign to :However, this might require some maintenance if the import system changes.
