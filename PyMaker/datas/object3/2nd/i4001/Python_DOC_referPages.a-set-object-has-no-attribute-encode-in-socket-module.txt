I've tried to encode a set object and it failed to do it, claiming an AttributeError code.Is there a way for it to work?NOTE: I've been using the socket module.
Are you trying to send some form of representation of  via a socket? Then you need a binary representation of that object first. Using  suggests that you want the string-representation of , which you can get using .
There are a few options here, but probably the easiest is to encode your dictionary using the Python pickle protocol. To do that, use sending code like this:and receiving code like this:However, I want to warn you: using the  module at all is a can of worms. It is low level and meant for experienced programmers. Compared to the question you've just asked, the other problems you'll have to deal with are probably a lot harder. For example, you have to think about how to delimit your messages before you figure out what to pass as the second parameter to  (the  parameter).I suggest you try something higher-level like Python's  modules.
