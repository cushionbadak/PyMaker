I'm scrapping a website script and I came across a variableit's a part of a long string so I'm storing it in python as a substring variable as follows: let's say that the div that has the script I need is stored in a  variable, therefore  returns the script I need, then I search for the above string beginning  and the end of this string , now I can form the string using , now if I run  it printsbut I can't get it's actual value, running python in terminal shows the following resultsThat  is what I need, so how to get it?
I found the solution a long time ago and forgot to post the answer, so sorry for those who came across the same problem.First, we need to escape the hex string by removing the  from it:After removing the  we have generated a hex string, so, to get it's value we do the following:
Your string is Base64 encoded - it has a certain look to it, and the  at the end are a dead giveaway. You can use the  module to turn it back into a byte string.
You can use , since the Javascript string literal in question is also a valid Python string literal.
