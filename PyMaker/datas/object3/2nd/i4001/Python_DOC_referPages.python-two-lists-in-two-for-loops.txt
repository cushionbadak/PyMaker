I have two list here:I'm trying to compare the elements in two lists and return the minimum value of the different for both element 0 in list1 and element 1 in list2, for example:print list3 give me:[datetime.timedelta(0, 2976), datetime.timedelta(3, 30187), datetime.timedelta(3, 30198), datetime.timedelta(6, 6277), datetime.timedelta(3, 22987), datetime.timedelta(3, 22998), datetime.timedelta(5, 85477)]Everything in the same list.Here in , I could get the minimum value for first element in  but how could I get the minimum value for the second one  and loop if i have element 3 in list1?I would like to separate the list for compare result for first element in  and second element, please let me know how to achieve this, much appreciated!
If I understand correctly, you can separate your time deltas in different lists, and then just use  to get the minimum values.Using your own code:This way, your  holds the difference from each element of  to all elements of Then you can get the minimum difference from the first item using  and for the second Notice that, if you haveyour whole code can be written in one line using list comprehension:being  and  your list of  objects. This yields
First off, Python doesn't know that the string represents a date. You can't just throw data into a string and expect the interpreter to know what you want. So, you're just going to get an error because the "-" operator means nothing to strings.If you want to compare two dates, I suggest reading up on Python's builtin datetime module: https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html
If you want to iterate over the two lists together you can zip them and iterate over them simultaneously.  Then compare the values and append the one you want to the result list.Note that the result will be the size of the smaller list, list2 in this case.
