I have a nested list:What I need is an algorithm to get indexes of shorter sublists, all elements of which are contained in longer ones. In this example algorithm should return:Any help would be appreciated!
One way may be to use double  loop in same list and check with  for those when not equal :Result:
You can convert each sublist to a set, and use the helpful  method.  This will not work if you have duplicate elements in your lists that you need to preserve.
