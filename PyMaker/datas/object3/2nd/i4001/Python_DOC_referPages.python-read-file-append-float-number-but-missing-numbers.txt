Natural Text
I have a question regarding extracting data from  file in python. My data.txt file looks like thisIt has some strings followed by 44388 float numbers.I use the lines below to extract it:however, instead of getting 44388 float numbers in mylist, I end up having 44383 float numbers when I Read file A, 44378 float numbers when I read file B and 44388 float numbers when I read file C. The only difference is the last letter in the filename and the numbers are all float numbers which are from my lab testing result. I don't know if the problem comes from the regex, or anywhere else. Could anywone help me with this? thank you very much!
Whats wrong with your code-sample:Your  command parameters do not work as given. Your lacks a  is fully obsolete due to the  statementre.findall() returns a list, no need to append it, simply set . Your regex will not match interger values without a , see regex101 - so for you only matchIf your files always start with 2 lines you want to discard and are followed by floats, you can do:If you still have different number counts, and each float has indeed a  in it, use a text editor to count the number of  in your file. Most probably A,B and C simply have different amount of test results in them.
