This question already has an answer here:Removing elements from a list containing specific characters                    4 answers                I have a list that contains elements and want to delete some elements that has particular keyword.For example:List contains:list = ['red rose','blue rose','red color','yellow paper']And I'm looking for deleting lists with keyword 'RED' and get output asOutput:    ['blue rose', 'yellow paper']Thank you.

All what you need is a loop:['blue rose', 'yellow paper']
