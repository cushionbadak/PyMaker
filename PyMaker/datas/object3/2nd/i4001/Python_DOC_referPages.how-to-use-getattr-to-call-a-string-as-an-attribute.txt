I am trying to open up an 2 excel files (soxs.csv and nugt.csv) , look at the column "close" and find the max, min, mean in the "close" column for each file.The result I am getting is . But I am calling it with attributes that should run just trying to do it with less code by using a loop. Any suggestions on how to get around this?
The is a string so you can call it, you can get the  by like this:It returns the method, for calling that you should use  and send the parameters if needed, like this:
You're calling the  which is a string at following line:Change it to:Also, for accessing multiple attributes at once you can simple use  which accepts an iterable of attribute names.e.g.But in this case since you need to call the  result again, it's not a Pythonic way to use . Instead you could dimply loop over the attrs and just call the result manually in a list comprehension.
Use  instead of  for calling methods.,  and  are all methods of , not attributes. Since  only calls one method at a time, you can apply multiple methods via a comprehension.Here's a complete example:
