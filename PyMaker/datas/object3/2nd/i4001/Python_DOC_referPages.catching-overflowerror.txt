In Python 3 I have a class representing a range [x,y] of values and computing the length of such range.If the length is too large, I'm not sure how to catch the OverflowError exception inside the class itself. It is raised only in the outer code using a class instance...This is what happens upon execution:
That's because the  doesn't occur within your magic  method - Python is perfectly capable of handling much bigger integers than that - but in CPython  itself is implemented as  which returns a , which is limited to  (32-bit) or  (64-bit) and thus the overflow occurs when your  result is coerced to it.You can do a pre-check before returning the result to make sure you capture the overflow before it even occurs, something like:
