Let's say I have a list like this: Now I have a list like this:I want to query the larger list with this one, and return all the lists that contain the words within the query list in the same order. There might be gaps, but the order should be the same. How can I do that? I tried using the  operator but I don't get the desired output. 
If all that you care about is that the words appear in order somehwere in the array, you can use a  and  to iterate through the list, and if the  is emptied, you have found a valid match:By comparing each  in  with the first element of , we know that when we find a match, it has been found in the correct order, and then we , so we now are comparing with the next element in the .To filter your initial list, you can use a simple list comprehension that filters based on the result of :
You can compare two lists, with a function like this one. The way it works is it loops through your shorter list, and every time it finds the next word in the long list, cuts off the first part of the longer list at that point. If it can't find the word it returns false.Now you have a function to tell you if the list is the desired type, you can filter out all the lists you need from the 'list of lists' using a list comprehension like the following:The list  will include only the lists of the desired type.
