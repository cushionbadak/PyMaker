Natural Text
Is it possible to do this in Python:If 0 was a string then __repr__ could be used in MyClass. The the value would be '0' but the type would be MyClass. But since __repr__ can only return string, and foo.bar has to be an int __repr__ does not work. So is it possible to have MyClass() giving a value of 0 (int) but still keep its type as MyClass?
You can accomplish what you are talking about using the numbers package of the Python standard library, which implements PEP 3141.  Specifically, you can derive  from , and override the special methods as necessary.
