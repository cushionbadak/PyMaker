Natural Text
I am trying to add a window and a text in this window with curses using this and this:Code:The text added with  is visible but the "Example String" is not.How can i manipulate windows to make that text visible?

After that, the changes to  would be in parts of the screen outside your window.There's another problem: calling  refreshes the associated window.

If you return the  variable from , you can use that window with .
