Hi i am writing a program to read a dictionary from file and then it capital the first letter and sort it alphabeticallyWhat i am trying is to convert dictionary into list. Then i have tried for loop but somehow it is not workingmy file containsmy code:now when i try for loop to get the index it gives me error it gives me error: My question is getting confusing... The main thing i need to be done is that the first letter of each line becomes capital and they get sorted in file alphabetically. also please tell me what i am doing wrong in this for loop... I want index to start from [0] to the len[lst]

Just use  over mapping :Here you have a live example
