This is a problem from HackerRank. My implementation as shown below passes most of the test but for the tests that it fails, it states that it is taken too long. After looking at other submissions, I found that another user's implementation (credit to saikiran9194) passes all tests almost immediately. I really am having trouble understanding why his solution is the most efficient at scale. My Implementation:More Time Efficient Implementation
It's the difference between  and  ().  is  whereas  is  due to, as you mention, hashing.Source: https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity
 has linear complexity, so your code has quadratic complexity overall, doing linear work in each iteration of the loop. By putting the lists in a  first, it only needs O(1) to get the count for a certain letter.You can just wrap those lists into  (not tested):Or shorter using
