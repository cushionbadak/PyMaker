Original Question hereI want to sum the [qty] based on [pid][dbid][eid][sid].this code works on v3.6.4 but when i migrate to v3.4, then i got an error message:
 can be used to unpack dictionaries into keyword arguments in function calls. Beginning with python 3.5, PEP 448 -- Additional Unpacking Generalizations was added to the language. This expands the places where you can unpack tuples () and dictionaries ().  In is the first  in the list and  is a  with one key that sums the  values in the list. The  operator unpacks both dictionaries and since the dictionary constructor now supports an arbitrary number of unpackings, the two dictionaries are merged into one.This can all be done with a function for python 3.4 and earlier
