Natural Text
I have a python script that is checking data from a text file and writing it if it meets the right parameters. So far I have:I only want to write if I = 1 or is equal to the previous lines I + 1. However I'm unsure how to call the previous line, or keep the current line for future recall. Does anyone know how i can achieve this? 
One way is to just store the previous (we initialise to  and check if it is ):Another way is to user iteratorsEditIf you want to get each line number as well, use the enumerate function:Just as an FYI don't dobut instead do this:The reason is that the first method reads the entire file into memory and will not close the file if an exception happens in the read, which could corrupt the file. the  statement handles that all for you, and then you can iterate over the file directly.
