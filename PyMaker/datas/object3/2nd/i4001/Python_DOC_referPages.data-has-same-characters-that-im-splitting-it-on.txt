Natural Text
Sorry about the title, I'm a little unsure how to exactly ask this.I have a dataset of game review information. The info is separated by commas, however some of the info, like titles or genres, have commas within them. These are all inside quotations. I want to convert this to a list but keep anything within quotes as a single index, rather than two. Here's an example. This is the raw data:I use  to get: but  results in two indices. I want this as a single index, but I'm not sure how to go about it.I don't have too much experience with regular expressions but I'm guessing that's the solution I'm looking for.Any suggestions on the best way to go about this problem? 
The builtin csv module will handle this, with the only wrinkle being that that library is really designed to consume files, so the documentation may be a little unhelpful for your case, where you have a string. But the reader object can consume lists, so instead of a file, you can just pass in a list of CSV-formatted strings:
