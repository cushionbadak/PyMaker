I am new to Python and am trying out :My Question: How do I view/print all the permutations in  directly without using a  loop?What I Tried:I tried using  and  as suggested in this SO link but both do not work (former does not seem to exist for the object while latter generated 'TypeError: 'itertools.permutations' object is not callable').Please pardon if my question is rather noobish - this attributes issue appears complicated and most of what is written in SO link flew over my head.
Just cast your  to a :This will give you the following output:That's the direct answer to your question. Another good thing to figure out is whether you really need what you are asking for.You see, there is a reason why  returns a generator. If you ain't familiar with that pattern, I'd strongly suggest reading about it. To make a long story short, generally you don't wanna cast such things to a  unless you really need it to be a  (e.g. you want to access items directly by index). In your case where you only need to print permutations there is absolutely nothing wrong with using  loop.Here is one-liner to print one permutation per line:But again, simple  loop which you are using already is just fine. Remember that simple is better than complex.
