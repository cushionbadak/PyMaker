I am trying to write a dictionary to a csv file in python.I've tried nearly every tutorial that I could find but did not get a good result yet.I want to later edit that file in excel but it looks like this right now:My python code:What I need is that the key is in column A, and the values are in  column B. Furthermore each row should be used instead of every second  row. It would be nice to remove the "," between the key and the  value.I am very happy if someone could help me with this.Greetings,Finn
