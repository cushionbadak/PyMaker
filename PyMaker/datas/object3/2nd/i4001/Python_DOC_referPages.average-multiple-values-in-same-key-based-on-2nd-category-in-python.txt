This question already has an answer here:Group and compute the average in list of tuples                    2 answers                I have a list which looks something like thisI'm looking to find the average of the third elements for each type of second element for each first column values. The output would look something like thisI've been able to do something like this for a list of tuples with two elements but am struggling with three.If this question has already been answered then please point me there as I couldn't find it myself
Here is a solution using :Results:
Using nested defaultdict with float  We use the fact that the average can be calculates as (see: https://math.stackexchange.com/posts/957376/)Returns the following structure:With this you can easily add more data, e.g. running this again:Returns:
It's fairly easy to construct a suitable data structure to hold the data:Then you can just iterate through this doing the sums:
Generate a dictionary of all the values first, and then average them.So, if we name your list , you can do:which gives  as:
You can do this really easy in pandas.Hope it helps.
