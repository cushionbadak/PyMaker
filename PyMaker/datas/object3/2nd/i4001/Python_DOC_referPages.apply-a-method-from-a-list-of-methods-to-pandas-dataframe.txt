this is my first question here so please be patient with me.My problem is as follows:Assume we have a pandas Dataframe and we want to apply dynamically some pd.Series methods to a set of columns of this Dataframe. Why the following example doesn't work?Expected outcome would be But instead i getRemarkablyworks as expected, so somehow python seems to have a problem with the '.func' syntax despite the fact that yields the desired output: 'function NDFrame.astype at 0x00000186954EB840' etc.
Your syntax for calling a method is incorrect. There are 2 ways you can call a method in Python.DirectAs you found, this will work. Note that  isn't referencing some other object, it's the actual name of the method belonging to .FunctionalThe functional method demonstrates explicitly that  is the name of the method.Trying  will never work as  is not the name of a  method.
You could use  to get attributes from the Series, :For example,yields is the function in Python's standard library used for getting a named attribute from an object when the name is given in the form of a string. For example, givenwe can obtain  usingTo obtain , we would needHowever, if we specify then we need some way of handling cases where we need one call to , (e.g. ) versus those cases where we need multiple calls to  (e.g. . To unify the two cases into one simple syntax, we can use , a recursive drop-in replacement for  which can handle dotted chains of string attribute names such as . The recursion is handled by .The docs give as an example that  calculates . Similarly, you can imagine the  being replaced by  so that  calculates .
