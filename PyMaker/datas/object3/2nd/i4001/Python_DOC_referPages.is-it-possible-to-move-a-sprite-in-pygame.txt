I want to use raw user input from terminal to move a sprite using pygame, instead of using the key event listeners. Ultimately i want to be able to control the sprite via terminal issuing commands like "move up", "move left" and so on. Im trying to make an interactive terminal application that creates a pygame window as you type commands in the prompt, so you can see how everything is working. Is that possible? This is what I have attempted: 
The  module has a  method which you could use for this purpose. Windows users have to install curses. First enter , so that the  method doesn't block, then use it in the main while loop to get the pressed key and concatenate it with a string variable (called  here), and use  to display it. When the user presses enter, check if the entered command is equal to  or  and move the game object in the according direction.I don't have much experience with curses, so no guarantees that everything works correctly. The  module (Windows) also has a getch function and I think  can be used for Linux and MacOS. This cross-platform solution seems to work, but I've never tested it: https://stackoverflow.com/a/510364/6220679
