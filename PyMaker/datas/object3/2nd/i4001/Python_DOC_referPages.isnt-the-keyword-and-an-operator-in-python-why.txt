This question already has an answer here:Why is operator module missing `and` and `or`?                    4 answers                I couldn't find the official glossary of python operators but at least it seems that operator library of python doesn't include  or  keyword. They do have , but it's for bitwise and operator(). What makes me more confused is that they do include  or  keywords as operators.In short, isn't (and ) an operator? If it isn't, what is the standard of being an operator in Python? I though I'm pretty familiar with python but this problem confuses me a lot at the moment.
Yes, it's an operator. But it's not like the other operators in the  module. short-circuits (i.e., it evaluates its second argument only if necessary).  is similar. Therefore, neither can be written as a function, because arguments to functions are always fully evaluated before the function is called. In some cases this would make no real difference, but when the second argument contains a function call with side effects (such as I/O), or a lengthy calculation, 's behavior is very different from that of a function call.You could implement it by passing at least the second argument as a function:Then you could call it as follows:But this is a rather unorthodox function call, and doesn't match the way the other operators work, so I'm not surprised the Python developers didn't include it.
