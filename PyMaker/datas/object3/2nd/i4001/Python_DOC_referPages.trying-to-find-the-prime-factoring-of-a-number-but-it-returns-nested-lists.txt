I'm having some issues with the output of the function to be a pile of nested lists. I'm trying to recursively make a tree of the factors until I end up with only having factors which are primes.Well currently it gives me the correct numbers as far as I have been able to figure, but its creating nested lists which isn't what I really want as result.Outputs:(3242) the [...] is the same list again.Another out where it's even worse: (48) 
The problem is that  returns a list, which you then append to your main list, creating the list of lists output you are seeing. Thus, instead of  do:That way you concatenate the lists instead of appending: docs. A good intro to these functions is this tutorial. 
Just for fun here is another approach to finding primes with python/numpy. You can make a pretty simple sieve of eratosthenes:
