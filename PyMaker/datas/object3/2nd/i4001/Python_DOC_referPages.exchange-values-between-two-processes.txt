I have a python script written for python 2.7 running on my raspberry pi. What I try to do is move forward with my step motor and at the same time check if there is a square ahead. In order that these to things don't interfere I want to move the image processing to its own process and just check if the image was found before further steps are taken.These are the involved classes.:::ProcessManager:And I try to create the process with that:For test purposes I directly set the value to true in the image processor but in the stepper it stays False.I also tried to add the  to the pool as well, but it just seemed that the stepper then didn't run as well.Also I tried to call the processes over two helper functions but with a similar effect:What am I doing wrong?
Why are you complicating things with custom managers when you only want to share a single value - and  exists precisely for that. Also, there is no point in creating a process pool if you're only going to use it to run a single process.You could simplify your code greatly as:Without sacrificing any of the existing functionality.
