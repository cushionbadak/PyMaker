I'm working on project named "Faciel Actions Units Detection" I'm using python2.7 and opencv 2.4The error: A partial traceback, transcribed from a screenshot:
Pickle is used by the  module to communicate between the different parts, and in the programming guidelines it explains that you must ensure that all your data that you pass between processes must be compatible with pickling:Picklability: Ensure that the arguments to the methods of proxies are picklable.You are using data that is not picklable.Specifically, what is going wrong is that the  class doesn't quite tell the truth on how you can create more copies of the class.   stores references to classes and functions, not their definition, because that's way more efficient. This means that instances only need to store the data for that instance, not also all of the class hierarchy and method definitions.In order to do this,  takes the module a class or function is defined in, and the name of the object, and together that's the reference to the class or function. It then double-checks that it can use that name to load the same class or function back again.That sanity check failed for the  class. You have instances of a class is named  and that claims to have come from the  module, but when  then goes to the  module and looks up the  attribute of that module it found a different object. This means your data could not be unpickled.There are ways to correct this; you need to teach the  module to use a different function to load the same data again, using the  function; if such a registration exists for the  class then  will not make the above check:WARNING: I didn't actually test if the above will work, because I don't have a 2.4.x version of  installed locally; I merely referred to the  documentation to guess at what attributes such a class would have. You'll probably need to adjust it. The idea is that for the  type, the  function is called, returning a callable () to create a new instance, and the arguments that you want to pass to that callable.If any of the above values are themselves more  types that exhibit the same problem, then you need to register more functions.
