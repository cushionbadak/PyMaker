So what i want is for my code to understand if my input has a number in it or not, if it does it is meant to output "Correct" but if it doesn't then it would output "Incorrect" how can i actually make this work. So it knows if there is an integer in the input or not. Any help is appreciated    
According to https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#match-objects you have a bit of a subtle error.The statement should not be  it should be , the reason being the value number is tests as  if anything is matched, and is  if there are no matches.i.e.Note, somewhat bizarrelyPrints false, so number is not the value true, it overrides . See https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.bool for more information
You can use str.isdigit, re.search, or the built-in string to number conversions such as float and int:
the regex you're looking for is: . It accepts anything that contains at least one digit. is the same as  meaning it will match any lower/upper -case letter, digit or  literally. It can occur 0 to many times in the string matches one to many digits from 0 to 9.Actually, if your intention is just to check whether the string has digits you are good to go just with  that's the same of what you posted originally.You can try and create regexes using this site regex101.com
