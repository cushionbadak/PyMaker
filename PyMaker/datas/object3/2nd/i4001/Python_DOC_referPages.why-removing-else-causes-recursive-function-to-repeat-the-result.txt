When I execute the following code on Python console using the below statement,for the code below, each result appears just once. But, if I remove  and remove the associated indentation of the code below it, I receive each result twice. Why does it happen?
From docs:The big difference between  and a  statement is that on reaching a  the generator’s state of execution is suspended and local variables are preserved. On the next call to the generator’s  method, the function will resume executing.So this happens because  body doesn't break execution, so it moves forward to the next  statement and with  clause reaches end of function and implicitly returns.CheckandAs we can see without  execution will continue and call  with  equal to .So you can leave  or refactor your  clause and add  statement into it to explicitly finish execution likeFurther readingGenerators. and  statements.
Because you are ing twice, if there is no  loop.
