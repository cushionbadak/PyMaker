So I just started with Python in VS Code.I have installed Python 3.6.5, and the extension for Python on VS Code.But when I try to save my files, this appearsSo I do the pip install pylint command, but it does this:Basically, what this means is that it does not recognise "pip", how do I fix this? I've been searching for answer but I could not understand anything.
I would try this. Under the View menu select Command Palette. This opens up a window to enter VScode commands. In the command palette look for the command 'Python: Enable Linting'. This allows you to toggle between on or off for linting. Next look for 'Python: Select Linter' lets you chose pylint or another module for linting.After setting these you should be good to go...And you should have the Python extension installed.  The name is the one word: Python.  pylint is installed with this extension. Your pip problem may be unrelated.
