I wrote a script, and I assigned part of it to select random sample of 10% of the files in a dir and copy them to a new dir. This is my method below, but it gives less than 10% (~9.6%) each time, and never the same amount.this gave
By calling  repeatedly, you are effectively choosing with replacement. This means that you might be choosing the same file twice, in separate trips around the loop.Try  instead:Consider this program:Here are two runs of the program:Notice that, in the first line of the second run  randomly selected  twice and  twice. If these were filenames, it would appear that only 3 files were copied. In fact, five copies are performed, but the redundant copies don't add to the file count. Of course the number of repeated identical choices is random, leading to the inconsistent behavior you see.On the other hand, the second line, derived from  will never have repeated elements, since  chooses without replacement.
