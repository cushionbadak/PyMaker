I have matrix of signals generated in Matlab (24 x 121) and labels file (1x 24). After I loaded it, it is :labelsand XI want to draw graph based on 1-correlation measure similarity, and not show branch if it is weight >0.7. The code I'm using is:I get an error Traceback (most recent call last):   File  "C:/Users/Kristina/Desktop/NOBS/source/grafovi.py", line 36, in        G.add_edge(s,b,weight=w)   File "C:\Python34\lib\site-packages\networkx\classes\graph.py", line 706,  in add_edge      if u not in self.node: TypeError: unhashable type: 'numpy.ndarray'I cannot figure out what the problem is.
Your objects  and  are elements of the  variable, which is a list of arrays, each looking like this:When you call , it expects something like this:As both the error message and Moritz noted, either (probably both) of the variables passed to  has to be hashable, but numpy arrays are not hashable.It's far from clear to me exactly what you're trying to do, but if you just want to use the contents of each array (such as ) in your graph, just access the zeroth element of each of your arrays, since in your current implementation  and  always seem to be single-element arrays anyway. What I mean is changing to this:although I'm pretty sure you should use  instead of looping. And, as always, if you run into unexpected errors and unexpected types, use  and  to determine what your variables actually are, instead of what you expect them to be.
