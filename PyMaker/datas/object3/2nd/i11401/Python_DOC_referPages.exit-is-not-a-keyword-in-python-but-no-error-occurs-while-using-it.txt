I learn that  is not a keyword in Python by,But there is no reminder of  while using it. The output of the following snippet code makes me confused. Can anyone help me out?I am unable to get related info about  from Python documentations, except for . 
Keywords are part of the python syntax.  They usually have special meaning in statements (e.g. , ,  ...).  This has other consequences -- e.g. you can't make a variable with the same name as a keyword.  builtins are callable objects (e.g. functions or at least function-like) that python provides in the namespace by default.  examples of builtin functions are things like , , , ...It's worth noting that  is a convenience provided when in an interactive session.  It's highly encouraged to use  instead.
 is an instance of the  class.  The  class defines an  method that returns the string that you see when you type  into the shell.  It also defines a  method.  Just as  is called when you use a class like a function,  is called when an instance is used like a function.  Therefore,  calls the  method, which exits the program.
 is an Built-in Constants added by the  module.The  module (which is imported automatically during startup,  except if the  command-line option is given) adds several constants  to the built-in namespace. They are useful for the interactive  interpreter shell and should not be used in programs.
 is the  function when you are using the interactive console.Many things exist while they are not keywords (e.g. , ...). So you can bind to existing names, but not to keywords
