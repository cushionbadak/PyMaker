I'm new to python and working on a way to open a file named acne.txt which is inside my define folder in the same python34 folder as my code. The code I've written for the same is:The variable NN_is[0] when printed yields acne. Can someone help me in solving this problem.Thank you in advance. 
Use  to concatenate the directory and file name, and use  to construct the string for the file name:I also recommend that you open the file within a  statement. This ensures that the file will always be closed, even if there is an error. It's also handy because you don't need to explicitly close the file - it will be closed when the  statement goes out of scope.
