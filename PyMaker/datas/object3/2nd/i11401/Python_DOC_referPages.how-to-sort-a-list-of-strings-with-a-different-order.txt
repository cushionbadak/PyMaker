I am writing a function in Python which can sort my list. The problem is that I don't want it in the same order that the  method used. I tried using the  method, but when I sort this string, which I it comes out like this:The order I want it to be in is:Now, I've got a list like this (example):And I want so sort it. If I'd use the  method, it would look like this:But I want it to be in the same order as the string I gave before.
The idea is to associate to each char the index in the specified order and use the indexes of the string chars to do the order comparison.Note: only works with Python 3Sort one char stringsSort any length stringsOutputs:
