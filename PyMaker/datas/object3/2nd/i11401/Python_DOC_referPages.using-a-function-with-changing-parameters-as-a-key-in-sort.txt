I am trying to sort a list of points in the x-y plane according to their polar angle with a point selected from the list that has the minimum y value.I used to find the minimum y value in listPtsI have a function theta to find the angles between two pointsI was wondering if its possible to somehow use this function as a key in the .sort() method as each point being check will have a different pointB for theta?cheers
Yes. Read the documentation for , and it's right there. Argument even has the same name as for .Update: If I understand your real problem,  is computing relative angles between points, and you want to sort point pairs based on their  scores somehow?If that's correct, you really need a multi-step process:Generate all point pairs for each origin point and destination (either all possible point permutations/combinations, or through some initial pairing algorithm that is more selective)Sort the pairs based on their theta scoresTo do so, you use  to generate the pairs (or sort first to get some consistent point ordering, then use  so you don't create pairs for points  and ), then sort the resulting pairs using  to order the pairs by their relative angles. For example:which outputs:corresponding to  values of .
