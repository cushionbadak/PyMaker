I want to use Type Hints in my Python program. How can I create Type Hints for complex data structures like lists with stringsa generator returning integers?Example
Use the  module; it contains generics, type objects you can use to specify containers with constraints on their contents:Depending on how you design your code and how you want to use the return value of , you could also use the  and  types here, depending on wether or not you expect to be able to mutate the result.A generator is a specific type of iterator, so  is appropriate here. If your generator also accepts  values and uses  to set a  value, you can use the  object too:If you are new to type hinting, then PEP 483 â€“ The Theory of Type Hints may be helpful.
