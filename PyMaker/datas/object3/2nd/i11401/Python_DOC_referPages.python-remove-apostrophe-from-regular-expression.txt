I have the following regular expression to extract song names from a certain website:It displays the results below :   Where  is in the output below, is an apostrophe on the website the song name is extract from.    How would I go about changing my regular expression to remove those characters?     TIA
As stated in the comments, you can't do that using a regex alone. You need to unescape the HTML entities present in the match separately.
