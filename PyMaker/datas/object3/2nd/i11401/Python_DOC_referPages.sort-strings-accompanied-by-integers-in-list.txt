I am trying to make a leaderboard.Here is a list i have :I would like to be able to sort this list from highest number to smallest, or even smallest to highest, giving something like : I tried to use stuff like     but i only managed to get, out of the list, the best player. Not wanting to repeat the code for as many players as there are, does anyone have an idea ?
You indeed have to use the  module, but also the  parameter of the  method.It works fine using  as you did too:Note that I  the regular expression so it is computed once and for all rather than for each element in the list.
I have an other solution based on Object Oriented Programming and the overriding of the  special methods of .Which print to the standard output:This method allows you to not rewrite the  function and use the built-in one (which is probably optimized). More over, since your strings may be thinked like "specialization of the  class", the inheritance mecanism is very suitable because you keep all its properties but re-write its comparison mecanism.
