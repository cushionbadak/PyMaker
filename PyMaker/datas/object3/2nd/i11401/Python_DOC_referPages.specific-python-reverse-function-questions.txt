This is a python function, which is to flip each element entered, backward. I have learned indexing, but to_flip[counter] is like nothing I seen. What purpose does to_flip[counter] serve, in flipping each element? Does it have a name for this? And doesn't counter serve to add each number given, and to come out with a sum? Why is it needed here? And are there any other ways of doing reverse like this, for a beginner. Thank you.
