Natural Text
I am reading a JSON file, adding a field and then writing to a new JSON file.The JSON file I read in  looks like this:I open the JSON file, read it, create a new field and then dump it in a new file:This succesfuly exports and I am able to inspect with a text editor (Sublime Text)As you can see, this isn't as visually readable as the original JSON file. I am able to read it line by line successfully but it is printed as one single line in Sublime Text. Is there a formatting side to JSON dumps that I am missing?
There's a parameter called . It is  by default, which means "no pretty printing". If you set it to an integer value, it will enable pretty-printing, and use that many spaces to indent nested elements.In your case it will be something along the lines of:(or  if you prefer less spaces). Here's an example from the docs (link), which shows more functionality you might also want as you progress:
The  parameter allows some degree of pretty printing.From the docsIf indent is a non-negative integer, then JSON array elements and object members will be pretty-printed with that indent level. An indent level of 0, or negative, will only insert newlines. None (the default) selects the most compact representation.
