You can do it with:
You can use the  method on strings and have to convert the data in the list to strings first. takes the string as a delimiter and concatenates the content of the list with this delimiter between each element.
This is very simple. Take a look at Citation from the docs:str.join(iterable)Return a string which is the concatenation of the strings in the iterable iterable. The separator between elements is the string providing this method.
Obviously  is the shortest way or if you dislike  use a list comprehensionyou could also do it manually, using  to convert the  list into a series of function argumentsor use  and a  functionAll return
Just a non- solution.
Convert them into strings, then join them. Try using:
