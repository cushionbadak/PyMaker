I am using a script that overlays an input pdf onto another that is essentially a letterhead. However, I am not sure how to allow for the process to be automated to allow for many files to be processed one at a time, without previously knowing what the file will be named. I am using python 2.7.
Import os and use os.listdir to look in a particular directory for the files:https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html#os.listdir
Your problem seems to have an easy solution with command line arguments.You can import the sys module and use sys.argv to get the list of command line arguments. There's a tutorial which should work with 2.7 at this link. sys.argv is an array and sys.argv[1] is the first argument that you pass since sys.argv[0] is the executable name.From the command line you can execute as:It's possible to insert command line arguments with IDLE if you're using that. If you need to know how leave a comment.
You will probably be safest with something like argparse argparse offers you very felxible manipulation of command line parameters to implement a control interface for scripts.
Thank you for all of the contributions.This is what I ended up using:
