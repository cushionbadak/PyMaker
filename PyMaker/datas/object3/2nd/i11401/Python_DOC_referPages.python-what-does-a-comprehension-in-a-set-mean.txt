I saw something like:I know  is a comprehension, but I cannot find a valid grammar for it, since  itself is invalid.
From python3 referencecheck: is ,  is  and  is 
It is to create a set based on the comprehension. Example:The result will be a set:In the above example, it happen to be the logic can be simplified to:Where you do not need a comprehension at all
It's a generator expression. They are normally surrounded by parens, but the parens can be omitted if the expression is the only argument to a function call:Generator objects can be iterated over, they produce values one by one. Compared to using a list comprehension here, the advantage is that no intermediate list object has to be created (which matters more if there are, say, a million elements rather than three).Documentation: https://docs.python.org/2/reference/expressions.html#generator-expressions
python's set based on comprehension. example for list with strings
 is a Generator ExpressionsIt reduces an iterable input to a single value.It match with the constructor of the  class.There are in Python 3 a set comprehension like that:So you don't need  anymore in Python 3.
