I'm trying to implement fair queuing in my library that is based on asyncio.In some function, I have a statement like (assume  are tasks):Now I read the documentation for  many times but it does not contain the information I'm after. Mainly, I'd like to know if:,  and  happened to be already ready when I issue the call. Is it guaranteed that  will contain them all or could it be that it returns only one (or two) ?In the second case, does the order of the tasks passed to  matter ?I'm trying to assert if I can just apply fair-queuing in the set of  tasks (by picking one and leaving the other tasks for later resolution) or if I also need to care about the order I pass the tasks in.The documentation is kinda silent about this. Any idea ?
This is only taken according to the source code of Python 3.5.If the future is done before calling , they will all be placed in the  set:
