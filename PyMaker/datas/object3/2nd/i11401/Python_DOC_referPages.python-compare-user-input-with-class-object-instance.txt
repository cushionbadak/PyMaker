I'm creating a program, where people will guess the identity of someone, based on user input and predefined values. I would like to compare the user input with values that are preassigned to "smith" and "john". I thought that I could do:I'm getting the error AttributeError: type object 'myPeople' has no attribute 'smith'Also, I'm not sure, if the statement "is True" will work. Thanks in advance for your help.
You can customize your class by adding a comparison method, in this case .  Then you can just check to see if class instances are equal.  Use the user's responses to create another instance then compare.
