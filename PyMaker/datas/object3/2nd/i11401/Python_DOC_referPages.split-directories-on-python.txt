I'm trying to split my working directory to get the base path of the script to be able to access a configuration file.For example the directory I'm working is: C:\Users\testUser\PycharmProjects\my_script\script\binThe directory I need is: C:\Users\testUser\PycharmProjects\my_scriptSo first I use  to get the path. --> C:\Users\testUser\PycharmProjects\my_script\script\binThen I apply  this will return the directory name. --> C:\Users\testUser\PycharmProjects\my_script\scriptFinally, I used  this will give me the directory I need --> C:\Users\testUser\PycharmProjects\my_scriptI would like to know if there is any better to do it?
The way you did it is fine, but if you want to just get the parent directory of the current directory you are in, you can use .For example, on my machine (Mac OS) (note my current working directory was ):Basically, all I did was ask for the parent directory. Then ask for the parent directory of the parent directory.
Maybe you can create a package in your diretory and go back to the root using: __PATH__.https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#packagesOros.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(__file__))
