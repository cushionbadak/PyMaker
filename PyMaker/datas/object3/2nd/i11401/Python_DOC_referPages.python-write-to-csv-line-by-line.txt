I have data which is being accessed via http request and is sent back by the server in a comma separated format, I have the following code :The content of text is as follows:How can I save this data into a CSV file.I know I can do something along the lines of the following to iterate line by line:But i'm unsure how to now properly write each line to CSVEDIT---> Thanks for the feedback as suggested the solution was rather simple and can be seen below.Solution:
General way:ORUsing CSV writer :ORSimplest way:
You could just write to the file as you would write any normal file.If just in case, it is a list of lists, you could directly use built-in  module
I would simply write each line to a file, since it's already in a CSV format:I can't recall how to write lines with line-breaks at the moment, though :pAlso, you might like to take a look at this answer about , , and .
What about this:str.join() Return a string which is the concatenation of the strings in iterable.  The separator between elements is  the string providing this method.
