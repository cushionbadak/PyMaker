I have two lists:I want to create a dictionary which has the following output:i.e. Lists L1 and L2 both have same number of elements and the elements in them corresponds one to one. I want to find sum of all numbers in L2 for each unique element in L1 and make a dictionary out of it(DictOutSum). I also want to create another dictionary which stores the counts of number of unique elements of L1(DictOutCount).I don't even have an idea where to start for this other than to use a for loop.
Pure python implementation:Fancy one-liner implementations:
You should use the zip builtin function

The mega elementary waySide note: From your username, are you Persian?
DictOutCount, use ,DictOutSum, Previous answer, DictOutSum, The main steps are:use  to make an iterator that aggregates elements from each of  and use  to make an iterator that returns consecutive keys and groups from the iterable (sorting before that)use  for cumulatively addition
