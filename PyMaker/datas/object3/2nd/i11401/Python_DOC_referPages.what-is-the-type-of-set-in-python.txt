The result shows that b is not of types.ListType. However, there is no 'SetType' in Python. So what is the type 'XXXType' so that isinstance(b, types.XXXType) is True?
Use .The  references to built-in types are just there for convenience* and are otherwise deprecated (they have been removed from the Python 3.x version of the  module). As such  was never added.For example,  is just an alias for :If you must have a  reference in the  module, simply add the alias yourself:If you are looking for an abstract base class for the basic container type, use the  module ABCs; these signal what methods a type support and checking against these types can let you detect a wider set of types that support specific operations (rather than be an instance of just the  and  types):* History lesson: Once upon a time, the built-in types like  and  were not really classes, and the built-in names  and  were simply functions to convert to the built-in types. That means that the names were simply not the same object as  and  and you had to use the  module to be able to use  on a list object. That time is now long, long behind us, and the role of the  module has changed.
