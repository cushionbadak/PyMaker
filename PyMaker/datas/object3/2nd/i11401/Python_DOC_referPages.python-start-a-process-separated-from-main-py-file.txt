I have a python script .py that basically do thisThe problem is that when I launch command with os.system(string), it is executed in the python script, so it will quit console only when the command has finished.I want launch the command as another process, so the main code goes on and can quit console (with "quit", I guess), without touching the process it started. How can I? 
The command given to  is launched as a separate process, but  waits for its termination.  The easiest way to avoid this is by appending a  to your command string, then the command is executed in the background (i. e. without waiting for its termination):
You could also use the subprocess module... this will wait 5 seconds and print test to your stdout.
