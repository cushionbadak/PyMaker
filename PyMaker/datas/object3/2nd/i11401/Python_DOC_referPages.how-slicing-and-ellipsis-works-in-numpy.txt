I have been reading a very old documentation of Numpy and found out a weird notation which eludes my understanding. The documentation says  is a shortcut for . The documentation being old is very vague and I would welcome any comments. Thanks,Prerit
 is fancy indexing used by numpy that selects the first element of the last column in . Fancy indexing can only be used in numpy arrays and not in python's traditional lists.Also, like its pointed out in the comments,  is a syntax error.It is helpful because you can select columns easily
Three full stops  (and not  (U+2026)), refers to the Ellipsis singleton object. It has no built-in special operations but is often used in slicing expressions.No built-in classes utilise the Ellipsis object however NumPy uses  as a shortcut when slicing arrays, for example, where  is a 4D array:  is equivalant to .NumPy - Indexing
