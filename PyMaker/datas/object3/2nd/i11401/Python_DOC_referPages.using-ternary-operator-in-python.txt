Consider the following code snippet. It flags a syntax error at the break statement.How do I fix this?(I want to still use the ternary operator)
Edit:(see my conversation with Stefan Pochmann in the comments)Ternary operator is not for only statement, but rather for assignment or for expression (and  is an only statement):use normal  statement to do statements:
You cannot use break in Your loop logic can be re written using itertools.takewhile if you want a more succinct solutionYou can also remove the need for the else using a for loop by reversing your logic, check if j is not in dummy breaking when that is True:Also if you want to remove all occurrences of any of the initial elements from digits that are in dummy, remove won't do that for any repeating elements but using a list comp after creating a set of elements to remove will:You can also iterate over a string so no need to call list on digits unless you plan on doing some list operations with it after.
