From this quieston's answer is will return True if two variables point to the same object, == if the objects referred to by the variables are equal.Aren't  and  point to the same object? Both of them prints a list of the same methods. Am I missing something about object here?
First of all,  is not :Second, as the documentation says [...] With an argument, attempt to return a list of valid attributes for that object. If the object has a method named , this method will be called and must return the list of attributes. This allows objects that implement a custom  or  function to customize the way  reports their attributes.If the object does not provide , the function tries its best to gather information from the objectâ€™s  attribute, if defined, and from its type object. The resulting list is not necessarily complete, and may be inaccurate when the object has a custom .The resulting list is sorted alphabetically. [...]Now,  and  both have the  slot filled from :And the documentation for  adds this one extra bit of information:Called when  is called on the object. A sequence must be returned.  converts the returned sequence to a list and sorts it.As the documentation says,  constructs a new list for each invocation and then sorts it. (We could also look into the code for  which calls  on the return value of ;  takes a sequence as an argument, and returns a new list with the same elements as the original sequence; this newly created list is then sorted and returned)Third,  is an instance of type , which is a subclass of .Additionally,  does not add any methods that are not already present in . And because the resulting list is sorted alphabetically,
Everytime thet you execute  the new object is created.
 creates a new object for the  that it's returning each time.Basically you got confused between  and  and .
