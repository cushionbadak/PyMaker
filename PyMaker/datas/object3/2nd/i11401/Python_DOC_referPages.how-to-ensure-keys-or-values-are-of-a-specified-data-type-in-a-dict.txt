My python program uses dicts and there are a massive amount of "if" statements just for checking the type of the retrieved value.I want to avoid this but instead do it a more programatically correct way.Here is an example:
To verify that all keys/values of a  are of a particular type you could use the  function:To enforce the types when storing values you could use a custom function to mediate access to the dictionary or, better yet,  subclass  and override the  method, e.g.:
Python is not type safe. So the values stored in a dictionary can be of any type. One way to prevent values of other types to be added to the dictionary is to define a function which adds the data only if the type matches. Then only use this function to append to the dictionary.
