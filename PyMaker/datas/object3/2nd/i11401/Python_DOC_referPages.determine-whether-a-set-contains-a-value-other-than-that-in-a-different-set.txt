I am looking to find if a set contains any value other than that contained in another set.At the moment i have the code:Is there a simpler way of doing this? It is obviously trivially easy to see if a set contains an element [e.g. union of sets], but couldn't see an obvious way of seeing whether a set contained an element other than that in a set.UpdateJust to clarify, I am only looking to see if there is a term in the  which does not appear in the  set. [i.e am not looking to see if there is a difference between the two sets, rather just whether there are values in the entered set which are not in the other one].
You can substract the two sets:Every element in  will be removed from . If the resulted set is not empty, this means there was at least one value in  not contained into .Note that an empty set is interpreted as , this is why this  condition works.
Simply calculate difference of two sets. Return a new set with  elements in the set that are not in the others.
