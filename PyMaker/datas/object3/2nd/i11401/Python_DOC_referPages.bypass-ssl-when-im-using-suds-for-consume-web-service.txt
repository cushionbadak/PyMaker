I'm using SUDS for consuming web service. I tried like bellow:I got this error:I saw link but it is just solution for python 2.7. How can I bypass SSL with SUDS? Or is there any none python solution (For example add fake certificate in windows OS)?   I'm using python 3(So I have to use urllib instead of urllib2).
A  client uses a subclass of  to process requests.The default transport used is an instance of , but you can override this when you instantiate the client by passing a  keyword argument.The http and https transports are implemented using  (or  for python2) by creating an urlopener. The list of handlers used to create this urlopener is retrieved by calling the  method on the transport class. This means that you can create your own transport by subclassing the default and overriding that method to use a HTTPSHander with a specific ssl context, e.g:
This code worked for me:
You can use https://pypi.python.org/pypi/suds_requests to leverage the requests library for the transport. This gives you the ability to disable the ssl verification.Or try my new soap library, it supports it out of the box: http://docs.python-zeep.org/en/latest/#transport-options
This is what I came up with that seems to work well:Cheers!
You can add the code below before instantiate your suds client:See my own website for details: https://lucasmarques.me/bypass-ssl/
I use this:See: https://bitbucket.org/jurko/suds/issues/78/allow-bypassing-ssl-certificate#comment-39029255
