This question already has an answer here:How can I split a url string up into separate parts in Python?                    6 answers                I'm trying to split a url into parts so that I can work with these separately. For e.g. the url:How can I split this into:1) the source/origin (i.e. protocol + subdomain + domain)2) path '/api/addresses'3) Query:  '?postcode=XXSDF&houseNo=34'
The  library, found in  in Python3, is designed for this. Example adapted from the documentation:In order to get host, path and query, the API is straighforward:Returns:In order to get the subdomain itself, the only way seems to split by .Note that the  should be used instead , according to the documentation:This should generally be used instead of urlparse(https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html#urllib.parse.urlsplit) if the more recent URL syntax allowing parameters to be applied to each segment of the path portion of the URL (see RFC 2396) is wanted
You can just use python's urlparse.
You probably want the stdlib module  on Python 2, or  on Python 3. This will split the URL up more finely than you're asking for, but it's not difficult to put the pieces back together again.
