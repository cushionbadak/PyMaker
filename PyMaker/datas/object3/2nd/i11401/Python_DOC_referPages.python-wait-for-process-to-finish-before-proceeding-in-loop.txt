I'm attempting to use PDFkit to create PDFs of a site and I'm having some trouble:Running  on a single URL works fine, but trying to use it in a  loop causes problems. I think it's because it takes a while for each PDF to be generated. Is there a way I could wait while  is running, and only proceed with the next URL when it has finished with the previous?
