I am using a shared linux cluster and want my temporary directory to be  rather than the default . According to the  docs,  should use the  environment variable to determine the temporary directory. However, this does not seem to be the case?!Any suggestions?
Does the directory exist?  Is it writable by the user?  If not, it won't work and Python will fallback to other locations.  You can see the code here, reproduced here for reference:
