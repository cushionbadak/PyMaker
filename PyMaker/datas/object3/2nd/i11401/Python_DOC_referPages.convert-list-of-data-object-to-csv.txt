I'm using python 2.7.6. I would like to convert my list of objects into csv format. I have a list of cdr object, this object contains some string, int and datatime object.But i'm getting a blank csv. Thanks for help. 
 built-in function expects a collection as argument, so pass attributes in a list form. Then use the @Shankar suggestion.from python help docs:iter(...)       iter(collection) -> iterator       iter(callable, sentinel) -> iterator       Get an iterator from an object.  In the first form, the argument must      supply its own iterator, or be a sequence.       In the second form, the callable is called until it returns the sentinel.
