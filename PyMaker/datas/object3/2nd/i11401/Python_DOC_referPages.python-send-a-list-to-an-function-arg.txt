This question already has an answer here:Python - use list as function parameters                    4 answers                I have a class that looks like this:and I want to call the function with something that looks like this:In columns_to_add I have all the objects that I want to give the function_print(). I iterate the function with "j" (I want to send the "j" element of each key to function_print)I know how to solve it while making changes in function_print() (change recordList[i] to recordList[0][i]) but I wan't another solution where I change the input to be recognized as multiple objects instead of just one object?I have tried to do:But that didn't do it, any other tips on how I can unpack the keys in columns_to_add and insert the?
Just use  again:(I don't recommend using keywords as variable names)
Just unpack it as you would with any other function.
