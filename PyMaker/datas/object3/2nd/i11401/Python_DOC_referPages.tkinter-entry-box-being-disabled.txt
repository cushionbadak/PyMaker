Natural Text
I'm working on a GUI Python program using Tkinter. I have a function that is called when a button is pressed (and when the program is loaded). The program is currently unfinished and only checks data validation at this current point. As the default entry is current invalid, it throws an error. However, after this point, the entry box is disabled and will not let me enter any data. I cannot figure out why this is happening and I was wondering if someone could tell me the reason so I can work on a solution. ThanksAny tips are appreciated.
There are two apparent problems. Firstly, you shouldn't usebecause you can't call a function with arguments on the command config.My suggestion would be to take a look here and use one of the proposed methods, I particularly like the one using functools and :with  being the function you want to call and  the parameters you want to call separated by a comma.Secondly, you are usingwhich doesn't return the Entry typed text, use insteadPS: Albeit not directly related to your question, you should useinstead of
