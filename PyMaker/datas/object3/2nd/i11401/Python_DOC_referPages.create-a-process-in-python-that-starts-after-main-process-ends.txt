I have a python script named "prog.py". I want to add a feature that opens a new process that watches the operation of the current script. When the script terminates, the process recognizes the termination and then invokes a certain function. Here is a pseudo-code:Do you have any idea how to do it? 
Is there a reason the other process needs to be launched first? Seems like you could do this more efficiently and reliably by just ing when the first process completes. For example:When the current Python process exits, it will seamlessly replace itself with your other script, which need not go to the trouble of including a polling loop. Or you could just use  to execute whatever  is directly in your main script and avoid a new Python launch.
