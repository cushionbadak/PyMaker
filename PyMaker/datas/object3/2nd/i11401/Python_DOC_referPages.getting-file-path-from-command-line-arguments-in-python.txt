Natural Text
I would like to read a file path from command line arguments, using argparse. Is there any optimal way to check if the path is relative (file is in current directory) or the complete path is given? (Other than checking the input and adding current directory to file name if the path does not exist.)
As Display Name said,  along with  is probably the best:outputsome cmd stuff
