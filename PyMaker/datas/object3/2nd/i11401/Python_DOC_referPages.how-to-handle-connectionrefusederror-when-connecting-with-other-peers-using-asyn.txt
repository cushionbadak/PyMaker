I use  for connecting with other peers in a bittorrent client im working on. When some peer cant be connected, the program crashes with  and  exceptions. Is it normal that some peers cant be connected or theres something wrong with my code. If that's normal, how should i handle the exceptions? I've tried to put  around  but that didnt do anything.Here's my code:Here's the output:I'm very new to  and not sure if i'm doing it the right way.Thanks.

Tasks usually need when you want to start some coroutine "in background".Based on all of it code may look some way like this (I didn't test it):
