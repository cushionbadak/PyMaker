Is there a way with python to get the help or man page of all the methods for dictionaries or list on the command line or idle? So if your on an exam and can't google stuff you can still look them up? My allergies are terrible and I'm worried I'll confuse those methods that are for list, dictionaries or sets. I asked my instructor and google but she didn't think so, but she didn't know how to access the help page for modules so she may not fully be an expert. Like with modules you can on the command line just do for example: import(math); help(math) then it list all the functions in a module.
IDLE supports the full built-in  function out of the box. In the interactive interpreter, just use  to print out the documentation for that object.You can use this on modules, classes, and methods:
