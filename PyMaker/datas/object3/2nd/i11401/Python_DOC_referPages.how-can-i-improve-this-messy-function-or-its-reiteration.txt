Very long and annoying question, ill try to do my best to explain it.I have a file containing data such as The first element is the name, second is surname, third is email address, 4rth is phone number, 5th is division number, 6th is points scored, the remaining two don't matter for this issue.What I have been asked to do is to check the top two scorers (6ths element) and the bottom two scorers in a division (5th element). When they have been identified, the top two should be promoted (go up a division), the bottom 2 should be demoted (go down a division). I have written this piece of crap:It is very ugly and impractical, moreover, I have to have 6 of these functions (as there are 6 divisions) which makes the program ridiculously overweight.If anyone could help me, whether it be how I could use this function just once to check all 6 division instead of having to write 6 individual ones. I'm sorry you had to see this, I just don't know what else to do at this point. Any help would be very appreciated.Many thanks

Not the best and most efficient code, but this should work. I'll leave you to fill in the blanks.
