This question already has an answer here:How to use Python decorators to check function arguments?                    8 answers                Function parameter types in Python                    11 answers                Currently Python allows you to define functions likeI would like to be able to define functions likebecause I think it would cut down on programmer errors.How can I do this?Right now I am resorting toBut I think it might be easier if I could just change the signature of the  function.
Modifying def is possible, but not at all the right (simplest) approach. The easiest way will be to use python 3. It supports the type annotations, though it does not do anything with them by default.This answer combines python 3's annotations with a decorator and type filtering helper functions. There are plenty of decorator based solutions and recipes for type checking. Do a search for "python annotation type checking" if you want other examples.Note that the above question includes answers with decorators for python 2 as well, if you cannot use python 3 for some reason.
