I am fairly new to Python scripting. My problem statement is: My 'List' looks something like below. I want to take out only the 'num' part (800000010627, 800000010040 and so on). I tried few techniques but no avail. Can anybody help? List:
The easiest way: just cut the needed part from your bytes:This expression will create a new list named only_numbers with numbers extracted from original list items. Note that this method simply omits the first 17 symbols, so, if prefix part of your initial data will change in length this method may fail miserably.If that prefix (div-num-expr::060) changes you will need to harness the power of regular expressions. You can read more about regexes in python in the official documentation.

Check it outl = [b'div-num-expr::060-800000010627', b'div-num-expr::060-800000010040', b'div-num-expr::060-800000011128', b'div-num-expr::060-800000010734', b'div-num-expr::060-800000013939', b'div-num-expr::060-800000014595']filter = []for eve in l:    eve = str(eve)print(filter)
