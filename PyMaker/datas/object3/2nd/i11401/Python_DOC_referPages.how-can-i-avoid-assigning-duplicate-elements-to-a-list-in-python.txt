I am trying to write a program that outputs a list of questions for a test. What I am trying to do is to avoid adding duplicates to the list that way when I print the list I only have a certain amount of unique elements.
You could use  so there wouldn't be need to do any filtering:
Initiate your list as a set. Set can only contain unique values. After your work is done, change your set back to list. please refer to this link for more details.
If, as it seems, you can use the  module,  has a very convenient function for your use case's documentation from yhe  prompt
