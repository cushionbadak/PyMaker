In Python's time module, there is a  function, where you can make Python wait x seconds before resuming the program. Is there a way to do this indefinitely until a condition is met? For example:I am trying to make a pause function for my PyGame program. Any help is appreciated. 
Something like this:will wait until  is true, sleeping a tenth of a second between checks. This is usually short enough for your script to seem to react instantly (in human terms) when  becomes true. You could use  instead if this is not quick enough. In my experience, today's computers are fast enough that checking a simple condition even every hundredth of a second doesn't really make a dent in CPU usage.Of course,  should be something that can actually change, e.g. a function call.
Your code in the question implies that you want some other thread to resume your program. In that case you could use . You could create it in one thread and pass it into another:Call  to resume this code immediately.I am trying to make a pause function for my PyGame program. Any help is appreciated.Use . Typically, you have the main loop where you update the state of the game and at the end of the loop you call . It is enough to use  flag in this case, to skip the updating.
