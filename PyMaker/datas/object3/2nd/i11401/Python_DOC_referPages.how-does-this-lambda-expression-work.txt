I'm familiar with simple lambda expressions. However I have this lambda expression in a book.I didn't declare any input variables, which is not how I learned Lambdas.The previous example from the book hasThis makes sense, The Key is , the nested Key is , and the value is .My two part question is, how does a lambda work with no input variables? and should I assume that the  is to create a key  and at index  of the list set the value ?
 is exactly the same as:that is, it is a function that takes no arguments and returns a  2 array with the two entries set to 0.   takes a callable that takes no arguments and returns the value for a missing key so your second example () is the same as:Now, a dictionary in Python can take any value for its key (as long as they are hashable).So when we index into  with a two, since the dictionary doesn't have any key at  our lambda (which is equivalent to ) is called and returns a list with two zeros in it.  We then set the second element in that list to 1, mutating the list in place.So yes, you're pretty much spot on when you say:should I assume that the  is to create a key 2 and at index 1 of the list set the value = 1
