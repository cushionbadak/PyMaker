The mutually exclusive group mechanism is just for a simple (flat) exclusive or group.  There's no mechanism for nesting one group in another, or for applying other logic (,  etc). You need to do your own testing after parsing.  As long as the defaults are reasonable (e.g. the default default ) that isn't hard.Subparsers provide another kind of grouping logic, which may work for you.This has been raised in other SO questions, and a Python bug/issue, if you need to explore it in more detail.===============, despite the name, do not work with mutually exclusive groups.  Their intended purpose is entirely different (grouping of help lines).  You can nest one mutually exclusive group within another, but the net effect is to put everything in one group.argparse: some mutually exclusive arguments in required group============================with resulting runs
