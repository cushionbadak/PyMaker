Natural Text
I have a file that has a number of headers of binary data (I suppose that is what it is) and after that, there are lines of text. I'm just starting to work with it, but I noticed that if I use the Python "enumerate" function it doesn't appear to read the lines I want it to read (I'm using Python 2.7.8). It is not returning the lines I'm interested in. In my text editor I can see the data I want but the result indicates maybe it is "serialized data"? There is more of the same binary at the end of the file.Sample from Data File (I'm hoping to skip the first 8 lines):I want to start with the line that starts with "curve".Sample ScriptResult
Be aware that  takes a  parameter that only sets the initial value of the number. It does not cause it to skip over any contents.If you want to skip lines, you'll need to filter your enumeration:
I figured out that since the file was in a binary format, I needed to read it in that way with open('myfile', 'rb') rather than with open('myfile', 'r') and I got a lot of help from this question.The re-write looks like this ...
