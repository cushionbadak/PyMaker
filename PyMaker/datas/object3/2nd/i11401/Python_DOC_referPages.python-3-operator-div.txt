I have a slight problem with randomly generated operators in Python 3.So you see, I have the operator functions ,  and .But when I try and add the  operator I get an alert saying that .I've never actually tried using random operators in Python before, so this might sound a foolish question, but it's one which is giving me hell in debugging.
There is no  in Python 3, no; that only existed in Python 2.There is a  function instead, as well as a  function. The reason for this division (no pun intended) is that the old Python 2  operator would return an integer if both operands are integers, a float otherwise, while these two functions always return the same type, regardless of the type of inputs.
