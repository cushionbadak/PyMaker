Natural Text
I have a small script printing some debug infos of unicode characters. I need to filter out everything that came with Unicode 8.0 because of compatibility.Is there a way to get the Unicode version in which a specific codepoint was added programmatically?
 contains and provides some property information about Unicode characters, but unfortunately  Age is not one of them. You will need to download and parse  for the UCD if you want access to this information.
