I have a large hierarchy of classes stemming from  class (for example  would be a child), and all of them implement the  method, as well as other methods (for example derivation or more specialized numerical methods). What is the cleanest way of adding common logic to each of these  methods based on the type of the input? Formally, I'd like to have something like for each child class of . I could add  at each implementation of  but that would be painful. Anything easier to achieve this?
How about something like this?The child classes each define , and the fallback logic resides in the parent class.An example:Editorializing:As an aside, I don't know much about your particular use case, but my understanding is that  is very often not the ideal choice, and it's better to do some sort of duck typing. In which case, you'd probably want to replace the  statement with a / block where you just use the interface as if  implements the  interface.
