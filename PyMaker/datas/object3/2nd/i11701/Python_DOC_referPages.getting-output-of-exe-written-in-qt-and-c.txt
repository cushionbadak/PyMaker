Natural Text
I'm having this problem with a python script I'm writing that calls an exe file (subrocess.Popen). I'm redirecting the stdout and stderr to PIPE, but i cant read (subprocess.Popen.stdout.readline()) any output.I did try to run the exec file in windows cli and redirecting both stdout and stderr... and nothing happens. So I reckon there is no stdout and stderr in this Qt app.Is there any way I can get to the data that prints this exe on screen (by the way the application is photivo.exe)?
Warning: Use communicate() rather than .stdin.write, .stdout.read or .stderr.read to avoid deadlocks due to any of the other OS pipe buffers filling up and blocking the child process.https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen.stderrThat means try something like this
From http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/debug.html:With Windows, if it is a console application, the text is sent to console; otherwise, it is sent to the debugger.There is a special debug channel on Windows (WinAPI function OutputDebugString). See also How does Qt5 redirect qDebug() statements to the Qt Creator 2.6 consoleNow it is possible that photivo.exe uses plain qDebug() to produce the output and thus writes to the debug channel. You could try to verify this by using the tool DebugView.In that case you must find a way to read the debug channel from Python or fork photivo.exe and make it use STDOUT/STDERR instead of qDebug().
