So I have to create a list in Python using two excel spreadsheets that have been provided (that show a list of names, locations, salaries, etc...) for a mock company employee info list. I am required to turn it into a 2D python list. I believe I have the code down right, but I keep geeting an error due to the `x =+ 1'. Am I missing something?Thanks in advance!
Use the  module. The defaults of  will read CSV files in Excel dialect:You can also read the data into a dictionary structure, so that you can access columns by name.
