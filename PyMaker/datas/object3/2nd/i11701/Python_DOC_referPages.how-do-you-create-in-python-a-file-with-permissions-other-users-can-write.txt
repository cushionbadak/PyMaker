How can I in python (3) create a file what others users can write as well.I've so far this but it changes the what I get ---sr-S--t  1 root root    12 Apr 20 13:21 relaxbank1.txtexpected (after doing in commandline $ sudo chmod 777 relaxbank1.txt)-rwxrwxrwx  1 root root    12 Apr 20 13:21 relaxbank1.txt
The problem is your call to  recreates the call. Either you need to move the  to after you close the file, OR change the file mode to .Option1:Option2:Comment: Option1 is slightly better as it handles the condition where the file may not already exist (in which case the  will throw an exception).
If you don't want to use  and prefer to have the file created with appropriate permissions, then you may use  to create the appropriate file descriptor and then  the descriptor:Python 2 Note:The built-in open() in Python 2.x doesn't support opening by file descriptor. Use  instead; otherwise you'll get:
This is a robust methodSee how: is used instead of the raw binary constant, which is more semanticwe add just a single  to the file, and use the  by default, see also: How do you do a simple "chmod +x" from within python?See also: Write file with specific permissions in Python
