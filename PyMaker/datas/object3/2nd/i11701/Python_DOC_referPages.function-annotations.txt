I really do like function annotations, because they make my code a lot clearer.But I have a question: How do you annotate a function that takes another function as an argument? Or returns one?And I don't want to do  to use it in annotations.
Use the new  type hinting support added to Python 3.5; functions are callables, you don't need a function type, you want something that can be called:The above specifies that your  takes a callable object that accepts any arguments, and it's return type is , e.g. anything goes, it is a generic callable object.  then returns something that is just as generic.You could express this with  too; a plain  is equivalent to . Which one you pick is a style choice, I used the explicit option here as my personal preference.
