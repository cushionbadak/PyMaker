I have a dictionary that contains the starting and ending coordinates of line segment. I want to compare all the possible combination of any two keys in the dictionary to check if the line segments have an intersection. How can I do that ?The function for determining whether there is a collision is like this
You can just make nested loops for each of the pair elements. The following example does just this and tests the results with a plot., result is:, and:
You can use the standard  function to generate combinations. Eg,Using  is more efficient and more readable than using nested  loops, especially if you want combinations of length > 2.
You may writeThe  part makes sure you only get  but not  which would be the same and not  which would not make sense.You get an iterator with combinations and you can write:Note you should use a  rather than a  if the keys are 1, 2, 3,...
