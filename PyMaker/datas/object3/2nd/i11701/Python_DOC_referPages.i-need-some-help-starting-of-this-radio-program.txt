What I need help on is getting the stations to change to the next station in the list if the user presses 3. It starts at static but I want it to change every single one and then start over again. I tried something like this:I only end up getting the last station cannot figure out how to list the rest of the stations.
There are a couple of reasonable ways to do what you want.The easiest would be to make your class store an index into your list, rather than an list item directly. That way you can increment the index and wrap it around using the  modulus operator:A "fancier", and possibly more Pythonic way to solve the problem would be to use the  generator from the  module in the Python standard library. It returns an iterator that yields the values from your list, starting over when it reaches the end. Though you usually only deal with iterators in  loops, it's easy to use the iterator protocol by hand too. In our case, we just want to call  on the iterator to get the next value:

Define a variable in init with the actual position "self.pos = 0", and call this function when you required
