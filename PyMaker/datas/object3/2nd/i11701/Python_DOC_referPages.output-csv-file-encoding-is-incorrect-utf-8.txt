Natural Text
I have UTF-8 (no BOM) encoded CSV file:Following snippet reads the the file and then saves it again using different encoding:Problem: Saved file is not iso-8859-1, but utf-8 encoded. If I replace the file read with following list in my UTF-8 encoded source code file, it works correctly:Is this a bug in Python?  Or do I have to use additional encoding options?Tested with Python 3.4.

Thus  returns Fix is to explicitly specify encoding also for the input file:
