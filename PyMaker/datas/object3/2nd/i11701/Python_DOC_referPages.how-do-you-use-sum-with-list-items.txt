I am trying to create a program which prints the mean of certain values in a file. When I run my code using the file 'cropdata.txt', which contains this:I get the following error:I am not really sure why this is as I thought that I had converted the selected elements to integers.My code:
Upon converting like this , you didn't save the conversion back in the list.Try converting like so:and then sum like so:Alternatively you may use the statistics module instead of summing yourself.An optimized version:
Your codeisn't really doing anything, as the variable  gets overwritten each iteration of the loop.  Therefore, none of the data is converted from  to  type which is the cause of your error.  What you want to do is create a list of numbers as such:A few other things to note:Using  is a little superfluous as  will automatically split whitespace delimiters.  It also counts consecutive spaces as one delimeterNo argument is needed in  and you certainly don't need the enclosing parenthesisI've added a  function to your  calculation.  In Python 2, operations on two integers stay as an integer (so 5/3 = 1, not 1.66).  I believe Python 3 has similar behavior but this extra function doesn't hurt if not (Thanks for the clarification Bharel), this float function is not needed in Python 3
Your problem is not with  but the list of 'numbers', this should solve your problem:
