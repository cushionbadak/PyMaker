Natural Text
I know it's a very stupid question, but I am having some difficulty in wrapping around my head to convert this  command into an equivalent subprocess call to execute the ssh command. My current  call is:I am having difficulty especially around the  and  part. Can anyone show what would be the equivalent subprocess call to execute this command?NOTE:  and  are variables.
Use "subprocess.Popen"shell=Truemeans that the text is like it would be written to command promptthen u can communicate with subprocess with PIPEsOr commands can be supplied as a list of stringsfor more info see the docshttps://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html
Similar to subprocess.Popen: would also work
