For example if we have the method lt() implemented in a class and we try to use the greater than operator it will not raise an exception because it will use the less than method to compute a result. Is there some kind of table that exists that shows all of the operators and the operators that are called if the original operators were not defined? I did some searching but did not find what I was looking for. Thank youEDIT: Trying to find a list of magic methods that are called when an operator is used with objects but no operator method is defined in the object's class 
If want to overload an operator, you can implement the special (dunder ) methods. You will find them here - https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-namesIf you are looking for operators for efficient iteration purposes check the  module.
