There is a simple list, for example, I want to run through  with  loop to get previous element value for each iteration:I expected to see  on output, but get  instead.I guess this is because  method search only for first  value, ignoring the fact that there are two elements  as well as two ...How to fix this code to get expected output?
The  method will return the index of first occurrence of its argument. And since you have multiple duplicate items in your list it doesn't give you the expected result. You can use a simple slicing to get your expected output:Or if you want to access these items through a loop you can use  function like following:
Matching elements with their predecessors or sucessors is a common use case for zip:
You can always emulate the behaviour of C/Pascal/Perl/whatever 'for' instead of Python 'for' (which is actually more like foreach). Note that the range starts with 1 to avoid returning the last element on the first iteration.Not very Pythonic, but this approach is sometimes more intuitive for people with background in other languages.
As you noticed, using  does not work here, as it always finds the first position of the given element. Also, it is pretty wasteful, as in the worst case you have to search the entire list each time.You could use  with  parameter to get the element along with its index:
This will do the trick:
