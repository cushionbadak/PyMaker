I have tried inheriting from both  and  like so:and like so:in order to created an ordered default dict (a class that should remember the order in which new default items were generated) but it seems to throw an error stating:I have read here that it's because they're both implemented in C. Upon disabling Python's C implementation of  by commenting this section in the  module:I have managed to inherit from both, but it does not seem to work as I expected. I have two questions then:Why can't you inherit from two classes written in C? I would understand if you wouldn't be able to inherit from any class written in C but why can you inherit from one and not from 2?Implementing my requested class would be easy by subclassing  and overriding  to match 's behavior. Is there a better way (preferably within the standard library) to mimick the same behavior? Or is subclassing  the most optimal? (subclassing  is possible too but implementing it is is probably easier using )The first question is the important of the two as implementing it myself by subclassing  shouldn't pose a problem.
The functionality of  can be simply implemented by defining a  method:
