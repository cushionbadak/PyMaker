People mentioned in answers a1, a2 thatDue to the way the Python C-level APIs developed, a lot of built-in  functions and methods don't actually have names for their arguments.I found it really annoying cause I'm not be able to know it by looking at the doc. For instance, evaleval(expression, globals=None, locals=None)Then I wrote this line of codeand got . So is there a complete list of functions of this kind? How do I know if a function is allowed to have keyword arguments?
In Python 3.5 you can inspect the  of the built-in function:or ( cannot be used as a keyword argument)The  means that the arguments following that can be used as keyword arguments. C.f. Of course there are bugs even in 3.5:though according to issue 26729 in the Python bug tracker, there ought to be  after the  as the  cannot be used as a keyword argument.Unfortunately this information is not yet available in the Python documentation itself.
