I want to execute a python script in c to get a custom executable name but all my attempts basically failed as it always involves some child process where I don't have the pid to 'contact' it...Disclaimer: I'm more of a beginner in CHow would I go about doing that? 
I think that you want is a way  to create an executable from a Python script. There are a few tools to do this:py2exe  (Windows)pyinstaller (multiple platforms)cx_Freeze (multiple platforms)Alternatively you can embed the Python interpreter in C.
