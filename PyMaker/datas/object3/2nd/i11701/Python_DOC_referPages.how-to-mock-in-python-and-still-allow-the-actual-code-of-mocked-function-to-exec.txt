I have recently started using the mock framework in python. It seems that if I patch a function, the actual code is not called - which means that the database changes etc that this actual function does is not implemented.I have been trying to go around it by calling the function before hand and storing the return value and passing it as arg in patch(), but is there a better way to do it?
