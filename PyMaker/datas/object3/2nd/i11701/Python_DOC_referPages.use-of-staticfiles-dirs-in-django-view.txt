I'm using STATICFILES_DIRS in my view and it gives me the path in single quotes and surrounded by square brackets. How can I just get the path? For example, it gives me['/.../static']and I want/.../staticAny help would be appreciated. Thanks.
STATICFILES_DIRS is a List more about lists you can read in official docs (see: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html).You can get the element of this list like this :  when 0 is the position of a given element.So I'm not sure if it's usual manipulate staticfiles_dirs in views.
