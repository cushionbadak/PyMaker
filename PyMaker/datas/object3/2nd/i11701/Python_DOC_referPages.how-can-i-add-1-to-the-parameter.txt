(I've called the function to see if it works.)Somebody please help me since I'm very new to python :)I changed it to but still no results are showing after I enter a number, Does anybody know?
You need to return some value or it never will appear.
You need to ensure you return the num in the increment function and assign it to a.Return:    def increment(num):        return num + 1Assign:    a = increment(a)
