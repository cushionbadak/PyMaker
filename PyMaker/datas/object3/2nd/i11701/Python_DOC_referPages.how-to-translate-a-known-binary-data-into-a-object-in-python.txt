For example, I already know a binary data:  It is a dict object. How can I translate it into a dict object? I can only find the way to read files into a object, but I can't find the way to translate the existing data into object.
You can convert the binary data to a python object using the pickle module:Note that this will only work on objects that were serialized using the tools in the pickle module -  or .  The pickle module can't deserialise arbitrary binary data.  Also, you should only unpickle objects from a trusted source, as unpickling an object could cause code execution.
