Natural Text
I am trying to output names of books along with their probabilities. This is what the current output looks like:What I am trying to achieve is to have the probabilities paired with the names:This is what I have done till now:This is what my prob5 looks like:  which is why I am rounding it off to 4 decimal places and I need to extract the probabilties from this numpy array.I am getting a little confused as to how to run the two loops at the same time to achieve the desired output format.
I don't know what kind of problems you encounter while manipulating a numpy array, but if  is as you described you could directly access its 0-th element as . As for printing 4 decimals, have a look at the syntax of .Assuming that you are using Python 3:If you use Python 2.x, use the  module and its  function that has improved performance over the native . If the objects have a different number of elements, use  instead.
You can use zip to combine the two lists and then itertools grouper to split into groups of two.
Do you mean like this?And to write the output directly to a file:You can change  with  if you want to write the output in one single line.
