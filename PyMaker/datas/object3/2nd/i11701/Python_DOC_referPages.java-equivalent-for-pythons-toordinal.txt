What is the best way to replicate  in java?I tried using epoch but the results are nowhere near.
There isn't any direct way to query that information using the Java Time API but you can calculate it.Run today, 19th April 2016, it outputs , which is consistent with Python's output.From a , you can get the Epoch day with . If you take a look inside the current implementation, you'll find that it actually calculates the total number of days since year 0 and subtracts that with the constantwhere  is the number of days in a 400 year cycle. That constant isn't public, so we can't reuse it directly.From the Python documentation of , it defines year 1 to have an ordinal of 1. The calculus above by the Java API supposes that it is year 0 instead so we just need to adjust for that.
