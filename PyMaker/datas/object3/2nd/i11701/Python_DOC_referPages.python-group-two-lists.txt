I have two lists:Is there anyway i could group items in A for the same sessionid, so that i could print out the following:
The itertools  function is designed to do this sort of thing. Some of the other answers here create a dictionary, which is very sensible, but if you don't actually want a  then you can do this:output returns a callable that fetches the item at index 0 of whatever object you pass it;  uses this as the key function to determine what items can be grouped together.Note that this and similar solutions assume that the  indices are sorted. If they aren't then you need to sort the list of tuples returned by  with the same key function before passing them to .edited to work correctly on Python 2 and Python 3
Not using , you can use a dictionary:And based on the remarks below:
You could use a dictionary and :Or you can use :Output:
One linerWithout nested loop
You can do:
You could also convert them into numpy arrays, and use the indices of the session ids you need with should return  you could of course turn this into a function which takes N, the desired session and returns your A values.Hope this helps!
