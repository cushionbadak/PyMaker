Natural Text
I have a string which has both Arabic and English sentences. What I want is to extract Arabic Sentences only.This Link shows that the Unicode range for Arabic letters is . So, very basic attempt came to my mind is:But, this fails miserably as it returns the following list.As you can see, this is exactly opposite of what I want. What I am missing here?N.B. I know I can match the Arabic letters by using inverse matching like below:But, I don't want that.
You can use  to replace ascii characters with empty string.Your regex didn't work because you are using Python 2 and your string is  you need to convert  to unicode for it to work. However it did perfectly work on Python3.x
Your original code was correct, just needed to encode  with proper encoding, 'utf-8' and add  in your  pattern since you are working with Python2, This will give you a list of matched unicode strings instead of single characters that you don't need to join them back with If you were in Python3, you don't need any of encoding tweeking as default encoding is 'utf-8':
Your code is:When matching a byte sequence, there is no such concept as Unicode code points. Therefore, the  escape sequences in the regular expression don’t make any sense. They are not interpreted as you thought, but just mean .So when parsing the regular expression for bytes, it is equivalent to:This character class is interpreted as “one of , or a byte in the range , or one of ”. This, in turn, is equivalent to , since all the other bytes are already included in this range.Demonstration:Note that the  is not matched, since it comes behind  in the ASCII character set.
