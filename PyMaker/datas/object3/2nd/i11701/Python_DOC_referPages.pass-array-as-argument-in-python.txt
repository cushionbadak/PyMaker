I am new to python. Now I need to declare the array of size 20 and pass the array to a function.The function expecting the array is as:The  is an input to the .Can anyone help me, how to pass array in python?
When you say "array" I assume you mean a Python , since that's often used in Python when an array would be used in other languages. Python actually has several array types: , , and ; the popular 3rd-party module Numpy also supplies an array type.To pass a single list (or other array-like container) to a function that's defined with a single  parameter you need to use the  operator to unpack the list in the function call. Here's an example that runs on Python 2 or Python 3. I've made a list of length 5 to keep the output short.outputNote that when  prints  the output is shown in parentheses , not brackets . That's because the brackets denote a list, the parentheses denote a tuple. The  in the call to  unpacks the  list into separate arguments, but the  in the  definition re-packs them into a tuple.                                                                       For more info on these uses of  please see Arbitrary Argument Lists and Unpacking Argument Lists in the Python tutorial. Also see What does ** (double star) and * (star) do for Python parameters?.
Size doesn't matter.Just pass  to function.You don't need  sequence unpacking for that purpose.
I think that what you need is easier than expected:
