I'd like to create a variable whose name includes the name  for example, but the below code doesn't work.I want to make it so that if  is entered, for example, then if the  variable was equal to 7, 7 would be outputted. How can I do this?
You cannot have  variable in Python. The Python variable naming rules are described in PEP 8 (also see this related thread: What is the naming convention in Python for variable and function names?). Instead, look into using a dictionary:Or, depending on the end goal, you can have first name, DOB and score under separate keys:Or, to take it further, you may define a, say,  class with ,  and  properties. 
As discussed in other answers and comments, you should use a dictionary. But in the case of you think you should create a dynamic variable with respect to Python naming rules, you can use  built-in function like this:Actually  function runs Python statements dynamically. Ä°f  variable is "Kaiylar" and  variable is "1.2" of int, then we pass "KaiylarScore = 1.2" statement to this function.Regards.
