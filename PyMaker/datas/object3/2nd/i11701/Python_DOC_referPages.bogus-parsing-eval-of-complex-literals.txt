When evaluating complex numbers, python likes to fiddle the signs.This is Python 3.5.0 (but similar weird issues exist in python 2)Why?  nb: I noticed it when reading this question.
The issue here is that python doesn't parse complex numbers such as  as literals, they are actually parsed as an expression:So, this is not a complex literal but a subtraction of int and complex.The int part is taken as having a 0j complex component, and then we lose the expected signed zero from the result because of the subtraction of the complex components.  The result of  should have positive sign, as IEEE 754-2008 dictates.  This is arguably a parser issue, because the sign of the zero can influence the solutions of equations.  However, the issue has been repeatedly raised and closed on the python tracker as 'not a bug', so it doesn't look like that behaviour will be going away any time soon.  The reliable way to initialize complex numbers is by calling the  built-in:
