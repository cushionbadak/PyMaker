The regular expression works fine:output: However I was wondering if there was a way to group the matches to a single line separated by a single space instead of grouping the matches in a list. So instead of the output shown above I would like to print this instead:

Python < 3.0I think the cleanest and most pythonic way to do this with pre-3.0 python is:  To clean it up a little, you could save the re.match result in a variable:Example: Python >= 3.0Of course, there's always a nicer option with Python 3.0+. If using Python 3 isn't an option, you may be able to use  in your Python 2.x code.This is the nice Python 3 way of printing a list on one line without the commas:And of course, saving the re.match in a variable makes the code very clean and understandable:Example:
