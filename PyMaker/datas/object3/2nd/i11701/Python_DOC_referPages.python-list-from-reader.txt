New to Python so help much appreciated. Trying to create a list from a csv file but I get back empty list. The code is:The output is As you can see the reader works but when I try to create a list it returns empty. Thanks in advance.
Iterators such as files can only be iterated once. You need to re-initialize them to be able to restart reading from the beginning. Try:
You can only move though the iterator once. You can however reset the iterator by using  (see docs https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.IOBase.seek).Your example would then only need one additional line of code, becoming:
Files cannot be iterated twice without rewinding, and  returns an iterator that cannot be iterated twice at all.The easy and "right" way is that you load the whole file into memory:This will work as long as your file is not huge.
