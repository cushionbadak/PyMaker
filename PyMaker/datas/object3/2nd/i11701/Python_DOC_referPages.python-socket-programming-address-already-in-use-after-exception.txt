Natural Text
I have a little server running on my Raspberry Pi which listens at a specific port. However, whenever an exception occurs during a connection and the connection is terminated, it seems that the assignment to the port is not "unbound".This is an example code:When I run it for the first time and do a  on another terminal, the connection is made and the server raises the Exception as expected.However, when I try to run it for a second time, I get this error:How can I make sure that the socket is unbound even if an exception is raised on the server?(By the way, this doesn't seem to happen in Windows.)
Set  socket option before binding the socket.the  flag tells the kernel to reuse a local socket in   state, without waiting for its natural timeout to expire.from  documentationNOTE: You will get an error even if you apply this, if there's  socket is remained from the previous run (without the  option).
