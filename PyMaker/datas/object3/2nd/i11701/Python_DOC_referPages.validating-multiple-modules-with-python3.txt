I'm trying to validate multiple functions from separate files all with the same names in Python 3.So, consider I have a directory of directories:  which has , , , ...,  which all are directories and each contain a file called . I do not know what  through  are until run time.In each , there's functions  through . I would like to create a script that executes  through  and prints their output for each  through 's  file.I would like to think that I could import each  file in each directory, but the problem is that each file has the same name. Also,  through  is not known until run time. Obviously, I can determine  through  using the  function. Any idea on how I can call  from two different files after getting the names of the directories through  and ? Another poster suggested this for 2.7:This is possible using .Then, to call a function  in the  module contained in subdirectory  for example, it would be:.This would be a perfect solution. Can anyone suggest a similar solution in Python 3.4 or 3.5?
 doesn't support importing given a full pathname, but does support importing from packages.You can make each sub-sirectory, ,  etc., a package by adding a blank  in the directory, and then use importlib.So, in each directory, you have  and Then the following example code should work:Note that I'm on Python 2, which only has , Python 3 has more functionality, but I would expect the above to still work.Not also that the directory which contains  etc. must reside in your PYTHONPATH.
