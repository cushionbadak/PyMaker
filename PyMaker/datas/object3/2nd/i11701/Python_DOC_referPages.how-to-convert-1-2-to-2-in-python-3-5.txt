what I need is that I ask the user to input something like 1/2ex: what I need is to take 16 out of 1/16 and use it for calculations.in math we can easily use 1/(1/16), but in python I do get a data type error when trying to asign and do the calculations using the fractional value like this,Any help is highly apprecitated
I don't fully understand your question, but Python does understand fractions - see https://docs.python.org/3/library/fractions.htmlOne benefit of this is that you check for invalid input by catching the  exception.
k[1] will be the denominatorand will be it as a number
You can calculate x = 1/16; and then calculate y = 1/x. Hope it helps
You could use  module. But I if understand your question correctly, your user enters  in this fraction form and you want the  out of it.If it's now what you want then please comment.
