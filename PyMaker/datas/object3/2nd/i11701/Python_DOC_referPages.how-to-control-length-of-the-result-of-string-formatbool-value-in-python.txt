What the equivalent way to  function for converting booleans into strings?Please note the space in . This  always makes the length the same for 'True' and 'False'.I've check the methods in this post:How are booleans formatted in Strings in Python?None of them can do the same thing.
You can use type conversion flags to do what you wanted:Note the . I used an underscore to show the padding more clearly.Relevant documentation:6.1.3. Format String Syntax[...]The conversion field causes a type coercion before formatting. Normally, the job of formatting a value is done by the  method of the value itself. However, in some cases it is desirable to force a type to be formatted as a string, overriding its own definition of formatting. By converting the value to a string before calling , the normal formatting logic is bypassed.Three conversion flags are currently supported:  which calls  on the value,  which calls  and  which calls .Some examples:
You can use the  function. More about it here.Here are some examples:
I found that  works fine. The output is exactly the same as , ie .So the length of  is alway 5, no matter  is  or .Of course you may change the length or the alignment direction as you want. eg.  outputs .
Not sure if I got idea correctly but if some variable x results in True or False, You can write str(x); if not a case, sorry just try explaining Q in more detailed way
