Natural Text
I have a string:feature.append(freq_and_feature(text, freq))I want a list containing each word of the string, like [feature, append, freq, and, feature, text, freq], where each word is a string, of course.These string are contained in a file called helper.txt, so I'm doing the following, as suggested by multiple SO posts, like the accepted answer for this one(Python: Split string with multiple delimiters):However, I get the following, which is not what I want.
This looks for the string  to split on. You probably meant takes a regular expression as the first argument. To say "this OR that" in regular expressions, you can write  and it will match either  or . If you wrote , it would only match  followed by . Luckily, so we don't have to write , there's a nice form where you can use s to state that everything inside should be treated as "match one of these".
It seems you want to split a string with non-word or underscore characters. UseSee the IDEONE demoThe  regex matches 1+ characters that are not word ( = ) or underscores.You can get rid of the  if you remove initial and trailing non-word characters from the input string, e.g. .
You can try thisThis will result:
I think you are trying to split on the basis of  characters. It should be can be translated to --> Python CodeThis will also work, indeedIdeone Demo
