I want to export some Excel file in my memory, and here is my code.There is no problem when i use Python 2.7 but if i use Python 3.5 it occurs error I guess the error is because of their difference (open function)What is the appropriate way to open excel file in my memory and export it?
In Python 3.x files are opened in text mode by default. Change your first line to:From Python 3 documentation (emphasis mine):Normally, files are opened in text mode, that means, you read and write strings from and to the file, which are encoded in a specific encoding. If encoding is not specified, the default is platform dependent (see open()). 'b' appended to the mode opens the file in binary mode: now the data is read and written in the form of bytes objects. This mode should be used for all files that donâ€™t contain text.
