I have the following Python code:The code is supposed to return string chunks of certain size , and is also supposed to check if  is empty or not passed as a parameter. It is giving an error  takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given). How do I provide a default argument so that I can call this with one or two arguments?
This has nothing to do with test cases, testing or the assertion you are trying.Your code simply fails because your function  expects exactly two arguments, but you are giving it exactly one.If you want  to be an optional parameter, use a default value: will account for all cases of falsy values for , among them , 0 or the empty list .edit:From your comment I'm assuming you actually want instead ofI can only guess, though, your specifications are unclear.
