Natural Text
I'm trying to find unique instances of IP addresses in a file using regex. I find them fine and try to append them to a list and later try to use  on my list to remove duplicates. I'm finding each item okay and there are duplicates but I can't get the list to simplify. The output of printing my set is the same as printing ips as a list, nothing is removed.This string  shows up 60+ times in the output before and after trying to  the list
You are not storing the matched strings. You are storing the  objects. These don't compare equal even if they matched the same text, so they are all seen as unique by a  object:Extract the matched text instead: without arguments returns the part of the string that was matched (group 0):
