I want to copy the first two lists from a given nested . I did the following:My question is: is there another elegant way? 
Just use slicing to get the first two items from a list. Also, don't use list as it shadows the built-in : Output:An easy way to think of slicing is as follows:Furthermore, as it was made clear to me, you are looking to actually extract this data in to a separate list. Therefore, you probably want to make use of the copy module, and use deecopy. Per the docs: For collections that are mutable or contain mutable items, a copy is  sometimes needed so one can change one copy without changing the  other.Therefore, your code can look like: 
You can use slicing:
Well, for your example, justor equivalentlyIn your sample code sList refers to the same lists as the original (which definitely shouldn't be called ) - if you actually want copies, useto duplicate the nested lists
You can just take a list slice
Note that  copies the list, so any change in either the first two elements of my_list or sliced_list will not be reflected in the other (unlike simple slicing). selects the first two sub lists from your list.Slicing refers to the actual sublist, not a copy, as this example demonstrates.Copy with Using slicing
