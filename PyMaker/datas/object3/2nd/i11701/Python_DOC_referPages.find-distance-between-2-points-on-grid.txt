Im finding the distance between two points, given  and . With x or y, one is always a float and the other an int, so its always on a line. You have to stay on the gridlines to get to the destination point, and there is no set incrementation. I havent seen any other posts on finding distance on a grid that deal with the mix of ints and floats so here I am.This is my code:An example would be  and , it should equal 2.7, but I get 2.5For example, you go from  to  to  to  for a total difference of 2.7. It's like calculating the Manhattan distance, but instead of starting and ending at lattice points, you might start and/or end half-way down a block.
When you look at the different combinations, it seems like the naive Manhattan distance will work, except when your path takes on a "C" shape (as given in the example). This will happen if and only if your two float points are both x-coordinates or y-coordinates and have the same integer part.An attempt might look like:
From each house take a short-range taxicab to a corner. You have two ways of doing so. Then -- take a long-range taxicab between the resulting corners. There are 2x2 = 4 possibilities, depending on the corners traveled to. Take the min:For example,
It's not the mix of  and , probably you are experiencing floating point error.  are not exact, they are approximate, and can therefore be "off" by small amounts.You could use  objects provided by the  module to work accurately with floating point values. Here's an example:The final result will still be "off", but using  will help to avoid cumulative rounding errors:
