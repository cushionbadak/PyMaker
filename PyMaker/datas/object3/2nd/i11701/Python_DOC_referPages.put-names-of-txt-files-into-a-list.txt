This is my code, pinched from this site:It works great, but I want to be able to manipulate my results and store them into a list, and I'm not sure how to do that. It's probably super simple and missing me completely, I'm sort of a noob. Thanks :)EDIT:I removed the readlines part, that wasn't meant to be there.What I am trying to do is get the names of every .txt file in the folder, in this case the folder is C:\
Probably you want to have something like this:if you don't want to have .txt in the list do this:
A couple alternatives to incBrain's (perfectly fine) answer.First, to simplify your own code instead of reinventing the wheel, use :Or to get higher performance on Python 3.5+ (or any version of Python using the  module from PyPI):Or for true ridiculousness, push more work to the C layer and avoid redundancy by splitting off the extension once, instead of one check for it, then another operation to strip it: doesn't do much for you in this case (you're not reading any attributes it might have checked for you), but in a largish directory, it means you aren't storing all entries at once ( and most other APIs read the complete contents of the directory into a  first before you have a chance to filter it), so peak memory usage is reduced when few files are matched.
