I'm trying to create a powerset in Python 3.  I found a reference to the  module, and I've used the powerset code provided on that page.  The problem:  the code returns a reference to an  object, whereas I want access to the elements in the powerset.  My question: how to accomplish this?  Many thanks in advance for your insights.
 functions return iterators, objects that produce results lazily, on demand.You could either loop over the object with a  loop, or turn the result into a list by calling  on it:You can also store the object in a variable and use the  function to get results from the iterator one by one.
Here's a solution using a generator:
