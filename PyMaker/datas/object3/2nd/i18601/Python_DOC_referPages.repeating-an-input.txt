I'm new to Python and have been working through some tutorials to try to get to grips with different aspects of programming.I'm stuck on an exercise that is most likely very simple however I am unable to find the solution.How do I create a program that reads one line of input and prints out the same line two times?For example if the input was  it would print:Any help with this would be hugely appreciated. I think I'm making a simple logic error but don't yet have the skills in place to recognise what it is.
The other answers seem logical enough, but what if you wanted to print it let's say a 1000 times or a million times? Are you really going to be typing print(variable) a million types? Here is a faster way:Here, I can change the value of range to whatever I want, and J will be printed that many times. What happens here, is that the variable i loops upwards (an increment) to the number 2, so to explain it to a beginner, i travels t=from number to number. Where I put print(j) for every number i loops through until it gets to 2, J will be printed.
It sounds like you've been doing the input and output in one go:That works for doing a single echo of the input, but makes it a bit harder to repeat the same thing twice. An easy workaround would be to save the inputted text to a variable, which you can print twice:If you needed to do the input and doubled output with a single statement, you could use string formatting to duplicate the text with a newline in the middle:
way complex right?(:D)
