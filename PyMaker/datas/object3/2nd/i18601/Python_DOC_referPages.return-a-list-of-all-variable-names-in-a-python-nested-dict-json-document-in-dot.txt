I'm looking for a function that operates on a python arbitrarily nested dict/array in JSON-esque format and returns a list of strings keying all the variable names it contains, to infinite depth.  So, if the object is... would return...
Example:
This is a fun one. I solved it using recursion.Here is my result:EDITHere it is again using generators, because I liked the answer by F.jThe same result:
If the top level of your object can be a list (array, in JSON terminology), your output format doesn't work: for e.g  you'd logically return , which probably isn't what you want. You can solve this by also passing in the name of the object to a slight modification of F.J's answer:Usage:Python 3.3 introduces a  syntax which makes this a little cleaner:
Python 3.3+ only:Python 2.x ~ Python 3.2
