I have a Python program which adds something dynamically to . It works fine, but I'd like to distribute my Python program as a .zip file where  runs. Can I add entries to  from the zip file? After searching around a bit, I found the  documentation but I can't figure out what will work.note: the stuff I need to add in  includes  and  files for Windows.
I'm not entirely sure I understand your question, but I'll have a crack at answering it anyway ...Unfortunately, while you can import from a zipfile by adding it to : contains a list of strings providing search locations for  modules and packages. It is initialized from the PYTHONPATH  environment variable and various other installation- and  implementation-specific defaults. Entries in  can name  directories on the file system, zip files, and potentially other  “locations” (see the  module) that should be searched for modules,  such as URLs, or database queries. Only strings and bytes should be  present on ; all other data types are ignored. The encoding of  bytes entries is determined by the individual path entry finders.source: http://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#path-entry-finders... that doesn't extend to  and  files:Any files may be present in the ZIP archive, but only files  and   are available for import. ZIP import of dynamic modules (,  ) is disallowed.source: http://docs.python.org/3/library/zipimport.htmlI'm not aware of any way of working around this restriction.
