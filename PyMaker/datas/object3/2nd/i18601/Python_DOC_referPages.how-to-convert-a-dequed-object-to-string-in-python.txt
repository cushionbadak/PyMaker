I am trying to output a rotated version of a string. I have taken a string, , and created a deque out of it, , and rotated it using the rotate method. How do I "convert" that deque object I rotated back to a string?
Answer to your question: Since a deque is a sequence, you can generally use str.join to form a string from the ordered elements of that collection.  works more broadly on any Python iterable to form a string from the elements joined together one by one.BUT, suggestion, instead of a deque and rotate and join, you can also concatenate slices on the string itself to form a new string:Which works both ways:Besides being easier to read (IMHO) It also turns out to be a whole lot faster:Prints:
Just use str. method:
Just concatenate the characters in the string:
You could use the string join method:
Using  should do the trick.
A good way is to use the  method on the string.
You can use :
