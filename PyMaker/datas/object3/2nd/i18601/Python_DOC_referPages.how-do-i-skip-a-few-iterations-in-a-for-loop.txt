In python I usually loop through ranges simply by but now I want to skip a few steps in the loop. More specifically, I want something like  so that it would skip the whole loop and increase the counter by 10. If I were using a for loop in C I'd just sum 10 to , but in Python that doesn't really work.
You cannot alter the target list ( in this case) of a  loop. Use a  loop instead:Alternatively, use an iterable and increment that:By assigning the result of  to a local variable, we can advance the loop sequence inside the loop using standard iteration tools (, or here, a shortened version of the  consume recipe).  normally calls  for us when looping over a iterator.
The best way is to assign the iterator a name - it is common have an iterable as opposed to an iterator (the difference being an iterable - for example a list - starts from the beginning each time you iterate over it). In this case, just use the  built-in function:Then you can advance it inside the loop using the name. The best way to do this is with the   recipe - as it is fast (it uses  functions to ensure the iteration happens in low-level code, making the process of consuming the values very fast, and avoids using up memory by storing the consumed values):By doing this, you can do something like:
Why not just set the value to skip until?  Like:where SOME_CONDITION is whatever causes you to skip and DO_SOMETHING() is the actual loop contents?
will print 0, 10, 20 ...
