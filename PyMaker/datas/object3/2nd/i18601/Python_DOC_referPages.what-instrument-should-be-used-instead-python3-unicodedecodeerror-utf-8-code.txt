I migrate to python3, specially to get parse international internet, pages of Chinese etc.But there i meet this trouble.My simple code is a python wrapper around wget, because it is easiest way on my sight to dodge the ban. http://xiwayy2kn32bo3ko.onion/test/read.cgi/tor/1371355627/978nIs an example, it is onion-web. Why codecs.py of python3.3 did not understand everything whatever exist?subprocess crashed with out any chance to restore fetched data.Is there universal international way to fetch and parse html pages on any language? I were sure that utf-8 developed for this task.Target page is: Shift_JIS encodedMy main question is:How it should be done for any encoding, any language, universally. What language better to take for that task, how should html be parsed?What instrument shall i use for such task? 
Don't use ; it assumes that whatever output was produced by the command is decodable with the same encoding as  uses.Try  instead; it returns bytes.
