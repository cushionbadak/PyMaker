This is the code I written so far, and the point with the program is to read 20 people from a file and then assign them their attributes, then normalise their values from a input given by the user.What I wonder is how to loop through the attributes of the persons that is placed in allPersons list and then compare them against eachother to find out the max value. This is what I tried so far, but I can't get it to work All help will be appreciated, and I'm open for new solutions, also I imagine the importFromList method is not the most effective one, so if you got any objections I'm willing to listen and learn!
 takes a  parameter, a function that when passed one of the objects returns the value by which to compare them.Use  to get that value:This returns the matching object for which that attribute is the maximum. If you wanted to store just that maximum value itself, you have two options:Take the attribute from the returned object:Pass just the attributes instead to  with a generator expression:If you find that you need to order the  classes in various directions by the same attribute again and again (to find the minimum, maximum, sort them, etc.) you may want to make your class orderable as well.To do that, you'll need to implement some of the basic customization hooks Python will look for. With some extra trickery, you can get away with just the lower-than and equals operations, and by using the  class decorator:Now your  class is orderable, entirely on the basis of ; for the  function, that means you can drop the  parameter altogether.
