This question already has an answer here:Loop “Forgets” to Remove Some Items [duplicate]                    10 answers                In python, I'm supposed to write a program that asks the user for a string, and then it removes all occurrences of p, q, r, s, t (lower and upper-case), then print out everything else.For input  it should print .I've written the code but it doesn't remove the last letter if needed.Here is what I've written:
You could use .Since you're on Python 3, use the  method like this.The problem in your code is that you're removing stuff from the list while iterating over it.Just doing this works. (Here you make a copy, iterate over it, while removing the element from the original list)P.S - Instead of using  and iterating over the list and joining the characters, just use .
You can use regular expression: 
You can combine  and generator expression. Combine for loop and string concatation is not efficient or pythonic. Also, string itself is iterable, no need to turn it into a list.
There's a lot of ways to do that. e.g.As a side note, you don't have to turn a string into a list to iterate over it but you shouldn't modify an iterable when you iterate over it, so if you would like to improve your code it would be something along the lines of: This way you are making a copy of a string, you don't run into problems that you have when you modify it during iteration.
