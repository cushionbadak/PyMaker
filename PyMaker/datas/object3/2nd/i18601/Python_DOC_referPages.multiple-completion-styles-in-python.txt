I've been playing with Python's  module. One of the things I noticed is the lack of support to directly bind a key to a Python function.  In other words, there is no binding for readline's .My intention is to have different completion logics depending on the key pressed.  For example, apart from the traditional tab completion, I would like to bind something like  and perform completion using a different function.  Or, another example, to imitate Cisco shell and bind the  key to a command listing with a description.With only one completer bound, is it possible to retrieve the key that triggered the completion event?Thanks.
Based on readline 6.2.4.1, I added a new function to pass the value of variable rl_completion_invoking_key to python in readline.c, and generated my own readline.so. Then I can decide different behaviors according to the invoking keys in the complete() function.
