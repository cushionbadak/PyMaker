I have a problem writing the following arrays to a .txt file.This is my code:This is the output:Is there a way to print it in this format?I have tried But it does not work, as it is a list of numpy64 floats.
You want to make strings out of each member of the list first.  TryAlso, don't name variables !
Try
hacky fix:
Converting them to strings should workand as Brien said, don't call your list 
If list is a numpy array of floats:OR-You can also use csv to write np.arrays quickly:Yields txt file:or if you wanted integers, adding:would yield
Firstly, you should use the with statement when dealing with files to ensure they are automatically closed even if the program encounters an error befor they finish. Secondly, you can replace  and  with  and . Also, having a variable called  overwrites the inbuilt type list. Common practice is to use a trailing underscore to avoid this.This code should work (although I don't currently have Numpy installed to test it with)Note that this will erase the previous contents of the file. If you don't want this, open the file with "a" in the open function rather than "w".
