Pardon me if this has been addressed before, but how do I organize data exchanged between client and server in python application (sockets)?Let's say I have some elements I have to send - strings, tuples, dicts:What I currently do is I simply convert everything to string - call  before sending and  after receiving. This obviously seem a bit redundant.How should I send these chunks of data? Is there a convention? Preferred format? How do I compress it?
The easiest way is to pickle them on the client side and unpickle them on the server side. However, to need to ensure that the data is coming from a trusted source as it is possible to force unpickle to execute arbitrary code. Make sure you use  to get the C language implementation.
JSON is what you're looking for. If you have an object and you import the JSON functions:you can use  to encode into JSON and  to convert a JSON string back to an object. For example:yields  and yields .
You should never  data from an untrusted source, which means you should never  anything arriving over an unsecured network connection (or where you can't be absolutely certain the entity at the other end is who or what it says it is).The obvious solution here is to encode the data as JSON at one end, and decode it at the other (unless you have specific performance requirements that require a highly-compressed format like e.g msgpack).
