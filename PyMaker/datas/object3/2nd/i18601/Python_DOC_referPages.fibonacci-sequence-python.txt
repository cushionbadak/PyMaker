I am trying to understand Python, but I still don't get it. I am new to the language, and wants to understand it properly.This is a line from a Fibonacci sequence using loops. Please explain the meaning of this code. I am trying to get the pattern by hand. I got the pattern up to 3, but after 3 I am not getting the answer.
This is known as multiple assignment. It's basically an atomic version of:By atomic, I mean everything on the right is calculated before pacing it into the variables on the left. So  becomes  and  becomes the old version of  plus , equivalent to the non-atomic:So, in terms of what you see:That exact code (along with the explanation of multiple assignment) can be found here in the tutorial.
It's multiple assigment (or tuple unpacking).According to Python Tutorial:This example introduces several new features.The first line contains a multiple assignment: the variables a and b  simultaneously get the new values 0 and 1. On the last line this is  used again, demonstrating that the expressions on the right-hand side  are all evaluated first before any of the assignments take place. The  right-hand side expressions are evaluated from the left to the right.
How about multiple answers?
