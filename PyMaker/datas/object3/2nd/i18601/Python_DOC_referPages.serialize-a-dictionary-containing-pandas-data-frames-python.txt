I have a dict containing several pandas Dataframe (identified by keys) , any suggestion to effectively serialize (and cleanly load) it . Here is the structure (a pprint display output ).  Each of dict['method_x_']['meas_x_'] is a pandas Dataframe. The goal is to save the dataframes for a further plotting with some specific plotting options.{'method1': {'meas1': 'method2': {  'meas1': 'meas2':
Use pickle.dump(s) and pickle.load(s). It actually works. Pandas DataFrames also have their own method df.save("filename") that you can use to serialize a single DataFrame...
