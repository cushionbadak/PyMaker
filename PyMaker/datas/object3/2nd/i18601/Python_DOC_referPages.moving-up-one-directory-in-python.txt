Is there a simple way to move up one directory in python using a single line of code? Something similar to  in command line

Use the  module:should work 
Obviously that os.chdir('..') is the right answer here. But just FYI, if in the future you come across situation when you have to extensively manipulate directories and paths, here is a great package (Unipath) which lets you treat them as Python objects: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Unipathso that you could do something like this:
Well.. I'm not sure how portable os.chdir('..') would actually be. Under Unix those are real filenames. I would prefer the following:That gets the current working directory, steps up one directory, and then changes to that directory. 
In Python 3.4 pathlib was introduced:It also comes with many other helpful features e.g. for joining paths using slashes or easily walking the directory tree.For more information refer to the docs or this post, which covers the differences between os.path and pathlib.
