Natural Text
I was wondering if it makes a difference in using  vs ?  If it does, when should I be using one or the other?
Read the manual:All non-keyword arguments are converted to strings like  does and written to the stream, separated by  and followed by .So if you pass a single argument to  (e.g., ),  is not inserted between them. (So no extra space character.)All these lines are the same (the difference being how many times  is called behind-the-scenes and how many intermediate strings are constructed):
This use of  is specific to the  function. It automatically inserts a space. It is best to use for readability's sake when the space is desired, because it avoids the  call.But, if you need a string (e.g. to put in a variable), you need to use .
