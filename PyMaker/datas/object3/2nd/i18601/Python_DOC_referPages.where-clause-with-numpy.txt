Here's my array:I would like to do a where clause which will return the indices of the elements in 'a' where the sum of the values for this element is equal to 1.Something like : Can someone guide me ?Thanks.
Using enumerate, list comprehension:
So the sum of the 2nd row (index == 1) is 1.0.  takes the sums across the rows, which are equivalent to the elements of your original list of lists. Without specifying an explicit axis, numpy takes the sum of all elements of the array. Note, there is a difference between the python builtin  and . This is a good reason not to do  and keep things explicit.Update:As @Jaime suggested doing a comparison with the equality is not safe. Ideally  would have an  option, but it doesn't. You can still recreate this using:See the docs for  for more info.
