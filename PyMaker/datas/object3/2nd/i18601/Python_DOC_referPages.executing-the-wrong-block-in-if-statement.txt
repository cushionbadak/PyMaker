Even though the  number will be greater than 200, the values in  would not show up. Can you guys tell me why it doesn't show up? In  everything shows up nicely even if the number if greater than 200. Whatam I doing wrong?
This is happening because your program execution goes through  before it even considers the . Here's how if-statements work:This:is the same as this:If you want to execute what's inside the  and the , there are four options:Option 1 (just add everything from one onto the other):Option 2 (nested if-statement):Option 3 (no , just s):This will execute the last two  blocks, which might not be what you want. Note however, that in executing all those if-statments' conditions, you lose on runtime, especially if they're complex conditionsOption 4 (range conditions):This gives you the short-circuiting of if-statements that you desire, as well as the guarantee that only one block will be entered at any given time.Hope this helps
That's because  conditions short-circuit, if first  condition is  the second one is not going to be checked.From docs on :It selects exactly one of the suites by evaluating the expressions one  by one until one is found to be true; then that suite is executed (and  no other part of the if statement is executed or evaluated). If all  expressions are false, the suite of the else clause, if present, is  executed.Use all 's in case you want all conditions to be executed:Another option is:
As others have pointed out, once the  condition is true the  will not even be evaluated.Try reversing the order of the statements like this...Also keep in mind that in your original code a value of exactly 150 would have been missed unless you change the  to .
Did you know that you can sum lists:But I have to believe you have a list of your total variables going, in which case you can just do:
