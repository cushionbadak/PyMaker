Natural Text
This question is an exact duplicate of:How do I get the right amount of count() on two lines, for 2 separate teams? (counting goals)                    1 answer                My desired program has to read a text file like this:and run the following output:I think i need to first put it into groups. Remove the newline characters. Then remove everything but the capital letters in the first line and assign them to seperate variables. Then search the text for the amount these variables occur. so that would mean a = 2 and b = 4 then - 1 off each total and have that as result. This is what i have so far:I think i know what to do but i dont know... Any help would be appreciated :D Thanks
