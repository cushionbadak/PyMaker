This question already has an answer here:“Least Astonishment” and the Mutable Default Argument                    32 answers                Check out the following code:f(6)returns [6]while f(7)returns [6, 7]My question is why it doesn't use the default myList value when no value is specified.On the other hand, this code works fine f(6)returns [6]f(7)returns [7]Why in the later case it takes the default argument value but not in the former case?
The default argument is init at the point of defining the function. So for mutable type values, the function calls share the same variable. You can refer Why are default values shared between objects.
