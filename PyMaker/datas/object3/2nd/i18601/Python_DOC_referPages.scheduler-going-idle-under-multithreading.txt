I'm running Python 3.3.2, Win7/Pro, 64-bit and have some code in which I'm trying to run a scheduler in its own thread.   It appears that when the scheduler empties its working queue, it goes idle and does not resume even when a new entry is added to the queue.   It's not completely obvious to me from the docs that it is supposed to resume, but I would not expect user code (running in a thread outside the control of the scheduler) to have to worry about the possibility of that the scheduler has "finished".   I suspect there is something I'm not understanding and/or that I'm misusing it somehow, but I don't know where.In the example below, I solved the problem by replacing the scheduler's enter method with my own which checks the queue length and if it is zero, enters the request and then calls the scheduler's run method again.  This does seem to work, but definitely feels wrong.   Is there something I'm missing?
According to the docs,  will run all scheduled events with . The text is a little obscure, but I believe that  returns once all scheduled events are complete. If that is the case you will need to add more events and call  again, and given your reported results that seems to be what is happening.
