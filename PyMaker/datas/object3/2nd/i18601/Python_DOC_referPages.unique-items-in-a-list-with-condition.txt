Lastly the 3rd element must also be unique to the first element.In this previous question we solved a complicated method where for a transaction it details a purchased unit. I want to output other units in that course. If two transactions exist that relate to two units in one course it will display them a duplicate (or times each subsequent unit).The aim of this question it to ensure that this duplication is stopped. Because of the complication of this solution it has resulted in a series of question. Thanks for everyone that has helped so far.
