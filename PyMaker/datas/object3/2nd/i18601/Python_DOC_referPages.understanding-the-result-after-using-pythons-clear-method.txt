I don't understand the result of the code below. Why is the result ?But if I write as I have other result.
 prints the value returned by the call .  prints the object ; clearly two very different things, and so it's unsurprising that they produce different output.The documentation for dictionary types simply says of :Remove all items from the dictionary.That's what it does. It's not documented as returning anything, while all the documentation for all the methods that do return something are explicit about what they return (usually methods that alter a collection only return ). So there's no reason to expect it to return anything.
You are printing the return value of , which returns . It returns  because the  method clears the dictionary in place.By convention, any method on a default Python type that alters the mutable structure in-place, returns . The same applies to  or to , for example.Your second sample does not print the return value of . It prints the empty dictionary after you cleared it.
