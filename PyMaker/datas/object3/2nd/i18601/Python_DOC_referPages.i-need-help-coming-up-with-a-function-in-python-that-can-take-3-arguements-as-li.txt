This question already has an answer here:How to get all possible combinations of a listâ€™s elements?                    24 answers                What I have so far does pretty much nothing 
Use :Demo:
Or, for completeness, in the generator-fashion without an extra function:
Maybe there is a more pythonic way to do it :)
Since it looks like you were trying to come up with a recursive solution, here is the general form of it:This works for most kinds of iterables.  Demo:Recursion is difficult to understand at first, but the general form is:In this case,  is replaced by  in order to make a generator, which is more memory-friendly.  You still shouldn't expect this to be the best-performing solution, but I'm including it for completeness since "USE ITERTOOLS" doesn't end up teaching you much other than itertools is cool.
