Let us say I have a python method to get last synced changelist in p4. (The question itself is not related to p4 but only a basic python question)The caller of this method can either supply p4port which is a String or they could supply the p4 object in itself. My requirement is that if a "p4" object is supplied I want to run the method body without the with context, i.e, I dont want the enter or exit method called on the p4. This is because the responsibility of closing/entering p4 object lies now with the caller. If p4 object is not supplied the with syntax needs to be constructed in this program using the p4port string.Can someone tell me what is the best way of structuring this method? I want to change the body as less as possible. Basically something likeBut I am not sure what the best syntax is.
You can create a dummy context manager:
It's not directly possible,  is a compound statement and can't be embedded in expressions like this. But you can make use of the fact that your function also supports "borrowing" a resource:This approach even works if you have separate functions for the two paths (which may make sense in this example, as  is apparently not used when an existing  is passed in).
In Python 2 you'll probably want to create your own context manager, either a dummy one as @glglgl shows in his answer, or perhaps one that wraps up the optional creation of the P4Connection:If you were using Python 3.3 or later, you could instead use the awesome new  class:
