I would like to automate exporting csv files from vtk/vtu files. Right now, the steps I take are:open paraviewload in the pvd file that stores the information about all vtu files (one for each time steps in my PDE simulation)goto Properties tab on the left, hit 'apply'File->save Data...  provide a base file name, select 'points' and 'write all timesteps'this writes a csv file for each timesteps with the name basefilename#timestepno#.csvIs there a way to do this from the commandline (there's no X server on the computer that's doing the computations), eg using the python interface?
Try the following in either the Python Shell in the UI or using the pvpython or pvbatch Python executables.
I had a similar problem with pvtu files and solved it with the script below. I run the script using execfile("SCRIPTNAME") in Paraview -> Tools -> Python Shell. I hope this helps.-- Reinhard
