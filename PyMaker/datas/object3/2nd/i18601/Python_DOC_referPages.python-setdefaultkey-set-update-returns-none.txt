I'm having a problem with setdefault and unions not working like I expect them to.  My code looks like:The print output looks like:If I substitute the two lines below for setting k_rad:My output looks like this:If I understand setdefault, (which obviously I don't) the output should be the same,right?What am I missing?  Why am is  returning None?As pointed out below, the problem is that update returns None.  I really didn't understand how update and setdefault work together.  Since setdefault sets the dict to the default ifwe're creating a new dict element and returning the the hash and update updates the elementI didn't need the assignment.  All I really needed was:Thanks for the assistance!
 returns a set in your case. And  is an in-place operation, which means it changes the original set and returns None. So if you assign the result to a variable you just assign it a None.
