I want somthing similar to is alpha method. Should i write my own alpha method to check or can i use something inbuilt???Help is appreciated. Thank youUPDATES : on changing the loop  to  i dont get the error but i dont get any output as well.
you could use this function to encode email:or evenwithout enumerate:
You can use  module if the string does not contain email only.
I assume you want to check if a part of the string passes or fails the isalpha() test.  That isn't what your code is doing.While there may be better ways to solve your problem, you can also make your code work.  Hopefully that is useful.indeces is an integer, as is -1, so the result of what you are applying isalpha to is an int, as the error says.  This doesn't work either.  That is making a string out of the int, so str(2) results in "2", which isn't the test you want either.If you want to check the character, just index into the string, like so:
