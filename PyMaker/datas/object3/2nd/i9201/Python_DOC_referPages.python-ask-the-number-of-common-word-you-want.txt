Natural Text
I'm quite new with the functionnalities of Python. And I need to know if someone can help me ?My problem is : I have to create a program where someone can tap the number of most common words he/her wants. I don't know if I'm understandable. But for example : I need to use "x=input("enter a number : ")then the user can tap one number and the program will say : "here are the x most common word in your text". Here my program : I know I can have the number I want by using most_common(), but I would like the program to ask it and not putting it in the code. Thank you very much in advance
I think you're looking to, for example, return the 5 most common words if the user enters .   can actually do this for you, if you pass a number to it as an argument.
