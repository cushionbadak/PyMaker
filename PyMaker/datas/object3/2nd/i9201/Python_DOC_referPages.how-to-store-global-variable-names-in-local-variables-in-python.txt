So I am trying to create a function that will let me simply call the function, and I give it 10 values, and a variable, and it will change that variable into one of the values provided, randomly.This however tells me the following:
In Python, you don't usually modify input parameters. I know this is standard in C, but it's easier to return the value and assign you variable to the output of the function instead:
One way to do what you are trying to achieve is by Not passing your global variable  as parameter in your function.EDITAs you have pointed out that you want to use this function for other variables as well, to do that, you can simply return  and call your  function to change the value of as many variables as you want.following code snippet is used to change the value of two variables, one is global variable  and other is 
For  values you should use a list. You also need to write less code, so it scales better. And you should try to avoid global variables... Reasons why you can find in the global internet. For this example you even could save a method definition.
