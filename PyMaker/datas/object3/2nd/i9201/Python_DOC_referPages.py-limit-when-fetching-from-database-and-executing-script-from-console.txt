This subject can be already covered. If so, apologizes for that. I have a problem when fetching rows from database (with "for" and "while" loops) and executing the script from console.I need to fetch a huge amount of rows from database and I'm building a script so that i can insert the user ID's and i'll get the account ID's of the clients and the statuses.I have realized that when I run the script from Eclipse, full output is fetched from DB. When I run the script from console, there is a limit of rows. So, i'd like to know if i have a "while row is not None" loop... why my row becomes None if there are more rows in database??Also: I need to solve this issue. No matter how. I'd prefer to not load the full list to a local file (if possible). But, if there is no other way... okay, please help!! This is my example.
Without modifying too much your code you could try using  provided by the  module like this:But looking at the source code of  my guess is that it won't change the situation much since it does more or less what you were doing explicitly in your code.What would probably work better is to add rows one at a time to  instead of fetching all rows and looping through them to add them. Something like:You don't need to transform the row elements to string values since  does that internally.But it is possible to take advantage of different features to simplify your code and to make it more pythonic:In this version:I have used the  to do some of the substitutions (some may say that's a tad overkill but it could be useful to you in the future)A  connection implements the context manager that provides you directly with a cursor.Since a  cursor can provide an iterator we can use it with  to go through all the rows even if we don't care for the result.
