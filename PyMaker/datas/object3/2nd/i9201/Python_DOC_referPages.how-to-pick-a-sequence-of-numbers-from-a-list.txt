I have a startnumber and an endnumber.From these numbers I need to pick a sequence of numbers.The sequences is not always the same.Example:I need to create a list of numbers with a certain sequencep.e.3 numbers yes, 2 numbers no, 3 numbers yes, 2 numbers no.. etcExpected output:(at the end there are only 2 numbers remaining (31 and 32))Is there a simple way in python to select sequences of line from a range of numbers?

Extrapolating this out:As alluded to in the docstring of example_filter, the  for get_data is really just expecting a  or  based on a call. You could change this easily to be of the signature:So that you can determine whether to take or leave based on the value (or even the index), but it currently takes no arguments and just functions as a less magic  (since it should return its value on call, not on iteration)
 gives required list.In , is sequence to pick/skip from,/ are no. of elements to pick/skip, is to be set  ifsuch behavior is desired. returns chunks of n elements, itignores last group if it has lessthan min_chunk elements.It is derived from stuff given inhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/8991553/1921546.Demo:An alternative implementation of :All things used are documented here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.compress
