I'm attempting to read in a line of integer values separated by spaces and then perform a few simple statistical calculations on them. An example line of input looks like so:I decided to use the  module from the Python Standard Library documented here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.htmlHere is it in action:Upon executing, I get the following output from :And so it seems the first call to  is consuming all of the elements in the  list before the call to  can use them. (I do see the output from the first  statement from , so the call to  worked fine.)The input handling doesn't seem to have any issues. I have the following code that works as expected:Outputting the following from :Nothing in the standard library documentation mentions these functions consuming the parameter passed in. Each of these standard functions should only return a value and not alter the list itself.Is there something specific to Python where a list can only be read or iterated on once? Or is there possibly a quirk with both of the compilers I've tried?
 produces an iterable, and iteration over that can only be done once. If you want to be able to re-use the result, produce a list first from the  results first:You could also use a list comprehension:Demo, using :Your input of 3 unique values has no mode, hence the last exception.
