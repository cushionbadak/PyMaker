So, I'm still sort of new to programming, and I'm trying to format the output of some arrays in Python. I'm finding it hard to wrap my head around some of the aspects of formatting. I have a few arrays that I want to print, in the format of a table.I want the output to look like this: (where the column widths are a little more than the max length in that column)I tried to do this:but (I think) that won't print the headings in the right place?I tried this:but that prints the data of each object in columns, rather than rows.Help is appreciated! Thanks.
Just adding the extra formatting:The parts in the curly braces are part of python's new character formatting features, while the TABs serve as delimiters. In sum, the  method looks for those curly braces inside the string part to determine what values inside the container go where and how those values should be formatted. For example, in the case of the headers, the following is what's happening:We use the asterisk () in front of the list to  the elements inside that list.The first curly brace is for the string "Name", and it is formatted with  which means that it is adjusted to the left and padded with extra space characters, if the length of the string is less than 10. In essence, it will print all characters in a given string and add extra spaces to the right of that string.The second curly brace is for "Age" and is formatted with .The third curly brace is for "Favourite Colour" and is formatted with .All those strings are delimited with the TAB character.The combination of the above steps inside the print function yields:I hope this proves useful.
You'd print the heading on its own (the one with name, age, favourite colour). Then you use the code you have, but with:You might also look into the  package for nicely formatted tables.
Use zip(*iterables):
Jacob Krall is perfectly correct about using  to combine your lists. Once you've done that, though, if you want your columns to align nicely (assuming you are using Python 3.x) then take a look at the  method which is available with strings and as part of the Python  function. This allows you to specify field widths in your output.
