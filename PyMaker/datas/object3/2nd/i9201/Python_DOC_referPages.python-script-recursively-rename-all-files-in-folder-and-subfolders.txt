Hi I have  a number of different files that need to be renamed to something else. I got this far but I want to have it so that I can have many items to replace and their corresponding replacements rather than type each one out, run the code then retype it again. UPDATE* Also I need the rename to only change part of the file not the whole thing so if there was a "Cat5e_1mBend1bottom50m2mBend2top-Aqeoiu31" it would just change it to "'Cat5e50m1mBED_50m2mBE2U-Aqeoiu31"
Is this wath you want?Check if this is wath you want!!!
The first thing you'd need is a  for the replacements, then a small change in your code:In the name_map, the  (string to the left of "") is the name of the file in your filesystem, and the  (string to the right of the "") is the name you want to use.
