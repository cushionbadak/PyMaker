So in my code I usually do this to convert string to int, but I was wondering if there was a less clumsy way, because it feels kind of long.Maybe this is just how it has to be, but thanks in advance if you have any ideas.
Given that you're trying to convert a string to an int, I'd suggest you use the  function.Your python code would look like:This 3-letter function does what you need in a short way. Actually in other languages like Java, the syntax is almost twice as long.Java example
