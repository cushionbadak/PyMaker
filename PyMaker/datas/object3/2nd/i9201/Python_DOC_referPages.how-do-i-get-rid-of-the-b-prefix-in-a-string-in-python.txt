Natural Text
A bunch of the tweets I am importing are having this issue where they read I gather the  indicates it is a byte. But this is proving problematic because in my CSV files that I end up writing, the  doesn't go away and is interferring in future code. Is there a simple way to remove this  prefix from my lines of text? Keep in mind, I seem to need to have the text encoded in utf-8 or tweepy has trouble pulling them from the web. Here's the link content I'm analyzing:https://www.dropbox.com/s/sjmsbuhrghj7abt/new_tweets.txt?dl=0Code AttemptError
you need to decode the  of you want a string:
It is just letting you know that the object you are printing is not a string, rather a byte object as a byte literal. People explain this in incomplete ways, so here is my take.Consider creating a byte object by typing a byte literal (literally defining a byte object without actually using a byte object e.g. by typing b'') and converting it into a string object encoded in utf-8. (Note that converting here means decoding)You see that we simply apply the  function.Bytes in Pythonhttps://docs.python.org/3.3/library/stdtypes.html#bytesString literals are described by the following lexical definitions:https://docs.python.org/3.3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals
You need to decode it to convert it to a string. Check the answer hereabout bytes literal in python3.
I got it done by only encoding the output using utf-8. Here is the code examplei.e: do not encode when collecting data from api, encode the output (print or write) only. 
On python 3.6 with django 2.0, decode on a byte literal does not works as expected. Yeah i get the right result when i print it, but the b'value' is still there even if you print it right.This is what im encodingThis is what im decoding:This is what django 2.0 says :Encodes a bytestring in base64 for use in URLs, stripping any trailing equal signs.Decodes a base64 encoded string, adding back any trailing equal signs that might have been stripped.This is my account_activation_email_test.html fileThis is my console response:Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"MIME-Version: 1.0Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitSubject: Activate Your MySite AccountFrom: webmaster@localhostTo: testuser@yahoo.comDate: Fri, 20 Apr 2018 06:26:46 -0000Message-ID: <152420560682.16725.4597194169307598579@Dash-U>Hi testuser,Please click on the link below to confirm your registration:as you can see expected test in console:After investigating it seems like its related to python 3.My workaround was quite simple:i receive it as uidb64 on my activate function:and  voila:now it works fine. :)
****How to remove b' ' chars which is decoded string in python ****
Although the question is very old, I think it may be helpful to who is facing the same problem. Here the texts is a string like below:Thus you can not remove b by encoding it because it's not a byte. I did the following to remove it.which will give
