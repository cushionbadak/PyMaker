This question already has an answer here:How can I read inputs as numbers?                    19 answers                I'm learning python and working on exercises. One of them is to code a voting system to select the best player between 23 players of the match using lists. I'm using .My code:I getTypeError: '<=' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'But I don't have any strings here, all variables are integers.
ChangetoYou are getting the input from the console as a string, so you must cast that input string to an  object in order to do numerical operations.
If you're using Python3.x  will return a string,so you should use  method to convert string to integer.Python3 InputIf the prompt argument is present, it is written to standard output  without a trailing newline. The function then reads a line from input,  converts it to a string (stripping a trailing newline), and returns  that. When EOF is read, EOFError is raised.By the way,it's a good way to use   if you want to convert string to int: Hope this helps.
When you use the input function it automatically turns it into a string. You need to go:which turns the input into a int type value
input() by default takes the input in form of strings.vote takes a string input (suppose '4','5',etc) and becomes uncomparable.Correct way is : will convert the input to integer ('4' to 4 or '5' to 5 depending on the input)
