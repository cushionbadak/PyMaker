In python, I am currently experimenting with what I can do with  command. I tried to open a file, and got an error message. Here's my code:My error message was:I looked on the website to try and find some answers and I saw a post where somebody mentioned . 1. I'm not sure what this is and 2. I don't know how to use it, and thats why I've come here.
Your user don't have the right permissions to  the file, since you used  without specifying a mode.Since you're using Windows, you should read a little more about File and Folder Permissions.Also, if you want to play with your file permissions, you should  it, choose  and select  tab.Or if you want to be a little more hardcore, you can run your script as admin.SO Related Questions:Example1Example2
The problem here is your user doesn't have proper rights/permissions to open the file this means that you'd need to grant some administrative privileges to your python ide before you run that command.As you are a windows user you just need to right click on python ide => select option 'Run as Administrator' and then run your command.And if you are using the command line to run the codes, do the same open the command prompt with admin rights. Hope it helps
If you have this problem in Windows 10, and you know you have premisions on folder (You could write before but it just started to print exception PermissionError recently).. You will need to install Windows updates... I hope someone will help this info.
