I imported a CSV using Pandas and one column was read in with string entries. Examining the entries for this Series (column), I see that they should actually be lists. For example:I would like to extract the list elements from the strings. So far, I've tried the following chain:(all on one line, of course).and this gives me back my desired list elements in one column.['"entry11"']['"entry21", "entry22"']['"entry31", "entry32"']My question: Is there a more efficient way of doing this? This seems like a lot of strain for something that should be a little easier.
