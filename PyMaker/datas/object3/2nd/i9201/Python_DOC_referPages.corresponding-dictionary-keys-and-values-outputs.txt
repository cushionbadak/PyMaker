This question already has an answer here:Python dictionary: are keys() and values() always the same order?                    8 answers                As a dictionary is not ordered the output is also not ordered:But are the  and  outputs above always in corresponding order?
The answer is yes.From python 2 documentation:If items(), keys(), values(), iteritems(), iterkeys(), and itervalues() are called with no intervening modifications to the dictionary, the lists will directly correspond. This allows the creation of (value, key) pairs using zip(): pairs = zip(d.values(), d.keys()). The same relationship holds for the iterkeys() and itervalues() methods: pairs = zip(d.itervalues(), d.iterkeys()) provides the same value for pairs. Another way to create the same list is pairs = [(v, k) for (k, v) in d.iteritems()].And from python 3 documentationIf keys, values and items views are iterated over with no intervening modifications to the dictionary, the order of items will directly correspond
