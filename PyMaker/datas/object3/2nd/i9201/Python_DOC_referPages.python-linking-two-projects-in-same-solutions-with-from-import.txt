In the same solution I have my project which imports SQL and my game project.Unfortunately when I type "from highscore import *" it doesn't recognize it in the game file. Am I missing something important?
It is considered bad practice to use .You're better off importing only the things you need with  or .What are the “best practices” for using import in a module?In general, don’t use from modulename import *. Doing so clutters the importer’s namespace, and makes it much harder for linters to detect undefined names.
