(See this question for what the  means)I need to construct the include path of  to compile something (i.e. ) against the virtualenv. I can get the  using  or .How do I get the  to construct the include path?EDIT: I tried  but that is pointing to , which is unhelpful for this.
The easiest way to get the include path is to use the  function:This path is adjusted for virtualenvs already. For scripting purposes outside of Python, you can either print the path directly:or get all  data by running the module as a script:then parse the output that dumps to stdout.Other than that, if you only want the executable name (with the  included), you can get that from the  variable; this includes the  suffix:As of Python 3.2, you can also use the  variable; it is set to  in this case:Also see PEP 3149.For earlier Python versions, the various flags that influence the suffixes are available still via the aforementioned  module as configuration variables:Note that ubuntu merely compiles multiple binaries and adjusts the executable name to reflect the configuration option chosen; on other systems the ABI flags are not necessarily reflected in the executable name.
