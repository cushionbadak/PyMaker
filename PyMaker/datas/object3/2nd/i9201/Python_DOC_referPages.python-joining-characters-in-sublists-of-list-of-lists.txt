I have a huge list of lists, this is a section of it:I did the following operation on the entire list of lists:because I would like to have unique information in the sublists. This returned the following:Which is great, since it did become unique, but now I need them to be in their original from, without being broken up character-by-character.Is there any way to re-join them inside the sublists?
Instead of , use .But you can just put the strings themselves in a set instead of calling tuple: .
If the ordering of the contents of the inner lists does not matter, you can turn them into a set, which is a an un-ordered collection of unique elements, and then turn that set back into a list:Prints:
as you already mentioned: you can  the strings:for your whole list you could do this:note that there is no point in creating a list of single characters; a string itself behaves exactly like a list of characters (an immutable one, though); so you could directoy do this:that will not preserve the order though...
