I am trying to write a function that takes a user inputted list, and transforms it into a string that separates each value inside the list with a comma, and the last value in the list with "and". For example, the list ['cats', 'dogs', 'rabbits', 'bats'] would be transformed to: 'cats, dogs, rabbits, and bats'.My code works if I assign a list to a variable and then pass the variable to my newString function, but if I pass a user input to my function, it will treat every character in the user input as a separate list value.So my question is, how can I tell Python that I want input() to be read as a list. Is this even possible? I am very new to Python and programming in general, so Lists and Tuples is about as far as I know so far. I am learning dictionaries now. My code is printed below, thanks. 
 always gives you just a string. You can analyze that string depending on how the user is supposed to enter the list.For example, the user can enter it space separated like . Then you doYou can also split on  or any delimiter you like.
If you want to read a list literal from user input, use  to parse it:
You could build a list from the input and use your current working code to format it as you want.
