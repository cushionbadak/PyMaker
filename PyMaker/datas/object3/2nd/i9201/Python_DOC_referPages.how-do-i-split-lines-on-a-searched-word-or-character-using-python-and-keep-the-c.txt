Natural Text
I am trying to append or put the remaining words into the next line when I have searched for the string or character already.For example I have a file that has a paragraph like below:I want to search for the  and have the result be like this:So, whenever it sees a forwardslash  in line, it will move the remaining string or text in that line to the next line. I want to gather them into a list like format so that I can do further processing. 
You can try this again. By replacing the character to next line
Here's one way to split up your text into a list of lines.outputTo make sure that each line has exactly the contents that we want we can print its representation:outputNote that a single backslash is shown as a pair of backslashes in the representation. Similarly, to put a backslash into a normal Python string literal you need to use two backslashes, egI didn't need to do that in the  string literal because I used a raw string.To read  from a text file instead of using a string literal, you just need to use the file  method, like this:outputWhen you've finished processing the  list and wish to save it to a new file, the simplest way is to pass a file argument to print. Eg,I should also mention that to use the  function in Python 2 instead of the  statement, then you need to import it. To do that, put this line at the top of the script, before other imports:Actually, it's a good idea to tell the interpreter to use Python 3 style division as well: 
Have you considered doing this, for example you have a paragraph that the second sentence has a charcter of '/'.So that the line that starts with the '/' will be in next line.
