i am retrieving some results from a mysql database and they come in a form separated by brackets. I want to remove the brackets, i have used the strip function but that will only work for when i have one result to display. The code below will only remove brackets for search results that only have one element. 
If you want to simply remove all brackets from a result, you can use replace() method. The syntax is string.replace(string_to_replace, string_to_replace_with).eg:This will need to be done for each bracket type, I believe. So another round for "[]".Note that after you remove all brackets, splitting a result set to individual rows might be hard if the brackets are the delimiters.
After some playing around I found that the results you get back from a mysql query aren't string but tuples so simply trying to remove the brackets doesn't work.Here's is my example of how I dealt with it, starting with the query:I can then loop through the results and print each one like this:Which gives some results like this:But I wanted to separate each of those results into both fields so you can do something like this:which will give you output like this:Rather than just printing these out the plan for my code is to create a json type dictionary that I can easily search.
