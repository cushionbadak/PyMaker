 is a method, so  gives you that error.If you wanted to get the result of that method instead, call the method:Note, I replaced  with  here, you are setting a new attribute after all. I also renamed the attribute, because otherwise your  method will get really confused too, causing a second error that looks a lot the same, as  is still a method too. This necessitates fixing the  method to:So the completed code looks like this:You can avoid re-defining the  method altogether by using class inheritance; make  a specialised version of :You get the  implementation along too, so your final  will output something a little more interesting.You could also make  a property; properties are methods that are automatically called for you each time you access the attribute:In this case, I'd not use either a method or a property however. There is no need to make  hidden here. Just replace it with a direct attribute:That's because neither the method nor the property do anything more than pass along the  attribute. You may as well just directly access it.    Last but not least, you create a  instance from a  instance, then another  instance from the first  instance, so your final instance has added 0.5 to 4 twice:
