I'm trying to create a simple mapping class where when keys are 1-1, e.g. . I'm running into an error when I'm checking to see if the class is equal to a value I enter, I should be getting  but I keep getting . I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, my code is below, any help would be appreciated. 
Your  class has to implement the  magic method in order for  to work properly. Assuming that two  are equal if the  is equal, you can try somehting like this:Without this,  will fall back to checking whether those are the same instance, i.e. what  does.Often, when you implement , you would also implement the  method, so the two are consistent. Again, you could simply delegate to  for the hash, but  is not hashable (for good reasons, see below), but you could hash the items:Without , you could e.g. not use your  class as key inside another dictionary. However, this setup is problematic, as the  is mutable, so  might change between uses, making it impossible to retrieve the  from the  or  at a later time.
