I want to have code that does something like thisRight now the final method does not work as I do not know how I can have access to both self and cls. How do I implement this?
As a very brief review,  refers to a current instance of the class while  variables are attached to the class itelf i.e., shared among every instance. Here are some references to help with this, and how I got to your solution:https://stackoverflow.com/a/25577642/5557662Python datamodel docsI modified your sample code to illustrate the difference and included a solution: and  are variables saved to the class. You can access any class variable without an instance via  which represents the name space.Since class variables become a part of every instance, you can just call  to access them. Alternatively, you can explicitly call  to make it clear where the intended variable is actually stored.
You could just do  - any attributes not found on the instance will be automatically looked up in the class.To make it explicit that you're expecting the attribute to come from the class itself, use .
