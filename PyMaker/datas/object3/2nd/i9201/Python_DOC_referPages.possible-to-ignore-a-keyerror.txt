I have a simple bit of code that goes into aws and grabs some data then prints it out to consoleMyCode:I get an error because one or more of my subnets don't have tags:print("Subnet ID: ", subnet['Tags']) KeyError: 'Tags'I'm not expecting every subnet to have tags so is there a way to simply ignore the lack of tags and just print empty or simply move on? sorry if this sounds like a silly question, I've searched google and found some ideas but they look a little advanced for what I have.
