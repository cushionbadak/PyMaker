I have a sizable array (8000ish entires) in python which is the edge list of a graph. part of the array looks like:The string pairs pairs of vertices which have an edge between them.Is there a efficient way to import this array into mathematica, so that it can read it? I know mathematica strings are surrounded by . Can I just export this array in a different format out of python, or do I have to go in an re-parse the thing as a string?Where my code looks like:second to last print call makes an extra comma, but i'm not worrying about that.Thanks in advance.
Since your data is clean, i.e., it contains no double-quotes or square brackets we can use the  method to translate Python's native string representation of the list into Mathematica format.To use  we first need to construct a translation table, using the  method.outputThis is faster than using Python loops with Python string formatting, since almost all the work is being done by code that's written in C, so it runs at C speed.FWIW, this can also be done in Python 2, with a minor change. In Python 2, there's no  method. Instead, you need to use the  helper function.If you'd like each row to be on a separate line you'll need to pre-process each row. This will necessarily be a little slower, but the speed difference will be hardly noticeable with 8000 rows.output
