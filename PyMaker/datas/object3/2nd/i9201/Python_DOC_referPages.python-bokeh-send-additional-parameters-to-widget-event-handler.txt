I want to send additional data to a bokeh event handler (e.g. an on_change or on_click method).  A minimal example that increments or decrements an integer is below (I run this app with 'bokeh serve --show app.py).  I had to write separate event handlers that do almost identical things in this example.  To write this app with just one event handler function, I need to pass additional data or the event handler must know the calling object.  How do I do that?
The standard   facility that is built into python works fine with Bokeh callbacks.
