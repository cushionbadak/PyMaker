I have a list of lists of words called wordlist as follows:I want to find the common elements in all the sub-lists. Hence, my desired output of the above list should be:In order to achieve this, I created sets using the below code:The set look like this:There can be any number of words per list, and there can be any number of lists. So I can end up with uneven sets of any number. I know I can compare two sets using the intersection methods, but how do I compare across multiple sets to return only the common items?
You are using  incorrectly. You may use it like:This could be written in one line as:The value hold by  will be:Here is the solution giving same result with the slightly performance efficient approach:Since  accepts all the iterables, there is no need to type-cast all the sub-lists to set.
The easiest way is to use map() to convert the inputs to sets, and then use set.intersection to find their commonalities:
try this way in order to get common elements:
