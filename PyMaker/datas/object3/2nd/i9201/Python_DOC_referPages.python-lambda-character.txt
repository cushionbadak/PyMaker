Natural Text
I am trying to write a function that includes a parameter lambda as a character. However, lambda is a tool in python so how do I write lambda as a character in python without having it be the tool.
If you want a function such as... you cannot do this.  lambda is a reserved word to introduce a lambda function, and you cannot use it for something else.If, instead, you want to use the Greek character:... then you can do this.  The above code works in Python 3.*, which defaults to UTF-8Under Python 2.*, you have to declare your program as using a different character set (the default is an English-centric character set).  See here for encoding details.
