I have a program running on the raspberry pi, where there are 2 inputs, a 1Hz signal and a 50Hz signal. I am recording the time elapsed from the rising edge of the 50Hz signal to that of the 1Hz signal and then calculating the phase difference.  I want the key to represent the current time of the rising edge of 50Hz waveforms and the value to be the phase difference relative to the 1Hz signal.Here is my code:The last line I presumed would place each recorded rising edge time as a key and the corresponding phase difference as the value.  But when I print the list there 50 key/value pairs in dictionary as expected but they do not match the printed rising edge times.  Is there a proper way to place variables from this while loop into a dictionary?
I think you are printing the datetime value:then you calculate it again and save it in a variable:These two times can be different. Changing it to:should work and you should get matching printed and saved times.
I believe @user3811623 has the right answer. I also wanted to point out - As @JerryStratton mentioned, you do not change the value of x just by applying x.isoformat(), for that you want to assign the value back to x as well - Dictionary keys are not sorted in chronological order, for keeping key entering order you want ordereddict - https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDictI find it curious that you're getting 50 valuess in your dictionary, as you initiate it inside the loop, thus resetting it. For example, this- withyields    Not sure how you're getting to 50 keys here.
