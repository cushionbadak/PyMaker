I want to split the following strings to get each attribute seperately:I know that all of the attributes end with either ", '" or ", \\'"Initially I was just using two string.spilt()These both did the job, but I am working with a large amount of data and both of these are very general and the pattern was matched somewhere in the data it wasn't supposed to.So I tried a re.split instead:The regular expressions are meant to find the first ", \'" and the split on this if it is followed by characters a single quote and a colon, its meant to catch what follows the ", \'".reg_split_no_esc split on the first split condition but not for anymore, the other pattern is just not working.Any help would be really appreciatedEDIT:My first regular expression works but it only splits the first element and leaves the rest un-split so it looks like this:
Just for completeness sake I figured out the answer, it was the lookahead assertionThe final pattern looks like: Cheers
