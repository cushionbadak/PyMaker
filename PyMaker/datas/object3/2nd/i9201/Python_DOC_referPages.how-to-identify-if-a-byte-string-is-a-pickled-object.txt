How to identify if a byte string object is a pickled object.For example, in the below dictionary, how can I identify that  is a pickled object and that the other objects are not?
Although there are ways to tell whether it is likely that a stream is a pickle stream (for instance the first byte is always , followed by the protocol number, here , the last byte is also always a ), in general it is hard to know that for sure (it could be coincidence that the first byte is  in a random string). So you better simply try to unpickle it and see if that works out:The above method will return  if the stream is a pickle stream,  if it is not, and throw an exception if  throws an exception (out of memory, etc.).
