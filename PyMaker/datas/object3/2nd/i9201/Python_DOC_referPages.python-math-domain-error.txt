This question already has an answer here:Im trying to write a program with the quadratic formula in it and i can not figure out why i keep getting an error [duplicate]                    1 answer                I am making a program that solves the quadratic equation and prints the roots. Before I get to the main program, I am just trying to make the square root work. The error I am getting says "math domain error". If someone could give me some help as to why it is not working that would be great. 
It's known that gives that error when you try to use it with a negative number. The result probably is a complex number, and as stated in the comments by 098799, "math.sqrt won't give you complex numbers".Instead of using:Try using:It works with cmath, because it provides access to mathematical functions for complex numbers.
