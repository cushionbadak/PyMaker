You could use : returns a dictionary containing the amount of times the letters repeat in the string. We then iterate through the dictionary and create all the repeated strings ('d', 'dd', 'ddd', etc) for one term. 
itertools.groupby can tell you the number of consecutive chars. After that for each group you have the char repeated upto that number.
here is one way using regex:

The following will do what you want. I don't know if its efficient compared to other solutions though.Timings
