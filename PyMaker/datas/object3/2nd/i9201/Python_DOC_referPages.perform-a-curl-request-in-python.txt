I am trying to perform a curl request in python. My code is the following:Howver I am receiving in the second line the following error:TypeError: expected string or buffer (payload = json.loads(open("request.json")))Any idea what this error is about?
You are opening file  this will return . need string.you can try  will return file content instead of file object.If you dont want to use  you can directly use  instead of This is what I triedTry to read same file.
expected string or bufferopen() returns a file. And there's a difference between  and  (the second accepts a string, not a file) Besides, I don't think the  is necessary 
You are using  but attempting to load a file. You need to use  instead.
