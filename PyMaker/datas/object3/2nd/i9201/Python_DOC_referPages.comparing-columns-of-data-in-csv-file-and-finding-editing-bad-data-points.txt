I am working on a code to perform some data analysis.  I would like to compare the numbers in the columns of data.The constraint I would like to use is if the column with "POA"  is > 900 then the columns A401 A402 AND A403 must be > 7.  If this condition isn't met I would like to do something with the data so it can easily be found.  Also don't want to include the VT column in the test condition.Would really appreciate some help if someone can point me in the right direction.sample of data I am inputting as .CSV
Let's say you have a file  with the contents:Then you can process it with Python like this:Then  would contain:
Use https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html to read your CSV data into an iterable object.I'm guessing that you mean if POA is >900 and A0401, A0402 and A0403 are > 7, otherwise you want to do something else with the data?The other meaning of your question could be that if POA is >900 then you want to set A0401, A0402 and A0403 to more than 7, otherwise, you want to do something else.In which caseFor your do something, I'm not entirely sure what you mean by you want the data to be easily found, but I'll assume that you want to highlight it somehow. If you want it to be easily found you could add another column to your CSV data. Something like, 'flagged', which will be set to 0 by default.When you find an exception, simply set flagged to 1, then you can look through the data and find all of the rows with flagged set to 1 to find your exceptions.
