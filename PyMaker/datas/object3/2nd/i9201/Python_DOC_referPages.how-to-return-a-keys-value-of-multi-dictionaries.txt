I have this codeI am trying to let a user input a number from 1 to 399.when I used , I got a KeyError '2'2 is the number I did input. so, I passed the input of  to another variable called , but I got the same problem.in the live environment of python (idle), when I write , I get  instead of the error above. So, what is the problem exactly and how can I solve it?
that's because your input is a , not an  (using python 3), so you're actually doing  which fails.will fix that.note that if the user enters "303" you'll also get a key error. So better do  for your example (you also have to check for !=0 since Roman digits don't support it :))Aside  should be My fix proposal with full implementation of number build (also works with python 2):
The documentation for  already explains this:The function then reads a line from input, converts it to a string (stripping a trailing newline), and returns that.So your  is a string but your keys in the dictionary are numbers. So it can't find any match (because ) and produces the .As already mentioned by @Jean-Fran√ßoisFabre you need to convert it to an integer:Or better reverse the string and then map each digit to an integer:For example with input  this returns If you use indexing then you need to change your dictionaries a bit:I added the number  to all of them because then you don't need to special case them and you can just go throw these:The  reverses the resulting string again before joining all parts.Sample:The code I used was:
