I'm setting up a prod environment on a new Mac server that should mirror my dev environment.  The job runs without a hitch on my dev computer, but on the server I'm getting this traceback:This job is being run through the  terminal in the  App.  I've checked the  in the  terminal, as well as on the machine itself.  Everything says .  I've also checked the encoding in my  database, and that is also set to .  Here is my  statement for the file that the  is writing to:I'm a little stumped as to where to even start to track down this error since all the default encodings seem to be correct...  I should mention that this file is then copied to a  database using the  command after, so the file should be written in a mode compatible with that.
You did not specify an encoding for your file, so the default codec is used for your system. Currently that is ASCII. See the  documentation:In text mode, if encoding is not specified the encoding used is platform dependent:  is called to get the current locale encoding.Specify a different codec instead. UTF-8 would work: doesn't apply here; that's merely the default for unqualified  calls.
