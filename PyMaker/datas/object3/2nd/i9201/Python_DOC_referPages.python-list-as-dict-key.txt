I have the following:I see the following object has  attributeQ:even though it has  attribute, still it cannot be used as key.Why?
Did you try looking at the value of the attribute?Just because something has a  attribute doesn't mean it's hashable; the  attribute has to be a callable that actually hashes it (instead of, e.g., raising an exception).
