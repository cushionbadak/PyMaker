My problem is, whenever I use thr.results() the program acts like its running on one thread. But when i don't you use thr.results() it will use x threadsso if I remove my if statement, it will run on 10 threads, if I have it in there it will act like its on one 1 thread
That's because  will wait for the future to complete:Return the value returned by the call. If the call hasn’t yet completed then this method will wait up to timeout seconds. If the call hasn’t completed in timeout seconds, then a concurrent.futures.TimeoutError will be raised. timeout can be an int or float. If timeout is not specified or None, there is no limit to the wait time.When you have  within a loop you submit a task, then wait it to complete and then submit another one so there can be only one task running at a time.Update You can either store the returned futures to a list and iterate over them once you have submitted all the task. Other option is to use :Output:
