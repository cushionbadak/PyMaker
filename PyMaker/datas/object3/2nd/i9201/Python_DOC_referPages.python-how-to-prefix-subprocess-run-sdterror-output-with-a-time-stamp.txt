I want to prefix the sdterror output from subprocess.run with a time stamp, unfortunately I have not been about to figure out how to do so.This part of my shell script runs FFMPEG and writes the output to a logfile :I have done a lot of research into this and I can't seem to find a solution, from what I have been reading the .run is the recommended approach for running subprocess.I know how to create the time stamp:Can someone explain how i would prefix the time stamp to each new line from the subprocess.run() call?EDIT:Just to be clear I want a timestamp at the start of each line, here is what I am getting using logHere is my  code:I think the issue is that  is a string and I cannot append by lines, is this the case?BTW i am using python 3.5
You want to log each execution in a separate, timestamp-named file.First, notice that it's better to avoid  in file names. Windows cannot accept that, and you want portability. So I changed the format.Basically, it's simple:compute the timestamp to capture start daterun the processwrite the logfile with the timestamp in the namecode:
This, https://docs.python.org/2/howto/logging-cookbook.html, should answer your questions - it mentions logging from different processes, timestamps, etc.
