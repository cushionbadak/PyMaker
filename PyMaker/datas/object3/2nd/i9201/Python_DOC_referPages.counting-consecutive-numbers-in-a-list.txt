Sorry if this has already been asked; I couldn't find a question that was similar enough to mine to where I could develop a satisfactory answer.I'm pretty new to python (3.4.3). I am trying to add elements to an empty list using a for loop by comparing the elements of another list to the next element in that second list (terrible explanation; I apologize).Here is my code so far:Basically, I want to add to list[] values that represent how the length of consecutive blocks of numbers in random_list[].I expect my output in this case to look like this:As in, there is one singular number, followed by 4 consecutive numbers, followed by one singular number, followed by one singular number, followed by 4 consecutive numbers.I've tried this many different ways, and I have gotten the function to build a list, but all the elements are 1's...Thanks for your help!
You could take an approach like this: 
There are a few problems with your code, among others undefined variables, or using an element  from the list as the index of that element, but also you will get an index error for the last element, and you never add the last count to the result list.Instead, I'd suggest using the  recipe for iterating pairs of elements from the list, and using  to access and modify the counts already in the list.Alternatively, you could subtract the index from each element. This way, successive consecutive elements will end up being the same element. Now, you can just use  to group and count those elements.
The following code fixes it up. You were iterating over the elements of the list itself instead of the counter you were referencing.Returns this:
Here's my versionSay you had a list of numbers, which you want to loop through and count the consecutive streaks:You could do something like this:
