I'm quite a beginner with python.I'm trying to remove all the 'noone: 0' from this dictionary, so it will look the same as below but without any of the 'noone: 0':I searched and found all the ways I should be implementing it, but cannot find a method that works. I tried this to no avail:
I believe this would do what you want.What you have here (G) is indeed a dictionary, but more specifically, it's a dictionary whose values are also dictionaries.  thus, when we iterate through all the keys in G (), each key's corresponding value () is a dictionary.  You can see this for yourself if you try running:So what you really want to do is pop from each dictionary in G.  That is, for each G[i], you want to remove 'noone' from those "sub"-dictionaries, not the main top one.P.S.: if you really want to take advantage of python's convenience, you can even write simplyBy using the second argument into pop, you don't even have to check to see if 'noone' is a key in G[i] first because the pop method will not raise an exception. (if you tried this two-liner without the second argument, you'd get an error for all sub-dicts that don't have 'noone' in them).
Iterate over the values and pop the key from each value:
I would go with dictionary comprehension:
