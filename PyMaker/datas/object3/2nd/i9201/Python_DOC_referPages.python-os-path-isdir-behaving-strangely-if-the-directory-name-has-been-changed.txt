I am seeing a very strange behavior coming from these two commands:versus the following command when I run it in a terminal on the path above:When I run this to check:I get False instead, although  actually has a subdirectory listed in it!The first one returns me nothing while the second one returns me a list of subdirectories. Why would this happen?
this is a problem because  (coming from ) will only contain the last part of the path and therefore be a relative path.  will only look for  in your current working directory ( will tell you which one that is; that is also what is referenced by ).you could fix that with something likebecause now  is the absolute path of the directory/file called  in  and it will be found independently of your working directory.just in case: pathlib is a nice built-in module for path handling...
