Natural Text
I wish to log to file as well as show the same information in the terminal window, but with nice colors (using colorlog or other cross-platform log colorizer). This is what I have:This gives me the following in the terminal (with colors):...and this in the log file (no colors, just plain text):Why is the level not right though?
There are two issues in your (original) code. The first was a minor error in which you assigned  to the log handler instead of the terminal handler.The second issue - that you weren't seeing logs below  level in your terminal - was caused by the fact that you were setting the minimum logging level on the terminal handler but not the logger itself. You need to replace:With:According to the documentation, loggers are set to  log level by default, and if my intuition is correct then setting only the handler to a lower log level would not work because the handler can only process what the logger feeds it anyway - -level logs and above.
