I am using Python 3.5.1. I read the document and the package section here: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packagesNow, I have the following structure::Now, while in :Similarly, now in home, superfolder of :Actually, I can do all kinds of stuff:Why does this work? I though there needed to be  files (empty ones would work) in both  and  for  to be importable when the Python path points to the  folder?This seems to have changed from Python 2.7:With  in both  and  it works fine.
Python 3.3+ has Implicit Namespace Packages that allow it to create a packages without an  file.Allowing implicit namespace packages means that the requirement to provide an  file can be dropped completely, and affected ... . The old way with  files still works as in Python 2.
IMPORTANT@Mike's answer is correct but too imprecise. It is true that Python 3.3+ supports Implicit Namespace Packages that allows it to create a package without an  file.This however, ONLY applies to EMPTY  files. So EMPTY  files are no longer necessary and can be omitted. If you want to run a particular initialization script when the package or any of its modules or sub-packages are imported, you still require an  file. This is a great Stack Overflow answer for why you would want to use an  file to do some further initialization in case you wondering why this is in any way useful.Directory Structure Example::EXAMPLESThe below examples demonstrate how the initialization script is executed when the  or one of its modules is imported.Example 1:Example 2:
I would say that one should omit the  only if one wants to have the implicit namespace package. If you don't know what it means, you probably don't want it and therefore you should continue to use the  even in Python 3.
