boolean has to be either True or False.then why output:yesi didn't get why yes is printing , since "poi" is nether True or False.
Python will do its best to evaluate the "truthiness" of an expression when a boolean value is needed from that expression.The rule for strings is that an empty string is considered , a non-empty string is considered .  The same rule is imposed on other containers, so an empty dictionary or list is considered , a dictionary or list with one or more entries is considered .The  object is also considered false.A numerical value of  is considered false (although a string value of  is considered true).All other expressions are considered . Details (including how user-defined types can specify truthiness) can be found here: http://docs.python.org/release/2.5.2/lib/truth.html.
In python, any string except an empty string defaults to ie,
What is happening here is Python' supplement of implicit  constructor after the , Because anything followed by  should be resolved to be boolean. In this context your code is equivalent toAccording to Python  constructor accepts anything and decides the truthiness based on below casesIf x is integer, Only  is  everything else is If x is float, Only  is  everything else is True`If x is list, Only  is  everything else is If x is set/dict, Only  is  everything else is If x is tuple, Only  is  everything else is If x is string, Only  is  everything else is . Be aware that  will return to Here is the log for the cases I listed above
