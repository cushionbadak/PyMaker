I am a newbie to python and I am struggling to find a better way for a problem.I have a list like below:In each tuple, the last attributed could be 'deleted' or 'None'. I need to check if all tuples have 'deleted' at last place. How to do that.I tried to do list comprehension (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions)but it does not seem to be working in case of null data.Can anybody please help?Thanks in advance.
This should return  if they all contain "Deleted"Also all your tuples need to have at least 4 elements. If not, you will get an index errorEDIT: As it stands in the comments it is better to go with  as you stated: "last element"
From your example it is inferable some tuples have no 4th item, so I added the  check.
Below line would work.
