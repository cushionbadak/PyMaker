This question already has an answer here:how to catch all uncaught exceptions and go on?                    2 answers                Problematic code:  Result:Problem: can I prevent the exit and proceed having printed the error?
No.From the docs (emphasis mine):When an exception is raised and uncaught, the interpreter calls   with three arguments, the exception class, exception  instance, and a traceback object. In an interactive session this  happens just before control is returned to the prompt; in a Python  program this happens just before the program exits.Your except hook will run, then the program will exit. If you want to catch exceptions, you need to use the usual  formula.
See the documentation for that function:sys.excepthook(type, value, traceback)This function prints out a given traceback and exception to sys.stderr.It does nothing but provide additional debugging facilities.
