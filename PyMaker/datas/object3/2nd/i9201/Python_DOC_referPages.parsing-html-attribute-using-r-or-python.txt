Natural Text
So I have a HTML file with a bunch of  tags with , and I want to automatically find the  with the biggest font-size and get the text that's between the span tags. Preferably in R or Python, but other methods are welcome as well. Any ideas?
For Python 3, you can use . (For Python 2.x you will need to look at )An example would be:Not very good with HTML (as evident from my previous answer), so you may need more control flow for edge-casesUseage:Edit: For going through all HTML files in a directory (in example, it is the current directory). This implementation will find the maximum value across all HTML files (if you want to the analysis once for each HTML file, initialize the  after each iteration and handle the results)
