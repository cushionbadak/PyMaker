Natural Text
I'm trying to load data from a CSV file, and convert one column with a date, to a week number. I am getting below mentioned :Error:I tried to execute this program on Python 3.5.2 -Anaconda custom (64-bit)
Converters are given the raw  value read from the file; you need to decode these to a string first if you want to parse them as a datetime value. ASCII should suffice as your input is simply a series of digits and dashes to form a date:Note: I removed the  call; the  object supports the  method directly.
