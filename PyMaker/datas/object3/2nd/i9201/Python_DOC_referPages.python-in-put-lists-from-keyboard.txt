You initialized list1 to an empty listIn order to add a new item to the end of the list use append()In your exampleYou were getting an IndexError because you were trying to access an index in list1 that doesnt exist, since the length of an empty list is zero.(FYI this answer is specific to your error, not the rest of your code)Docs:https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html
It's erroring because list1 is an empty list so your position is nonexisting
