I am trying to sum the product of two different list items in the same line using for loop, but I am not getting the output as expected.My example code:output:expected output:
Just  the lists to generate pairs, multiply them and feed to :In above  will return iterable of tuples containing one number from both lists:Then generator expression is used to multiply the numbers together:Finally  is used to sum them together for final result:
You have some problems in your code, first off you cant index your list with parenthesis you need , secondly you've created a generator not a number.You need to  your lists first:Or as a functional approach use  within  and :
A generator by itself, even if applied so as to generate the list result, will just give you a list of the products. You still need to do something to add up the elements of the list, which you can't do inside your generator.Your method looks like you've mixed generator syntax with a traditional  loop, which would look like this:The cleanest, or at least most Pythonic, solution probably uses  to combine the lists, a list comprehension to multiply the elements, and  to add them all up:You could also use  for the full-on functional approach (note that you have to  it from  if you use Python 3):
Let's take a close look at your code:The right hand side of this statement is a generator expression. Think of a generator as a lazy list. It doesn't actually sum anything, so to be more correct you should do(Note the brackets, not parentheses, for subscripting the lists.)Now  is a generator which "contains" the products of corresponding elements of the original lists  and .The next step is to iterate over the list to sum the elements:As others have already posted, you can do this all in one line with  and  built-in functions:

You can try:
If you have a large list, you might consider using numpy arrays.
