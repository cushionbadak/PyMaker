I would like to use a function with many parameters. Is there a way, instead of having : something like : (but this code does not work)I would just like to have the "question=" part to make things easier to read
You need to define things before you use them. If you meant  to be a variable, then it needs to be defined before the function. Note that the function takes a reference to the object. If you rebind the variable later, that isn't seen by the function.Then, notice that the variable name inside the function is the thing on the left, not the thing on the right.
It's possible to enter the type of variable as an argument
