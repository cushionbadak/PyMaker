I'm tring to write the one line equivalent to:So, i tried:But this line returns  or  depnding on the evaluation of the expression.The following gives me an error:Is there a way to selective return a value using inline if, and if not I would appreciate an explanation as to why.
You want a 1 line-code? Why? If it's about style and performance then start by doing only one lookup in :That's probably faster and more pythonic because it follows the EAFP principle: "Easier to ask for forgiveness than permission."About your exception:However the:should work without problems.
You can write your first code on one line if you want:This is not great style, but it does exactly what you want. You can't use an  expression for this because  is a statement, and you can't nest a statement inside an expression.
If it's not in it, nothing supposes to happen. Then what you are doing won't work, when using the  keyword, something gets returned. So just keep it as you originally had it so code can continue to flow if the  isn't in the groupI prefer using inline ifs as the code is shorter.This is a very dangerous way to start learning to code.Yes, you may sometimes look smarter to others but the second they start to realise that your "one-liner" is actually making performance slower, they will be just reverting your code back to the simpler form.
