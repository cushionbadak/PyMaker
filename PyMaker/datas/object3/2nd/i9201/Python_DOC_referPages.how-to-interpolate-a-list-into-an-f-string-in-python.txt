Say I have a functionI want to interpolate the result of the function into a string to get . I've tried this:But it produced . Can I do this using an f-string?
is this what you are looking for?maybe the best thing about this solution is that it works with any list length and with minimal tweaking you can change the output format too.
Firstly, the -operator can only unpack iterables in few specific contexts, such as a function call, list display, etc. It can't be used directly in a f-string placeholder. Although, you could use  like this:Secondly, you can't generally format/interpolate multiple values in a single placeholder. You'd need to use a separate placeholder for each value:
The  operator (similar rules exist for ) can only be used inside:a function call: a list, tuple, or set literal: an assignment: It is not an expression and can therefore not be used inside the braces of f-strings.
For lists, f-strings do not seem to add much to what was already possible without them. An alternative, slightly simpler, solution without f-strings and without , which works for any list length, is the following
You can also use the zfill method instead:
