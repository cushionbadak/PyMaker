I have this code:When I run this I keep getting the error:how to resolve it?
You are storing unbound  objects in a dictionary. Such objects (as well as  objects, functions and  objects)  are only bound through the descriptor protocol, by accessing the name as an attribute on the class or an instance. Directly accessing the  objects in the class body is not an attribute access.Either create the dictionary after creating the class (so you access them as attributes), or bind explicitly, or extract the original function before storing them in the dictionary.Note that 'binding' for  objects merely means that the context is merely ignored; a bound  returns the underlying function unchanged.So your options are to unindent the dictionary and trigger the descriptor protocol by using attributes:or to bind explicitly, passing in a dummy context (which will be ignored anyway):or access the underlying function directly with the  attribute:However, if all you are trying to do is provide a namespace for a bunch of functions, then you should not use a class object in the first place. Put the functions in a module. That way you don't have to use  decorators in the first place and don't have to unwrap them again.
