I have the below dictionary:Q: Is there a way to retrieve the value of key (in the above dictionary), using the hash value of the key?If I print  , I get:Q2: Why not do a key lookup directly rather than converting the key to a hash value and then do the lookup? I read that using hash makes it faster.
You don't need to retrieve the value using hash by yourself, Python dict do that for you. Python dict use hash internally. from https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesmappingA mapping object maps hashable values to arbitrary objects. Mappings  are mutable objects. There is currently only one standard mapping  type, the dictionary.
