I am currently working on an automation task. I have arrived at a part of the script where I need confirmation from the user to continue. For example the script is automatically entering some values in Selenium for the user however I need confirmation from the user that these are the correct variables. Let's say I want to output this list into the command prompt:The user then can enter  and my script will continue with the rest of its processes. How would I go about implementing the first portion of this? I believe the second portion of this task would involve using  to correctly store the value the user enters back. However the issue is with the first part, how do I implement this so that my script knows to pause and wait for the user input? Thanks!
IIUC you need to wait for the user until it matches your list.Also make sure that you go through below link and reads the basics https://docs.python.org/3/output
