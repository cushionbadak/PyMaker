Quite a stupid question but...So when there's no  at the end of the function, why would the code return ? When it's called recursively and  or  is eventually equal to , it meets the  condition right? Then it should return the non-zero value.
If neither  nor  is equal to zero, neither one of the first two return statements will be executed.Without the final return, the flow of control reaches the end of the function without hitting a return statement, so the default value of  is returned.
