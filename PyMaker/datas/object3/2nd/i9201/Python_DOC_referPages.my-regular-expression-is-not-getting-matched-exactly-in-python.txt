 matches your pattern at the beginning of the string. Append e.g. end of string  or word boundary  to your pattern:From the docs on :If zero or more characters at the beginning of string match the regular expression pattern, return a corresponding MatchObject instance.
You should add a dollar sign to the end of your regex expression. The dollar ($) means the end of the string, and for future reference, the carat (^) signifies the beginning.Output
