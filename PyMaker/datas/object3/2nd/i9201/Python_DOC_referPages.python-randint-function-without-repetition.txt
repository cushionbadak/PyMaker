I am just a beginner to python.And I here just wrote a simple program just to self evaluate myself and try to answer the questions asked in a random order.But the bug here is that the randint function sometimes acquires the same number which was already acquired that I get the same question repeated.I tried my best to fix it but I could n't . Hope I get some help here.`import random
before your function, add an array of booleans that describes which questions have already been answered:then, where you assign qno to a value, keep generating random numbers until you've hit one you haven't asked before, and mark the newly asked question as asked:
The random.shuffle function does exactly what you want.
If you use randomint(0, 14), you're bound to get lots of repeats! For example: Here's my output, on my first run: Notice how I got the number  three times! Obviously repeats will happen less as the range increase, but you'll always run a chance of repeating numbers especially since this is only a pseudo random generated number. Perhaps you're looking for something like shuffle? For example: 
maybe a little advanced, its nice to have options that don't require explicit indexingcould be now that I added the  at end of loop
