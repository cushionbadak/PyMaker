my question is about class design and my current approach is inspired by this question/answer. Starting from there, I create multiple instances of the class  which are collected and can be accessed via the class . Additionaly, the class  should have some method which is occasionally called for all instances. Now, conditional on the outcome of the method, is there a way to instantly delete an instance?EDITHere is what I have in mind so far, but this is not "instantly" and it's "outside".
Usually when you have an object kill itself, you know your design is wrong. This is the case here.You have Foobar responsible for adding Foos to the collection, but you want Foo to be responsible for removing itself from the collection. Either Foobar manages the collection or Foo manages the collection. That way only one of them is aware, for instance, of the nature of the collection. In your case both classes need to know the collection is a dictionary whose key is  . Once you figure out who handles the collection, you'll see Foos no longer need to delete themselves, and the ordinary Python garbage collector will work just fine.
