This question already has an answer here:How do I get the filepath for a class in Python?                    3 answers                Is it possible to get the name of the file containing the class? The variable  is a class in the below.Update: The following works to get the name of the script containing the class:
Call  on the class/function/method/module. It's not guaranteed to work, but it's more reliable than just checking the  attribute of the object (for example, on Python 3.5,  works, while  raises ).If you have an instance, this won't work without converting to the class first, e.g.  (on Python 2,  can be more reliable with old-style classes); it can only tell you where the class was defined, not where the instance was defined.
