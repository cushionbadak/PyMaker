I want to create function for every possible permutation of an array. I wrote some code and I don't know what is wrong with it. It return me first possibility = [1,2,3], but then It fails with error : original[i] out of index but it should be originial[1] which equals 2. Maybe del temp erases also from original but that would not make sense for me.Thank you in advace.
Python standard library module  provide  which yields permutations:
You better use  for this since these are well optimized and tested routines. Nevertheless in case you want to implement it yourself, there are some things that can be improved/corrected:You  a value, but only in the last recursive step you need to propagate them back;you return a reference to the list you construct on the fly, as a result you will always return the same list;you always ete the first element, not the one you picked; andyou do not restore the element after deletion.Some additonal improvements:use  instead of  on the last element; andyou can simply use  instead of a comparison on :
