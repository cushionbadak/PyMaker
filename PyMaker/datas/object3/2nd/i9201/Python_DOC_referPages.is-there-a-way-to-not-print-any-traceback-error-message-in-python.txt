I have some piece of code like thisAnd when I run it, it keeps giving tracebacks about SSH problem such as this:I would like to know if it is possible to not print at all on the screen any Traceback messages?ThanksHere's the full error:
You could just finish your try and just do a general catch and then do nothing with it.
Probably the best alternative would be to use the tracebacklimit module.For Python 2.x you could do:For Python 3.5 (tracebacklimit) some people have reported that this should be set to  to work, i.e.:For multiple exception raised some people reported is not guaranteed to work (In Python, how do I print an error message without printing a traceback and close the program when a condition is not met?).
