I've worked with the Python basics for some time and fall back to  for data analysis. Now I want to learn how to do OOP the Python way, but with all the reading about classes, objects and their attributes: I got lost on the way experimenting and am looking for directions.I use Python module , reading all interfaces, and for each interface going through spreadsheets to filter and get more (supplier) data I need.As an example I can have the following data:Tree-wise to show the relations:    the keys would look like the example below without the values:You can see the interface is used multiple times with more subinterfaces.This also counts for the hostname and could be for other details along the way.In what kind of way should I be thinking of handling 50000 entries in memory? Or am I better of with a database?I know how to create dict-in-dicts, but not how to make relations between each other using actual objects.
Object-orientation is about objects which are bundles of data and functions (or messages that the objects understand) that operate on the data. Instead of starting with plain data structures and dividing them, you should start to think which operations you want to do in your program. Then, cluster these into entities with clear, distinct responsibilities. The later will be your objects.It could well be that the final design does not look similar to the data-grouping you presented and that you will not see the same flow as in a data-oriented approach. If this is a pro or con is open for discussion.
