I want to know why the following codes work?I accidentally found that I don't have to init attributes in init. I learn from every tutor I have to put assignment in init like below.If there are some official documents can explain this would be better. 
It's class attributes vs instance attributes vs dynamic attributes. When you do: and  are dynamic attributes (not sure if this is an official term). If the usage of the class is such that these attributes are set before calling any other methods of , then those methods can use . Otherwise, you get an error:This happens because for , speed and time are attributes on that instance of . Their existence or value doesn't propagate across other instances of Car. So when I create  and then try to lookup , the attribute doesn't exist. As you've said in your own comment, "they spring into existence when they are first assigned to."I accidentally found that I don't have to init attributes in init. I learn from every tutor I have to put assignment in init like below.Your tutors were very wrong or you misunderstood what they meant. In the example you gave, every Car gets the same initial  and . Typically, an  would look like this:You can then initialise a  with: . Or put default values in init if it's optional.Edit: example adapted from the docs:
