Actually, I can not reproduce your problem; your code runs fine on Python 2.7. However, there are better ways to do it. First, instead of using a , you could  the  and  lists:However, this will still replace the  in  and the  in , and it might also replace characters that were introduced in an earlier replacement, which is probably not what you want. Instead, you could use the  module, joining the strings to be replaced with  to a regex and delimiting it with  word boundary characters, e.g.  in your case, and use a dictionary to look up the proper replacements.    Result: 
Trybut that is propably not very fastIf entries in old are all letters-only you can dothis also avoids the double replacement problem if an entry is in both old and new (not avoided in the shorter solution)
 is available on Python 2.x but deprecated in python 3.x.Below is how you can use it in Python 3.xstr.replace(old, new[, count])  Return a copy of the string with all occurrences of substring old replaced by new. If the optional argument count is given, only the first count occurrences are replaced.In your case, it is
