I don't seem to be able to monkey patch a  method of class instance (and yes, I want to patch just single instances, not all of them).The following code:Outputs this:While I'd like it to output:How do I monkeypatch ? Why I can't patch it the same way as I patch other methods?While this answer tells how to do it (supposedly, I haven't tested it yet), it doesn't explain the why part of the question.
So, as J.J. Hakala commented, what Python really does, is to call:as such, if I want to override the  method, I must override the  of a class, but if I don't want to affect behaviour of other instances of the same class, I need to create a new class with the overriden  method.So an example of how to override  would look like this:Running it produces following output:
For custom classes, implicit invocations of special methods are only guaranteed to work correctly if defined on an object’s type, not in the object’s instance dictionary. That behaviour is the reason why the following code raises an exception:Source: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-lookup
