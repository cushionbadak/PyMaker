Natural Text
While migrating to Python 3, I noticed some files we generate using the built-in  now have  prefix around each strings...Here's the code, that should generate a .csv for a list of , according to some parameters defined by  (thus always returns unicode data):The problem is once I returns , I get:Instead of (indentation has been modified to be readable on SO):I did not find any  parameter in the  module. I would like the whole file to be encoded in cp1252, so I don't really care either the encoding is done through the iteration of the lines or on the file construted itself. So, does anyone know how to generate a proper string, containing only cp1252 encoded strings?
The  module deals with text, and converts anything that is not a string to a string using . Don't pass in  objects. Pass in  objects or types that cleanly convert to strings with . That means you should not encode strings.If you need  output, encode the  value:as  objects also deal in text only.Better yet, use a  object with a  to do the encoding for you as the  module writes to the file object:I've enabled line-buffering on the wrapper so that it'll auto-flush to the  instance every time a row is written.Now  produces a bytestring:
