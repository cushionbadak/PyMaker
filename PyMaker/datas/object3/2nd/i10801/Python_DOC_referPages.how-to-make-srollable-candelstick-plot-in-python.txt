I have following candlestick plot. I want to make it scrollable so that I can see more details. The current plot is too long to see details. I have found examples for making a line plot scrollable at here:Matplotlib: scrolling plotHowever, updating a candlestick seems way more complicated than updating a line chart. The candlestick plot returns lines and patches. Can you help?
You can plot the whole plot, and then use the slider widget to modify the axes area.I couldn't reproduce your data because I don't have the  library, so I modified the candlestick example from here, and added the slider.I hardcoded some values of the axes sizes and positions, please be careful when adapting to your code.Also same idea can be implemented to add a vertical scroll if needed.
For what you want, I'd recommend using Plotly, which allows for interactive data visualization (including scroll, zoom, panning, etc), and has a nice Python API.Here are two different ways to do it (in both cases, you will need to )Using the Plotly website API (requires that you create an account here and get your username and API key. You'll need to be connected to Internet to generate the plot.)Using Plotly's offline mode. I assume that you will be using the Jupyter (IPython notebook). You won't need to be connected to the Internet.The result before zoom...... And after zooming on a specific region.If you have any other question, please let me know. Hope the answer will suit you!
