I'm doing a test in Python3 trying to convert a string from  to a array/row format.  I would like to get what I get when I run  using a string.Thanks :)
Works here is a tuple is an list is a dictionary
I'm not entirely clear on what you wish to do, but I think it's this.
If you want to parse a string into a tuple you can use ast.literal_evalNot clear what you really want to do?
