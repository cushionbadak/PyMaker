I have a while loop that fills a list of objects ,and another loop that fills a dictionary associating Var1:Account2. But, I need to get that dictionary's value into each object, if the key matches the object's Account1.So basically, I have:I've tried this:But, it's not working, and I suspect it's my first "if" statement, because listOfSpreadsheetRowObjects is just a list of those objects. How would I access account1 of each object, so I can match them as needed? Eventually, I should have three objects with the following information:SpreadsheetRowself.Account1=Account1self.Account2=(v from my dictionary, if account1 matches the key in my dictionary)
You can use a generator expression within  to check if any  attribute of those objects is equal with :
You can try to use the  function like this:
If you have a dictionary  and want to get the value associated to the key  then you look up that value like this:So if your dictionary is called  and the key is  and you want to set that value to  then you would do:The whole point of using a dictionary is that you don't have to iterate through the entire thing to look things up.Otherwise if you are doing this initialization of  after creating all the  objects then using  doesn't make sense, you would need to iterate through each  item and do the assignment for each one, something like this:But again, you don't have to iterate over the dictionary to make the assignment, just look up  from the dict:
