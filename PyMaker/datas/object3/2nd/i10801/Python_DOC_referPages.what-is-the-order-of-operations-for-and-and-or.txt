In Python is this:the same as this...?Can I use the second code block instead of the first?  It would eliminate an extra elif statement and it just seems cleaner.My concern is how the 'and' and 'or' operators work.  Are the two 'and' comparisons separate and the 'or' compares them?  Is there an order of operations for 'and' and 'or'?I ran the code and it works both ways but I want to make sure I understand exactly how the operators work.
Yes, the second code block is equivalent to the first one. According to the documentation,  has lower precedence than . It means that the if statement is evaluated aswhich is what you want.You could return the result of that boolean expression to shorten the code:
vaultah's answer addresses your actual question perfectly -- they deserve the upvote and checkmark.But I think programming blackjack in every language you're learning is an excellent way to better understand it, so I threw together code to show a different way to implement the blackjack test.  More for educational purposes than to actually answer your question:If I were to implement it today, Cards and Hands would be classes, and there'd be a  method, like:Examples:Sorry for the silly non-answer, but these are just different ideas to think about.  Don't worry if they're over your head, you'll get there.
The usual advice is if you don't know, then your readers might not know either, and it would be better for everybody if you use parentheses.although you might try other formulations, such asor writing a helper function and using
