I want to ignore the path of a file stored in a zip. I use the following:This will create the followng:/mygoodpath/ignorepath/filename.txtI would prefer /mygoodpath/filename.txtI am looking at shutil.move as well as ZipFile.open to open and write, though the later would probably have a few edge cases. Best method to handle this?
Try using Zipfile.open
