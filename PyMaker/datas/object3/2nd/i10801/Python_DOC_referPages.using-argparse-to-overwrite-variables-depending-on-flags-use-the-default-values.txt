I have a program that stores a few important variables as strings that are necessary for the program to operate properly: , , and  . These variables are stored in a file, which is loaded by the program.For debugging purposes, I would like to be able to quickly overwrite the files with command line arguments. The args would all be optional, and if not used then it just uses the variables taken out of the file.I can do simple positional args using something like , and only overwrite vars if the args are present, but this has the problem of not being able to handle if you enter the variables in the wrong order, or if you enter, say, the  and  but not the .I have been reading through the pyDocs argparse Tutorial and documentation, but it does not seem terribly useful for what I need - it covers mandatory args, and optional flags, but does not seem to allow optional args that depend on a flag to denote their purpose. EDIT: Turns out it does, but the example is not very obvious, so I missed it. Similarly I have had trouble finding applicable questions here on SE. In short, given a program likeSome examples with different cmd line inputs/outputs would be:All values are defaultsAll values are overriddenDefault , Override  + . Args were specified in different order.Default  and , Override You get the idea...for the syntax of the flag/args relationship, I am also not sure if there is a specific syntax python needs you to use (i.e.  vs.  v )
There's a few ways to define default values for arguments specified by . When adding arguments to your parser, you can specify a default value. Simply:From the above example, it is trivial to extend to allow additional default functionality. Note that  is already by default due to the naming of the long argument . Like so:
