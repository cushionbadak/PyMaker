I'm creating an assignment for school.First create the pseudocode, etcThen write a compare function that I've written that partBUT then I have to prompt the user to input the numbers for comparison. I have no idea how to write the user input prompt.
Since you're using Python 3.x, you can use:Since Python 3.x doesn't evaluate and/or convert the data type, you have to explicitly convert to , with , like this:But if you wan't to create a good function, you'll have to validate the params A and B, to make sure your program don't accept  or  as inputs. You can take a deeper look here: Asking the user for input until they give a valid response
Use the command:Then, when compiling the .py file, the terminal will show the message:Where you can put your input as easy as type and enter.And maybe, as said above, you'll wish to convert the input to an int or float using either int() or float() to make sure you're getting a valid input.
