Natural Text
Everytime I send an email with this function, it doesn't add the subject and the message to the right fields, but instead of that, it adds it to the 'from:' or something.Here's the image of it.Any idea how this can be fixed? Thanks for answer
You cannot have a space after the . An email header line is continued by indenting it, so your code is creating a really long  header with all the data you are trying to put in different fields.Anyway, manually gluing together snippets of plain text is a really crude and error-prone way to construct an email message. You will soon find that you need the various features of the Python  module anyway (legacy email is 7-bit single part ASCII only; you'll probably want one or more of attachments, content encoding, character set support, multipart messages, or one of the many other MIME features). This also coincidentally offers much better documentation for how to correcty create a trivial email message.
Following on from @tripleee suggestion to use the  module, here's a basic example using your current code:Notice how much easier it is to define the parts of the email using keys like  instead of attempting to build a string or 'gluing parts together' as tripleee put it.The different fields (From, To, Subject, et cetera) you can access are defined in RFC 2822 - Internet Message Format. These documents are not easy to read, so here's a list of some of the fields' keys you can use: , , , , , , .You cannot have a space after the \r\n. An email header line is continued by indenting it, so your code is creating a really long From: header with all the data you are trying to put in different fields.As triplee and the RFC-2822 document says, if you are wanting to build the email string manually look at the field definitions in that document which look similar to this example:from = "From:" mailbox-list CRLFYou can translate this into Python code when building an email string like so:
