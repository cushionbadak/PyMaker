I can run one program by typing:  in the command line, but I want to run it from within another program.In the other program, I imported subprocess and had , but I get an error message saying something about a callback. If I comment out this line, the rest of my program works perfectly fine. Any suggestions on how I could change this line to get my code to work or if I shouldn't be using subprocess at all? 
If  requires user input, probably it wasn't meant to run from another python script. you might want to import it as a module:  and run the functions you want to use from there.If you want to stick to the subprocess, you can pass input with : documentation, example.
Your program  should meet the following requirements:The first line is a path indicating what program is used to interpretthe script. In this case, it is the python path.Your script should be executableA very simple example. We have two python scripts: called.py and caller.pyUsage: caller.py will execute called.py using File /tmp/called.pyFile /tmp/caller.pyMake both executable:caller.py output:$ /tmp/caller.py $ OK
