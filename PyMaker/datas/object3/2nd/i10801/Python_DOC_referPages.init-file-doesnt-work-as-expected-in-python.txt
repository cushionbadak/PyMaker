I have some folders and  files in the following structure:In the  file under the  folder, I have  and in the one of , I have . But when I tried , I got such an error:But when I just , no error is thrown. However, when I call , this error happens:I try all of those mentioned above in the , which is at the root of the directory.Do you know what is the reason and how can I fix it? Thanks!
The problem is that you are importing another module named  that is installed on your system rather than your own module. You can verify this by checking the module file path in  after you .The first thing to do is change the name of your module to avoid namespace collisions with the other  package on your system. If your new package name doesn't collide with something else, you should now either successfully be importing it and have it behave as expected, or it fails to import entirely.If it fails to import, it is most likely because your  directory is not in your  environment variable.There can potentially also be other more technical reasons that a module is not recognized by the interpreter such as old definitions being cached (in which case restarting the interpreter is often enough. Possibly after deleting any precompiled versions of the module). Another problem I have seen ended up being that a module contained a bug that made the interpreter unable to parse it. I am sure there are other odd possibilities out there.
You're on Python 3. You need to perform relative imports explicitly:The  module you're currently getting is the standard library  module.
