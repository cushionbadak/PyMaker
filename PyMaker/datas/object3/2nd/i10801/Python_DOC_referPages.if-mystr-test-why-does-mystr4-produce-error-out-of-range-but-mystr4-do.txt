I'm using recursion to iterate through the values of a string. When I get past the last character, it's allowing me to use that index position as an empty string  instead of giving an error. Why is that?produces an errordoes not produce any error.
Slicing is not bounds-checked by the built-in types. If the array indices are out of bounds, it will automatically truncate then at the right places.
Because array accesses are defined such that it's an error for a lone index to be out of range, but not for (part or all of) a slice to be.  If any part of a slice is out of range, it simply yields no results, rather than triggering an error.
Python 3.0 documentation says about strings thatAttempting to use an index that is too large will result in an error. However, out of range slice indexes are handled gracefully when used for slicing.
