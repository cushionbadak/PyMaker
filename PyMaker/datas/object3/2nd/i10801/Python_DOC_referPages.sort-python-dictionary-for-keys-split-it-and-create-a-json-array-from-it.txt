I have this huge JSON file, which contains more than 80000 lines, looking like that:There are 10 different heroes with their gold data. I want to sort that data for the hero names, make a json list of the gold data, and then store it in a databse table looking like that, where gold_data should be like [{tick, gold}, {tick, gold}, ...]But seems like i am too stupid to sort that. I tried building a list out of it and using  I am just not too comfortable with Python yet and I tried so many different things, but i have no idea how to sort,and then split this dictionary for the hero_names key so I can get that JSON object for gold_data
