I am trying to make a list of topics for another project to use and I am storing the topics in . However, when the topics are stored in the file, I do not want duplicate topics. So when I am saving my topics to my  file, I also save them to a  file. What I want to do is create a conditional statement that won't add topics to  if the topics are in the . My problem is, I don't know how I could create a conditional statement that could check if the topic is listed in . A problem may arise if you scan for keywords such as "music", seeing that "electro-music" contains the word "music".
