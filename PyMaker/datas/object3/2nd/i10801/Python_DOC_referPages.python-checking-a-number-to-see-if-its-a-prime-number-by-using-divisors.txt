I have to write a program that checks if a number is a prime number by going through divisors in the range(1,num). (For ex. if the input is 5, the program will check if 2 is a divisor, then 3, then 4). Can someone explain how I can put the last expression in my program (the "this is a prime number" print function), so that it appears only after the "else" function in the "for" loop and not the "if div == 0:" statements? Thank you!
Given that you have already covered a division by 1, all you have to do is count if there is only one more divisor (the number itself). So to keep your code structure I added a counter.
There are many ways to do this:Set a flag!Use  !
Python's  expression has an optional  clause:Loop statements may have an else clause; it is executed when the loop terminates through exhaustion of the list (with for) or when the condition becomes false (with while), but not when the loop is terminated by a break statement.So your code should look like this:
I added one line sys.exit()
