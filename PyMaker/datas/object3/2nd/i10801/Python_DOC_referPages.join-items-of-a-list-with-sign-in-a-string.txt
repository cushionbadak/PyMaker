Change each individual  element in the  to a  inside the  call instead by using a :In the first case, you're calling  on the whole  and not on individual elements in that . As a result, it joins each character in the representation of the list, which looks like this:with the  sign yielding the result you're seeing.
You don't need to call  on your list. That returns the str representation of your list and the output of that is joined with . You can instead use  to convert each item in your list to , then :You can also use the new style formatting to have a more readable output:
What you need to do is concatenate a string element with ' + ' for each element in your list. All you need from there is to have some string formatting.  Sample output:How does it work?We use what's called a list comprehension (5.1.3) (generator in this specific usage) to iterate over our list of  elements creating a  of  elements. Now we can use the  method  to create our desired format.
