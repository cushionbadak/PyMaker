Hi I'm trying to finish this small piece of code for modifying csv files, I've got this far with some help:edit... some more info.Basically what I’m looking to do is make some small changes to the csv file depending on the project and parent issue in JIRA. Python will then make the changes to the csv file before it is then read into JIRA - that’s the second part of the program I’ve not even really looked at yet.  I’m only looking to change the BOX-123 type cells and leave the blank ones blank.  But the idea of the program is that I can use it to make some small changes to a template which will then automatically create some issues in JIRA.Any help really appreciated.
You want to use the row's index when comparing to . Use :You really should be using the  module here, though. Untested but should get you started.
A friend helped me last night and this is what they came up with:
