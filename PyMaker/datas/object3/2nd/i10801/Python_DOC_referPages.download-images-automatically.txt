I have written this piece of python code which downloads a number of images from a repository of images and saves them in specified folder. The code looks like this: For some reason the images are replaced and I do NOT see all images. I keep seeing one image  and all the images seem to replaced, though I expect the name of the images to go ,  , ... .I also see this warning/error but I am not sure if it is relevant to this problem or not. Where do you think the problem lies? Note that I am incrementing the image number: 
You have everything in one  block. Assuming  fails but all the other lines are executed without any problems, your code will never reach .Try rearranging your code where you first increase  and check which lines actually gives you the error.
