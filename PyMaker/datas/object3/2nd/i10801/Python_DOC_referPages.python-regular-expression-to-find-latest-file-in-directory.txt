I have one directory which contains below files for example purpose.Here how can i retrieve file which starts with ""AM_INMAG_Export_" and it should have latest timestamp using Python.for example: "AM_INMAG_Export_2016-07-29.csv" is the file I want to retrieve.BUT "fileN" is the latest modified file in the directory.
Filter the files that match your desired prefix and then sort.UpdateFilter filenames with a regexp and then sort.

So it looks like you need to use regex to get the date as a group item. Once you have all of the groups you need to convert that to a python date and then check to see which one has the greatest date.This is the regular expression you will be looking to use, you could go into more detail around the grouping and get an actual date format you are looking for.
use  to get the files and then sort the file names from the earliest to the oldest file:Note: the assumption here is that all files have identical prefix and post-fix, and the difference is due to the date.
Use glob.globThis will work if the time defined in the name is actually the updated time. Otherwise , you should use os.stat to find 
A list of files obtained with glob.glob() can be sorted with the sorted statement. See the following example
