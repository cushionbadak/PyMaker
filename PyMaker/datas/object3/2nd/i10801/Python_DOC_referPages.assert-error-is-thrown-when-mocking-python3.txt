I am trying to write a test that mocks raising  on a call to  when attempting to open a file for reading. However I cannot seem to get the test working. The  appears to be thrown but my test fails because of this even though I am trying to assert it is thrown. Below contains one of my attempts:fileMethods.pyfileMethods_test.pyAm I missing something obvious or is the way I am testing this method incorrect?
The reason this will not work is because you are mocking  and so the  function (which raises the  you're looking for) is not even called.If the  function is mocked (and therefore, the called function will do nothing), you can't assert that the exception raised by that function is called.The way it works is that when you mock a function it will, by default, not do anything. Look into the documentation here which explains this in further depth.
