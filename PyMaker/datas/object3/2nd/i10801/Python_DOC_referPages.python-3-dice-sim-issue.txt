I am BRAND new to python because my new school requires it. I am used to c++ so I'm still learning the ropes. I'm trying to make a dice rolling simulator and I thought i was doing everything right but my code just won't work. Any tips or guides to help me learn would be greatly appreciated. Here is my code:This is the error I get: Traceback (most recent call last): File "C:\Users\nomor\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35-32\DiceRollingSim.py", line 20, in  main() File "C:\Users\nomor\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35-32\DiceRollingSim.py", line 13, in main num_rolled = roll(sides) File "C:\Users\nomor\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35-32\DiceRollingSim.py", line 4, in roll num_rolled = random.randint(l,sides) NameError: name 'l' is not defined
For the first issue.... You put an "l" instead of the number 1. Python thinks this is a variable which you haven't defined anywhere -> the error you get.From the documentation randint takes two ints as parameters:random.randint(a, b)  Return a random integer N such that a <= N <= b. Alias for randrange(a, b+1).Next, look at these lines in your code.The  part needs to be indented inside of the while loop:
