Natural Text
I am trying to get my python script to read a text file with a list of file names with extensions and print out when it finds a particular extension (.txt files to be exact). It reads the file and goes through each line (I've tested by putting a simple "print line" after the for statement), but doesn't do anything when it sees ".txt" in the line. To avoid the obvious question, yes I'm positive there are .txt files in the list. Can someone point me in the right direction?
Each line ends with a new line character  so the test will rightly fail. So you should  the line first then test:
I guess you should add the endline sign  at the end of the extension:
Use  to remove trailing whitespaces, such as  or .
