This question already has an answer here:How to avoid having class data shared among instances?                    8 answers                So today I have an assignment that requires me to construct a bank account class. I have everything in order for my output to match the expected output. My Output:However as you can see, even though Mary and Alin are different customers, they generate the same account number. My question today is how can I give a different random 10-digit account number for each customer object created in my Bank Account class. right now I have my Customer class and then my BankAccount class (only including random number parts):I figured that for every account object I made, a new random number would be generated but that does not seem to be the case. Any ideas?
It's because you are statically setting the variable. Your line  only gets called once. Move it to the  call of  and you should get different account numbers.
You defined the  as a class variable, therefore once the class is created, the same  will be assigned to every instance of the class.You should instead create the account numbers in the instance and not as a class variable:More so, since you're almost always guaranteed to use the  module, you may consider moving that  statement to the top of your module.On another note, you should consider using a more reliable logic to generate unique account numbers.  would create duplicate account numbers at some point, which is a behavior you don't want. You can have a look at the  module.
When you make accountNumber it is statically created once. If you are re-using this it will be the same everytime.Compare the output of something like:with:Move it inside the class and it will be ok.
