A simple test, consisting of , which consists of 10001 copies of your original :
You can use a boolean mask whereby you check if the last two characters of  are in not () in a set of two character endings:
Instead of , you can use the  method to check if a string ends with a specific pattern.I.e.:You should create another df using the filtered data, and then use  to save a clean version of your file.
