I wrote some codes to get some lines from .txt like below and its keep returning lines with brackets which I did not intend. Could you help me?codes:name.txtAnd it returns
You don't need to call the splitlines() method on the results of readline()file.readline() returns one line of the file, including the trailing newline..splitlines() is getting rid of the newline by using it as a delimiter and giving you a LIST of lines with only 1 item.  The brackets are coming from the str representation of that 1 item listyou want this:to remove the newline or you could also slice off the newline like thisanother thing you might consider is changing your code to use the file object as an iterable.  It is more idiomatic in Python to writethan to use a while loop and .readline()
Making minimal changes to your code, try:This produces output like:Further improvements:Notes:You want to use  to assure that the file  gets closed regardless.Looping over  as a counter as in  is not pythonic.  Use enumerate instead. reads in a line.  There is no need for .By looping over the lines in the file with , we eliminate the need to read the whole file in at once.  This makes the program suitable for handling very large files.In python, when a line is read from a file, it still has the newline at the end of it.  We use  to safely remove it.
The  function reads a single line from the file. Then you ask to split the line into a list of lines (which will give you a list of only one line since that's what you have).Don't split the single line. Instead strip the string (to remove leading and trailing "white-space").Please read the string reference for more information about both  and .
This is because  returns the line in a list form containing a single element. Try this instead:
