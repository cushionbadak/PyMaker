I'm using Python 3.5.2 on Windows 10 x64. The  file I'm reading is this which is a  array containing 2 more arrays.I'm trying to parse this  file using the  module. As described in the docs the  file must be compliant to . I checked my file here and it tells me it's perfectly fine with the  format, but when trying to read it using this simple python code:I'm getting this exception:I can read this exact file perfectly fine on Javascript but I can't get Python to parse it. Is there anything wrong with my file or is any problem with the Python parser?
