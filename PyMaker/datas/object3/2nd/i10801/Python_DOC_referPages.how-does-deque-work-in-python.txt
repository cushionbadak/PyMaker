I am having trouble understanding how the deque works in the snippet of code below, while trying to recreate a queue and a stack in Python.Stack Example - UnderstoodAs expected when pushing and popping, the "e" goes Last In, First Out (LIFO). My question is with the example below.Queue Example - Not UnderstandingWhen pushing and popping, the "e" goes Last In, First Out (LIFO). Shouldn't it be First In, First Out (FIFO)?
A deque is a generalization of stack and a queue (It is short for "double-ended queue").Thus, the pop() operation still causes it to act like a stack, just as it would have as a list. To make it act like a queue, use the popleft() command. Deques are made to support both behaviors, and this way the pop() function is consistent across data structures. In order to make the deque act like a queue, you must use the functions that correspond to queues. So, replace pop() with popleft() in your second example, and you should see the FIFO behavior that you expect.Deques also support a max length, which means when you add objects to the deque greater than the maxlength, it will "drop" a number of objects off the opposite end to maintain its max size.
