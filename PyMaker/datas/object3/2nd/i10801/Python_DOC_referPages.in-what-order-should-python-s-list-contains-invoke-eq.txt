Consider the following Python program:Under CPython 2.7.11 and 3.5.1, it prints:But under PyPy 5.3.1 (2.7), it prints:Although Python 3.5’s documentation states that equality should be symmetric “if possible”, sometimes it is not. In that case, the order of arguments to  becomes important.So, is the above CPython behavior an implementation detail, or is it a part of ’s public interface (meaning that PyPy has a bug)? Please explain why you think so.
Per the language reference:For container types such as list, tuple, set, frozenset, dict, or  collections.deque, the expression  is equivalent to .The other examples in the same section show the same ordering for the equality test. This suggests that the comparison should be , in which case this could be considered a bug in PyPy. Additionally, CPython is the reference implementation, so in any discrepancy that version wins!That said, you should raise it with that community to see how they feel about it.
