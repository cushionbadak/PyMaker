I want to be able to assign a string (a word) to an integer, and also an integer to a string, so that later on when i sort the integer or string, i can print the corresponding string or integer to that unit in matrix.Example;and even multiple positions, like;then,Just like in .cvs, when a column sorted other columns move according to keep row intact. And would like to do some additional functions on file, like classifying those strings after output so I can make some charts with color for visualization.Thanks
It can be done by MATLAB.I tried to do it using vectorization method. And it became the more and more unclear at each step but I spent a lot of time for it, so I show it: and  is input data. It creates manually. And  is a result you need:P.S. It works! But it looks like some brainblow so I suggest to use loops.
What you're doing is called "sorting arrays in parallel" or "sorting parallel arrays." You can use those terms to search for guides on how to do it. However, below is some code which shows one way to do it in MATLAB:
