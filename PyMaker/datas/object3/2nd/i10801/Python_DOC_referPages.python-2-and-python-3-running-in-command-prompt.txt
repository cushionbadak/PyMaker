Having various projects in both Python 2 and Python 3 (with both python versions installed), I was looking for a more intuitive way to run scripts via Command Prompt than.Python 2 already took , so ideally  should invoke Python 3.My question: How can I add  as a Command Prompt command?
Searching did not yield good results, so I thought I should share the process I took with anyone looking for this in the future.Make sure the Python 3 folder is present in the PATH environment variable. Locate the "python.exe" file in the Python 3 folder.Copy and Paste the "python.exe" file within the Python 3 folder.Rename the copied file to "python3" (or whatever you want the command to be).Now, when you input  to Command Prompt, the script will run through the copied Python 3 file.Also, by copying python.exe (instead of renaming it) you allow other interpreters - such as PyCharm - to continue using their default "python.exe" path settings.I hope this helps!EDIT:A "symlink" has the same effect, but keeps things a bit tidier.
If Python 2 and 3 are both installed and in the PATH variable, you can do:py -2orpy -3
