I am a newbie to Python. I got some Python sample code from a software vendor who extended their software API with boost.python so we can call them in Python. I am confused with some of the segments, such as:All the variable names are replaced to be these funny things anyway, just for explanation of the general idea. So here the problem is in the 3rd line. How can we set the variable  with its sub property , where  I suppose is some kind of enum of different kind of animals, which is a sub-property of ?I tried doing some test to add one line following the above 5 lines to see if  is still there:and it works ok. So for this instance , it's sub property  is not overwritten by its sub property of , it still knows  is its sub-property. Can you advise if I need to implement this line in Python, how can I do that?I suppose it would be a quite interesting knowledge for people learning Python, so I raised this question here for discussing. I am trying to think in a C++ way, but I didn't figure it out.
I don't really see what's the issue. Consider an  defined in python:The  and  are instances of the  class:As such they have access to their own class, which is :Now you can just add a  to the  class and obtain that behaviour:and now you have:Note that while the above allows you to write  doesn't allow you to access as in  because this would return the  object.To obtain the exact behaviour you see in that code you could:Set the  attribute to be an instance of  (possibly an  one) and be done:Replace the use of  with a custom made descriptor that will handle the access via the class too.  In this case read the documentation about  which also provides its python code equivalent. The case you have to change is  when :Use this as:And now you have:so that  works.
