Part AI want to do some checking on arguments to a class instantiation and possibly return  if it doesn't make sense to even create the object.I've read the docs but I don't understand what to return in this case.What should  be in ?It cannot be  because the object doesn't exist yet so  is not a valid keyword in this context.Part BTied to my question, I don't understand the need to have the  parameter.If you call the constructor of  -  - won't  always be ?How could it be anything else?According to the docs,  in  is:. . .the class of which an instance was requested as its first  argument.
(I'm assuming you are using Python 3 because you provided a link to Python 3 docs) could be . returns the parent class (in this case it is simply ). Most of the times when you are overriding methods you will need to call the parent class's method at some point.See this example:And then:
You could just return the instance of cls like this . Because every class is subclass of , you can use that as a object creator for your class. The returnes object is passed as a first argument to the  with the any number of positional argument or any number of keyword argument you passed to new. There you will create instance variable assigning those values.
