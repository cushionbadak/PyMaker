Natural Text
I have a text file consisting of space-separate text values:I do not know how many of these values - right of - I'll have a priori.I want to use Python groups within a regular expression to be able to refer to each capture.Currently,  references the item to the left of semi-colon and  references everything, in one string, to the right.I do not know a priori how many  each  will have.The syntax  is used to create a group which can be used to reference a specific captured sub-regex. For example, for line 1 =  = Line 2: =  = QuestionAfter I execute , I want to be able to be able to reference each space-separate  via .The problem is that I don't know if there is a way to create an arbitrary number of unnamed groups.For line 1, I'd like to be able to say  and have that return . For line 2,  should return `` since there's only 5 letters.
See this answer.Most or all regular expression engines in common use, including in particular those based on the PCRE syntax (like Python's), label their capturing groups according to the numerical index of the opening parenthesis, as the regex is written. So no, you cannot use capturing groups alone to extract an arbitrary, variable number of subsequences from a string.A better solution is to just call line.split() on everything after the  on a line.
