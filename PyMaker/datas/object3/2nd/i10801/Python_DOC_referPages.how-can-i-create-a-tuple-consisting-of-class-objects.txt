This question is for Python version 2.7. For example, if I have the following class:After executing the code above I get  because I can only store a single variable of the object inside the tuple and not the object itself. My question is, is there an easy solution to store class objects in tuples such that  where  are objects?
You don't have to call  on the object to do this:Be careful to not use the name  to not shadow the builtin  class.To create a tuple with more than one item:Note that the parenthesis serve only for grouping and removing them will not have any effect.
Your problem doesn't really have to do with the type of the tuple's elements, but rather with single-item tuples. From the documentation:A special problem is the construction of tuples containing 0 or 1 items: the syntax has some extra quirks to accommodate these. Empty tuples are constructed by an empty pair of parentheses; a tuple with one item is constructed by following a value with a comma (it is not sufficient to enclose a single value in parentheses).Note the following:
