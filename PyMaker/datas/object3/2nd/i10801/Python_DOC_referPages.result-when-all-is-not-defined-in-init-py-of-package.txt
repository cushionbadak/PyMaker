I am just learning and practicing python,on the way,i am reading about python packages and how to import into other modules or package at Modules ,I assume the following scenario ,I have package as ,and in no I have not definedwhat happens if i have an import statement as,Since I have already imported mkv module in first statement,what exactly happens after execution of second import statement,I didnt get the concept after reading on the mentioned link.
When you dofirst, if the package's  hasn't been run yet, it will be run. (If you've already done , the package's  will have already been run.)Then, if  does not define an  list, the import will pick up all current contents of the  object*. That'll be anything defined in  and any submodules that have already been explicitly imported by any code that has executed in your program. For example, if 's  is empty, you doand no other import statements relating to  exist in your program, then the  will pick up , but not any other submodules of , such as .*excluding anything that begins with an underscore, as is standard for any  with no  list, whether you're importing from a package or a normal module.
