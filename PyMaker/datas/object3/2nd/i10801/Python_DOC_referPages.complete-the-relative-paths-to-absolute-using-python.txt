I have rewritten the complete code to fetch the href and src link using beautifulsoup this time by the request of many SO users instead of regex. Here is the code:This code prints all the links in console and I can successfully change them into absolute paths by using if-elif-else to differentiate "../../", "../", "/" and "//". But the problem is when I try to replace them using "re.sub" the whole html gets messed up again. I use BS4 instead of regex but still the same issue. Because of character count I can't post output here but for the sake of knowledge it also messes "" or any other html tag as well. Please suggest me any way to change these links and put them back where they need to be.NOTE: Code is most minimized as per akashkarothiya's advice.
Its final code and everything is working perfectly thanks to akash karothiya's solution.This code changes all kinds of relative links into absolute links in any given html code.    
I found a simpler solution with  because it accepts a function as the replace-with parameter.Haven't tested with multiple depth relative urls (e.g. ), but it should work just as fine.
