Natural Text
Here is my script:The end goal is simply a text file with 5000 randomly generated numbers in it that I would like to use in subsequent projects. When I run this little script I get the following error : I've reviewed the following sites to solve the problem myself : http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex16.htmlhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/os.htmlhttps://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.htmlAnd according to those, I am doing the correctly. The error is thrown specifically due to the "w" in "file = os.open('numbers.txt', 'w')" according to my IDE ( using JetBrain's PyCharm ). I feel like I am overlooking something trivial especially with how simple this script is... Any assistance would be thoroughly appreciated! :)
If you want to use os.open you have to use os flags to identify mode in which you are going to open file:The way you are trying to open file is correct for built in open methodGood Luck !
From the documentation you linked:If you just want to read or write a file see open().As I said in the comment, change this:To this:
Citing after Python docs available hereThis function is intended for low-level I/O. For normal usage, use the built-in function open(), which returns a “file object” with read() and write() methods (and many more). To wrap a file descriptor in a “file object”, use fdopen().You should use the built-in  function as others has said already.
