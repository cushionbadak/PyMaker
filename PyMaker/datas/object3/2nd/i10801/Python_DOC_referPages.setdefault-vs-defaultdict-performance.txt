I am writing code for an application where performance is important. I am wondering why  seems to be faster then .I would like to be able to use , mostly because i do not like the print output of the nested  (see implementation below).In my code, i need to test if  is already a key of the dict.Here are the two functions that i am testing:IPython input and output:    Why is  slower. I thought the underlying code would be the same. Is there a way to improve its speed?Thanks
According to user aneroid:It would make sense that  is faster that  since the former sets its default for the entire dict at creation time, whereas setdefault() does it per element when it is read. One reason to use setdefault is when the default you assign is based on the key (or something) rather than a generic default for the entire dict.
