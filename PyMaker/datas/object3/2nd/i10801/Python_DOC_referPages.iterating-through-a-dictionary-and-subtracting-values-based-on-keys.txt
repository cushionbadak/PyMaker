So I have a dictionary like the one below, however, I am trying to subtract ART[0][0] - ART[1][0] and this has to be an iteration. This is what I have, but it doesn't seem to work. I keep getting the error: 'KeyError: 2'Any help would be appreciated.Sample input:ART = {'U': (5, 6),  'E': (7, 3),  'A': (3, 3),  'O': (3, 2),  'I':  (1, 4)}
Dictionaries are accessed by the key name. See here for examples.For example,  would return . In your code, you're trying to access a key , because that's what  is equal to. However, there is no key named  in the dictionary.
It seems like you want to get all the combinations of keys from the dictionary. Dictionaries are unordered, so  does not have any meaning1). Instead, you can iterate the keys directly:Or shorter, using :1) Except if you have a key  in your dictionary, which you don't.
You mention in comments that you want to call items in the dictionary by an index. This is not possible because dictionaries are unordered. Dictionaries are for mapping a particular 'key' to a value that you stored against that key. If you  several times, you will see different ordering. I don't think you want a dictionary here and I believe you've picked letters to make keys for the sake of making keys.Python uses zero indexing. So  would miss the first item in a list if you were iterating through. You would want  to get all elements in the list, which can be written simply as .Finally, your code has , ,  (never used),  and . This makes things much harder to understand, especially when Python gives you so much flexibility in naming things.With those assumptions, I think you want a list of tuples as your data structure:
