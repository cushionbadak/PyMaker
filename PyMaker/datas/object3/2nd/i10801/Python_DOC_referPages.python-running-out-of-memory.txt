What would be good to improve this program to make it run more efficiently? Thank you!!
Not performance/memory related but you could replace:by: being a , it is iterable. https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#listAlso in Python 3, indexing dict values no longer work, you will end up with:Since items in  are json dicts, you may want to search for attributes by name instead of relying on attribute index:And then make it single-line:EDIT: actually since  reads the JSON string into a dictionary, the order or attributes is arbitrary, so when you access them by index you will very likely end up with a different attribute than the one you're looking for. Here you want read  I guess. I'd even guess that is why your code fails, since you give sklearn input he is not expecting.
