I have a program that spawns a bunch of worker daemons using the multiprocessing library. Sometimes these daemons will sporadically fall over and die. This isn't caused by a python-level Exception. The crashes seem to be totally silent...Can anyone provide tips on how I may go about debugging this issue?
The faulthandler library might help debug such behavior. Run this code in every process  method to save tracebacks into separate files:
