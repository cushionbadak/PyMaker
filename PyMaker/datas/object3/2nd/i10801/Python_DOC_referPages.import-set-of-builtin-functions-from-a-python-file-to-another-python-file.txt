Your question is a bit unclear. Basically, there are two things 'wrong'. First, your import statement is broken:This specifies a file name, not a module name - modules don't contain dots and extensions. This is important because dots indicate sub-modules of packages. Your statement is trying to import module  from package . Change it toSecond, there's no need to fetch builtins from another module. You can just import them again.If you really want to use  from , you can do so:Note that  and  in  are the exact same module.
if you want to import stuff from another file, you should use python modules.If you will create file named init.py then the execute folder becomes a module.After that you can useor you can usewhich imports all, but better solution is name everything you want to use explicitlyyou can find more about modules in documentation
