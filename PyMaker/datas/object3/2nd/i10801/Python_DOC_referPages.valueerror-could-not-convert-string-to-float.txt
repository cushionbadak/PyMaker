So... I have this primitive calculator that runs fine on my cellphone, but when I try to run it on Windows 10 I get...ValueError: could not convert string to floatI don't know what the problem is, I've tried using  but it doesn't work ether. Please keep in mind I'm green and am not aware of most methods for getting around a problem like this
your code only convert string that are integers like in below statementif you provide  as a input it will give the output as but if you provide  as input it will give And it is same with the case of  but the difference is that by default  takes input as a string and  takes input as what is provided to the function
I think this is happening because in some cases 'input' contains non-numerical characters. Python is smart and when a string only contains numbers, it can be converted from string to float. When the string contains non-numerical characters, it is not possible for Python to convert it to a float.You could fix this a few ways:Find out why and when there are non-numerical characters in your input and then fix it.Check if input contains numbers only with: isdecimal()Use a try/exceptisdecimal() example:UPDATE:Two-Bit-Alchemist had some great advice in the comments, so I put it in my answer.
