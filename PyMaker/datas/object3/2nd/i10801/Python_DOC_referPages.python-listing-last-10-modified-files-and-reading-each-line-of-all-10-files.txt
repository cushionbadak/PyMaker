List all files in a directory.2.) Grab the last 10 modified/latest files (preferably using a wildcard)3.) Read through each line of all 10 filesUsing shell commands I can:Using glob I am able to list the files and open a specific file but not sure how I can list only the last 10 modified files and feed the wildcard file list to the open function.

pythonic answer: use  with a lambda function, then use list slicing to get the 10 earliest or 10 latest or what have you.
What you are looking for is a fixed-size sorted buffer.  does this, albeit without the sorting. So, here's a buffer that'll do what you need, and  shows you how to use it
