This question already has an answer here:Does Python have a string 'contains' substring method?                    17 answers                This is my code:It's working, but only if  is "xyz". If  is "Bla bla bla xyz" then it's not working. What should I do if I want my script to dispaly "Found it!" even if  contains "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, eum ne maiorum volutpat, ei has erat  eruditi, autem fierent evertitur at has xyz Case simul persius id  mei, soleat laoreet assentior ea mel. Meis assum contentiones in cum,  est ornatus salutandi id. Sanctus labores ius ne."Sorry, but I'm new to Python :-/
All you have to do is change your ordering. You can use the operator 'in' to check if a string contains another string.
You can probably just use in operator or str.find: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#in https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=index#str.findBasically, you would do The in operator is probably the fastest way.The .find will return a number between 0 and string length -1 (to tell you the location of the string. However, if it cannot find the string, it returns a -1. So if it returns -1, then it isn't there, so anything other than -1 means it is.
