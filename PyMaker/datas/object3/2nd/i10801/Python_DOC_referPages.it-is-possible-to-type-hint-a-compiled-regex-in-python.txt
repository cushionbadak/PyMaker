I would like to use autocompletion for a pre-compiled and stored list of regular expressions, but it doesn't appear that I can import the _sre.SRE_Pattern class, and I can't programmatically feed the obtained type from type() to a comment of the format # type: classname or use it for a return -> classname style hintis there a way to explicitly import a class from the _sre.c thing?
You should use  and  which were specifically added to the typing module to accommodate this use case.Example:
