Lets say I created a class object someClassObject in function A, and threw that object into a function B:How do I retain all the modifications I've made in function B to someClassObject so I can continue using someClassObject in function A if my function B cannot return anything?My function B is a recursive function and I can't think of anyways to have it return my someClassObject
I'm pretty sure that happens by default when you create a class:
if you pass a class object (generally any object) around, it stays one single object so all changes to it are visible for all references to it.for example inA() returns 2
I presume you meant instance of a class when you meant class object, in Python even a class is an object and you can pass them like instances.In Python all objects are passed by reference meaning when you pass an instance to a function you only pass a reference and all changes you make to the object will be preserved.If you meant instance of a class than the example is:
