If I had this Python script:What would I have to replace [name of self] with in order to have the function get_name to return 'this_is_the_name_im_looking_for'?I need this because I'm creating a Python module and want to feed back which instance of this class they're using
The built-in python method  returnsan integer which is guaranteed to be unique and constant for this object during its lifetime.This doesn't return the 'name' of the object per-se, but it will allow you to distinguish between different instances of the class.  This also solves the problem of having multiple pointers to the same object since the id is associated with the underlying object (the address of the object in memory):
