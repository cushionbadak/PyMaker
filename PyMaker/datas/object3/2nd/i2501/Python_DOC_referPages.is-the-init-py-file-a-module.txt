Is   file is a module ? I am learning python and come across packages and modules and i have one doubt that weather  file can be consider as module Since every python file is module so can we consider  as module ?
According to the official glossary a module isAn object that serves as an organizational unit of Python code. Modules have a namespace containing arbitrary Python objects. Modules are loaded into Python by the process of importing.Which (imho) borders on gibberish for saying " objects or files with Python code."Since even an empty  file contains valid Python code, and you can import it via , it would technically be considered a module.I don't know how this knowledge could be useful.
