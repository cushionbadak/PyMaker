I have the following python code to calculate how many days, hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds an amount of marsdays is. I want the output to be: x sols = x days, x hours, x minutes, x seconds, x millisecondsI found out I had to use timedelta because it uses milliseconds, which I need.I have written the following code but it doesn't give a correct output for the values. When they're >60 they need to be passed on because 60 seconds equals 1 hour. But the values can go >60. for example, when I enter a value >1, like 4, I get the aswer: 4 sol =  4 days, 2 hours, 38 minutes, 7220 seconds, 976 milliseconds.The hours, minutes and milliseconds are calculated this way because timedelta can't give them apparently. exist, but don't exist. which I don't understand because I can give them values as seen on line 2.I think the way I try to achieve what i want isn't correct.
I think if you use "seconds" as a floating point number instead of the  library it will work better. The  library has a lot of assumptions around Earth dates and times that won't really be valid on Mars.
