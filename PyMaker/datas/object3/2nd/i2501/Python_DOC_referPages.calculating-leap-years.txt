This question already has an answer here:How to determine whether a year is a leap year?                    7 answers                I have an assignment that is supposed to calculate whether a year that the user inputs is in fact a leap year. I cannot figure out the formula for this. Can anyone help? I can figure out the rest of the code but here is what is needed:The month of February normally has 28 days. But if it is a leap year, February has 29 days.Write a program that asks the user to enter a year. The program should then display thenumber of days in February that year. Use the following criteria to identify leap years:1. Determine whether the year is divisible by 100. If it is, then it is a leap year if and onlyif it is also divisible by 400. For example, 2000 is a leap year, but 2100 is not.2. If the year is not divisible by 100, then it is a leap year if and only if it is divisible by 4.For example, 2008 is a leap year, but 2009 is not.
Or without import:

Use the following criteria to identify leap years...The assignment contains the logic/steps in prose; write the steps in comments and then convert the comments to code.I've done the first bit below, including the relevant "comment instructions". Now write the code below each comment. Among other things, the code should contain  and use the  (modulus) operator.To structure code cleaner, consider putting the comments/logic inside a function:Coding takes a lot of practice .. so practice :)
