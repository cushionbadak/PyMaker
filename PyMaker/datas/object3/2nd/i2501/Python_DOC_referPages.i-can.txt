I'm using python 3.6 and I'm trying to do a program that requires arguments, but I can not use it because I can't pass the arguments. Another question: I can't understand the  parameter; is it to create a variable with that name?IÂ´m getting this error, when trying to use it (I use hi and bye as examples)
As @Dawit's answer correctly points out, the issue is with . The built-in action  has an automatic default of , and sets the value of the argument in the namespace to  if the flag is found. It does not accept any arguments to the flag.If you want to accept an argument to the flag, you have to use an action like .If you want to error-check or convert your argument on the spot, pass  to . You can convert to a type like , or just check your argument. For example, you could have a function  that would be parse the argument string to a more easily managed object, or raise an error if the format didn't match. Then you could do .The  argument simply provides the name of the output attribute in the namespace to assign the value to. This is normally taken from the long name of the flag or positional argument. So for  the output variable would default to  and for  it would default to . Sometimes you want to use an alternative output variable though.
This worked for me:Changing  to
