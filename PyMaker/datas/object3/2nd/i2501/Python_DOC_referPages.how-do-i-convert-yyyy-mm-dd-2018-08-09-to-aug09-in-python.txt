I'm plotting a graph with anaconda and it's taking a start_dt = x1[0] and end_dt = x1[29]. There are 30 values on the x axis. Right now, the date getting picked is already in Aug09 form. But I want to switch to another file where the dates are in yyyy-mm-dd form. How do I change the format of the date when it's getting passed to the state_dt and end_dt?
