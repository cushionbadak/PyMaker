I am trying to write a Card class and I want to make sure that I can use comparison operators on it, as well as use max,min,sort of list of my  objects.I read that to accomplish this I just need to implement  but when I did that my unit tests would not pass, so I ended up implementing all of the comparison magic methods ,,, etc.I want to get rid of bloat in my code and remove all of comparison methods expect for  if possible.I am using Python 3.5 Anaconda distribution.This is my current implementation:Originally instead of all the magic methods that I have now I had :My unit tests(using pytest):
 no longer exists, so that's not an option. That said, you can implement only  and , then use the  decorator to fill in the rest:If you can move to 3.7, you might want to look at the  module which can handle code generation for equality and comparisons very easily, which (if combined with the  module to properly order your ranks and suits for free), would remove most of your custom code entirely, leaving only a half dozen lines or so.
