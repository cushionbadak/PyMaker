I am stuck in finding how I can take the "k" in consideration to solve the following problem. Basically, it should start at index k and look for the lowest value in the range from k until the end of the list.
One-liner solution is this:You select the minimal element from A[k:], find its index in A[k:] and add k to it to compensate the search area.A slightly neater solution is this:
You can use  to keep track of the original index before you slice the list with  as the starting index:so that:would output:
You could use enumerate to find the index of min:Output
You can add  to the index calculated from a sliced input list:
