I am working with the skimage.feature.greycomatrix to calculate the image's GLCM(Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix),   but when I use:in  shell - it works. See imageBut when I use it in my sublime Text 3, thenit will report an error:(See picture of Sublime Text error)Can anyone tell me why this happens and how I can solve it?My code:enter image description here
You were running Python with the  flag, which discards docstrings, replacing them with .  includes code that, during initialization, parses the docstring of one function to set the docstrings of a bunch of other functions. This fails when docstrings have been discarded. Running Python without the  flag avoids the issue.It looks like similar issues may have been encountered and fixed in other parts of the scikit-image codebase; I see a few places that already check for docstrings being set to , such as in . To make  compatible with , a similar check for a  docstring would have to be added to that module.  does a bit more than just docstring handling, though, so we can't just skip the whole thing if we don't have docstrings.
