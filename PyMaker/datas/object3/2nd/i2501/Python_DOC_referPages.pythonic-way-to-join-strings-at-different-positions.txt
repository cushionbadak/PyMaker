I have a string that contains numbers. The string needs to separate the numbers by chunks of 3. If necessary, the last chunk, or the last two chunks can contain 2 numbers (but never 1). Examples:Working with chunks of three is straight forward:How can I extend this?
I made a simple program that would be easy to understand, to solve this problem. You can do it as:
Another way to describe your condition is: "Break everything up into chunks of three. If the last chunk has one element, grab one off the chunk before".  provides a nice tool for breaking the strings up:

This problem would be most easily solved by a regular expression. You can use  with the following regex to find either one or two groups of double digits at the end of the string or triple digits elsewhere, and then use join the non-empty groups with  using a generator expression:so that:would output:
