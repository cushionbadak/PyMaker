This question already has an answer here:Print statements without new lines in python?                    5 answers                When hitting run on IDLE Python this is the output i get: Python IDLE OutputBut when I run it on an online GUI such as trinket.io this is the output: Trinket.io OutputI want it to display the output on IDLE like it does on trinket.io, how do i do that? As you can see IDLE makes a new line for every dot
trinket is using python 2in python 3 the comma thing to keep in the same line doesn't work, you have to replace it with the  parameter:This python 2 linebecomesin python 3
This solved it, the issue was that trinket was using Python 2 and IDLE was using 3.7. trinket is using python 2in python 3 the comma thing to keep in the same line doesn't work, you have to replace it for the end= parameter:This python 2 lineprint ("."),  becomesprint (".", end=" ")
