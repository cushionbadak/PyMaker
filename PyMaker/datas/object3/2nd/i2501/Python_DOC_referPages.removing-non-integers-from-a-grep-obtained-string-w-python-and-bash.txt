Natural Text
I am using  to grab the text out of a file:and I need to save the number as a variable. I have tried a handful of methods I have found here such as using filters and . For some reason I can only get it to separate one zero.So far the code looks like this:And in return I get ['0'].
The result of os.system is the exit status of the command, not the output of the command -- see https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.systemThe "NELECT" line was just printed by grep to stdout, but not captured in the result variableOr, don't call out to grep, read the file yourselfOr, maybe don't use a regular expression:
Are you sure that  has output specified? For me this regex returns list with two elements:  and that's expected behavior. So most probably there is something wrong with grep call.Your regex won't retrieve whole  as  catches only continuous digit strings, no dot symbols. To get whole number use something like  which means: any word ( means word beginning/ending, dot must be escaped as  in regex matches any character) that contains at least 1 digit, dot and at least 1 more digit. If dot is optional, then something like this:  ( creates group that will not be captured so your output will still be single element list).Note that  will return list of string matches. To retrieve number from first match: Edit. Forgot to add: avoid using print statement, it works oddly with tuples and is completely removed in Python 3. Python 2 support ends in 2020 so it's better to prepare. You can replace print statement with Python 3 print function by adding  at the file beginning.
