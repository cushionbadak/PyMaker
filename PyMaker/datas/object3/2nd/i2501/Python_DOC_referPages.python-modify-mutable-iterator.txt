The code is like following:When I doIt will print line by line of file.But when I modified the test.txt file and saved it, the next(file) still printed the original file content.Does iterator store the complete file in the memory?If not why the content of the file didn't get updated?
No, as an iterator the  object stores only a look-ahead buffer, not the complete file, in memory. This makes it efficient for large files.Since there is this look-ahead buffer, changes made to the file won't be reflected to the  method. However, you can use the  method to clear this buffer so the next call to the  method will return the updated content:
Let's suppose open() reads 2 letters at a time. (Actual value is io.DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE)You've created a file object,  which, oversimplified, is like You've created a iterator of  with data like this: next() has went through the first item of , read it, and printed it.Let's learn from an example.Reading normallytest.txtWe will open the file, iter(), and list() to open and iter through all of it and make a list.Just as expected.File changes after We've opened the file.We will now append  to test.txt.test.txtand then iter() and list() it.The changed contents are seen. We can see that  does not actually read the file.File changes after We've opened the file and d.We will now append test.txtand then  list() it.The changed contents are seen. We can also see that  does not actually read the file.
