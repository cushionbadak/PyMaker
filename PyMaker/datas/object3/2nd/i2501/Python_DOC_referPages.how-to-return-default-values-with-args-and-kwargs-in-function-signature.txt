This question already has an answer here:Calling a Python function with *args,**kwargs and optional / default arguments                    2 answers                I'm trying to wrap my head around using  and  in Python 3 (Python 3.7.0) but I'm running into some issues with my understanding.Here is a simple function I have:And test it to see what is returned:What I don't understand is, what happened to  in the first print statement? I can see it is being overridden by the  in  but I'm unsure why.How can I rewrite this function so the default value is not overridden, or am I missing something with how the parameters are passed from the function signature to the return statement? I tried looking here and here but did not find the answers I was looking for. As I thought putting the default values before the  and  would prevent the overwriting. 
 only captures any positional arguments not otherwise defined;  does not mean  can't be used as a positional argument. So  is assigned the first positional argument.You can prevent  being used as a positional argument by making it a keyword-only argument. You do this by placing the argument after the  var-positional catch-all parameter, or if you don't have a  parameter, after a  single asterisk:orNow  won't capture positional arguments any more:You don't have to have a  keyword catch-all either:but if it is present, it needs to be listed last.Keyword-only arguments do not have to have a default value, the  can be omitted, but then the parameter becomes mandatory, and can only be specified in a call by using :
Hmm,  is the first positional argument in your function definition, so naturally it binds to the first actual positional argument at callsite, which is 1.
