I have a string , I would like 4 unique characters to be generated randomly every time I run the program.The result should give something like:I could use  but it would require a  to be used instead, are there ways of achieving the same result using a ?
You can indeed use ; it'll give you a list, but it's easy enough to join the resulting list into a string:
You can use the functions provided by Python's  module.Use  to extract a random set of characters from the string and then  them:
You can do this using random then join your resulting list with '' to create a string:For input, you can use a string as in Python a string is also a list (list of characters) 
There are 3 solutions (and probably 100 more):The"classic"  method appending everyone of the  letters to the same string and the  method of the  module that picks one element among its arguments,Using the   to add in one time the elements generated by the  method of the  module. The  method is very versatile and can be used with several arguments (official documentation),Using the   to add in one time the elements generated by the  method of the  module. The method picks randomly  elements in .Method1Method2Method3
