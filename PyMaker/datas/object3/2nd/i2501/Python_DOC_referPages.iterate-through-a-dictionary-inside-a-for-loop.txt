I'm trying to print the values of a dictionary inside a for loop, currently this is what I'm getting:I have tried indexing the values inside the for loop, but I haven't had luck with this:This is the content of my dictionary:This is what I'm aiming for:Any suggestions?
Inside your  you have the following linesAt each iteration you assign i to be 0, then print the i-th element of  and then increase its value by one.The same will happen for the next iterations.So, to fix it,  should be moved outside the loop.
Other than the  problem, there are some major issues with your for-loop:Every time you iterate, you copy the ENTIRE list of values, just to access a single element. is a key in the  dict. There are ways to ask for the value associated with a key. Go over the tutorial and the documentation for .When iterating over a dict, if you want both keys and values, you should use , not . Sample code:When you pass  to , you are passing the function named .  is a function that takes in an object and tells you what type it has. However, when you pass , you are just passing the function itself. Is that really what you want? You need to call the function on an object to get its type.I recommend reviewing the material, or finding a tutor to explain to you what each part of your code does. Prepare some questions beforehand.
