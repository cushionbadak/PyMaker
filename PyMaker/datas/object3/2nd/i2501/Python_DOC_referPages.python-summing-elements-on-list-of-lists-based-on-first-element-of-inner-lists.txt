I have a listI require the output from summing the second element in each sublist for a unique first element. In this case it is:Where  is summing the second element of  and .What would be the most efficient way to do this for say lists of length 1,000.
Accumulate with a :Note that the value for 2 was automatically "promoted" to a float by addition, even though this is a defaultdict of int.  This is to match the desired output posted in the question, but I think you should consider to use homogeneous output types rather than a mix of int and float.
Using Pandas, you can retain the original 'order' of the data:
Will this work?Output:
You can get away with sorting and :This will not preserve the original order of the keys.
