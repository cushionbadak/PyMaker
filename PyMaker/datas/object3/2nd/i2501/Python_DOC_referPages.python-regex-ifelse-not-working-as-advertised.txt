This question already has an answer here:Checking whole string with a regex                    5 answers                I'm trying to educate myself on how the  pattern matching works in python and so created the following test from the documentation. As near as I can tell it's not working per documentation but I've learned to assume I missed a critical step somewhere.In this test case the third item should fail because it's missing its closing '>'.Relevant:Will try to match with   if the group with given id or name exists, and with no-pattern if it  doesnâ€™t.  is optional and can be omitted. For example,   is a poor email matching pattern,  which will match with '' as well as '',  but not with '' nor ''.So my question is, what step did I miss? Tried on different python versions and hosts/os.
You're using , asking whether the string contains a match for your regex, rather than asking whether it is a match.  contains a match, specifically .Use  rather than .
