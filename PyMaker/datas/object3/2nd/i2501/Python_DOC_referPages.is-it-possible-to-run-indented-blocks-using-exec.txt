Using the  python command, is it possible to run indented blocks of code (Like  statements or ). For example:At the moment I am using this to run the code:Also I know that this isn't very "Pythonic" or "Good practise" to let the user input their own code but it will be useful in other parts of my code.
The problem here isn't the indentation. The problem is that you're trying to  the lines of a compound statement one by one. Python can't make sense of a compound statement without the whole thing. the whole input as a single unit:
From exec() documentation:This function supports dynamic execution of Python code. object must be either a string or a code object. If it is a string, the string is parsed as a suite of Python statements which is then executed ...Thus, you can do things likeYou just need to follow the right syntax and indentation.
Another way of formatting code within an exec() function is to use triple quotes, which makes it easy to see what the code looks like.This would maybe not work if you're asking the user to input the code, but it's a trick that may come in handy.
