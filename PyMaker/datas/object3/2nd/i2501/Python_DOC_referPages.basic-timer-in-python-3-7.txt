Due to my poor knowledge of Stack Overflow, Python and general writing skills I didn't specify the fact that I am using the pygame module. I'm very sorry for my lack of understanding and will aim to improve.Started learning Python about 2-3 days ago. Recently encountered an issue with my implementation of a timer. I was using , but later found that this actually pauses the code for 10 seconds, whereas I need it to count 10 seconds. Is there a way I could achieve this? Many thanks in advance.EDIT: I understand now that the term 'timer' is probably not best suited. What I'm actually trying to do is create a cooldown of 10 seconds.
Edit 2: Cooldown:The following code Edit: This might be what you want:This one counts up from 1 to 10. You can reverse it byFirst answer belowThis is one way you could do a basic timer in python:This now prints (approx)  because it took 10 seconds to run the above code. You could also look at s %timeit!AddendumYou could also make this even bigger, and make a  class, like so:Now you can just run  followed by  and  to start and stop the timer respectively (multiple times(!)), and then  to see all the recorded times. E.g.
The issue I think you are running into is that your code runs sequentially. If you are looking to have some code running at the same time as the rest of your code runs (kind of like being in the background) you could use a Threading.However, if you are doing this as a cooldown system in a game I would recommend storing , which gives the current time in seconds, when the action is first taken. When they try to do the action again you can compare the current time to your stored time and see if they have passed the cooldown ().
you can set timer using :class threading.TimerA thread that executes a function after a specified interval has passed.
