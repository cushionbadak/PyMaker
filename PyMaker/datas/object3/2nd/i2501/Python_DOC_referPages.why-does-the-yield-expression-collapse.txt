I was messing around and noticed that the following code yields the value once, while I was expecting it to return a generator object. My question is what is the  of the  expression and also why are we allowed to nest yield expression if the yield expression  collapses?
The value of the  expression after resuming depends on the method which resumed the execution. If  is used (typically via either a  or the  builtin) then the result is . Otherwise, if  is used, then the result will be the value passed in to that method.So this:Is equivalent to this:Which in this case (since you're not using ) is equivalent to this:Your code is only looking at the first item yielded by the generator. If you instead call  to consume the whole sequence, you'll see what I describe:Output:If we iterate the generator manually (as you have), but  it values, then you can see that  "returns" this value:Output:
