You are misunderstanding how the  module works.  is a special module that is built into the python interpreter and changes how the interpreter parses and/or executes your code. In order for a  import to have the desired effect, it must be of the form(See PEP 236 for the exact specification.)However, in addition to the  module that's built into the interpreter,  also a real module in the standard library! The import  actually does two things: It enables the new division behavior, and it imports the feature specification from the real  module. This is what you'll see if you take a look at the value of  after the import:When you do , you're simply importing this variable. But you're not enabling the new division behavior.
