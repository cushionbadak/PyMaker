I have the following dict:I have a multitude of such dics, all with the same keys but different values.Now I would like to merge them into one dic, preserving the keys.I therefore looked at this question:How can I combine dictionaries with the same keys in python?However when I do:... I get:TypeError: string indices must be integersDo you understand why and how to fix it ?
Would suggest using defaultdict and appending values of same key to it
