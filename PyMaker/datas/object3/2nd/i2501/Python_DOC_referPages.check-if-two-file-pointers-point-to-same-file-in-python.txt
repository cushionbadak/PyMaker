How do I check if two file pointers point to the same file or not.My use case is I am watching a file for changes and doing something, but logback rolls over this file to old date and creates a new file. But the file pointer variable in python is still pointing to the old file. If , I would like to update  to new file.Why  doesn't work?When I tried, even then the name still is the old one.
 is available on Windows and UNIX, and comparing the inode number (file serial number) and device ID uniquely identify a file within the system: is the inode number which identifies the file uniquely on a drive. However, the same inode number can exist on different drives, which is why the  (device ID) is used to distinguish which drive/disk/device the file is on.
