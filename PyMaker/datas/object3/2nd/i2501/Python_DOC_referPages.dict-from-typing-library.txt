This question already has an answer here:What are Type hints in Python 3.5                    3 answers                I have seen people using I would like to know what is this function for and what is the "->" for? I understand that it take the dictionary with value "cha" which is in list of dictionaries and convert it to list list of dictionaries. Is my understanding above a correct one? If no, could someone please show me some simple example?
That is Python's type hinting. It's just syntactic sugar to help the developer reading your code get a sense of what type of input your function is expecting and what type of output it should return. Types to the left of  denote the input type, and types to the right of  denote the return type. In your example,  is a function that is supposed to accept a list named  which contains dictionaries and return a list which contains lists which in turn contain dictionaries. Something like this,That being said, Python is still a dynamically typed language and type hints don't add any compiler optimizations to your code. All type checking still happens at runtime. There is nothing stopping you from violating type hints of your function, which means I could pass any type of argument to  and it would still try to use it as valid input.
