I have a code like:If I wanted to use a  loop instead:How can I replace the  final / general case in the  example above ()?And above all, which one of the two forms performs better?
Just add an  suite to the  loop:The  suite in a  loop is only executed if the  loop ended without ending early with . See the  statement documentation:When the items are exhausted [...], the suite in the  clause, if present, is executed, and the loop terminates.A  statement executed in the first suite terminates the loop without executing the  clauseâ€™s suite.To see which one performs better, you'd have to time them using . However, unless you are executing a critical code section in a tight loop, please stick with  as the  combo is not well known and will leave many programmers not aware of the semantics scratching their head. Moreover, for your toy example, you'd use regular expressions over a  test or  loop anyway.Timing these two trivial examples:shows that there is just 1.8 microsecond between them. If I re-run the samples a few times, one or the other example wins by similar extremely small margins. That doesn't really make one or the other fastest, so you can consider them equal in this case. However, if you do have a need to micro-optimise such a section, you need to do your own timings.
