I am making a tron-like game, two players control their character with keys w,a,s,d for player1 and player2 controls their character with up,down,left,right. On player movement, the user makes a trail and if the opposing player touches the trail of the player, they are "out".Code for the game:On each keypress, the users trail gets appended to a list then it gets looped through to check if there is a collision. Now it seems to only pick up the collision if the player's first trail touches, nothing else.Code for steel2D (My game engine):Any help would be appreciated.
There are several problems: is the wrong function if you want to compare the head rects with each rect in  and . You will only get pairs of rects at the same indices and also drop elements of the longer list. Take a look at this example:Just iterate over the rects in the trail lists and check if  or  collide with them.You append the same  objects (, ) to the trail lists when you move, so the lists only contain references to the head rects and therefore only the heads of the trails are able to collide.Append (shallow) copies instead:Side note: Collision is spelled incorrectly.
