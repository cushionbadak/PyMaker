I'm struggling with a  error on my application. The point is that I don't really understand why this error is thrown as I already handle it:The point here is that, when I run into this code, I have some "module-level" DoesNotExist that is thrown away, as if this try/except block is never hit: 
Consider using QuerySet.get_or_create, which shall eliminate the problem above.Also, please note, that if you access class inside the @staticmethod it makes sense to update it to be @classmethod. Also, in the question you are having:instead of     from django.db import models
