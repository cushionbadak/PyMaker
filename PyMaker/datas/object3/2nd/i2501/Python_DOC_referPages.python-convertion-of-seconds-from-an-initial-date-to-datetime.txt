I would like to have them in date time.I know in MatLab the function would beHowever, I struggle to find an equivalent function in Python.I have tried:   doesn't work because 'module object has no attribute fromordinal'? doesn't work (I have a matrix because there are many scans done)https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html
You will first have to create a datetime object for Jan 1st 1993 and then add the number of seconds to that date. The code below should help you get started.output: datetime.datetime(1993, 1, 1, 2, 46, 40)
