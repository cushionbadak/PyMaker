Can someone explain the rules of joining path, I am confusing with these results:  
An absolute path (like ) replaces the current path, rather than being appended to it.
From [Python 3]: os.path.join(path, *paths):...  If a component is an absolute path, all previous components are thrown away and joining continues from the absolute path component.On Windows, the drive letter is not reset when an absolute path component (e.g., ) is encountered. If a component contains a drive letter, all previous components are thrown away and the drive letter is reset. Note that since there is a current directory for each drive,  represents a path relative to the current directory on drive  , not .So (in ), the last absolute path (and UNC path is absolute) discards any other path preceding it.
