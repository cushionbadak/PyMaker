Natural Text
I am writing a program for counting the approximate number of words in the file and getting an error stating . How can I eliminate this error?Below is the traceback of above error:Here is my code:
You need to use the  function instead, and pass it an encoding.Try this:
The error message says that it tries to use ASCII decoding. You may need to specify a different encoding.The only part of your program I can see where encoding can come in is the  call. According to the docs, if you don't pass in an encoding explicitly,The default encoding is platform dependent (whatever  returns)Try passing in  to the  call.
I believe every encoding out there encodes the space character as  (out of experience, not with solid evidence). If all you need to do is count words, you can skip the decoding process by checking the number of  bytes in the file, then add 1 to it. This simple method will get you an approximate.With that method, you might have to consider subtracting the number of spaces at the very beginning or end of the file, since that means there is no word surrounding that space. UTF-16 encodes space as  so there might be a null byte at the beginning or end of the file if the document starts or ends with a space. Also some encodings put a byte order mark at the beginning of the file, in which case the text doesn't start from the beginning.You can't use regex with this method so it will not work if you want to parse documents in non-latin based languages.
