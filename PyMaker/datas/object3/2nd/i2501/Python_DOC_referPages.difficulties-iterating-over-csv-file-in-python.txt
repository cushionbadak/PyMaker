I'm trying to add up all the values in a given row in a CSV file with Python but have had a number of difficulties doing so. Here is the closest I've come:Instead of yielding the sum of all the values in row[1], the final print statement is yielding only the last number in the row. What am I doing incorrect?I've also stumbled with bypassing the header (the next() that I've seen widely used in other examples on SO seem to be from Python 2, and this method no longer plays nice in P3), so I just manually, temporarily changed the header for that column to 0. Any help would be much appreciated.
total should be moved to outside the for loop.indents are important in Python.  E.g. the import line should be pushed to left-most.

You are resetting your total, try this:
As others have already stated, you are setting the value of  on every iteration. You can move  outside of the loop or, alternatively, use :
