I recently upgraded Django from 2.0.7 to 2.1.1, a new error occurs in which I get this error . I'd like to understand if my fix is right and what caused this new error to happen, I couldn't find anything on the django release notes related to this issue, maybe I missed it. decorators.pyHow it is used, views.py: For the fix I just removed , but I'm not sure if it'll break something else.Can someone explain?
Rather than manually copy things across, use the  decorator to handle this for you:The  decorator (via the  function it calls knows how to handle  objects correctly (or rather, it can handle the fact that  objects have no  attribute).It's fine that the wrapped  object found on the  class doesn't have a  attribute, what's not fine is that you then don't copy that attribute at all even when you are decorating functions that do have the attribute. If you don't want to use  you'd have to manually copy the attribute across and handle the exception yourself:but take into account that this doesn't copy the ,  and  attributes, doesn't handle any custom attributes set on  (which other decorators might rely on).  does take care of all of those, plus it sets the  attribute on the decorator wrapper function that would let you unwrap the decorator again.
