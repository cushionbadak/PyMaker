I was going through this question : How do I return the definition of a class in python?But I am unable to display the class definition. I am getting the below error:Can someone please advise what am I doing wrong here? Thanks.
The  function only works if there is a text file available to load the source code.You typed the definition of the class into the interactive interpreter, which doesn't keep the original source around when compiling that source into in-memory class and code objects.Put your class definition into a module, import the module, and then use . works by first finding the module for a given object (for classes, by looking at the  attribute for the module name, then getting the module via ) then seeing if the module has a  attribute from which a readable source file can be determined. If there is such a filename and it can be read, then the  module reads that file to then search for the  line and giving you all lines from that point on with same or deeper indentation. The interactive interpreter executes everything in the  module and there is no  attribute for the interpreter, so any attempts at loading source code for objects defined there will simply fail.If you just wanted to know what members the class defines, use  or  on the object instead. You don't need to see the full source code for that information.
