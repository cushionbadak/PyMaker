I am attempting to read in CSV data and map it to the following XML structure. In my first attempt, I have used % operator for string formatting, which works.However, I am hoping to populate the  with a generated uuid, that I can then reference elsewhere. I'm not able to get this to work.I tried adding  just before the return statement and update I get a 'not all arguments converted during string formatting' errorSo I attempted to use f-strings formattingand get another error stating invalid syntax in regards to the closing I guess my questions are which string formatting style is the best option when dealing with UUID and what is wrong with my code? Plus, if I wish to reference the generated uuid in other generated xml structures - I will ultimately create an xml file with the multiple generated xml structure content.Thank you for any assistance 
To @deceze's point you were missing some formatting in your code shown.I believe what your looking for is something like this?CodeResultsGithub: Code was added to my Repo.
