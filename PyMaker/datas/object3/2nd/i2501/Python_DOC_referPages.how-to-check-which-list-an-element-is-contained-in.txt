DISCLAIMER: I am not asking how to check if an element is contained within a list. I am asking how to check which list an element is contained in.Consider this code:I want to print the name of the list that variable  is a part of (the program should print , , or just nothing at all)How would I determine which list the inputted word is a part of?

I would use a data structure designed for quick lookup. Presumably, none of your lists will contain conflicting elements. In that case, the elements are perfect candidates for dictionary keys. This calls for the relatively arcane method :Now you have a dictionary that will immediately tell you where a word belongs:I'd probably stick this into a class to manage the dictionary, lists and lookup. You could register a list under any name that way:Part of what you need to remember is that python variables can be bound to any number of names. That's why I suggest explicitly stating what name you want to return for each list. It doesn't have to be related to the name of the variable at all.
The first statement constructs the tuple of pairs of type , the second is the list comprehension which as a side effect prints the name(s) of the appropriate list(s).
