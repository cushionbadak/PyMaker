I've been using some great answers on Stack Overflow to help solve my problem, but I've hit a roadblock.What I'm trying to do Read values from rows of CSVWrite the values from the CSV to Unique PDFsWork through all rows in the CSV file and write each row to a different unique PDFWhat I have so farThe code above works if:I specify the PDF that I want to write toI specify the output file name The CSV only has 1 rowWhat I need help withReading values from the CSV one row at a time and storing them as a variable to writeSelect a unique PDF, and write the values from above, then save that file and select the next unique PDFLoop through all rows in a CSV and end when the last row has been reachedAdditional Info: the unique PDFs will be contained in a folder as they each have the same layout but different barcodesAny help would be greatly appreciated!
I would personally suggest that you reconsider using Pandas and instead try the standard CSV module. It will meet your need for streaming through a file for row-by-row processing. Shown below is some code looping through a CSV file getting each row as a dictionary, and processing that in a  function, as well as logic that will get you a new filename to write the PDF to for each row.I'm going to leave the PDF writing to you because I think you understand what you need from that better than I do.I known I cut out the Pandas part, but I think the issue are having with that, and how it doesn't work for a CSV with more than 1 row stems from  being an operation that retrieve an entire column.Python CSV module docspandas DataFrame docs
