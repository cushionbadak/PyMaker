I know how to cast to a string, but how does casting to a string actually work? Like if I were to write my own function in python to replace the current str() function how would I do that?
 as a typeYou cannot replace the  type. It is a base type which cannot be mimicked with a Python class without using  itself.In the same way, you could not write an  class without using  as it is your builtin way to represent cardinal values.This happens because Python is a high-level language. You can think of it as an API for using a lot of well-crafted C functions, in the case of CPython. This means you do not have access to key components such as pointers, bit manipulation and memory allocation that would allow you to reimplement some types such as ,  or  without somehow using them in the process. castAt a more basic level, if what you want is to know how the piping for casting to a string works, it is relatively straightforward.The function  will call the  method of the object to cast. If it does not exist, it falls back on .It is the responsibility of the object to format a  to be returned by its  method.
You could use the dunder method  to override that of , and return an intelligible message.example:outputs:Without the  method, it would revert to using the  one, and the output would be something like this:Here is a link to the Python Data Model  partand a link to the python documentation about  objectswhere you will find additional background information.
