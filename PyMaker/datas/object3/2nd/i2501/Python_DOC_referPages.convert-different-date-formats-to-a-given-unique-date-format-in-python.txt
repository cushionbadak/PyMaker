I have different date formats present as strings those are:I want to convert them into a single yyyy-mm-dd ("2018-06-22") format. I can split and then do the reformatting but I am looking for a more better way. Thanks in advance!
The module  does exactly what you need:OUTPUT:2018-06-22  2018-06-22  2017-12-15  2015-12-24  You can have a look at the module, or directly install it:formatters should be the same as datetime.
