Say I have a string:How could I remove all the digits except for ones trailed with a period using Regex (or any other method)?Ideal outcome:I'm a Regex beginner and have only tried  but this highlights what I want to keep.I'd like to keep digits in the form of , , etcThank you.
You could also use  as your expression. This is an example of a look ahead, essentially asking if the next character is not a '.' then consider it.If you are looking to have multiple digits such as 41. then you could also use I would look here for an example of look behinds and look aheads as well as having a play here to test it.Demo Good luck!
We can try matching on the following pattern:Here, we match some optional whitespace, followed by any number of digits, which in turn are followed by any character other than dot.  We capture this non dot character, and then use it in the replacement.DemoI assume that the digits you want to retain never have a decimal component.
