Natural Text
I want to read a file that has data:So I want an array "iage0[1]" to read "5 and "iage15[1]=5.4".  The header can be skipped.  Then iage0[2] = 4.3 etc... for each row.  So an array is just a column.  I thought "f.readlines(3)" would read line 3, but it seems to still read the first line.  Somehow I need to split the line into separate values.Here is my code, I don't know how to split up the "content" or read the next line.  Sorry for the simple question but I just started coding yesterday.  
I assume this is similar to what you're looking for. (Python 3.6)You can also use DictReader
