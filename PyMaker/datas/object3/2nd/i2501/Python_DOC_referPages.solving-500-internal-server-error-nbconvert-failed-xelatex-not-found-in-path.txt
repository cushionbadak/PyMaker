Whenever I try to export a Jupyter notebook as a PDF I get the following error in a separate window:I am running macOS Sierra 10.12.6.Things I have tried:Re-installing nbconvert through pip (in the Jupyter notebook) and conda (terminal)Installing xelatex for MacRe-installing MactexInstalling pandoc (both through pip and through "conda install -c conda-forge pandoc")RunningYields:I located the directory containing xelatex as per @einsweniger suggestion here: /usr/local/texlive/bin/x86_64-darwin.  I copied and pasted XeLatex into the bin directory above, and get a new error:I also put xelatex.fmt in the directory, but am still getting the error. 
I'm not accustomed with Mac install paths, from what the basictex faq says, I gather the executeables should live in Running  in a terminal might also help finding where the command is, but that only works if the directory is already in your PATH variable.Another method would be running  if it is not within your PATH so you might find it that way (might take a while as this will search you whole harddrive).Once you've found it and added the path to your PATH variable, you should also check if the jupyter has the correct PATH by runningwithin a notebook.
I've run into similar issues in the past with paths in python when using tensorflow in Windows and Linux.  As is pointed out by others, using PATH is the way to go (i.e update in .bashrc if it was linux), but I've found the code below to resolve path issues on a script by script basis.essentially would check PATH for what it is you are looking for and then adds it if it is missing.  You probably don't even need the 'if' statement.Perhaps not the most practical way has worked well for me where I know the path in question is perhaps a 'rarely used' or 'one time use' PATH add...So as was pointed out in comments above (and I think you already have) find the location of the file and add its location using the above code.

I encountered the same issue. As people previously stated, the problem lies in that xlatex isn't found in your PATH environment variable. A solution that worked for me was to run the following from the notebook:Or in a command line simply:And then run the export to pdf from a command line (within your virtual environment if there is one in place) as follows:This should create a pdf of your notebook on the same directory it is running.
If there is an update available maybe try and update Jupyter
