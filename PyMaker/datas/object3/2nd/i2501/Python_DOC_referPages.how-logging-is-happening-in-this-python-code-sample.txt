1, 2, 3, 4.The nature of your problem is that you use two loggers. The first one you have created with the code . The second one is root logger. You started it with the code . Usually you need multiple loggers to distinguish between sources of logging messages. Keep track of your loggers and do not mix them.To take an easy start with logging in python you may use only root logger. You can configure it with  and create log messages with, for example, .5.It behaves just fine. You do not need any extra actions to make logging work correctly. Although you may experience difficulties with logging across multiple threads and processes.
