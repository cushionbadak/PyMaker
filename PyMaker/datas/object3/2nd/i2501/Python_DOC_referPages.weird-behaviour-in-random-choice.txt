I'm trying to randomly reorder an Array using my  function:The issue that I'm facing is that  variable is always containing . Can anyone please point out what I'm missing?
The issue with the above code is in the line . Remember, that  variable can contain both 0 and  (both of those values are falsy).       So, I'd recommend changing your code to something like this (if you don't want to use ):        Also, do  instead of 
The problem occurs because you are setting  to be None, as result at some point all elements in the  list is , and the while loop becomes never ending.To scramble the list you can  use random.shuffle function from standard library:
