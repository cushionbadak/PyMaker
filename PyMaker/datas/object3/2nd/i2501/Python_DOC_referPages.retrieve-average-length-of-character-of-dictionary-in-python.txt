Natural Text
I need a help to retrieve the value of a dictionary.The dictionary: And the probabilities of the character:The problem is how to retrieve the length of each character and multiply it with the probabilities of each character to get the average length of character. For example:The final answer should be:Thank you.
Outputaverage length of character: 1.8333333333333333
You can use  with a generator expression:This outputs:
Using  with an appropriate generator expression producing the probability weighted lengths:
You can use a  and the built-in  function:This is a very nice guide about how to use lambda in Python
This simple approach might help you getting your answer
Using Python 3, that would be:Note: This program uses a simple loop, which I think is easy to comprehend if you're new to Python. Other answers use a thing called a list comprehension. Once you understand what these do, they are to be preferred in many cases, although a bit harder to debug since you can't single-step through them.
