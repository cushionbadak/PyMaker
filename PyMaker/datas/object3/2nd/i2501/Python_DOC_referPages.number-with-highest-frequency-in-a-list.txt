I am trying to write a program that will show me the number that appears most frequently in a list. I am trying to do this without importing any libraries. So far I have something that will give me the number of times the most frequent # appears but I want the number itself, not how many times it appears. How can I change what I have so far in a simple way to do this?EDIT: for example, freq([4, 6, 4, 3, 9, 1, 4]) is returning 3 since 4 appears 3 times. But I would like it to return 4 as in the most frequent value.
Try dictionariesor shorter:another solution without dictionaries:
 has O(n) complexity, given n values in your list. If there are m unique values, this means your algorithm will have minimum O(m x n) complexity. This isn't desirable.One O(n) solution is to create a counting dictionary and increment values as you iterate:Of course, with  the syntax is trivial:
Here is one way to do it with list comprehensions:To break it down:We iterate an enumerated version of the list:, which will produce tuples with the value and index. Then we create a list of tuples with the  of  and the index, : . We use the Max function to get the one with the highest count. Then we index the list  using the highest value at index  in the tuple.This input:  will then produce 1 as a result, although may not be the most efficient.
