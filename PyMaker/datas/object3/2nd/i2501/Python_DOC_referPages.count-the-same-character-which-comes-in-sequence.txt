I am trying to return the most used x characters in a file format. for example this functions should return [4, 1, 2].For example if string is "xxxxxyxxyxxx' it should return [5, 2, 3]My function does not return the correct list. Any helps would be really appreciated. Thanks
You are not resetting your counter when you encounter a  character, and you should only append to  if there was at least one  character counted by the time you find a  character ( characters could be duplicated too):Next, when the loop ends and  is not zero, you need to append that value too, or you won't be counting  characters at the end of the sequence:Next, you really want to use a  loop to loop over a sequence. You are given the individual characters that way:You can make this faster with : divides up an iterable input (such as a string) into separate iterators per group, where a group is defined as any consecutive value with the same  result. The default  function just returns the value, so  gives you groups of consecutive characters that are the same.  is the repeated character, and  takes the length of an iterator.You can then make it more generic, and count all groups:The same can be done with a regular expression:
You don't initialize the value of  between the sequences so it keeps on counting. Update (17:00) - fixed the original procedure and I thought of a better solution -
Edited for function format:returns [4,1,2]
