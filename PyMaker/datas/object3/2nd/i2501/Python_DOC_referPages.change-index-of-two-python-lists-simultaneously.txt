i'm using python 3, and have two lists that are related by their indices, but have separate values. So, for example, scan 400 has 101 points, and scan 405 has 201 points.i'm trying to construct a set of filenames (i.e. strings) for each scan that looks like:and Notice scan 405 will have more files associated with it. i got close with the the following code, but the nature of the nested for loop has me iterating too many times, and generating unwanted strings (i.e. a set for scan 400 containing 200 points, and a set for scan 405 containing 100 points, both are unnecessary).i may be setting this up inaccurately, but what i'd like to do in this case is change the index of both the  for loop and the first  for loop once the first  for loop completes. i'm not sure how to accomplish this, but i think that should resolve my issue. of course i'm open to separate, simpler approaches and thanks in advance for your help!
You can use zip:
You could use zip:OUtput
You could also use enumerate
