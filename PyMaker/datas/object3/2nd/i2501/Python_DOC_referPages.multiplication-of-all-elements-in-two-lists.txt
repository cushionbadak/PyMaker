I want to multiply each number of list1 with each number of list2.  For example: should return something like this:                                                                                   I just want to know if there is any special function to calculate this, as it would take a lot of time to calculate this using a for loop.
A simple nested comprehension will work:To get all the pairs (the cartesian product) from the two lists, you can also use :
You could also do this using dot products, as provided by  (I include this as an answer because you said you are looking for any special function, and are looking to optimize speed, though I agree it's not the most readable or straightforward method):
try this:
