I am trying to convert a string into date format in Python.I am using following statementHowever, I get an error - ValueError: time data 'Sun Aug 19 16:24:31 PDT 2018' does not match format '%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Z %Y'If I remove the timezone from the date string and the format string, the code works perfect. Which leads me to believe that the issue is related to the timezone but I am not sure what actions should be taken. I am in eastern timezone and the time zone in the string is in Pacific timezone. Appreciate any help on this.
As mentioned in this answer you can use python-dateutil for this:Standard datetime module behaves very strangely with parsing timezones, as I see reading this answer in question related to similar problem.
