I use the weight in random.choice, so if I remove after selection, I'm afraid it would mess up the weight. pop_fit_sorted is an array of arrays using numpy and percentage is an aray with the weights.That's the code i'm using. But it can sometimes select the same array twice. How to alway select 2 different arrays?
Note about random.choices():the relative weights are converted to cumulative weights before making selections.So you could do something like:to be sure to get 2 distinct elements.Or, as suggested, you may use numpy.random.choice():but in this case you need to convert your weights to probabilities.
