This question already has an answer here:Unsupported operand type(s) for ** or pow(): 'str' and 'int'                    2 answers                I wrote this code to calculate the roots of a quadratic function when given the values for a, b, and c in the form ax^2+bx+c=0:When I execute the program (in interactive mode) and input 1, 2, and 1 for a, b, and c, respectively, this is the output:What's the issue here? I didn't formally learn how to use interactive mode yet. I'd like a simple explanation/introduction or a website/tutorial that provides one.
The problem here is that input takes the typed input as string type. Check if this makes it work:Here you are explicitly changing the type of the input from str to integer so your variables can be handled by arithmetic operations.
You forgot to cast the input values to a numeric type. or Or, a bit cleaner:
You cannot do math with strings. As A.Lorefice said putting int in front of input will change the given string to an integer.
