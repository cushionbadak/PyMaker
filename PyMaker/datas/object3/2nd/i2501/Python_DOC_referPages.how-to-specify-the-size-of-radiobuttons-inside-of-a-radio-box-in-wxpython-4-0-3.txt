wxPython version: 4.0.3I want to make my radio buttons in the radiobox 3-5 times larger in diameter than there are on an image below.I have checked:https://wxpython.org/Phoenix/docs/html/wx.RadioBox.htmlhttps://www.tutorialspoint.com/wxpython/wx_radiobutton_radiobox.htmI have tried:all of this only changes the size of the field with radiobuttons but not actual radiobuttonsBut It seems I cannot change the size of buttonsmy code:
You are correct. wx does not allow you to change the size of the buttons, only the window they are in. From the documentation:size (wx.Size) â€“ Window size. If wx.DefaultSize is specified then a default size is chosen.Maybe try tkinter? It also doesn't allow you to control the size of the button itself, but you can make the entire contents into a button using  which you can control the size of. Hope that helps.
