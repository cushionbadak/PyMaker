I want to execute the following command via a python script:I can execute this command via the command line completely fine. However, when I execute it using subprocess, I get an error:My code is as followsAs I mentioned above, executing the command via the command line gives the desired output without any error. I am using the Raspbian Jessie OS. Can someone point me in the right direction?
You don't want to use  for this at all.What does this command really do?  It uses a bash extension to open a network socket, feeds it through cat(1) to reroute it to standard output, and decides to run cat as root.  You don't really need the bash extension, or , or root privileges to do any of this in Python; you're looking for the socket library.Here's an all-Python equivalent:(Note that all of my experimentation suggests that this connection works but the daytime server responds by closing immediately.  For instance, the simpler shell invocation  also returns empty string.)
Give this a try:
