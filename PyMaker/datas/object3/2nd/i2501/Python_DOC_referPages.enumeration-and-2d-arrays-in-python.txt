I'm currently working on some code in Python, and I have the following enumerations: I've also created a 2D array: Which is supposed to be an array of constants that I have defined earlier. I'm using these constants in an equation, but I'm referencing them as  or , etc. I feel like when someone looks at my code, they would understand it better if I had something like  or . Is there any way to use the enumeration from earlier to define my variables from the array like this? How can I use enumeration with arrays in general? How would I be able to write my alpha values with the enumeration? Please let me know if any part of this does not make sense - I would be happy to clarify.
You should consider a dictionary with tuple keys:Now let's say I want "matter" and "mu":
If you want to create a set of enumeration constants, that's exactly what the  module is for.In your case, you want enumeration constants that have an integer value, so you can use them as indexes into a list. For that, you want :And now, instead of this:â€¦ you can write this:
