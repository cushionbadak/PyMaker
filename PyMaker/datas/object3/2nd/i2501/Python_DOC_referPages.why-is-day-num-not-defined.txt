This is a section of an exemplar code that my teacher gave me. Can anyone explain how the variable "day_num" is used for this loop when it has not been previously defined. I have tried printing it out in the loop and it increases by 1 every time the loop runs. Any help appreciated, thanks.
Python variables don't have to be declared; the first time you assign to one, it's created.And almost anything that assigns a value to a name counts as an assignment, not just actual  statements. That includes:â€¦ and so on.Each of these assigns a value to  in the current scope (except for the last one, which only assigns a value in the scope of the function body). It doesn't matter whether  was a variable before that statement or not; it is one now.If it isn't clear where any assignment is happening, your  loop is equivalent to this  loop:Now it's obvious that, as long as the iterable is not empty,  is going to be assigned to.
You are declaring  in the loop. Basically the loop is telling the interpreter that you want to iterate over something and want to give each iteration a name, in this case . The iterable you are providing in this case is a range from 1-8, but you could just as easily pass it a list. In that case you would be calling each element of the list , as an example. Every time you run through the loop, it updates the value stored in .
