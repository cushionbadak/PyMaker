I am trying to write a function that does error checking in the following way.My expectation of Python's  command was that if I pass  to it, it would simply ignore it and raise no exception. The response, however, was:I then had a look at Python's built-in exception types to see if something like , , etc. exists. No luck though.I can, of course raise the exception in the  function, but I don't want to, since this would add an extra line to the stack trace.So, my (perhaps silly) question is: How can I use  to not raise an exception? :-)Thanks
If you don't want to raise an exception, don't call  (whose sole job IS to raise an exception).Perhaps what you really want is to call  from inside  when you actually do want to raise an exception, and just use  when you don't.An alternative might be to leave  as is, but wrap the call to it in an  that one raises the exception returned when an exception is returned.
