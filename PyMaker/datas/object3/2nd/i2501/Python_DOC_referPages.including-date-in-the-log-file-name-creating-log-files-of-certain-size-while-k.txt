I am setting up python logger using config. I want log file to contain date (and possibly time). I also want for that date, each log file to be of only particular size and to keep only 3 such old log files. For example, I will like to get log files of following form:I tried RotatingFileHandler using config of following form as explained here:and it produces log files as follows:But I am unable to understand, how can I get date in the log file names. Is it possible to do it with configs and with some handler say  or ? Or say can I somehow set the log file name to contain date after  call?
Your example shows a  which rotates files based on size rather than date. You need to use  as documented here. You can configure it in the same way as you have done .Update: If you want to restrict both by date and size, you will need to use a handler subclass which does exactly what you want.
