Natural Text
I've been writing Python code for only about 4 weeks. I'm writing a little text based game to learn and test everything I know. I can easily make this work with a value entered into the console as an integer, but for whatever reason I can't get my code to work with reading this value from a text file.Earlier in the program, my code saves a value to a text file, just one value, then later it opens the same text file, over-writes the value with a new value based on a very simple calculation. That calculation is the first value, plus 5. I've spent a bunch of time reading on this site and going through my books and at this point I'm pretty sure I'm just missing something obvious.The first piece of code that creates the doc and sets the value:This is the trouble section...I have commented the line with the problem.This is the error I get:I know you can't concatenate a string and an integer, but I keep trying different methods to convert the string to an integer to do the quick math, but I can't seem to get it right.
Error message is clear, you are trying to concatenate string with an integer. You should change the line from:To:Then you can use above value to write directly into file as a string as:
f.readlines() returns a list of lines, in your case something like . So  is a textual representation of this list, like , which you won't be able to interpret as an integer.You can just use  to read the whole file at once in a string, which will be something like , and convert it to a integer:
