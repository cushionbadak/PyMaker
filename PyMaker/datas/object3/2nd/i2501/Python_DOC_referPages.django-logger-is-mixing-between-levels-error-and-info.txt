If for some reason you only want INFO messages to show up in a handler's output, but nothing of higher severity, you would need to attach a filter to that handler. This is not a common requirement - though it's common to isolate errors and greater in logs, it's not common to isolate only INFO messages. Using a filter should work:and then assign that filter to your handler . Not sure why you've called it  - perhaps you need to review your understanding of loggers and handlers. The top of the advanced tutorial gives a summary.
