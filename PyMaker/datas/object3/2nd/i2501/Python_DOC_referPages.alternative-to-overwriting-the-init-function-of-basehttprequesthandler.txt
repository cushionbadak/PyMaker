I would like to define a few variables inside my RequestHandler class that is a subclass of BaseHTTPRequestHandler. These variables then should be accessible from inside my  function. Normaly I would define those variables inside the  method but the python docs about the BaseHTTPRequestHandler classsays "Subclasses should not need to override or extend the  method."So what would be the most elegant way to achieve this?
Shouldn't need to means you don't have to worry about that method, the library will work without any special attributes set on the instance. However, that doesn't mean you can't.For example, the  class doesn't define a  method itself, but the  class in the same module is a direct subclass of  which does define an  method.Your code can define one just fine:
