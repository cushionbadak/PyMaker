Natural Text
I am confused as to how this code actually works:If I were to just run the  statement without the  loop, but leaving everything else, m isn't defined. How can I run a  loop after the  method is called, and create the variable in the  loop? If anybody could just break down this code and explain what is actually happening I would be really appreciative.
Here's the same code, written without the use of a generator expression (that one-liner for loop)That's pretty straight forward, so let's get into how we're representing that in your code snippet. returns an iterable we're going to loop over. is the generator expression. Think of it as saying "The value returned by  for each of the items  in the iterable returned by ". Don't get caught up on the fact we use  before reading it - that's just Python's syntax being natural language inspired rather than operation-oriented. iterates the generator we defined, putting the values into a list. A common mistake is assuming that we can treat the generator as a list - it can't be indexed and can only be iterated once.Hope that helps!
