Say I have the  processes and 2 additional processes  and . In this program A is supposed to send data to B. If we have some code like this:given that the Queue  was created in the Main process, does the data flow like this?If so, is there a way to have a  initialized on  and passed to  such that data goes directly from  to  skipping ?
given that the Queue q was created in the Main process, does the data flow like this?No. As explained in the docs, a  is just an auto-synchronizing wrapper around a . When you pass a  to a child, you're just passing that  and some locks.And the  is just a wrapper around an operating system pipe. When you pass a  to a child, you're just passing the pipe's file descriptor/handle.Ignoring the locks, process A is basically just writing to a pipe, and process B is just reading from it.The locks do make things a bit more complicated (and may also mean that process A spins up a hidden background thread), but they still don't involve the main process at all.Unless the main process calls a method on a queue, it has nothing to do with that queue at all.
