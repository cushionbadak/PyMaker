I am a beginner to using Python (3.7.0 is the release) and am trying to make a comma appear after a word in a print statement whilst maintaining an overall structure to the output. This is better explained by the following, which includes a snippet of code:I want the print statement to place the comma directly after the lname    variable's last inputted character,    allowing for up to 10 characters to be inputted for the last name and 9 for the    first name.Ex: If I inputted my fname as "Jace" and my lname as "Smith", I would like the    comma to be placed immediately after "Jace",   so that the statement would print:whilst maintaining the position of the far-most-right bar "|", regardless of    if the fname and lname inputs vary   in the character-amount range specified by the left-justified formatting    modifiers. If my name was change to    "Tyler Campbell" I would still want the output to be:Can someone help me out? This is my first time using these forums, so hopefully this isn't placed in the wrong category or formatted wrong.
This uses f-strings and the format specification mini language.
