Trying to create a batch script for windows that runs a program with python3 if available else python2.I know the script can be executed with and py3 with .and if I run , it returns all the python versions.How do I build this script?I do not want to check if the python directory is available or not, I'd prefer to check in a way that is python location agnostic.
Piping directly  to  or  is not working (with python 2.7).Building dinamicaly and running a python script that return the version, will enable this piping ! The solution :
Not a full solution, but a method to detect which version of Python is installed:You can check if Python 3 is installed by running  and then checking the  variable in the batch script.  If it is 0, then  was successful, i.e. Python 3 is installed on the system.  If it is nonzero, then Python 3 is not installed.
