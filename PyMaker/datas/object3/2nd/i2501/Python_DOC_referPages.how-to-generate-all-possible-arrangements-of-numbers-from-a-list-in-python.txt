Problem: Given a list of 3 numbers  generate a list of all possible arrangements of the numbers.That's  unique entries from what I can gather. Something like:I tried using  and  but I can't get all 27 values. for example only prints 6 values: Is there something that's available  out of the box or is this more of a "roll your own" problem?
you are confusing  with :
The answer is still in itertools. The function called  does the trick; it takes two arguments: first is the iterable which has the usable elements, second is the amount of times the iterable can repeat itself. would return the permutations you want in your example.The reason  or  don't work for you is because they don't allow items to repeat themselves;  calculates the cartesian product, which allows for repetition of items.
This code prints what you requested :)
