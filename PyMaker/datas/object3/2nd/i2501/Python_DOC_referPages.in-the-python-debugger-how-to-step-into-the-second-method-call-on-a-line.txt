I'm trying to debug something in Django, and at some point in  I ended up at the following stack trace:I would like to step into the call to . However, if I type the  command, it steps into the  call (which is the  method of the object, Django view):Is it possible to step into the second method call on the line, not the first one? I've tried perusing the commands on https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html#debugger-commands but couldn't find any.
I believe you can step into the first function with ‘s’ And then run to the end of the function with ‘r’. From there you should be able to step into the second function.
