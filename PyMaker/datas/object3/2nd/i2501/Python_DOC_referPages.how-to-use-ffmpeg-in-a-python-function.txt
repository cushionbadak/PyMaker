I have tried to use a ffmpeg to extract an audio from a video file and this is my codeAnd I got no error after compiled. By doing this I should get a new file which is 'dm-new.flac'. But there is no such a flac file created after I compile the script. I think there are something wrong with the syntax or something in the variable 'command' which I have no idea to fix this. My question here is how can I use ffmpeg in a python function base on this code?By the way, I knew that I could just use ffmpeg without writing a function. But I really need to write in in a function. Thank you
Try this:I think you were trying to reference two variables inside a string but did not tell Python that you should replace 'video' and 'output' with their corresponding variables.  allows you to reference the variables that you refer to in a string. See here for more info.
Add one character () to solve it (over python 3.6): 
I think this is it. 
I belive this should work:
