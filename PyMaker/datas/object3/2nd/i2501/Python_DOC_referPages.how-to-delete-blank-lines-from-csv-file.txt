I am trying to read a file using  as delimiter and contains blank lines. My CSV file looks likes-I want to remove blank lines from this file and I want to store it in the same file. I want to use all the values after  for updating Excel table.How to remove blank lines from the file because if I am trying to read the file it is reading only top 4 lines and not reading any further line. I want to store every integer value in each row in a list like -
You don't have a CSV file, so don't try to treat it as one. CSV specifically means a file consisting of rows of columns, where all rows have the same number of columns and the columns are delimited by a single character (usually a comma or a tab).There is no need to delete the lines from your source file if all you needed was those first 4 values for your code either.Just loop over the lines in the file, split each line by whitespace, and if the resulting list is not empty, take the last value: with no arguments splits on arbitrary length whitespace, including tabs, spaces and newlines, with any whitespace at the start and end ignored.When a line is empty the  string will be , and splitting such a line results in an empty list. If there is anything other than whitespace on a line, you get a list of strings for each non-whitespace section:Because your file has the numbers you want at the end of each line, taking the last element (with ) gets you all the numbers.If you only need the top four such lines, test the  result:The  stops the  loop, and when you exit the  statement, the file will be closed automatically. If you do ever need to skip blank lines, just test if  is truthy;  uses the same arbitrary-width whitespace rules to remove whitespace from the start and end. Empty lines with just a newline separator end up as empty strings, which are considered false when used in a boolean test such as an  condition:You could then write that to a new file if you so wish, but that's not really needed here.
Just strip the lines to check if they're empty.
