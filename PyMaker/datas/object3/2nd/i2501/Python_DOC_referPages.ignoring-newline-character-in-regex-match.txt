Natural Text
I am trying to replace all matching occurrences with title cases using the following script. When there is a newline character between filter words (in this case 'ABC' and 'DEF') that line doesn't get replaced as intended. How can I ignore the newline character in this case? Edit: I don't want to strip all newline characters entirely from the string, but only strip those between the filter words.Edit2: I edited the text and script to better reflect on the issue I am experiencing. If I include  argument, it will give me: whereas the output I want is (notice that  is not capitalized):The following is the script I am using.
The following code gives the result you expect:I'm assuming that the value you want to "title-case" is always between double quotes, and that it can not contain a double-quote (escaped in some way). Handling escaping would be possible with a slightly more complex regex, though.
Use the  flag:According to the docs:  Make the '.' special character match any character at all, including a newline; without this flag, '.' will match anything except a newline.
