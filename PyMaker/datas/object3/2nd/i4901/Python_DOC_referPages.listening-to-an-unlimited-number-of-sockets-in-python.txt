I was wondering, if I want to listen to each socket that wants to join,what do I need to write inside the sock.listen(?) What number goes there and tells python "I want to listen to everyone" and not to a limited number of sockets.I thought about just putting a large number, but I feel it's not the right answer.Thanks for the helpers!!
See this answer where John la Rooy says:The doc say thissocket.listen(backlog) Listen for connections made to the socket. The    backlog argument specifies the maximum number of queued connections    and should be at least 1; the maximum value is system-dependent    (usually 5).Obviously the system value is more than 5 on your system. I don't see  why setting it to a larger number would be a problem. Perhaps some  memory is reserved for each queued connection.My linux man page has this to sayIf the backlog argument is greater than the value in    /proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn, then it is silently truncated to that    value; the default value in this file is 128. In kernels before    2.4.25, this limit was a hard coded value, SOMAXCONN, with the value 128.
