So I'm trying to make a infinite loop that uses a for loop instead of a while loop. This is my current code. If this code works it should produce x infinitely.Current code:
That doesn't work because the first time you enter the for loop the  function generates a range from zero to the value of  at that point, and later changes to  does not affect it. You can do something like what you want using, for example, :
 returns an iterator. The iterator is already generated and evaluated before the loop iteration. (It's the returned iterator on which the loop is iterating). The value of  is not used after the iterator is returned hence incrementing or changing its value is no-op. If you really want an infinite loop using  you will have to write your custom generator.For eg: To be used as :
Update list after each iteration make infinite loop
