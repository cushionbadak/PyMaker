Basically, I need to check the type of data of which a variable is storing before replacing the data stored in the variable with the new data. For example, how to check if the variable is storing a string data or an integer data?Source Code:So basically, how should I, or are there any conventional way to check the type of data that the variable is storing?
Proper way to do this is But think twice if you actually need this. Python uses duck-typing, so explicit checks for types is not always a good idea. If you still want to do so, consider using some abstract base or minimal valuable type for your checks.As other people suggesting, just getting type of your variable can be done by , but in most cases its better to use , because this will make your code polymorphic - you'll automatically support instances of subclasses of target type.
If you really want the type of a variable, and don't want to support inheriting, use the built-in  function:I agree with @Slam, that you should use this responsibly.
 returns the type of the variable
This command will return the type of the data stored by the variable.
