I have a CSV file like this one:Each route has an  and an  that are always the same for the same . Also each  has a set of , each of them made of a  and . I'm trying to group the  by , but I want to yield every field of the file.When I use  to group by , I'm only able to yield  and :I tried different ways to get the  and  for that  (like using  or  to get the  or using another for outside the existing one), but none of them worked. Is there a way to have a composite key when using groupby? Or maybe an easier solution to my problem?I would like to be able to yield this:
You can indeed  with a composite key:You just need to access your key by index when you yield the result.Try it online!
You can  multiple fields at once if you return a tuple from your  function.You can use  for that. The for loop would look like:
