I have been trying to get pip with python3 on WSL ubuntu 16.04 and have had no success. I have been running , but still have issues getting pip to work properly.Similar with Also I noticed that I seem to have two versions of python3 installed:
According to Python 3 documentation, distutils apparently is not deprecated, BUT, my install of 2.7 has disutils, but 3.6 does not.When I read:https://docs.python.org/3/installing/It seemed to say that distutils was being deprecated, but it was not worded clearly if they were talking about distutils or something else.If anyone knows the definitive answer, please let us know.
So after a lot of pain, I finally gave in. I had made things worse and corrupted my entire python3 installation. I had corrupted too many files trying to fix everything. I ended up uninstalling WSL/ubuntu and reinstalling clean. I made of backup a few things first.Unfortunately, this seems to be the best option if you have really messed this up, like I did. Being more careful now, python3 is working just fine, with pip. Make sure you follow official docs when you install.
