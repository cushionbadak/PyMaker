I am using qrcode to generate qrcode. When a ticket is bought, or when bought is true, I would like to generate a qrcode image and make some changes using PIL. Finally save the modified canvas into the Image field of the model.But this throws an error:AttributeError: 'Image' object has no attribute '_committed'How can I save a generated PIL image into an ImageField in django?
You can use a BytesIO to save the Pillow file to an in-memory blob. Then create a  object and pass that to your model instance ImageField's  method.Check out the django documentation for the  object.https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/files/file/#the-file-objectYou have to use , since the default  means that the parent model's  method would be called after the image is saved. You don't want recursion here, since you would typically end up in an infinite loop.
Change your code and use Django File as below:You can save  on the  and  path, or in temporary directory or use  object.
