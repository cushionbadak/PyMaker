Natural Text
A program outputs a file with lines of the following formatwhere  and  could, but do not have to, be made up of several words.  and  always are a single word.I need to get  in a variable for my further code. I imagine that this would work if I split the sting at a matching regular expression. This would return a list of the four elements and thus I could easily get out the second element with .How would I write such a regular expression?I need to split the sting on single spaces , but only if that single space is not surrounded by text in curly braces. gives me all the spaces and thus behaves exactly like . How can I exclude the spaces in the curly braces?
You can try DemoExplanation: first you match the first section inside curly braces then a whitespace then the second section; you put it in a capturing group, so it's available in search results as  Scan through string looking for the first location where the regular expression pattern produces a match, and return a corresponding match object. Return None if no position in the string matches the pattern; note that this is different from finding a zero-length match at some point in the string.https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.search
This might help.I just searched for any word that follows a close-brace. I used  to group that word so that I could access it later with If you really want all four elements, try :
