If I have a CSV (info.csv) file below:180101, S1, -1180101, S2, 15180102, S4, -5180103, S1, -5... The columns mean "date", "code", "info1" respectively.I want to convert new code (csv file, newcode.scv) matching in original data.such as new code mapping is below:180101, N1180102, N2180103, W1...Regard it as a one to one relation, no duplicates.So new data from it:180101, N1, -1180101, N2, 15180102, N2, -5180103, W1, -5Is there a nine fancy way of converting?
One way is to use , which specializes in vectorised computations. A pure  method will likely be loop-based and inefficient.
The csv module of the standard library has a bunch of useful functions for dealing with csv files including easy ways to both read and write them. DictReader is the one you'd want to look at for converting entries into a dictionary.csv module documentation
