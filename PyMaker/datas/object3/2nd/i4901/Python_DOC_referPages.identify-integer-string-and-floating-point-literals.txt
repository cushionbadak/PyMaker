I am new to Python and I am stuck with a problem. I have an input file which contains data as below: By using regular expression is need to parse each literal and classify whether the literal is a string or an integer or a floating point.The code snippet is somewhat like below:My issue is how can I structure the code to validate multiple regex conditions for each token passed. As of now the floating point if the condition is not validated. I want to check the token for, first integer regex if it matches or if it matches floating point regex or it matches string.Any help will be appreciated.
I would structure the problem as follows:Filling your patterns into the  variables above.Also note, your  pattern is no good, as it also matches :Since the decimal point is optional.  You might be better off breaking the pattern into an alternation with three options, starts with '.', ends with '.' or contains a '.' between numbers.  Also, in your integer pattern, the '?' in the octal section is incorrect:at this point we're trying to commit to octal so the prefix is not optional:You got this correct for hex and binary.
Split the text, use function  to test for , then  for  and capture  for .Output:Code demo
