Natural Text
I am currently trying to repeatedly replace a word in a line but there are two current issues with my code. I can successfully locate the lines I want to replace, but with my current code i fail to 1. store the specific value in the strings that i want and then replace the word on that same line.The text I want to replace appears to two times and looks like this in the textfile:I wish to change "One" here to something else each time I run the program. What I've tried to do is the following:The if-statement runs but the line does not replace "One". The strings also do not get separated correctly meaning that does not contain just the "One".How can I adjust my code so it successfully locates the two lines in the textfile that needs to replaced with the new string ("NewWord", as I have just used as an example just now)?
You will need to do the  like:The  method returns a new string is does not modify the existing string.
