I'm working with the  module in Python 3.My question is:Do we need to close the connection if I open it using  ?
From looking at the documentation for urllib.request.urlopenIt states that urllib.request module uses HTTP/1.1 and includes Connection:close  header in its HTTP requests.and when we check this against Request for Comments for the HTTP protocol:From RFC 2616, Section 14.10HTTP/1.1 defines the "close" connection option for the sender to  signal that the connection will be closed after completion of the  response. For example, in either the request or the response header  fields indicates that the connection SHOULD NOT be considered  `persistent' (section 8.1) after the current request/response is  complete.HTTP/1.1 applications that do not support persistent connections MUST  include the "close" connection option in every message.So you don't need to close the connection. The connection is closed as soon as you receive your response
