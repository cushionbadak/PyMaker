According to Python 3.6 release notes, "the class attribute definition order is now preserved". This is described in more detail in PEP 520.However, I can't seem to get this to work?For example:or:What am I misunderstanding?
From the looks of that output, that's probably not the code you really ran. You probably wrotein an IPython interactive session. IPython automatically sorts the keys of dicts and mappingproxy objects when displaying them. (This was eventually changed in IPython 5.6 so IPython no longer sorts dict keys on Python 3.6+.)
