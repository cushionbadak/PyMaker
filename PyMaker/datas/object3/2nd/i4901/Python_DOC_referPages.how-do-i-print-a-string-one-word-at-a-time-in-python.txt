I am trying to print a string one word per line using a loop. For example if the string is, 'I need practice', the string should print:I'\n'need'\n'practiceMy code so far looks like this:However, my output looks like this:I need practice
You can use the  function to split a string by spaces and that will give you back a list of words that you can then loop and print them out. The function accepts a string that will be used as the delimiter (e.g ",") if this argument is not specified or is None it will run an algorithm that will consider a sequence of whitespaces as a single separator and hence, as a result, no matter how many spaces there are between the words you will get a list of words with no whitespaces at the start or the end of each substring.
Just  the spaces with  'sphrase=input('enter a phrase: ')words = phrase.replace(' ', '\n')Note the space in the first argument of replace.
