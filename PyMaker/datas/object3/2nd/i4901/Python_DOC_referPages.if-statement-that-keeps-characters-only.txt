Let's say we have a list list_a = [a,b,C,.,/,!,d,E,f,]i want to append to a new list only the letters of the alphabet.So the new list will be list_b = [a,b,C,d,E,f].So far i have tried doing it like that way:However, when i print the list_b it has all the elements of list_a , it doesn't do the job i expected.Any ideas ?PS: comma in the specific example brings Error too.
You can try this:Also, check out the string module. It has a lot of additional methods that can help you, should you wish to work with strings. Do note that this works only with ascii characters. If you want to check for every character in an alphabet, then you can via the  method, as the others have noted above.
You can use the  method of the string type.
Try checking if the character is an alphabet by using the .isalpha() function.
You are missing the fact that the str() function does not return the "str" elements you think it does, just an str representation of them. Try creating a list with you dictionary [a-zA-Z] (not very pythonic but simple to grasp) and check if your character exists in it.I suggest writing your own code from scratch instead of copy/pasting, that is the only way to really understand the problem....
Well, it is basically the same logic of using  method, but you can do this by using :Output:
You can use the  or  package to do thisOr with
