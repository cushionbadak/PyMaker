I have the need to accept a large string through a message broker (I am using RabbitMQ) and parse the string to figure out the details of the request.

My requirement is to do some detailed parsing of a string that looks like:module is a key-word from a pre-defined list of possible values.command is a key-word from a pre-defined list of possible values for the chosen modulecommand-specific-info is a free-form text-input expressed as a sequence of comma-separated key=value pairsExample:
