Try adding  for example
you should read up on this question Understanding kwargs in Python to understand what you are doing, but that **user_info is described as keyword argument (and is usually written as **kwargs). When calling that funciton, since it includes a **kwargs input, you can write in any additional fields you might want. Then, this function: Creates those variables in the profile dict
