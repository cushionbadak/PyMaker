Natural Text
I have a problem with some of my python code. I want it to open a file, with few lines of text, and add header + footer to each line in that file.The problem is that 'create_output()' function returns only the first line with additional content. If I switch 'return' to 'print' at the end of this function it properly displays all lines from my file. What could be the reason? I want to understand what am I doing wrong here.
OK, I changed it to something like this, now it works fine.Thanks your feedback, now I know what I'm doing wrong.
You get only one line, because you reopen the write-file all the time instead of letting it open,  will truncate the file on open - so last line lives, rest is useless IO. Also you never close your reader afaics. from https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files:  mode can be  when the file will only be read,  for only writing (an existing file with the same name will be erased), and  opens the file for appending; any data written to the file is automatically added to the end.  opens the file for both reading and writing. The mode argument is optional;  will be assumed if itâ€™s omitted.Do not split the file open into extra functions, use  so they get closed as soon as you leave the block or some exception happens.Use string-formatting - either  or the inline variant - see below.Should do the trick.Links:Format string syntaxReading and writing files
