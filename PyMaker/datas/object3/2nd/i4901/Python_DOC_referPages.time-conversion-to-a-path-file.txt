I have a path files which are named by time (201803061500) etc. What I need is a time conversion, because I use  loop to open a few of them there is an error when I want files from for example (...1555 to ... 1615) and Python sees an obivous problem because after 1555 is 1560, but I want him to convert that to time so after (...1555 will be ... 1600) any ideas how to use it?Btw. Time conversion must be contain 4 digits, so it cannot be 16:00/16-00 etc. it must be 1600, because it goes as an input to my pathfile. Any ideas?UPDATE - I did this, but this code is rubbish and I think my problem might be solved by one command.
One easy way to handle unformated time is the . You can first strip your strings and then do whatever you want !Finally you can get your string back by using  functionSource : https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behaviorSource : https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html
Those three lines solved my problem,  also works, but if you put those variables to  pathfile, you'll get an error. That's why I've choosen this solution.
