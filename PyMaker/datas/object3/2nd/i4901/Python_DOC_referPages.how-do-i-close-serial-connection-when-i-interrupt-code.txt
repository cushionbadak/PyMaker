I have the following Python code which is just reading from an Arduino, and writing to a file:Whenever I interrupt the script, I always have to type  in the console, otherwise I cannot start the script again (in the same console).How can I close the serial communication automatically whenever I interrupt the script?

You can use the  statement.The  statement will automatically close  and  when execution leaves the  statement. This can be an exception in your case. The  statement has been introduced by PEP 343 to remove  statements by using context managers.
