Natural Text
Firstly, I have a text file which shows the voting scores of 5 candidates in 4 ballots below: 1, 2, 3, 0, 02, 3, 1, 0, 03, 1, 0, 0, 20, 2, 0, 3, 1Voters put their first three preferences and the two remaining candidates get zeros.Using the program below, each scores for each candidate gets put in a 2dimensional array and the quota is calculated.The output to this is:[['1', ' 2', ' 3', ' 0', ' 0'], ['2', ' 3', ' 1', ' 0', ' 0'], ['3', ' 1', ' 0', ' 0', ' 2'], ['0', ' 2', ' 0', ' 3', ' 1']]2The 2 at the end is the quota. For a candidate to win, the total of their first preference votes (the 1s) have to reach or exceed the quota of 2. I do not know how to code a function so that the first preference votes of each candidate are added up together.
You need to be careful what you are counting. If you look closely, you are counting , but because of the way you read your votes in, you could have  or . To get around this, read your file in line by line and remove any leading/trailing spaces by using :This will also strip the trailing newline of the last value in each line.  would then contain:To total up all the first preference votes you could use  to tell you where the  is in the list ( being the first location). With this you could keep a total for each using a list of counters:So at the end your  would have:
