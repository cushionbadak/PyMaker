Python  doesn't return tuples of length 0 or 1. For example:Is there any good reason that the  is written this way?  And not  for the second last  and for the last? Is there some other built-in option if I always want to return a tuple/list given the keys?
Is there some other built-in option if I always want to return a  tuple/list given the keys?just use a comprehension:In context:
Part of your confusion comes from the fact that your  func takes a single argument (expected to be an iterable) and unpacks it when passing it to . This results in the return value of  not being "symetric" with it's arguments. If you defined  to use varargs instead (as  does) :the return values would be more consistant with the arguments, ie:Now the point is that few people would bother using  to implement your  function -  has mainly been designed to be used as a callback for  and like functions / methods (where it's current behaviour makes sense), and  would more canonically be implemented with a list expression ie:which would take an iterable and return a (possibly empty) list.
This behavior is documented in the docs (emphasis is mine):Return a callable object that fetches item from its operand using the  operandâ€™s  method. If multiple items are specified,  returns a tuple of lookup values does not decide the return type, it is the operand's  method.Wouldn't it be easier/better"better" is subjective. You can always wrap :
