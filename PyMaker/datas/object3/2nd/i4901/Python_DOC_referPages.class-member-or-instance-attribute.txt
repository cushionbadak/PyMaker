I've been using Structure in ctypes recently, but i got a strange question.This is my Python3 code:The question is: Is  a class member of AcknowledgeHeader or an instance attribute of ack_header?I tried to find the answer.If  is an instance attribute of ack_header, then why does  print a empty dict?If  is a class member of AcknowledgeHeader, then why is  not equal to ?
 is a data descriptor object on the  class. Accessing it on the  instance causes code to run that translates between C conventions and Python types.Because it is a data descriptor, all interaction with the attribute is captured, including deletion and assignment. If you were to set a  key in the  attribute dictionary it'd simply be ignored.Instead,  will always invoke , while assignment to  will trigger .In this case, only getting and setting is implemented, there is no  method, only  and , so  will throw an exception.See the descriptor HOWTO for more details on how descriptors work.
