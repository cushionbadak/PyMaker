I have an app which adds coroutines to an already-running event loop.The arguments for these coroutines depend on I/O and are not available when I initially start the event loop - with loop.run_forever(), so I add the tasks later. To demonstrate the phenomenon, here is some example code:The strange behaviour is that everything works as expected when there is at least one task in the loop when invoking loop.run_forever(). i.e. when the commented line is not commented out. But when it is commented out, as shown above, nothing is printed and it appears I am unable to add a task to the event_loop. Should I avoid invoking run_forever() without adding a single task? I don't see why this should be a problem. Adding tasks to an event_loop after it is running is standard, why should the empty case be an issue?
Adding tasks to an event_loop after it is running is standard, why should the empty case be an issue?Because you're supposed to add tasks from the thread running the event loop. In general one should not mix threads and asyncio, except through APIs designed for that purpose, such as .If you understand this and still have good reason to add tasks from a separate thread, use . Change  to: accesses the event loop in a thread-safe manner, and also ensures that the event loop wakes up to notice the new task, even if it otherwise has nothing to do and is just waiting for IO/timeouts.Adding another task beforehand only appeared to work because  happens to be an infinite coroutine that makes the event loop wake up every second. Once the event loop wakes up for any reason, it executes all runnable tasks regardless of which thread added them. It would be a really bad idea to rely on this, though, because  is not thread-safe, so there could be any number of race conditions if it executed in parallel with a running event loop.
Because loop.create_task is not thread safe, and if you set , you should see the error as
