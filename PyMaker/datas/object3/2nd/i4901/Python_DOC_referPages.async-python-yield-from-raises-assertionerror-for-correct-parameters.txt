My requirement is to run 2 functions at the same time and stop execution of one if the another one calculates and returns a result faster.I have know knowledge of async programming or event loops. I read python 3.6 which lead me to asyncio.wait()My sample code:But it doesnt work for some unknown reason.
The particular assertion you are getting has to do with incorrect use of . However, the problem runs deeper:My requirement is to run 2 functions at the same timeThis is not how asyncio works, nothing is run "at the same time". Instead, one runs async functions which execute until the point when they reach what would normally be a blocking call. Instead of blocking, an async function then suspends its execution, allowing other coroutines to run. They must be driven by an event loop, which drives them and wakes them up once some IO event allows them to resume.A more correct asyncio version of your code would look like this:Note in particular that: is used instead of . This applies to every blocking call.Coroutines such as  and  must be awaited using the  keyword. This allows the coroutine to suspend itself upon encountering a blocking call.Async code is executed through the event loop, whose entry point is typically  or .
