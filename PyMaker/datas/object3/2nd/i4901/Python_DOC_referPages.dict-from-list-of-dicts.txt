I have a list of dicts. In that list of dicts each dict has one key and one value for that key, as shown above. I need to create a dict that has the keys from all the dicts and each value for every key is a set with item values from the list of dicts. In the example, it'd be something like this:How can I do this in Python?
You can use the builtin  function.Output:Note: Using  (as shown in this answer) is simpler and faster than using .From the documentation:Working of :When each key is encountered for the first time, it is not already in the mapping; so an entry is automatically created using the  function which returns an empty list. The  operation then attaches the value to the new list. When keys are encountered again, the look-up proceeds normally (returning the list for that key) and the  operation adds another value to the list. This technique is simpler and faster than an equivalent technique using .
 is one way:

You can use :Output:
Very simply. Output :
