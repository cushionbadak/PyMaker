Let's say I have a nested list like:I also have another list holding the position based on which sorting is needed to be performed on each element of  list. Let's say it is defined as:Now I want to sort list by multiple arguments. First, I want to sort by the list , which should order the items in  at index [1], and after that I want to sort by the items in list at index [0]. Summing up, what I want to have in the end is:Is there any (preferable Pythonic) way to do this? Suggestions welcome!
Using Lambda ExpressionYou may use  function with the below lambda expression as  to achieve it:This lambda expression will return list of values for each element in the  list based on the indexes present in the  list. Based on the returned list, sorting will be performed. Sample Run:Using Even better to do it using  as:
To sort based off of , you can try this:Output:
You can use itemgetter from the operator module to construct the key for sorted.
