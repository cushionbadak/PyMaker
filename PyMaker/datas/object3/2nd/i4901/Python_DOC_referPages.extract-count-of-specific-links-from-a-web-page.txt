I am writing a python script using BeautifulSoup. I need to scrape a website and count unique links ignoring the links starting with '#'.Example if the following links exist on a webpage:https://www.stackoverflow.com/questionshttps://www.stackoverflow.com/foohttps://www.cnn.com/For this example, the only two unique links will be (The link information after the main domain name is removed):Note: this is my first time using python and web scraping tools.I appreciate all the help in advance. This is what I have tried so far:
There is a function named  from  which you can get  of urls. And there is a new awesome HTTP library named  which can help you get all links in source file.
You could also do this:The  line checks if every tag has an  set and if it doesn't start with the # character.The Counter method counts the occurrences of each list entry and the  orders by the value.The  loop just prints the results.
My way to do this is to find all links using beautiful soup and then determine which link redirects to which location:tld extract finds the correct url name and soup.find_all('a') finds a tags. The if statements check for same domain redirect, javascript redirect or other domain redirects.
