I started out with a simple example to compare Python code to c#, my more usual language:to simply output: 20:17:14:11:8:5:2then I thought about the shortest, not necessarily the most efficient way of doing it and came up with this after reading about list comprehension.Is there an even shorter way? I know it's a trivial issue, but really it's about learning about all the features of Python and how it differs from other languages.thanks.
Here's an alternative (Python 3.6+ only):As already stated though, your aim shouldn't be to make your code as concise as possible. Readability is more important.
You can use 
It looks like the final slice is just to remove an unused , so how about:Python is generally not about compactness but readability.
