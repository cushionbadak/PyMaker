I have a short but perhaps not simple question.How would I format this code to avoid error?The IDLE gave a syntax error.
I didn't see an fstring example given yet (Python 3.6+):
We should try to avoid using  operator with string as much as we can, since each  may create one intermediate string.Use  (double quote) or  (single quote) for multiline string or use  for seperating them.NOTE:  and  should be used with care otherwise it may print too many spaces in between two lines.Use format or similar concepts to format the string.Use Use format with keyword arguments.           Use string format style like C/C++.https://ideone.com/xJ31fN
An option that works in Python 2 and 3 is to use the join() function
