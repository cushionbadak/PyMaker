I want to use a limited number of threads (at most ) to run a function in a class for removing some files on disk in the background. The rest of my code within the same class is independent of this background function and might get executed tens of times more than the background function. However, I still need to enforce the core/thread limit. So it is possible that the background jobs might exceed  and I need to queue them. Note that my background function does not take any arguments.I am pretty new to multi-threading and multi-processing but I think I have done my homework and looked at many posts here on Stack Overflow and tried a couple of approaches. However, none of those approaches seems to work for me. Here's the structure of my code:Here's how I run the codeNote that I cannot start the background job before the stuff in  has started running.And here is my first try with  in my class file:However, the problem with this approach is that the program crashes at random times; sometimes right at the beginning of prpgram execution and sometimes later the erro messages are also different every time. I guess it's possibly because threads do not block a piece of memory and things might be being written/read from those memory cells. Or, unlikely, maybe this is because I am running my code on a server and there are some limitations enforced from the server on the allocated resources. In addition, I cannot set a limit on the number of threads and cannot do queuing, in case  code gets executed more than twice while I already have two background jobs running.Here's another try with :The problem with this approach is that Process will use as many threads/cores that my machine has in its disposal and since the rest of my code automatically is run in parallel, everything becomes super slow very quickly.I eventually arrived at  but I am still pretty confused on how I can use it effectively. Anyways, here's my try with :However,  seems not to work. None of the  statements that I have in the  print anything on the screen. I added  after  but I get some errors soon after the second processes start. I tried using things like  and some others but it seems that they require a function that takes limited arguments. But my  does not take any arguments. Finally, I do not know how I can do the  that I explained earlier using Pool.Also, I want to have control over how many times and when I want to run . Also,  should not wait for all threads to finish running before it exits. If that happens, I won't benefit from multi threading because the background function might take too long to finish. Maybe I should have been more clear in the question; sorry about that.So I would really appreciate if someone can help me with this. I am pretty confused. Thanks in advance!
the program crashes randomly. I guessIt would be easier to concentrate on one problem at a time, without guessing, so, what's the crash?Here's a test with  that might inspire you, based on the  example for . It prints
