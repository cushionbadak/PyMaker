I have a big program, say . I want to execute with two options, say 1 or 2. In case option 1 is chosen () I want  to execute some parts of the code (in particular lines 70 to 117 and comment lines 118 to 130), if 2 is chosen I want the opposite behaviour (comment/deactivate lines 70 to 117 and uncomment/activate lines 118 to 130).I know  to read from the command line, but do you have a (relatively) clean solution for this problem?
You should organise your code into functions eg.This way you can choose which code you want to call:To call function depending on argument you can use conditional expression:Or (better solution) use dictionary:So entire file would look like this:In addition, I suggest you to read about functions, which use is the basis for programming - https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions
Take a look at the excellent library Click. It allows you to wrap your program into functions that act as commands to your program when called from the command line.Your main file would look something like this:And you'd execute it at the command line like:
You can use sys module in python
