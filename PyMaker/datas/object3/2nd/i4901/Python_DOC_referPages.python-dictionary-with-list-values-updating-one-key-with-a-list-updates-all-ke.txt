I am new to python dictionaries so I am not sure why this happens. Basically the problem is whenever I update a key with a list, it updates all keys in that dictionary with the list.The try, except is to have unique users only so I don't think that's the problemHere's the code:the print statements give me:Even though the list_contacts is different every time (you can try printing it before updating the dictionary), all the key values are getting updated to the last list in that iteration. Any help is very much appreciated as I really don't know what is the cause for this.Thank you :)
this is a copy by ref problem - all your dict-"values" hold the same reference to the same data - as soon as you use one reference to update data, you modify the data underlying all references. If you want to have distinct and different lists, you need to copy.deepcopy() it when you put it into your dict.You can get a unique id using  on a pyton object to distinguish/compare if they are "the same" or "different" like so:original list shallow copy of deepcopyed Copy & paste into your editor and play around - change stuff and pp the various versions to see what carries over (or inspect the ids).
