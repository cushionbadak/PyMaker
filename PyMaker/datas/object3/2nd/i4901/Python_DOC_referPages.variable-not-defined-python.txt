When I run the code, why does the following error message appear?NameError: name 'MaxSlots' is not defined
 is always returned as a string and thus never equal to an integer.  The function then reads a line from input, converts it to a string (stripping a trailing newline)See the documentationYour  or  is never true since an integer is not a string in the Python world (if you used an  it would always return that) so you never define the new variable (since it is never run).  What you need to do is to convert each  to an integer.  This can be done using  function:Here  has been converted to an integer once an input value has been given.You do not need the  in the   statements if you are using Python 3 either:If you are using Python 2  does not take an You might also want to add an  to make sure  is always defined, ensuring you do not get this error.
Use  function to convert it to integer and initialize MaxSlots variable with a value.
