Natural Text
I have a file  which was created by reformatting the information here so the it is represented as a Python dictionary named . When I go to import the module using:I get the following error:UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xe9 in position 5436: invalid continuation byteI would like to avoid removing as much information as possible, but with that in mind what can I do to  so that it can be imported?
You probably chose a non-UTF-8 encoding for the .txt file (and the resulting .py file). A decent text editor can re-encode the file to UTF-8. Or you can prepend a line to the  file specifying the actual encoding:where  is replaced by the encoding's name. My guess is that  might work (which is the standard Windows encoding where  is represented by ).
