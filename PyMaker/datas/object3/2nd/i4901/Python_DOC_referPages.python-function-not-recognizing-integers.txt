I am writing a function that takes 3 inputs, if all 3 inputs are floats and/or integers it returns the average of the 3, otherwise it returns them as a list. This is what I have:when I input 3 integers it returns the list, how can I get it to recognize the input as integers? Thanks
Here is one way:Explanation applies a lazy function  on a generator expression, which checks if all items in  are integers or floats. is generally preferred to checking .The  /  clause can be replaced by a ternary statement.
You can use exception handling. A  exception is raised if not all elements of  are numeric:
Minimal changes to get the code to work in Python 2 or 3:You just needed to compare type(t) to int or float, and convert s to float before the division.  You also have to complete testing of all list members before the return, otherwise s = sum(l)will bomb for a case like [1, 'str', 6]
