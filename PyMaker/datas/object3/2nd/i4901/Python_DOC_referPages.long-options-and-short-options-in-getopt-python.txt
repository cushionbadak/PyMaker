In the below code I am mixing both short and long options. Also notice that "--longoption1" is separated by "=" and "--longoption2" is separated by space. But getopt does not differentiate between space and = for long options. On the contrary for short options anything followed by the short option (x,y,z) is considered as the value for the option. Notice "-x:shortvalue1 -y shortvalue2 -zshortvalue3" x is separated by :, y by space and z is not even separated by anything, but still getopt parses as I can imagine.  In continuation, why does the following code fail? Notice that "--longoption3longvalue3" is similar to "-zshortvalue3". I mean the option and its value are not separated. In this case short options still work but long options do not. Instead it causes the following error:I was following https://docs.python.org/3/library/getopt.html but I could not find any references for the answer I am looking for.
This is the correct, intended behaviour following both BSD and GNU  conventions. (Notice that the "long option" idea originated from GNU and is not part of the POSIX API).From the GNU man page:A long option may take a parameter, of the form  or . To pass a long option to the program, the name of the option and the value must be joined by either an equal sign , or separated as neighbouring items in , i.e.Joining them together will cause the underlying  library function to recognize this part as one long option whose name is , which is correctly unrecognized.
