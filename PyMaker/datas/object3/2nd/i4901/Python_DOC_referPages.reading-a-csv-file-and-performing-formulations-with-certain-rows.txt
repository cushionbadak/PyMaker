I asked a question similar last night, but my professor gave some clarification on how she wants the question answered, and it's thrown me for a loop.I've got a csv file with 3 columns.  I'm saving them as a dictionary, but I'm trying to find a way to read the  and the  and find a specific  (Occupied Housing Units), match it up with the earliest year (2008) and take the number in the  column next to those and match it to the NEXT  (2009) with the same  (Occupied Housing Units), find the difference between those two values, and print the outcome and do the same with 2009 & 2010, etc. like this:The csv looks like this:And the code I have so far is:Thanks!  I'm new to programming, and I'm an older dude.  I love that the programming community is beyond helpful, as if you all are welcoming everyone into a cult (the good kind?).
You could do it like this:Create a  of those row s which have the target  value in them.Sort it by the year value in each one.Use the  recipe for the  generator to process each pair of rows/years in the sorted .Code implementing the above:Output:
One easy way is to use 3 lists(each of your title_field) to keep the year and value fields, then you can process each list.
I suggest you to use pandas for doing it.Then you could use  and aggregation in a breeze.like this:Result:
