Pass them as named parameters to your service method:or since you have many parameters and they're a dict already:
Look at this example:and refer--> https://chillyfacts.com/send-soap-request-and-read-xml-response-from-php-page/#respondfrom zeep import Clientcl = Client('http://www.holidaywebservice.com/HolidayService_v2/HolidayService2.asmx?wsdl')request_data = {    'countryCode':'Scotland',    'year':2018}print(cl.service.GetHolidaysForYear(**request_data))
