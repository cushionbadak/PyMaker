Natural Text
Let me elaborate the process. Following is the sample code snippet of my applicationBelow screenshot is the output of my app. My need is I want to change the colour of button I click in Primary interface, but what happens is whatever the button I click, it is changing colour of the last button. I tried using lambda, but I doubt if I am using it correctly. The above snippet is working except the colour change part. Please guide me on how to get this done. Also, I want "Run Selected" button to print (text of) that particular button I clicked.P.S.: I have checked in this link too yet not solvable.
One option is to use  or  and pass the instance of the boton as argument. Instead of setting the callback when the button is instantiated (the reference does not yet exist) you can use the  method. On the other hand you can use an instance attribute to store the references of the selectable buttons ( in the code below, a list) and another attribute that stores the reference of the selected button ( in the code below).The code could look like this:I have modified other things, for example, I have provided a toggle button behavior for the buttons.This is the result:
