I need to calculate just first five prime numbers. I want to check the length of list while building it in list comprehension. The following code doesn't work.Output:Why  is not working here. How can I achieve that?
The "Pythonic" way is to use a generator, plus the  function:What this will do is create an infinite "list" called  that you can use in many ways that a list can be used, but it will only actually calculate the values that you need.
Use  combined with  to make your computation lazy.
List Comprehension creates and returns the new list. In your code, within the list comprehension,  will always return zero because the length of list will not be updated till the list comprehension is complete and new list is returned. If it is must for you to use a list comprehension, you may create a generator function to return you the next prime in the range. Within the list comprehension call the  on the generator object (using the  to restrict the count of required values). For example:The final value hold by  will be:As suggested in robbrit's answer, Pythonic way to achieve this is using  (but it is not a list comprehension as you requested):
