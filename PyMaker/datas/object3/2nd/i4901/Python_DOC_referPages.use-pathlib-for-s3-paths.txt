I would like to build some functionality to move files between s3 and my local file system, but pathlib appears to eat up repeated slashes, breaking my aws-cli functionality:Is there a way to use pathlib for manipulating s3 paths?
You can try combining urllib.parse with pathlib.It's quite cumbersome, but it's what you asked for.
No.   is for filesystem paths (i.e., paths to files on your computer), while S3 paths are URIs.
