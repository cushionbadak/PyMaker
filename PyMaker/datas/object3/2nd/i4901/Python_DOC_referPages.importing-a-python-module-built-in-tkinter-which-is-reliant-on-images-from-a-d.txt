I am trying to import a python program from within another python program, however these are not in the same directories, and so I am using this code:This works, and it opens the program. However, the problem I am having with this is that the program I am importing relies on some images and files that don't seem to get loaded (which prevents the program from running properly). These files are placed in What I've TriedI have tried placing my program that I am importing into the same directory as the files it relies on, but this came with the same error as shown here:So my question is - how can I fix the issue I describe above?
One possible solution is to turn Maths module into an import package. Put it inside your working folder, in a subfolder. Put an empty  in that subfolder to make Maths a package. You can now import it as usual from any module that is started from the working folder. To solve the error you'll have to abstract the resources location inside the Maths code. Try using  to get the contents of those files.See  docs, in the page bottom.
