I am just trying to make a random monster generator for an RPG I am writing. I am using Python 2.7. It's difficult to explain but I will try.So I am trying to make it so that if "random.choice(numbers)" comes up with the "has 1" variable, it uses "random.choice(attachmentssingle)" instead of the normal "random.choice(attachments)"This is because I don't want it to print out "has 1 legs" or "has 1 heads". Instead it would print out "has 1 leg" or "has 1 head".Is there any way to do this without getting too complicated? (I'm very new to Python and am trying to learn it while I'm sick.)EDIT: My code expected an indented block with "print random.choice(attachmentssingle)" near the bottom. But otherwise the code works just fine, it's just that I'm trying to replace "random.choice(attachments)" with "random.choice(attachmentssingle)" if "random.choice(numbers)" comes up with "has 1" EDIT 2: I tried @user202729's suggestion and this is what I came up with:However it doesn't seem to be working as it's the wrong syntax, and I've tried several different ways of typing it out but it doesn't seem to be working.EDIT 3: @Patrick Artner hit the nail on the head, thanks a lot man! I really appreciate all you guys helping me out with this!
You could use a monster class that remebers all the monster parameters for later use. YOu need to remember at least the number of appendages somewhere, so you can decide on which kind of attachments you use. (very basic)Output (reformatted):Advantage: If they got HP or Attacks as well, you can "script" them into your class instance as well and compute by those rememberd values:Output: 
You can use the trinary operator like this:
I am not sure i understood exactly what you are looking for but this might help you and i don't have enough reputation to comment but this might help you.then print num and choice instead using random functions again
