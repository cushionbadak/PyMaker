A textbook suggests I should be able to do this:I can do this: But, I would like to do the former. I'm trying to write a method which overrides config data from various files. Am I completely off base here?UpdateThe book was quite misleading. It posted part of the code, the result of the complete code block, and then gave the remainder. As I was referencing, rather than working through it cover to cover, I tripped over myself. This is the code I now have:Update2Using Mad Physicist's answer below, my code would be:
You are completely off-base and the textbook is giving you some very bad advice. runs Python code. As in Python statements, not the name of a file. From the docs:exec(object[, globals[, locals]])This function supports dynamic execution of Python code. object must be either a string or a code object. If it is a string, the string is parsed as a suite of Python statements which is then executed (unless a syntax error occurs)That is why your second statement works fine. If you want to run a Python module, import it. If you need to import using a dynamic name instead of a hard-coded  statement, you can use :This will run the whole import machinery for you, including ensuring that  ends up in .If you really need something even fancier, you can use the  machinery.  is the under-the-hood implementation of the  statement:If you want full control over the process, you can use the low-level machinery described here: How to import a module given the full path?. In particular see my answer to that question, since it describes how to load random text files as Python scripts: https://stackoverflow.com/a/43602557/2988730:Final note: It looks like you blindly converted all the  to  in your path. Forward slashes do not need to be escaped, so you only need single forward slashes. If you want to avoid escaping your backslashes, put  in front of your string to make it a raw string.
