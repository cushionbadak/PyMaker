I am looking for a way to connect two lists and two conditions... My way doesn't work and I have no idea how to get it right.What I want:Find terms of triggerlist in file. If the have been found, find citylist terms. Only if this combination is found, print successAll my following approaches do not workâ€¦   UPDATE:As it seems I was not clear enough (but I thought I was), here another brief description of what I want:Is it now better to understand what I want?
If you just want to find words which appear in both of triggerlist and citylist, you can runAlso note that Python evaluates boolean conditions lazilyhttps://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#boolean-operations 
Found it out by myself, after hours of thinking and trying. As it turns out  it was not a problem of arranging, but of simple understanding. The solution is really easy and basic python stuff. I think it was just a blackout, after too much coding. Maybe this answer helps others as well. 
Try this:-
If I understand your question correctly, you are looking to see if any of the triggerlist words are also in the citylist?  If this is the case you can do this very efficiently by converting them to sets and look for the intersection:If you are reading from a file of words: (note this answer is incomplete if there are more than one word per line, but you can figure out the rest).UpdateGiven the new information.  You can convert your trigger and city list to sets to compare the overlap (&) very efficiently.  You can put your second check inside of the first one rather than perform them independently.I haven't tested this code, mind you, but it should be straightforward to get it working.
