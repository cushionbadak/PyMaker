The above shaded area, according to Wolfram is supposed to represent: How to translate this into python code? The code must closely correlate to the set operations as provided in the above expression, at least that is the preference. The code must be generic enough to handle more more than 3 lists as well. UPDATE: Seems like Wolfram is throwing up an erroneous venn diagram? Also, what we actually want is and I am not able to represent that in Wolfram. 
Python supports sets (more about sets). For three lists it will be:For list of lists (this is wrong - all it does is XORing all sets, ANDing all sets and than XORing this two results - correct solution below):Correct solution:
You can use operations  [intersection] and  [union] for your purpose. Data from @WPedrak.ExplanationWe take the union of all elements and subtract all intersections. See @WPedrak's solution for general case.
