I was wondering the best way to find if a key exist in python dictionary, not visiting the whole list of keys again and again. I am thinking of try except. Is there any better way? 
Just use the  operator:
The Pythonic way would be be to follow the EAFP (Easier to Ask for Forgivenes than Permission) principle.That means assuming the key is in the dict, and catching the exception if it's not, like so:
As @Mureinik mentioned, you can just use:to return either true or false. However, if you desperately wanted to use try and except, you could use:
Sorry for the confusion guys. I know that I can use simply key_name in dict.keys(). But I have to search all the keys to know if that key exist. So I was thinking about try except like the above one. My question is if this is good practice to use try except? Is there any other way that will serve the same purpose of not visiting all the keys?
