Ok so I have looked around and seen similar questions and have tried a few different things.  Here is what I am trying to accomplish.  I have a list of variables with float values already assigned to them.  I want to be able to ask the user to chose a variable from list and add float values to existing variable or create a new variable and assign it a value and add it to the list. (I'm using python 3)Here is what I have currentlySo I am trying to get the user to name the variable and define the amount and then add it to this list.  When I run it I get this messageThe adding to existing function part is fine I believe.  I would really appreciate if someone could tell where I am going wrong or if this is a ridiculous way of going about doing this.  If it is, what is a more efficient way?
As long as input contains a space, this program should not throw an .If your input does not contain a space, splitting by  would create a list of length 1, containing the entire input string, which would then cause an  if you try to access the element at index .A solution would be to assign each variable to its own :However, in its current form your code will throw a  on the next line:You need to convert the  variable to a list to concatenate. You can do this using square brackets:Although this would now work, as you want to associate a name with the values you store in the list, you may want to use a . This allows you to access the names of stored values rather than hardcoding them in your output string using However, you will then need to check that if the user chooses to add to a new name, it is not already a key in the dictionary as the previous value would be overwritten.A starting point for the program could look like this:Although you probably don't want to name your dictionary .
