This question already has an answer here:sort dictionary by another dictionary                    1 answer                I have two Python dictionaries - I want to sort  based on the values of .The final answer should be something like -What is the most efficient way to solve this? 
Yeah. Use sorted() and pass a "key" function that knows how to get the value to sort by. Something like:Note that I leave it as a list of tuples. If you want an actual dictionary out of this, you'd have to use OrderedDict.
You can try this:Output:
Note that your result is no longer a dict, but rather a list of lists, which is better if you want to sort it, since order in dicts isn't guaranteed/implementation detailI would sort the items according to the value of the key in the other dictionary, and convert the tuples that  yield to 2-elements :result:
