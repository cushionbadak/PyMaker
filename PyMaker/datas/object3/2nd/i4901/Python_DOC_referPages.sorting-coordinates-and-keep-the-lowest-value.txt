For the array below, I am interested to sort the X-axis according to the y-axis and record the lowest tuple of the lowest X-value. The array is:I would to do this:What could I try here? 
Given: you can do:which gives:Here is a link to find out more about .And here is another one for .
To sort your list, useA common pattern is to sort complex objects using some of the object's indices as a key.The second part of your question.To get the lowest value according to X, and lowest value according to y are both shown below
The given two dimensional array is : Let us suppose  is a relation with  as ordered pairs.Therefore declare two variables  and  and initialize them to the first values, i.e,HenceAlso take two dummy variables  and  to iterate through the two dimensional array : The following algorithm chooses the lowest  value. If there are more than 1  values which are equal , then choose  such that  is lowest.The ordered pair (x,y) is stored in the variable  and then printed.Please let me know if there is change in algorithm's logic.
