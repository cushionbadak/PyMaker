I would like to implement validation for Python 3.6 type annotation within my project.  I have a method that uses  dict to check if all attributes of the class have the correct value. It works perfectly for basic types like ,  or , but fails for more sophisticated elements like  or  (which is also a Union).The failure is caused by  method within  object that throws . I even cannot find a way to ensure that the annotation is a Union so I cannot validate if a value complies with a type. The  module does not have any solution for it. Is there a way to validate if specified variable complies with ?
Yes.  and  were killed some time ago for cases like . The idea, as also stated in a comment on the issue by GvR is to implement your own version of  that use some of the extra metadata attached to types: and  are available as of Python 3.6.3. They might not in earlier versions since typing is still provisional. Until the internal interface for introspecting types is fleshed out and typing graduates from provisional status, you should expect breakage due to changes in the API.
