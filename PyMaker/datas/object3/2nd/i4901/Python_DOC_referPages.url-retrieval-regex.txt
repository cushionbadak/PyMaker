Possible Duplicate:What is the best regular expression to check if a string is a valid URL? Considering a string as follows:How could I, with Python, extract the urls, inside the anchor tag's href? Something like:Thanks!

The best answer is...Don't use a regexThe expression in the accepted answer misses many cases. Among other things, URLs can have unicode characters in them. The regex you want is here, and after looking at it, you may conclude that you don't really want it after all. The most correct version is ten-thousand characters long.Admittedly, if you were starting with plain, unstructured text with a bunch of URLs in it, then you might need that ten-thousand-character-long regex. But if your input is structured, use the structure. Your stated aim is to "extract the url, inside the anchor tag's href." Why use a ten-thousand-character-long regex when you can do something much simpler?Parse the HTML insteadFor many tasks, using Beautiful Soup will be far faster and easier to use:If you prefer not to use external tools, you can also directly use Python's own built-in HTML parsing library. Here's a really simple subclass of  that does exactly what you want:Test:You could even create a new method that accepts a string, calls , and returns . This is a vastly more powerful and extensible way than regular expressions to extract information from html.
