I am writing a test console program-phonebook with Python. My IDE is JetBrains PyCharm. I have 5 functions - Search contact, Enter contact, Delete contact, All phones and Exit. My question is how can I make the program to save information in text file and when I compile it, the information will be saved in this text file ? 
You could write the data to a csv file. https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html
This should help : https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/inputoutput.htmlI think for your case the easiest would be to write data to a python file as follows:This will make it extremely easy to load data later without having to parse (as in a csv).In the example code i provide, im saving your contact names to a list called 'contact_names' in a python file named 'MyFile.py'. When you execute 'MyFile.py you will have access to the 'contact_names' variable
