I wonder if this hint is just for better readability or it really does some optimizations.https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#type-aliases
No, an alias does not convey any kind of performance optimisation.It just makes it easier to read your code. It is easier to reason about a function accepting a  and returning (another) , than it is to use the more generic  type in the signature of .Use aliases the same way you would use constants in your code. For example, if your code needed to calculate acceleration in free-fall, you'd store  as the  constant, rather than just use  in your code. Using  makes your code easier to read.
