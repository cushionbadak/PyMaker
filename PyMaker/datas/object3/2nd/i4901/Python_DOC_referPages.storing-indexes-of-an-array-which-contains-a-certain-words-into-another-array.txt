Natural Text
I have these lists:I want to save those indexes of "array" that contain the word "school" into "finalArray". Meaning that "finalArray" should become like this:I tried the following code which does not do the job:Why is it not working? Is there a better way to do this?
Your solution is not working since you're checking for the whole word 'school' in your example array. To accomplish what you want you have to traverse the list and check each element for containing 'school':Please note that I have added a lower() to each checked element to make sure that your program will also catch 'School' in the input list.
You need to iterate through the array, looking to see whether the target word,  is in that array element.  Then drop the index into your list.Output:Your original attempt didn't do that:  could find the location of  in a sentence, not the location of the sentence containing  in the array.Improvement with more Pythonic technology:
You can check if  exists in the current element of iteration:Output:
 is one Pythonic solution to extract indices:If you want values, the logic is simpler:A list comprehension gives the same result as appending to a list via a for loop, except it is highly optimised.
Why is it not working? Because the index(x) method, according to the official Python 3 documentation:Return the smallest i such that i is the index of the first occurrence of x in the array.So, if you want ,you don't want indexes (integer numbers), but you want the actual item (in this case a string).Is there a better way to do this?You can simply iterate over the elements (the strings) of your  and, if the string contains the word "school" you can add it to .Note: this is not Pythonic code by purpose. Delirious Lettuce's answer contains a Pythonic way of doing it.
I am wondering noone introduced a solution with the built-in function:
