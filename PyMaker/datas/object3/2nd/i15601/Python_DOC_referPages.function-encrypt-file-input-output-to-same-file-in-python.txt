You can't generally read from and write to a file at the same time.So, you have two basic options.First, you can read into memory, then encrypt, then write back out. Hopefully you have an  function that works on strings rather than files. Since you've tagged this , and all of its engines work on strings, this should be trivial. But if you have to use files, you can usually use  (or, for 2.x, ), which wraps up a byte string in a file-like object, like this:This is dead simple, but of course it could be a problem if your files are gigantic.Or you can write to a , then  the original file with the temporary:This has some major advantages over the other method—it doesn't necessarily take a ton of memory (that depends on how  is written), and there's no chance of leaving behind a partially-written file if you pull the plug ( is atomic—it either happens completely, or not at all). But it's a little more complicated. And, before Python 3.3, there was no  function. On Unix,  works just as well. On Windows… well, that's a whole mess.
