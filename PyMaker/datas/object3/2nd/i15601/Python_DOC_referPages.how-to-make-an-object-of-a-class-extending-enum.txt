I have the following Python class.But when I try to create an object it it throws an error telling What is the other expected argument.
Per the docstring in the source code (note that this method is defined on the metaclass, ):[] is used both when an enum class is given a value to match  to an enumeration member (i.e. ) and for the functional API  (i.e. ).The required positional argument  is either one of the values of an existing enumerator, or the name of a new one. This is covered in the documentation here for the former, and here for the latter.
