I'm trying to use processing.Manager to share data between processes (processing.Manager.list, processing.Manager.dict, ...). But, when i use it, object are duplicated:Output:Shareds objects are duplicated when used: 0xb72a64a8 != 0xb72a64e8.I'm doing it wrong ?Why these objects are duplicated ?How can i use objects with processing.Manager.list/dict/etc ?
It's pretty much inherent that objects are copied, not shared, between processes. That's the definition of separate processes: that they have separate heaps with separate objects.If you want actual shared data, you have to use , , or â€”but of course in that case, you're limited to "native" values and those you can express in terms of C structs. And, even then, there's no guarantee that the  will be the same across processes, only that the value itself will be.The point of  is that you can put an object like, say, a  in a server process, and a proxy to that object in each child process. The list proxy looks like a real list as far as core list functionality goes (iteration, indexing, , , , etc.). But the proxy doesn't try to fake "under-the-covers" introspection functionality like .The exact list of types that can be proxied by  out of the box differs between Python versions, but you can find it in the docs for your version. As of 3.4, it includes , , , , , , , , , , ,  and . At any rate, it's never going to include , because  has no functionality beyond the under-the-covers stuff.Of course you can register your own types with the  with custom proxies. But I'm not sure what you'd want to share with .See Sharing state between processes for an overview and Managers for full details.
