I have  . My task is if in the string characters repeat then I must write the character plus a number counting the repeats.My code (but it doesn't work):Sample Input 1: Sample Output 1: Sample Input 2: Sample Output 2: 
You've got three problems with your code.First, as gnibbler points out, all of your / conditions are the same. And you don't need a separate condition for each letter, you just need to print the variable (like ) instead of a literal (like ).Second, you're trying to print out the current run length for each character in the run, instead of after the entire run. So, if you get this working, instead of  you're going to get . You need to keep track of the current run length for each character in the run, but then only print it out when you get to a different character.Finally, you've got two off-by-one errors. First, when  starts at 0,  is , which is the last character; you don't want to compare with that. Second, when  finally gets to  at the end, you've got a leftover run that you need to deal with.So, the smallest change to your code is:As a side note, one really easy way to improve this:  gives you all the numbers from 0 up to but not including , so you can get rid of  and the manual  loop and just use .But you can improve this even further by looping over an iterable of  pairs; then you don't need the indexes at all. This is pretty easy with  and slicing. And then you don't need the special handling for the edges either either:I think Matthias's  solution is more pythonic, and simpler (there's still a lot of things you could get wrong with this, like starting with ), but this should be mostly understandable to a novice out of the box. (If you don't understand the , try printing out , , and  and it should be clearer.)
This looks like a task for itertools.groupby.ResultThis might help to understand what's happening here.Result
This is kind of a silly way to go about it, but:Example
