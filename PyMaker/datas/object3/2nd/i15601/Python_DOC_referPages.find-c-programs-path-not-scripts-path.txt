I've made a game and I'd like to save the highscore.  So I need a place to do that. I chose to put it in the  directory. My problem is that that directory name isn't the same on every computer. For example on mine it's  (x86).So my question:Is there a way, to discover that path on any computer?PROBLEM SOLVED:os.getenv('PROGRAMFILES')
I second @iCodez's answer to use to get the path string from a system environment variable, but you might want to use the paths defined for APPDATA or LOCALAPPDATA instead. Windows permissions settings on the Program Files directory may prevent a standard user account from writing data to the directory. I believe the APPDATA and LOCALAPPDATA paths were designed for just such a use. On my system, APPDATA =  and LOCALAPPDATA = . My user account has full read/write permission for both directories.
You could use  or :Note that you can also specify a default return value for when an environment variable is not set:
