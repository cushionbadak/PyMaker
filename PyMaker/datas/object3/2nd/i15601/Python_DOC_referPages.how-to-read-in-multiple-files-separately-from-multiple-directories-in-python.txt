I have x directories which are Star_{v} with v=0 to x. I have 2 csv files in each directory, one with the word "epoch", one without.If one of the csv files has the word "epoch" in it needs to be sent through one set of code, else through another. I think dictionaries are probably the way to go but this section of the code is a bit of a wrong mess
when dealing with csvs, you should use the csv module, and for your particular case, you can use a dictreader and parse the headers to check for the column you're looking forthen you can extract it from the DictReader's CSV header and do whatever you wantAlso your python looks invalid
