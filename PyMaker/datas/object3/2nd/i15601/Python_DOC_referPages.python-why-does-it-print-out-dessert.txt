I'm new to programming, and obviously I can easily run a program to get the answer, but I want to get a clearer and better understanding of why this code runs "dessert". I understand len(s) is the length of the number, but what about the three numbers "-1, 0 -1"? Can I get a detailed explanation of why this prints dessert?
s t r e s s e d0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 range function :  range(start, stop, step)len(s) = 8len(s-1)= 7the loop starts at 7 stops at 0 and counts(steps) bacwards by 1 (-1)so , the loop prints7 6 5 4 3 2 1d e s s e r t
The code creates a range that counts down. Starting at  (so 7,  is 8 characters long), it'll count down to  (the end point is not included). In other words, you are giving  three arguments,  is one argument,  is the second and  is the third, and they represent the start, stop and step arguments. See the  type documentation.The code then uses those values to index ;  is the last character in the string, , then  is the one-but last character , etc.Breaking this down to the components in an interactive session:If you wanted the code to print out  (with the  at the end) then you need to adjust the  to loop up to :
It's all about .It's all discussed here.It can be used in three ways;Where in the first case, it will give , in the second case , and in the third case .The thing to note here is that the  you get is . Where standard interval notation has been used.The other thing to note here is that step can be negative, which is what you have in your example.
You call a loop with its start index, then tell it to traverse to end index and lastly increase the index or decrease the indexIf you useThe loop will start from 0 index and traverse till last index with 1 index increment
