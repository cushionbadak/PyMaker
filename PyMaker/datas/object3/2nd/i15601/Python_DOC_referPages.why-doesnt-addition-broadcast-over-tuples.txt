E.g., why can't I do:and get:as a result?
Because the  operator is used to make a new tuple that is the combination of two other tuples.  That is just how Python was designed.To do what you want, you can use  and a generator expression:
'+' operator concatenate tuples . if you want to sum tuples item you can use:or 
Its because of you add tow tuple and  operation for tuples concatenate them ! you can use  and  functions for that :or use a generator : and a better way with : 
Since Python thinks of tuples as lists that are immutable, adding two tuples is just like adding two lists. So, just as adding two lists will concatenate them:adding two tuples will also concatenate them:You can create a new tuple that consists of the sum of each pair with a few of Python's built-in functions:This works by using  on the two tuples to make a list of pairs:And using  to apply  on each element of that list, to get a list of sums:And, finally, using  to turn that from a list into a tuple.
Element-wise addition is a more specialized operation than concatenation. Fewer tuples could be added together: what would  equal? Or  for that matter?Since concatenation is arguably the more commonly desired operation, and importantly, well defined for all tuples, it makes sense that addition of tuples performs concatenation.
