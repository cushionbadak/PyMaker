I have the following list:  and I'd like to return a list containing the repeated pattern between the two elements of the list (in this case 'hihi').Here's what I'm doing:When I  it gives me . What I'd like to have is , only. I don't want 'blabla' to be returned because I don't have 'blabla' in the second element of the list. What am I missing?
Use  operations to get intersection of matched groups:used  or  to get common part that appear both in two matches.You need to modify the pattern or to use  because of the way  returns according to whether capturing group(s) is used or not; If one or more groups are present in the pattern, return a list of groups instead of a list of whole matched strings.UPDATEAs georg suggested, you can use ; does not require to use .
