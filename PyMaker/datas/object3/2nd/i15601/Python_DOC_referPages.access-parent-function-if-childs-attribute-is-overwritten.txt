I fear that I am dump as hell, but I do not have a clue how to execute a methode from a class if the variable name is overwritten in the class instance.This is the starting position. While the thing is running, a variable  is declarated in  so the function gets overwritten. My problem is, how do I manage that the method is called rather than the variable if I want to change variable  of ?I thought  is the way to go, but I have no idea how to achieve this properly. Unforunately my english is not that good so I may screwed up asking search the correct questions.
You dont have a parent and a child, you have an instance of a class, super is used when you overwite a method of a base classsuper
Why would you have to overwrite the attribute ? You shouldn't do that.
