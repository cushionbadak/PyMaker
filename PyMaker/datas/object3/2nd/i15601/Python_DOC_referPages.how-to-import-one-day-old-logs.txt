I am new to Python and need some help in being able to import done day old logs.  Below is the script I have come up with, but not sure if it is working or if there is a better way to do this.I have a script that does import the whole database from mid June 2014 but only need to get day old logs.Here is a sample of the logs I am trying to import/mnt/hcp1/R1P/R1P_ora_982_2.xml.201409070400  /mnt/hcp1/R1P/R1P_ora_20_1.xml.201409070400  /mnt/hcp1/R1P/R1P_ora_29962_1.xml.201409070400  /mnt/hcp1/R1P/R1P_ora_15593_2.xml.201409070400  /mnt/hcp1/R1P/R1P_ora_9946_1.xml.201409070400  /mnt/hcp1/R1P/R1P_ora_10746_1.xml.201409070400  /mnt/hcp1/R1P/R1P_ora_6508_1.xml.201409070400  /mnt/hcp1/R1P/R1P_ora_17340_2.xml.201409070400  /mnt/hcp1/SCC/SCC_ora_18881_2.xml.201407090400  
In order to compare the file creation time to one day ago, you need to actually get the file creation time. Your code is using , the function; it doesn't mean anything useful to ask whether that function is less than some time.Unfortunately, "file creation time" is not a portable concept. If you really want that, you need to write different code for different platforms, which I won't explain.Usually, you're happy with "file modification time". This is set when the file is created, and updated only when you overwrite or append to the file. You can use  to read this. So:However, it looks like there's a timestamp attached to each filename. If  means that the file was created on 7 September 2014 at 04:00 (and if the timezones, etc. aren't an issue), you may want to consider parsing those strings instead of ting the file. And once you're parsing date strings, you might as well use the simpler and higher-level  library instead of the lower-level . (You could do this with the previous version too, but since  returns a -style timestamp, you'd have to convert it manually to use it as a , so there's less advantage.)So:(Also, I'm not sure what that  is. Maybe you meant ?)
Regarding the "two days ago" part, you should use  and E.g.
