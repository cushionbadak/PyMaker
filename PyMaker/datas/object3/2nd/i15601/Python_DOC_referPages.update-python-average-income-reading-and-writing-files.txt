I was writing a code to find the average household income, and how many families are below poverty line. this is my code so farCall the main function.povertyLevel()I am trying to find the average of annualIncome and what i tried to do was avgIncome = (sum(annualIncome)/len(annualIncome))outFile.write(avgIncome)i did this inside the while lineRead. however it gave me an error sayingavgIncome = (sum(annualIncome)/len(annualIncome))TypeError: 'float' object is not iterable currently i am trying to find which household that exceeds the average income.
 expects a sequence (such as a ) (Thanks for the correction, Magenta Nova.), but its argument  is a :It seems to me you want to build up a list:(Note that I have one less indentation level for the  call.)Also, once you get this working, I highly recommend a trip over to https://codereview.stackexchange.com/. You could get a lot of feedback on ways to improve this.Edit:In light of your edits, my advice still stands. You need to first compute the average before you can do comparisons. Once you have the average, you will need to loop over the data again to compare each income. Note: I advise saving the data somehow for the second loop, instead of reparsing the file. (You may even wish to separate reading the data from computing the average entirely.) That might best be accomplished with a new object or a  or a .
sum() and len() both take as their arguments an iterable. read the python documentation for more on iterables. you are passing a float into them as an argument. what would it mean to get the sum, or the length, of a floating point number? even thinking outside the world of coding, it's hard to make sense of that. it seems like you need to review the basics of python types.
