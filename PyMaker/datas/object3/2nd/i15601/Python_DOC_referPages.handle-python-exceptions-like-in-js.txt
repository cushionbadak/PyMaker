Although there is no error in your code, you usually don't pass exceptions as arguments into other scopes unless the exception instance will be actually used as data. Exceptions in Python are lightweight and they bubble up to render a full traceback, so you must just let them live and happen.If you expect some kind of exception happen when you call , just write code to handle it, like this:Pro tip: avoid catching just . Always expect specific types of errors, get used to write and raise your own exceptions as well. It helps a lot. Read more about it. ;)PS: I also come from JavaScript as primary language; I'm sure you'll love Python too. :)
