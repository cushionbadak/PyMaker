Is there a quick way to replace part of the path in python? for example:I don't know the beginning of the path (), so what I'd really like to tell python to keep everything that comes after  (inclusive) and replace everything before  with :
You can use the index of :
If you're using Python 3.4+, or willing to install the backport, consider using  instead of :If you just want to stick with the 2.7 or 3.3 stdlib, there's no direct way to do this, but you can get the equivalent of  by looping over . For example, keeping each path component until you find the first , and then tacking on the new prefix, will replace everything before the last  (if you want to replace everything before the first , it's not hard to change things):This is a bit clumsy, so you might want to consider writing a simple function that gives you a list or tuple of the path components, so you can just use , then join it all back together, as with the  version.
First grab the relative path from the starting directory of your choice using Then add the new first part of the path to this relative path using 
A rather naive approach, but does the job:Function:Example:
