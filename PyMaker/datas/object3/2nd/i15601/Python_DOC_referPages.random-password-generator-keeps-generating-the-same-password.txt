I have to write a program that generates random passwords (using ASCII values and the chr() function) using Python and I have gotten my program to generate a random password, but when the program loops, it keeps printing the same random password and I have no idea what to do to fix it. If anyone could give me some advice, that would be great because I'm new to pythonhere is the code that I have so far:
You never reset , so your  loop always returns  after the first password is generated.Because you also do not reset  that means you generate just the one random password and re-display that value over and over again.You need to reset both inside the outer  loop:You could just use  instead of  there. You could also use a  loop instead of your inner  loop, simplifying your setup:Cleaning that up some more by using  and :
Once you have been through the loop once,  is equal to , so the loop  will exit immediately.Set  back to zero and  back to  inside the outer loop
Your code only generates one password and keeps printing it. That's because it runs the loop  just once: inside the loop, you increase the position until the password is long enough. But during next iterations,  will be already long enough - so the  loop won't be entered; instead, the already previously generated password will be printed.You have to reset  to zero before entering the  loop.
At that point your program did everytime the same, so without initialising random you get everytime the same random.you should use random.seed() first or even better use random.SystemRandom() if available.
