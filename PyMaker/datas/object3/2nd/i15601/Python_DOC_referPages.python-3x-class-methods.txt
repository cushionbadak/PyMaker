I'm currently learning the basics of classes, and I came up with some basic code as follows:Now, when I type the following:I get the following output:What is this? How can I get python to actually return the perimeter of the square?Also, I have another question:Do any class methods exist other than  and ? If so, can you please list them so I can go off and research them?
as shown, you are going to have some problems with this.  If you are trying to have circle and square be subset set classes of shape, then the two sub classes need to be indented.  Also, on class circle and square, you really do not need the (shape). also note the things I commented out as not needed.This does not come out as I am posting it.  the class shape (object):does not show up and the subclasses are not indented and I can not seem to make it show upclass shape(object):    def init(self, num_sides, type):        #self.num_sides = num_sides        self.type = type
Two things, indentation of the init of shape and add self. to the perim and area methods.
