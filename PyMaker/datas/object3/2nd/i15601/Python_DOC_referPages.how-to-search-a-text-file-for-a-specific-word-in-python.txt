Natural Text
I want to find words in a text file that match words stored in an existing list called items, the list is created in a previous function and I want to be able to use the list in the next function as well but I'm unsure how to do that, I tried using classes for that but i couldn't get it right. And I can't figure out what the problem is with the rest of the code. I tried running it without the class and list and replaced the list 'items[]' in line 8 with a word in the text file being opened and it still didn't do anything, even though no errors come up. When the below code is run it prints out: "Please entre a valid textfile name: " and it stops there.   The list is created from another text file containing words in a previous function that looks like this and it works as it should, if it is to any help:
You can use regexp the following way:The second command creates a list of acceptable words separated by "|". To run this on a file, just replace the string in 'the red car driven by the woman' for .
This may be a bit cleaner. I feel class is an overkill here.
There is nothing like Regular expressions in matching https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html
