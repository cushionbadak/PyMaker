I have JSON data which looks like this. If not for null (without quotes as a string), I could have used  module's  to convert the above to a dictionary. A dictionary in Python cannot have  as value but can have  as a value. How do I convert the above to a dictionary that Python recognizes?
You should use the built-in  module, which was designed explicitly for this task:By the way, you should use this method even if your JSON data contains no  values.  While it may work (sometimes),  was designed to evaluate Python code that is represented as a string.  It is simply the wrong tool to work with JSON data.
