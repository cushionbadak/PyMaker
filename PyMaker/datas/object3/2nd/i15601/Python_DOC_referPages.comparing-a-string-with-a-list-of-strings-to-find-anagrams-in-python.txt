I am trying to work out how to compare a string (str1) with a list of strings (str_list), and then return a list of all the strings in str_list that are anagrams of str1.I have previously defined a function to compare two strings and print True if they are anagrams of each other, and False if not.I have attempted to start to define the next function but I'm struggling to return the list of strings that are anagrams.Not sure if this is how I'm meant to do it as I'm still a beginner, so any pointers would be very helpful!Thanks.
The faster way to do this would be to use Note that your  will not behave as you expect because you only  the value, you do not  it. For you to be able to use your  function, as I did in my above list comprehension for example, you'd have to do one of the following.Or more concisely
You can use a generators for that , Also note that the result of  function is a list and you need to convert it to string with  and then compare :Demo :
