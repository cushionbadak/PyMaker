Natural Text
 results in Nan (not a number). But how do I check for it? Should be very easy, but I cannot find it.
math.isnan()Checks if the float x is a NaN (not a number). NaNs are part of the IEEE 754 standards. Operation like but not limited to inf * 0, inf / inf or any operation involving a NaN, e.g. nan * 1, return a NaN.New in version 2.6.
The usual way to test for a NaN is to see if it's equal to itself:
 tells you if it's  or not in Python 2.5.
I actually just ran into this, but for me it was checking for nan, -inf, or inf. I just usedThis is true for numbers, false for nan and both inf, and will raise an exception for things like strings or other types (which is probably a good thing). Also this does not require importing any libraries like math or numpy (numpy is so damn big it doubles the size of any compiled application).
here is an answer working with:python non-unique NaN: numpy unique NaN (singleton) : any other objects: string or whatever (does not raise exceptions if encountered)Here it is:And some examples:Output:
math.isnan()or compare the number to itself. NaN is always != NaN, otherwise (e.g. if it is a number) the comparison should succeed.
Another method if you're stuck on <2.6, you don't have numpy, and you don't have IEEE 754 support:
Well I entered this post, because i've had some issues with the function:There are problem when you run this code:It raises exception.My solution for that is to make another check:
With python < 2.6 I ended up withThis works for me with python 2.5.1 on a Solaris 5.9 box and with python 2.6.5 on Ubuntu 10 
Here are three ways where you can test a variable is "NaN" or not.Output
I am receiving the data from a web-service that sends  as a string . But there could be other sorts of string in my data as well, so a simple  could throw an exception. I used the following variant of the accepted answer:Requirement:
All the methods to tell if the variable is NaN or None:None typeNaN type
How to remove NaN (float) item(s) from a list of mixed data typesIf you have mixed types in an iterable, here is a solution that does not use numpy:Short-circuit evaluation means that  will not be called on values that are not of type 'float' as ( quickly evaluates to  without having to evaluate the right-hand side.
For nan of type float  
for strings in panda take pd.isnull:the function as feature extraction for NLTK
