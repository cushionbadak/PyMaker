I have the following class in Python.Now I need to write a method to iterate over all the attributes and return them as a list. I tried accessing individual attributes as  , but am nit sure how to iterate over them. Is there a way in python to do that.
Use the  function.  It'll likely give you more than what you're looking for, but you can filter it (e.g. only take ALL_CAPS words).Sample:and once you have the name, it's easy to get value:Finally, if you're amenable to using a different type, you might be able to use an Enum here.   wasn't added to the standard library until python3.4, but there are backports for python2.x.  I believe that your request would then look like:
You can also use FilterVariable names and values:Variable names:
Try this:First will give an List of the attributes of class including classes which it inherites.Second will give you an dictionary representation for the same
you might want to look into your classe's  attribute, which returns the class itself as a dictionary
You can use  to get attribute name and value.
