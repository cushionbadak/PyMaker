Even if I do not set thread as Daemon, shouldn't the program exit itself once queue.join(), completes and unblocks?Any help will be highly appreciated!
When you call  in the main thread, all it does is block the main threads until the workers have processed everything that's in the queue. It does not stop the worker threads, which continue executing their infinite loops.If the worker threads are non-deamon, their continuing execution prevents the program from stopping irrespective of whether the main thread has finished.
I encountered the situation too, everything in the queue had been processed, but the main thread blocked at the point of Queue.task_done(), here is code block.
