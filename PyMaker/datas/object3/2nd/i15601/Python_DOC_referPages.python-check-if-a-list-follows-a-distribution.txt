I'm trying to find a short way to check if list elements follow a general distribution like :the difference between list[i] and list[i+1] is clearly 2 , but the function i want needs to take in consideration also list[i+1] - list[i] >= 2 .One liners or lambdas are welcome !
Try this:As usual consider  instead of  if memory is a concern.
The obvious way to compare  and  is to  the list with its  slice, then loop over the pairs:For example, to find the maximum difference:This has a few disadvantages if the list is gigantic, or if you want your code to work with any iterable rather than just sequences. In that case, you can easily write a function that yields adjacent pairs:Or:
Can i try this way:
I am not sure what you are looking for but if your goal is just a one liner to iterate over the list and check a condition list comprehensions are a good option.
Try the code belowThis is using itertools.
