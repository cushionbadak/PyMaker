Natural Text
how can i count the number of spaces in a long text without getting the" EOL while scanning string literal"? and also uusing the function 'count', the text is: "'I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, 'for her hair goes in such long  ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all;"
This error, like any , only comes from the parser.Unless you're calling , , or (in Python 2.x) , that means the problem string is in your code, not in the input. For example, maybe it's something like this:In that case, you've got a string that starts with the double-quote, and goes until the next double-quote. Since there is no next double-quote, that's a syntax error.Or, as Mark Ransom points out, if the string itself is a literal in your code, maybe your text editor split it into two lines:In this case, again, you've got a string that starts with the first double-quote, and there is no next double-quote on the line, so it's the same syntax error. (Although in this case, you're not even getting to the line with the  that you're complaining about. This is why exceptions have tracebacks: to tell you, or the people who are trying to help you, where the problem actually happened, so you don't have to guess.)If you are using  or a related function, you're asking Python to treat a string as if it were code, and that string has a similar problem.The obvious solution there is to not call .If you're calling  in Python 2.x, that's the same thing as , so just change to .
You are probably not applying the  method correctly (i.e., you have an invalid string).
