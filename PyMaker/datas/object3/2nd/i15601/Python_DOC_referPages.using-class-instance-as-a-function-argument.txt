Suppose I have something like:Is there anyway to have it so that the changes to pet.weight are not transferred to my_dog.weight?I want the function to be able to take information from a class instance, perform calculations, and then leave the original instance unchanged.
You are reassigning the value of the  attribute on this line:Doing this affects the  instance even after the code has returned from the  function.To fix the problem, simply create a local name that is equal to  and work with that instead:Now, we use the value of  but avoid changing it.Also, you have defined your class incorrectly.  By doing this:you have made  and  to be class attributes of .  This means that their values will be shared among all instances of  and modifying them will affect all instances.  In other words, all of your s will have the same name and weight.But then you do:which overshadows the class attribute  with an instance attribute of the same name.  Unlike class attributes, instance attributes are unique to each instance of a class.  So,  is still a class attribute (shared by all s) while  is now an instance attribute (unique to each ).I think it would be best if you removed those lines and wrote the  class like so:Now,  and  are both instance attributes. Each  has a unique name and weight and changing either of those values on one  will no longer affect the other s.For more information on this, you can check out these sources:https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.htmlhttp://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_classes_objects.htm
