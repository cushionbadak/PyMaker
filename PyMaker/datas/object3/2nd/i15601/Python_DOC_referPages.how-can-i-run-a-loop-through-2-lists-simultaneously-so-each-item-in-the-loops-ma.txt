Natural Text
I am writing a code that plots data using matplotlib. The data is from thousands of text files. I am able to write the loop that can plot the data. Now, I want to add a label to each plot with a piece of information from another file, which I have made into a list:I want the temperature point in the list to be listed on the plot. There is an equal number of temperature points as there are plot text files. There are thousands of text files with the data for making the plots. Each file is a few seconds apart because time is not a variable in the plots. There is one text file with the thousands of times that correspond to each data file, with a temperature for that specific time. I want to run the loop so it will plot the first data file and add the first temperature point as a text on the plot and loop through each file and do the same.
Blockquotecheck out  is like  but generates an iterator, whereas  parses it's input all at once and passes a single huge object to the loop, which can cause issues with larger data sets, and is slower.Edit based on @cyber's comment: this is only true in Python 2.x. In Python 3.x the built-in  does what  does here.
This type of behavior can be solved using  then unpacking elements as needed. See the following simple example:Output
