Here is a code snippet.Is this well defined? That is, could  instead?Because I remember that an equivalent program in C++ '98 (if we use ) has undefined behaviour. The output of the program was different when compiled with VS compiler and G++.
As I mentioned in a comment, this test case can be reduced to:The question then becomes, is , or is ?Let's look at the relevant 2.x documentation and 3.x documentation:Python evaluates expressions from left to right. Notice that while evaluating an assignment, the right-hand side is evaluated before the left-hand side.In the following lines, expressions will be evaluated in the arithmetic order of their suffixes:Therefore... will be fully computed before we do , so  and this is well defined.
Yes, it's defined.  is called before the assignment. However, 's are not ordered in Python, which is why you sometimes see 0, 1 and 1, 0 in the output.
