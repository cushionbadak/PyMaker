I am trying to run gnuplot via python. I can send and run commands but cannot read the warnings or error messages from application. It just waits at here: "self.proc.stdout.readline()".Here is my entire code:It just waits at here:
Warnings and errors generally output on the standard error stream rather than standard output (this stops results getting mixed up with warning messages, for example). Because you are reading from  first, and no output is given, you are not getting to the part where you read from .Note, that  recommends against accessing the streams directly:Warning: Use communicate() rather than .stdin.write, .stdout.read or  .stderr.read to avoid deadlocks due to any of the other OS pipe  buffers filling up and blocking the child process.You probably want to use  as suggested. This gives you a tuple of , so just grab the second to get your warnings and errors. This sidesteps the issue of having to deal with reading the output manually, and problems like this.
