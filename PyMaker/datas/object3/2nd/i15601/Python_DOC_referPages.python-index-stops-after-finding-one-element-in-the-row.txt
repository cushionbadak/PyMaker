I have a map that my program scans and tries to find out where the occurrences of "E" are in the map, then stores them accordingly. But as it stands, if there are two occurrences of "E" in the same row it only indexes the first one? How can I get around this with my current function?
You only have one loop, over the rows.And within that loop, you call  only once. So, if there's a second  after that first one, you're never going to find it.What you need is another loop, that loops over all the s. For example:This would probably be a lot easier to read if you factored out the inner loop:Or just rewrote it to loop over all characters:Once you do that, you've almost got a comprehension. So, let's rewrite it to use a comprehension:
Because you continue next iteration as long as you meet the first occurrence of 'E'. The index() only returns the index of the first occurrence. You need to go through the entire row.
