I often write code that looks like this and am looking for a better suggestion. Basically, I usually create some general function  that handles all the cases I need with parameters, usually with optional parameters. However, often I usually run 2 (possibly more) specific functions. Everything is the same except one of the arguments is different, in this case . I run them so often that I actually prefer to just have two additional functions so I don't have to remember what the optional parameter needs to be. So for , I am running  and for , . Is there something better to do than this? This seems pretty sloppy and it has the disadvantage in the event that I need to change the  call, then I have to change all the other functions.edit (addition):iCodez thank you for suggestion. I have this particular situation and it is throwing me an error. Help? Thanks again
