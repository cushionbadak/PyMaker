My program loops through this subprocess that returns server latency.  The problem is that the program will pause mid-loop to allow the subprocess to finish. Is there a way to skip this subprocess until it is finished so I may continue looping?editThe reason I can't just wait for the subprocess to finish is because I need to be able to click and drag the window the latency is displayed on. If the subprocess isn't finshed, the window will not move. This creates a lag effect. 
 is bound to both the  command and the converted output.  While it is the  command you can use:to check if it has finished yet.  For more info, check the docs.
