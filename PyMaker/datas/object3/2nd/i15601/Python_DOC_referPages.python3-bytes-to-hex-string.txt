I have a bytes object:How do I get a string from it? Like this:I've tried:Is there no way to do this?
You simply want to decode from ASCII here, your bytestring is already representing hexadecimal numbers, in ASCII characters:Everything you tried is interpreting the bytes as numeric data instead, either as hexadecimal numbers representing bytes or as bytes representing numeric data.So your first attempt takes the value  as a hexadecimal number and turns that into the byte value , and  is turned into the byte value 123, which is the ASCII codepoint for the  character.In your second attempt you are converting each byte to a hexadecimal representation of its numeric value. The  byte being interpreted as the integer number 48 (the ASCII codepoint for the  character), which is  in hexadecimal.  is 54, or  in hex, etc.
The  representation can be confusing.  is not the same as ).  is actually  4 bytes  where 48 is the ascii code for ,etc. as such  is already an ascii string but represented as  if you want it to convert it to  you need to  (so that you construct a str from those bytes interpreting them like ascii code (as they are)).In general, you convert  to hex string like this:
