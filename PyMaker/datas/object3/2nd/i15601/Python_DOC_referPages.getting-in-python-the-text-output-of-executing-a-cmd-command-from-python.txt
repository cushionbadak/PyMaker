Natural Text
I'm trying to run Bazaar version control via Python. I have been using "os.system('')" for this purpose (although I now believe this is not the recommended command to run things via the command prompt).For one section I want to run the command "BZR commit [file] -m '[text]'". This runs Bazaar and commits the changes made to [file] with the message [text]. When this is run, a few lines of text is printed by Bazaar in the command prompt which basically says if it was successful or not.Running this command with "os.system('[message]')" (where [message] is the previously mentioned command), the command prompt succesfully carries out the command and prints the relevant lines. I desire to get these lines back in Python to check what was done, etc. This is where my problem is.I tried something like "result = os.system('[message]')" but this doesn't work (it gives 'result = 3' where 3 is definitely not the output in the command prompt).I have tried searching for a solution and came across many suggestions regarding 'subprocess' (such as here). However, these don't seem to work (or at least I'm not getting them to work), and results from using techniques such as using 'Popen' and 'communicate()' to try and get output and errs leads to getting 'None' for both. It could be that I'm just doing something wrong.Any help would be very appreciated as I feel I'm going around in circles. Also, apologies if this has been solved somewhere, I really did try and find a solution via google, and searching stackoverflow, but was unable to correctly execute them.If anyone needs any further information in order to help I'd be more than happy to help.Thank you.
As Cyber mentioned,  is a really easy way of doing it:Disclaimer: This code will only work with Python 2.7+
I do something similar for my python programs using git to grab version information. Hopefully, it will work for your version control as well. Working example:
