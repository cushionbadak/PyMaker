I have a list of that contains times. Each time is the number of seconds from Jan 1, 1904. This is not Unix or any other conversion I have familiar with. How can I convert this to the date?An example of this is 3438012868.0 which is 3438012868.0 seconds from Jan 1, 1904. I want this date to be Dec 11, 2012, 1:00.30 pm
