I have found this interesting issue with re.sub:Notice how only the first two instances were replaced. It seems that adding the [implicit] argument name for flags fixes the issue. I was wondering if anyone could explain it or it is in fact a bug.I've encountered this issue before with the missing argument name  but never for  and with string it usually blows up.
The fourth argument to  is not  but :This means that you need to explicitly do  or otherwise  will be treated as an argument to .  Additionally, the  flag is equal to :So, by doing  in your first example, you told  to only replace  occurrences of  in the string, which it did.
