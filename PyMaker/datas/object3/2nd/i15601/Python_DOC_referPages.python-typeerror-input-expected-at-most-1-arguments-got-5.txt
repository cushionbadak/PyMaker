When I am trying to input get a number into the system I get an error.That is the code in question and the error entails this:I have no idea why please help!!!
This is five arguments being passed to :Use the  method to provide a single string to input.
 expects a single string, not 5 arguments.You can use the  function to generate your string using these variables.
The error pretty clear... You're passing 5 arguments:Coming from Java, are we? :-)If you want to display variables in an string in python, you can take a look to string formatting (what other answers use) or you could also do:Also, if you're running this using Python 2.x (any version less than 3) I strongly recommend using raw_input instead of input. Input will eval the user's input as python code, and eval is evil!
Although  optionally takes multiple argument,  doesn't.You either need to use the  function - , or add the values  (the first option there is best).
