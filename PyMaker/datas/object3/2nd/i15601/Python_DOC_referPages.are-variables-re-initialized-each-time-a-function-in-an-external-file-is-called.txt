I currently import a function from a larger file I have written - e.g.:the function that I am importing uses a dictionary that is initialized elsewhere within  (i.e. at the top of my code I import a CVS file into a dictionary, which is then used by the function).If i repeatedly call this function (for example when iterating over a loop), will the dictionary be repeatedly re-initialized each time? (or once it has been initialized, it can be called by that function at a later time). I ask because the CSV file the dictionary is crated from is rather large (50MB), and thus I suspect my code will be highly inefficient if this must be read the file in every time the function is called. If it would normally be re-initialized, what would be a way of preventing this from occurring? 
No, importing a module multiple times only executes the module code just once.Importing really is just creating a reference to the imported names for your importing code to use. Loading the module is done just once, with the result stored in , in order to support the name importing.See the  statement documentation:The basic  statement (no  clause) is executed in two steps:find a module, loading and initializing it if necessarydefine a name or names in the local namespace for the scope where the  statement occurs.Emphasis mine; once loaded you don't need to load again.
