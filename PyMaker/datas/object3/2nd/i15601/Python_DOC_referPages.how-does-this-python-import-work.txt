I have two files in the same directory, and there are no  files anywhere:one file imports the other:The import succeeds even when run from a completely different location:I'm runningand my PYTHONPATH and PYTHONHOME variables are not setHow does  find ?
A quote from the module docs (emphasis mine):"When a module named spam is imported, the interpreter first searches for a built-in module with that name. If not found, it then searches for a file named spam.py in a list of directories given by the variable sys.path. sys.path is initialized from these locations:the directory containing the input script (or the current directory).PYTHONPATH (a list of directory names, with the same syntax as the shell variable PATH).the installation-dependent default."
