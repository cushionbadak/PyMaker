I have read the documentation and there is something I'm still not sure about. Does all the initialisation code for the whole module in  get run if I do:or only if I do What gets run from  and when does it get run?I'm sure I could also test this fairly easy, but for posterity and helpfulness for others, I thought I'd ask here.
The code in  is run whenever you import anything from the package. That includes importing other modules in that package.The style of import ( or ) doesn't matter here.Like all modules, the code is run just once, and entered into  under the package name.
