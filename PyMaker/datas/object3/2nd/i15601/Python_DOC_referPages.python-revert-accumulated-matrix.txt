I have a matrix like this how i get the partial sums by columns in python?
If you don't want to use numpy or itertools, here is the code
If you want a solution that doesn't involve numpy, and just uses list of lists and  (which is builtin), then the below should work
Trywhere  is the matrix you are differentiating.
From the second line, what you want is just the difference of row  and row , and the first line is just the first line of the original array. The easiest way to get this is with numpy. So this works:As Lord Henry Wotton (!) points out, the difference  is the same as .
I think this one is niceHere I prepend a list of zeros to the list of lists (obtaining ), and by a bit of packing and unpacking using  I have a list of lists with the expected results.
