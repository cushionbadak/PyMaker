Suppose that I have dictionary with 3 keys ,  and . What I need to do is to write a function that, given  as argument, swaps the values stored in  and .This is what I've came up with, but I'm looking for a more simple and concise way. Is there any, as far as you know?
You can use a slightly more clever means of determining the keys to swap by doing:but it's a pretty minor "improvement"; using  operations moves more work to the C layer, avoiding the Python layer iteration of a  comprehension, but the difference when you're talking about iterating three values is pretty trivial.It's using a  (a live, -like view of the 's keys) to get  operations to preserve the two keys not passed.
I'd do this this way, to avoid using loop:
To solve this, we first need to find the two keys that are not same as the input key. We then just swap the values for those keys.Your original answer is correct, but you are not returning d.So to correct your solution:
