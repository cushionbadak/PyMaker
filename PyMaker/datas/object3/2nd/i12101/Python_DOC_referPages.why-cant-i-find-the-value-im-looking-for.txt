Basically, I want to find how many S's and W's are in a data I'm reading in Python. Am I doing it correctly or not, because when I run the program it say there are 0 s's and w's found.. which isn't true.This is what I've done..
What about reading the whole file into a string, then counting the characters in the string using in built functions?
Your count functions work just fine:The problem is with your , which creates a list of lists (first each line is split into a list, and then those lists are appended to the  list). It should simply be a list of lines, or optionally you should use three nested  loops in your  to loop through the words:Some other improvements, completely unrelated to your issue. Your coding style is rather unpythonic. I don't know where you learned it from, but I'd recommend you try to adjust to the "general" recommendations, such as  instead of .Also, don't use  with  loop unless there's no other way. In Python, you can loop directly through a list using . With these changes in mind, this is how I think your functions should look like:And it's highly recommended to do the printing outside of the function:And instead of having multiple functions for each letter, why not use one with two arguments:Finally, I believe this is just a practice program and thus this is fine, but if you'll ever use this in a real program, you should use  and  instead:And even more finally, you should just read the whole file at once and count the characters in it:
You just create the wrong array. Your list was e.g.but for your counting functions it should beModify your input function to so the output isthen rest of the code works, but there are a lot of simpler solutions
