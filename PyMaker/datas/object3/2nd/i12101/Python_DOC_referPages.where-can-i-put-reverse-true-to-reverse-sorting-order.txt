This question already has an answer here:Python list sort in descending order                    5 answers                My teacher has told me to put  to make it sort highest to lowest but I really don't know where. My code is shown below.Can anyone please tell me where I would put  to make it print the scores highest to lowest?
You can do:
sorted() is a built-in function in Python. It has optional keyword arguments 'key' and 'reverse'. Your instructor is referring to applying the keyword argument as an input to the sorted() function. Check out more about optional arguments here.As you can see from documentation, passing in a value for reverse follows this behavior:reverse is a boolean value. If set to True, then the list elements are sorted as if each comparison were reversed.PS: as PM 2Ring mentions, I would discourage you from using 'sort' as a variable name because it is a built-in method of the list type. You can read more about naming specifications in the style guide.
