I am stuck on a seemingly simple task with a Python Twitch IRC Bot I'm developing for my channel. I have a points system all figured out, and I thought it was working, but I found out that every time I restart the program, the list that contains balances of users resets. This is because I declare the empty list at the beginning of the script each time the program is run. If a user chats and they aren't in the list of welcomed users, then the bot will welcome them and add their name to a list, and their balance to a corresponding list. Is there someway I can work around this resetting problem and make it so that it won't reset the list every time the program restarts? Thanks in advance, and here's my code:(I had attempted to use global variables to overcome this problem, however they didn't work, although I'm guessing I didn't use them right :P)
Try using the  module to dump and load your list. You can catch file open problems when loading the list, and use that to initialize an empty list.
