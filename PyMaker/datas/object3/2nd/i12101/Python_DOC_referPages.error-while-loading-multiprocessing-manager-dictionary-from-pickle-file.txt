I have got an error while loading a multiprocessing.manager.dictionary from pickle. I am sure pickle file exists in the directory where I run python.Here is the part of the code for saving it into pickles.If I print the dictionary out before the output, the result on the terminal looks fine.
 doesn't actually return a dict but a proxy object to the real dictionary managed by the manager in a different process. When you call a method on that object, the call is forwarded to the manager where the actual dictionary resides.As communication between the manager and the client process happens using the pickle protocol, these objects are pickleable and when unpickled produce a proxy to the actual object living inside the manager process again, that's why you see an attempt to create a connection when you try to unpickle the dict.So if you want to pickle the content of a manager dict, convert it to an actual dict before:
