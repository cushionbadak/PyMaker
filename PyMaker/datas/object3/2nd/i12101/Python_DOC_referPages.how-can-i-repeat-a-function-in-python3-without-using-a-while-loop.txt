I have a function in python three that needs to be run constantly and check some variables. At the moment I have a while loop and everything runned smooth, until I wanted to use a pyqt widget and that ended up in a disaster.I've found the twisted.internet module over an other thread in stackoverflow, but I can't get it to run over python3.is there an other module that allows me to repeat a certain function to run every 0.01 sec in python3 without idling my code?
If you're using pyqt that means there's a running event loop (which your while loop would block) - you can ask that to schedule a function call after a certain amount of time without needing to loop yourself.Using a QTimer sounds like what you need. This is a bit of a simpler example of using one.From that second link:That will do what you want, as long as the QTimer stays alive (if it gets garbage collected it will stop).
