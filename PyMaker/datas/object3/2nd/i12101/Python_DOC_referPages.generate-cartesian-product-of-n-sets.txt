How to generate permutations of n variables given the domain of each variable. (in python)I know about itertools, but that requires a fixed domain for the permutations so that won't work. Also is there a python library that does this? Thanks.Basically:Given 3 variables: A with Domain (2,3)B with Domain (1)C with Domain (1,2,3)How do you generate all permutations of ABC?

The  function does not require "fixed domain" as you state, nor do any functions.For example this code does what you want:and would do the same for any set of sequences of any length.
 has been duly suggested and works fine for the problem at hand. If you are - if only for academic reasons - interested in a sample implementation, here's a generator function:
