What exactly is meant by unhashable?Can any one tell what the error is exactly? Also can i add set into another set in python?
Objects that doesn't have the  attribute called . Python documentation has described the reason very well:If a class defines mutable objects and implements an  method, it should not implement , since the implementation of hashable collections requires that a key’s hash value is immutable (if the object’s hash value changes, it will be in the wrong hash bucket).
As Kasramvd explained, objects in python that are  and implement the  function are unhashable.  Since sets, lists and dicts are mutable (i.e. they can be changed; for instance you can add, remove items to all of them) , they cannot be hashed.  Since a set of sets is not possible, perhaps a set of tuple might work, though you will need to do additional bookkeeping (e.g ensure unique values) in order to achieve exactly what you described.Or even better, a set of .  Similar to sets, but immutable (you cannot add or remove elements from them).
A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of  arbitrary size to data of fixed size. The values returned by a hash  function are called hash values, hash codes, hash sums, or simply  hashes.The dictionary in python is just a hash map.And sets could only contain strings or chars or numbers, but not dics or another sets.You might wanna look at: https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets
