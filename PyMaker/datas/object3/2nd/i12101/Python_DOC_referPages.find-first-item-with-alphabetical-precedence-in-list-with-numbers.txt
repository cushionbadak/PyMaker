If I want to retrieve the first string item with the highest alphabetical precedence, how would I do so?Here is an example attempt which is clearly incorrect, but corrections as to what needs to be changed in order for it to achieve the desired result would be greatly appreciated:

Another way is to filter the main list  from intergers using  built-in method:
