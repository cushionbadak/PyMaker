I have two nested lists:( is completely unsorted but  is in alphabetical order, in case that is relevant.)Basically I want to end up with another list like this:So: merge the lists inside  which share a common first element then replace all the values in  with their corresponding values in  and finally format them in the manner of  (with the nested lists e.g.  in alphabetical order).(This question is similar to what I want to do but I was unable to modify the answers given to fit my problem.)Thanks!
You can use dictionaries for (a) mapping the letters to words, and (b) for merging the lists. Particularly, have a look at  to make it a bit easier.If you prefer the result as a list of sorted lists, just get the  from the dict.
