I'm writing my code using asyncio module with a lot of info/debug logging (logging.FileHandler). I'm concerned that extensive using of logging in asyncio will decrease the performance of my application, because logging is blocking operation.What is the best solution for that? Didn't find any information on logging overhead. Maybe using SocketHandler or MemoryHandler will help? For metrics I'm using statsd (which is also blocking operation, but must be very fast), but I'm more concerned with non-blocking logging.Code example:I'm aware of But that's not what I'm looking for.Thank you
Logging document provided a solution, log through a QueueHandler, then use a QueueListener to handle log record in another thread.https://docs.python.org/3.6/howto/logging-cookbook.html#dealing-with-handlers-that-block
You may create a custom log handler.The handler will push logging record into a queue.Another thread may read data from the queue and perform actual logging.As an option you may use  -- it's pretty fast.But, anyway, logging too much reduces performance, you can do nothing with it.
