Just loop through  and see if there is a matching key in the dictionary you created:Demo:However, take into account that you are using floating point numbers. You may not be able to match values exactly, since floating point numbers are binary approximations to decimal values; the value  (15 nines) for example, may be presented by the Python  function as , but is not equal to :If your input lists  is sorted, you could use the  function (or a backport of it), together with the  module to keep matching efficient:This tests up to two values from  per input value; one that is guaranteed to equal or lower (at ) and the next, higher value. For your sample , the value  is bisected to index , between  and . Since  is true, that would still let you map that value to  in .
