I have written this algorithm that finds all factors of a given number and puts them into a list:Inside the list cofactors will be placed next to eachother, but I would like them to appear in sorted order instead. Example of output from algorithm above: for  it outputs . I'm doing this as an exercise and I would like to know what the most efficient way of getting them in sorted order would be, any ideas?You can see one of my solutions below. It works, but I don't think it's optimal.
Just simply return the sorted list:how ever if you dont like using  function simply change for loop range to (1,n+1) :another way is using (most efficient way):Insert in this module is  however search is 
The one thing you are missing is simpler and easier operations on your lists. There is a Python built-in for reversing a sequence: .So you can do:
