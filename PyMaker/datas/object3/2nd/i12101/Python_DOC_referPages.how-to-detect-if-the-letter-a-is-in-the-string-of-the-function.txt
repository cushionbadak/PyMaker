So here is the following Question:Write a function that is given a list of strings and returns True if there is at least one string in the list that starts with "a", and False if there is no such string in the list. For example, if the list is ["bee","cat","ant"] the function returns True, while if the list is ["bee","cat","bat"] the function returns False. Use the header def isA(myList):What I wrote for the code is:I am not sure if I am right. Could someone tell me whether the codes are right for the question?Can someone please give me the whole correction of the coding if my coding is wrong. Thank you.
A much more simplified approach is making use of Python's  which will pretty much return True if any condition is met, when iterating over a list: To give you some input on your own code, however. Here are the problems I saw: In order: You do not need to declare String=[]. That line does not serve any purpose in your code. Next, you said you want to check for 'a' starting at the beginning of your word. You want to use the startswith string method.The logic here is that, based on your requirements, if you find a single case where it starts with 'a', then you quit early with a . Your  alone is a syntax bug. So, that should go away. Finally, if you managed to go through your entire loop without finding a single word that starts with 'a', then you simply return False. So, with all that said and done, your code looks like this: 
Try the following using the  function and a simple list comprehension:
