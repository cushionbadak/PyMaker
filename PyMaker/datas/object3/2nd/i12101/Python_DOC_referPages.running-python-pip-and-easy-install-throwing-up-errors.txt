I'm tying to install a new package I have been recommended using either  or  and both are throwing up the below error and I can figure out why.I have cleared the  folder as thought this was the issue at first.I have just stuck the  error up but can add  if needed 
The code of PyMySQL uses Unicode literals.The  parts of the directory names in the traceback of your error message tells me you're using Python 3.2. While Python 2 had Unicode literals, Python 3.0 to 3.2 didn't: The syntax was removed with Python 3.0:You can no longer use  literals for Unicode text.It was re-introduced with Python 3.3 by PEP 414 for backwards compatibility reasons.As Boaz stated and Padraic pointed out, PyMySQL requires Python 2.x ≥ 2.6 or 3.x ≥ 3.3, thus why the authors of PyMySQL felt free to use the Unicode literal syntax in their code.
Install Python 3.3 or higher. Check PyMySQL minimum requirements:https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyMySQL#id1
