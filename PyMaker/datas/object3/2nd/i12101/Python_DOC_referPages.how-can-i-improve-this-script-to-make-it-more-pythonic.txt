I'm fairly new to Python programming, and have thus far been reverse engineering code that previous developers have made, or have cobbled together some functions on my own. The script itself works; to cut a long story short, its designed to parse a CSV and to (a) create and or update the contacts found in the CSV, and (b) to correctly assign the contact to their associated company. All using the HubSpot API. To achieve this i've also imported requests and csvmapper.I had the following questions:How can I improve this script to make it more pythonic?What is the best way to make this script run on a remote server,keeping in mind that Requests and CSVMapper probably aren'tinstalled on that server, and that I most likely won't havepermission to install them - what is the best way to "package" thisscript, or to upload Requests and CSVMapper to the server?Any advice much appreciated.
I'll just go from top to bottom. The first rule is, do what's in PEP 8. It's not the ultimate style guide, but it's certainly a reference baseline for Python coders, and that's more important, especially when you're getting started. The second rule is, make it maintainable. A couple of years from now, when some other new kid comes through, it should be easy for her to figure out what you were doing. Sometimes that means doing things the long way, to reduce errors. Sometimes it means doing things the short way, to reduce errors. :-)Two things: you got the encoding right, per PEP 8. And Conventions for writing good documentation strings (a.k.a. "docstrings") are immortalized in PEP 257.You've got a program that does something. But you don't document what.Per PEP 8: put your  statements one per line.Per Austin: make your paragraphs have separate subjects. You've got some imports right next to some version info stuff. Insert a blank line. Also, DO SOMETHING with the data! Or you didn't need it to be right here, did you?You've obscured these in more ways than one. WTF is a hapikey? I think you mean . And what does  do?One piece of advice: the more "global" a thing is, the more "formal" it should be. If you have a for loop, it's okay to call one of the variables . If you have a piece of data that is used throughout a function, call it  or . But if you have a piece of data that is used globally, or is a class variable, make it put on a tie and a jacket so everyone can recognize it: make it  instead of . Maybe even  if there are more than one API. Do the same with .It didn't take long for the comments to become lies. Just delete them if they aren't true.This is the kind of thing that you should create a function for. Just create a simple function called "get_csv_files" or whatever, and have it return a list of filenames. That decouples you from glob, and it means you can make your test code data driven (pass a list of filenames into a function, or pass a single file into a function, instead of asking it to search for them). Also, those glob patterns are exactly the kind of thing that go in a config file, or a global variable, or get passed as command line arguments.I'll bet typing CSV in upper case all the time is a pain. And what does  mean? Read that line, and figure out what that variable should be called. Maybe ? Or ? Something that demonstrates that there is a collection of things. Now what does  do? You had this nice small variable name, in a BiiiiiiG loop. That was a mistake, since if you can't see a variable's entire scope all on one page, it probably needs a somewhat longer name. But then you created an alias for it. Both  and  refer to the same thing. And ... I don't see you using  again. So maybe your loop variable should be . Or maybe it should be  to make it easier to type. Or just . This seems a little needless. If you're using  to get filenames, they pretty much are going to exist. (If they don't, it's because they were deleted between the time you called  and the time you tried to open them. That's possible, but rare. Just  or raise an exception, depending.)In this code, you use the value of . But that's the only place you use it. In this case, you can probably move the call to  into the if statement and get rid of the variable.Notice that in this case, when there is an actual problem, you didn't print the file name? How helpful was that?Also, remember the part where you're on a remote server? You should consider using Python's  module to record these messages in a useful manner.You're creating an object with a bunch of data. This would be a good place for a function. Define a  function to do all this for you, and move it out of line. Also, note that the standard  module has most of the functionality you are using. I don't think you actually need .Here's another chance for a function. Maybe instead of making a csv mapper, you could just return the ? At this point, things get fishy. You have these function definitions indented, but I don't think you need them. Is that a stackoverflow problem, or does your code really look like this?No, apparently it really looks like this. Because you're using  inside this function when you don't really need to. Please consider using formal function parameters instead of just grabbing outer-scope objects. Also, why are you using  on the csv file? If you obtained it using , doesn't it already have the path you want?Here you forced  to be a list of rows obtained from , and then started iterating over them. Just iterate over  directly, like:  BUT WAIT! You're actually iterating over a CSV file that you have already opened, in your  variable. Just pick one, and iterate over it. You don't need to open the file twice for this.Okay, that was a LOOOONG span of code that didn't do much. At the least, tighten those inner  up to one line each. But better still, write a function to create your dictionary in the format you want. You can use  to pull the data by name from . Here you're encoding details of the API into your code. Consider pulling them out into functions. (That way, you can come back later and build a module of them, to re-use in your next program.) Also, beware of comments that don't actually tell you anything. And feel free to pull that together as a single paragraph, since it's all in service of the same key thing - making an API call.I'm not sure if this last bit should be an exception or not. Is an "Attempt Failed" normal behavior, or does it mean that something is broken?At any rate, please look into the API you are using. I'd bet there is some more information available for minor failures. (Major failures would be the internet is broken or their server is offline.) They might provide an "errors" or "error" field in their return JSON, for example. Those should be logged or printed with your failure message.Mostly this function has the same issues as the previous one.Except here. Never put your name in someplace like this. Or you'll still be getting calls on this code 10 years from now. Put your department name ("IT Operations") or a support number. The people who need to know will already know. And the people who don't need to know can just notify the people that already know. This was awkward. You might consider taking some command line arguments and using them to determine your behavior.And don't do this. Never put an  at module scope, because it means you can't possibly import this code. Maybe someone wants to import it to parse the docstrings. Or maybe they want to borrow some of those API functions you wrote. Too bad!  means always having to say "Oh, sorry, I'll have to do that for you." Put it at the bottom of your actual  code. Or, since you aren't actually passing a value, just remove it entirely.
