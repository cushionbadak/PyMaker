i am making a python script that talks back to just for fun and i want it to pick a random subject to talk about each time here is a snippet of my code but it keeps giveing me this error TypeError: Can't convert 'int' object to str implicitly
Put the functions in a list, then use the  function to pick one at random for you. Functions are just objects, just like any other value in Python:You got your specific error because you tried to concatenate an integer with a string ( is a string,  an integer); you'd normally convert the integer to a string first, or use a string template that supports converting other objects to strings for you (like  or ). But the string doesn't turn into a function, even if the string value was the same as a function name you happen to have defined.
