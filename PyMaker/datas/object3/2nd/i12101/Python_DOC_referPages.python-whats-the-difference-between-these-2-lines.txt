Can someone tell me the difference between  and  in the 2 instances below?1:2:When viewing the csv file, both result in the same output...
The two options do not produce the same file output on Linux or Mac. Only on Windows will you see the same output.The first instructs the  module to write  as the line terminator between lines. The file object it is writing to, being in text mode, will then translate that terminator to the platform default. The default is  on Linux or Mac, but it is  on Windows.The second piece instructs the file object to not change the line endings being written to it (it would otherwise translate line separators). The  module is left to the default, so it'll write two  characters between lines. The result is that all lines are terminated with  regardless of the platform.See the  documentation:The string used to terminate lines produced by the . It defaults to .and the  documentation:When writing output to the stream, if newline is None, any  characters written are translated to the system default line separator, . If newline is  or , no translation takes place. If newline is any of the other legal values, any  characters written are translated to the given string.
