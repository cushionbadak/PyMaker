Whenever I run this it just continues to get the  value, not the computed future value of the account?!
This is because you use  in your  rather than . This will cause the result of  be rounding-down and hence always result in  as long as  (which will be the case). That is why your future value is always the same as your present, since you put money with no interest.Simply change:into:Also, since you never really need to eval  (it is just  where you have already   from the user input), try to simply put  like this:You should get your future value
