I have written a FOR loop to call a function 100 times to get 100 random numbers, I now need to calculate the average number of all the random numbers generated. How can I do this? This is where I got up to so far
First of all, your function is only being run 10 times. You need to store the values you're generating, rather than printing them to the screen. You can do this by storing it in a list. To get a list of 100 random variables, you could do .Then, you need to find the average of this. To get a total sum, you can do . To get the number of values, do . If we combine this all together, we get:Output is:
Or if you prefer to use 
I think you have to store the numbers somewhere, not print them. If you use a list, you can calculate the sum and then divide by the length.
This is very basic stuff, hope this helps:
