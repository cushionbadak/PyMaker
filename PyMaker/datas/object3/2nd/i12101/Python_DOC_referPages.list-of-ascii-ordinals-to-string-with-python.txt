I've got a list of ascii ordinals like:now I want to transform this to a string removing the null characters at the end.I've tried withbut when I pass it to a function like:I've got this error:maybe because there are the null characters at the end.
Filter out the null bytes first (Python 2 version):Alternative way to do it:Some timings:edit:The  approach that works on both Python 2/3 versions looks like this:
Use a comprehension instead and only do your  on non 0:
In Python 3, to convert a list of ascii ordinals to a bytestring, you could use  constructor directly:To remove trailing zero bytes, you could call :If the input should stop at the first zero byte (like C strings -- NUL terminated):To remove all zero bytes (wherever they are), call :To get a Unicode string, call :To make it work on both Python 2 and 3, use  instead :The performance of these methods is comparable or better than  solution from @timgeb's answer.
