This question already has an answer here:Python string.strip stripping too many characters [duplicate]                    3 answers                I am getting some very odd result on a quite simple string manipulation using string.strip(). I am wondering whether it's a problem that affects only me (something is wrong with my python installations?) or it's a common bug?The bug is very wired and here it goes:It occurs only if an 'o' is following './' !What's going on here?!I have tested this on both python 2.7 and 3.5 and the result doesn't change.
This is how the  method is actually designed to work.The chars argument is a string specifying the set of characters to be removed.The chars argument is not a prefix or suffix; rather, all combinations of its values are stripped:So when you say , it's going to remove all leading and trailing characters in that set (ie. ).  You probably want to use  or .
string.strip() will left-strip and right-strip per character. Meaning, when you ask it to strip , it will remove any s or s or s it finds on the 2 ends of the string. This is why it's stripping off the .
It is not a bug.  strips any charater that is in a string passed as an argument to it. So first you strip all leading and trailing dots and slashes from string , and then all characters that string  consists of.
