Can some tell me why my urlopen method is all of a sudden not working
You should import urllib.request not just urllib;which version do you use, this code only work in python3.X, see this https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html#module-urllib.request for detail;If it did have exception, it may encounter network problem, make sure you can reach "google.com"(try it with browser or whatever)
