Natural Text
I am creating a script that parses a csv file and, in an effort to remain as agnostic to formatting as possible, I am using regular expressions to replace specific substrings. I am looking to replace a line in a cell with the author's name, which can be any number of characters and will contain an email address. It is guaranteed that there will be a space before the substring and that it will be followed by either newline characters (multiple lines in a cell) or a comma (last item in a cell). I am using......to try to replace everything between the space and a potential comma, but it is including the trailing commas in the line in the expression and replacing them with the author. I have previously tried......because this sounds like a job for a negative lookahead but I still haven't been able to retain the trailing commas.I am new to regular expressions so there is probably something simple that I am missing, but I haven't been able to get this to work.
Try this instead:
