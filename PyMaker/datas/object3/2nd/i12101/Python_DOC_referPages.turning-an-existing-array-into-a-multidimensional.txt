I'm storing 'such' and 'suchy' as variables, but instead of storing strings, I'd like to store more arrays.I am slightly above stupid, but this seems complex for me. How is it done with python?Edit:Apologies  for the  shortness.In PHP, you can do something likeLater on  it's fairly easy to add something to the array.I'm trying to work out how to do something similar with python. Thanks for the comments  so far. Already learned something. Thanks!
In Python, this: is this: If you want to add something at the first level, it's simply:which will now make it:If you want to update a list, let's say the list stored in 'anotherarray', you do this: Output of I suggest reading a tutorial on dictionaries in Python: Documentation from official docs
If I understood you correctly you need something like thisthan later in your game you can use it like thisor if you want to add in your dictionary new item with value equal to arrayyou can just write this
