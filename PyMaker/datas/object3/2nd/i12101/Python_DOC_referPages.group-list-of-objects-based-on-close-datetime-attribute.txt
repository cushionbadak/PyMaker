Say I have a list of objects. Each of these has a string representing a date (parseable by dateutil). How can I go about grouping these in a list of lists, in which each sublist contains consecutive (within 5 minutes) objects? For example:at which point list2 would beIt seems like there should be a python solution using lambdas or itertools along with dateutil, but my google schools are failing me.Thanks!
Here's a generator that yields groups of consecutive objects:
Take a look at groupby function from itertools. It takes a list of objects and groups them according to a key function. Your code could look like thishave a look at this question to find out how to round datetimes: How to round the minute of a datetime object python
My previous answer was not exactly solving the problem. You want to cluster all consequent items that have less than 5 minutes between each other. There are cluster algorithms you might have a look at, but with some simple lines of code this problem can also get solved. Btw there are many different ways to do this, this is just one:the rest should be easy
