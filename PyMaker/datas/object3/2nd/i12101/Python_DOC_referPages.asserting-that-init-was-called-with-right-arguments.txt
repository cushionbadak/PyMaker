I'm using python mocks to assert that a particular object was created with the right arguments. This is how my code looks:Now, I want to assert that  was created with the right arguments. This is the code I have so far:This is the error I get:Here is the fixed code (Call it ). Thanks, all!
So, the error message you are getting is actually because you are not checking your mock properly. What you have to understand here is that in your decorator you are ultimately saying that, the call to  will relturn a  object instead.Therefore, for any call to  with respect to where you are patching, the return value of that will call  instead. So, the assertion you actually want to check is simply at the , and not the :Here is the modification made to your code:A little extra information to provide some more explanation, if you were testing now if install was called within your context manager, you have to realize here that you actually have to check inside your , so a structure would be like this: For clarity sake create a mock_obj in your test method and: Now, within your context manager, you will need to look inside the call to . In case you don't know why this is, read up on context managers.So, with that in mind, you simply perform your check as: 
The problem is that  doesn't call  directly; rather, because  is an instance of , and  is defined, you get  being equivalent to which results in a call to , whose return value  is passed to  along with the original arguments.All of which is to say that since the mock object you bind to  isn't an instance of , none of the preceding applies.  is simply a call to a mock object, so you check that that directly:
