I encrypted a String with Java (on Android) and I get 'A14E71A6F4E8D8E465C3C302C2A96BD2' as a byte array.I now want to encrypt it with python, but it doesn't work:I already searched the internet, but didn't find a solution.Thanks in advance
In Python 2 you can decode the hex string using :If everything else is in place (iv, key, encryption mode) this might work.If you want this to work in both Python 2 and Python 3 then you can use  to decode the hex encoded string:
It may not be enough, you have not said how this was encrypted, but at the least you need to hex decode this before you decrypt.
