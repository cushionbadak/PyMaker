I am a beginner with Python and I am trying to use Tweepy to save some tweets and in doing so I am struggling to write them to a file. I get the error that saveFile is not defined. class listener(StreamListener):auth = OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)auth.set_access_token(access_token, access_token_secret)twitterStream = Stream(auth, listener())twitterStream.filter(track=['prime'])My token's seem to be working fine and the tweets do stream in idle. The file appears though there is nothing in there The error code is failed ondata, global name 'saveFile' is not definedIt does as mentioned print the data
The error must be because of a typo - note that variable name used here is not saveFile.Also consider that you are opening the file in "w" mode for every tweet - as the code is now you would overwrite the file every time a tweet is received.A better way to do this is to open the file when initializing the listener (), and then write to it from on_data:Do remember to close the file after the work's done.BTW there is a  module that can help read and write CSV files: https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html
TYPO in script, change  to . My suggestion to use is start using IDE or editors which highlight that typos for you, for instance PyCharm
