*I am having an issue processing CSV'S. I get this error: return codecs.charmap_decode(input,self.errors,decoding_table)[0]  UnicodeDecodeError: 'charmap' codec can't decode byte 0x90 in position 22: character maps to <undefined>What do I need to do to fix this? I think there is an issue where the CSV matches with the user's input.*
Your input file is probably in an encoding other than the default on your system. You can fix this by explicitly providing the correct file encoding to the  call (you should also pass  to the  call to properly obey the  module's requirements).For example, if the file is UTF-8, you'd do:If it's some other encoding (UTF-16 is common for files produced by Windows programs), you'd use that. If it's some terrible non-UTF encoding, you're going to have to figure out the locale settings on the machine that produced it, they could be any number of different encodings.
