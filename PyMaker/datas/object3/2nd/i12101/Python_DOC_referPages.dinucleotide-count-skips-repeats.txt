I'm working on finding the dinucleotide count in a .txt file. The sample data set that I'm using is 'SSSS'. The code below is what I am running as of now. I get a returned 'SS' count of 2 when in reality is should be 3. Could someone help me figure out a solution for the skipping that occurs while counting the characters. 
Your problem here might be because of overlapping substrings not being counted. I'm assuming that a substring SSS should be counted as two instances of the dinucleotide SS? The count() method you used will only return 1. If this is indeed the problem, you will probably have to design your own count method.
As Chuck Logan Lim mentioned,  the problem is indeed that overlapping substrings are not counted.One possible solution is to use a regular expression. Here,  is a lookahead assertion.Prints:
