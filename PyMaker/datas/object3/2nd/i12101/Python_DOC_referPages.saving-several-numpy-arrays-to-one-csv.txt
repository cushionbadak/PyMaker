Natural Text
I have several different 'columns' I need to save to a CSV. Currently I do this:Perhaps not important but for completeness:The dimensions are around 30 million by 7 columns (two of which are strings: id_labels) - so this takes a while (around 8 minutes) and uses a lot of RAM as I think python creates a new temporary object when I call np.column_stack so at a one point in time it holds double the data it needs.I was hoping was there was a better way to create the CSV I need?
you can open a file with append option and then use 
first, save file one by one to avoid memory problems. let's consider 3 solutions:Some tests:        so savetext is slighty faster.If csv is not requisite, pickle offer a binary protocol, wich is 40x faster. 
Not necessarily fast, but:This won't use up much more memory than just the memory needed for your separate arrays.
