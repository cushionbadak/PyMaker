Many thanks!!
This should do what you want: is a convenience utility that provides default values whenever you try to access a key that is not in the dictionary. If you don't like it (for example because you want  to fail with ), use this:
The expected output in the example is impossible, since  would not be associated with a key. You could get  though, with a  of s:Alternatively, using  to avoid the need for  (or alternate approaches that involve a / or  that sacrifice the atomicity of  in exchange for not creating empty s unnecessarily):The conversion back to plain  ensures future lookups don't auto-vivify keys, raising  as normal, and it looks like a normal  if you  it.If the  is important (because names or column indices might change), you can use  to speed up and simplify extracting all the desired columns at once:
