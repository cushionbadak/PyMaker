There is a great website copier that I would like to bundle in my executable, created with python 3 and py2exe.On the HTTrack official website in the FAQ section they say that there is a DLL/library version available.But I don't know where to start, or even how to use the DLL once it would be bundled in the executable.So how can I bundle httrack into a python 3 executable, and use its features to start copying websites?Edit:I found httrack-py 0.6.1 but it only supports python 2 and uses an old version of httrack, so I can't use this for my executable.
As I see it you have 2 options:You could try to convert  to python 3 followingthese instructions, but it's usually never a good idea to workwith outdated and unmaintained 3rd party library.Since the official HTTrack provides you with DLL, you can use thelibrary directly from python 3 code. A stackoverflow questionHow can I use a DLL file from Python? gives an excellentanswer on how to do just that.The py2exe merely creates a windows installer which will takecare of the details of installing python interpreter and your pythoncode to the target system so that end user does not need to deal withanything else than just one .exe . This means you have to include3rd party DLL's in the configuration - I would guess 3rd partyDLL's to go into "data_files" (not tested this myself though).
