Natural Text
I am facing a rather elusive bug which seems to be caused by reading from a file. I have simplified my program to demonstrate the issue:consider this program that works fine:I am using a very straightforward regex pattern but I am getting the gist of the regex from my array the script works as expected (matches patterns containing "pizza" and "fish" but does not match "steak")now In my actual program I am trying to read these keywords from a file (I don't want to hardcode in the source) so far I have this:where keyWords.txt will contain the following:but this breaks the code because somehow only the LAST keyword in the file will successfully match (if a match exists). What gives?
Use  to remove any newline characters from . If you know for certain that there won't be any leading whitespace,  is sufficient.
