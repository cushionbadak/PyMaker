Excel Image 1Excel Image 2Please look at the "Excel Image 1" to start.I am using python to pull those first two columns, and storing them in their own separate array.

I'd use the row_values method, instead. This is called with the row number and the column number (zero-based). For example to get the first row in a list do this:Slice the list to get values from specific columns. Such as:I started by keeping track of the values in the first column () and running a cumulative sum for a given keyâ€”. When the key changes, I just update append the  to  and update  and . The last thing to do is to append the last value in the cumulative sum.This yields the following in :BTW, your second file has 70.0 instead of -70.0 in row 3.After some thought I realized a better way was to use a dictionary (similar in concept to @Austin Hastings answer, but without the ).This yields:
