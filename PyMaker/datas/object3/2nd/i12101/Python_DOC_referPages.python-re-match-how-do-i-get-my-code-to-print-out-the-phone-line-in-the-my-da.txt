Natural Text
In my file i have a python code and a text file, however in the text file i have a the words phone and iphone, but when the user input is i have a phone it matches the input with iphone instead of phone. How Do i Solve This Problem? code below:Snippet of txt file
The problem may be in values that you provide as arguments to re.match:Given the keywords in user input "i have a phone",  will return True because some of the keywords (in this case "i", "phone") are present in the variable  (in this case a line containing "iphone").Update: @Jasper is right - "i" would also match "iphone". Edited the answer accordingly (initially I noticed only that "phone" would be a match).P.S. It would help if you provided a snippet of the text file that the code works with. that would make it more clear what is happening.
