I have a vector class which gives a vector with a list and I need to be able to add vectors or vectors to lists, tuples, and strings.  If they are not of the same length, I need to throw a type error. Some examples of output:I need to make a + function and a += function.Which python methods do I use to override the + and += operations, also I need to make sure that my + operation works on an object and a sequence and the reverse
