I've been storing variable information inside the builtins module and I want to clear all the variable information that is stored inside of it. I can't figure out how to do it though.This doesn't seem to work.
 does not clear a module's  before reloading it, so reloading a module doesn't affect any names you add to it that weren't originally part of the module.It is essentially always better to avoid messing with the  module than to try to restore it after messing with it. That said, if you really want to do this, save a copy of  before messing with it so you can restore from the backup later:That's not going to be threadsafe if another thread comes in between the  and the , but trying to reload  is hardly in safe territory anyway.
