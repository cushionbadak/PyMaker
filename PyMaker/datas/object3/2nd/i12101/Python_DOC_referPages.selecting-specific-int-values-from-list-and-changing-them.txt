I have been playing with Python and came across a task from MIT, which is to create coded message (Julius Cesar code where for example you change ABCD letters in message to CDEF). This is what I came up with:The code works but I have to implement not shifting the ascii value of spaces and special signs in message. So my idea is to select values in list in range of range(65,90) and range(97,122) and change them while I do not change any others. But how do I do that? 
If you want to use that gigantic code :) to do something as simple as that, then you keep a check like so: But you know what, python can do the whole of that in a single line, using list comprehension. Watch this:A little explanation: the list comprehension boils down to this for loop, which is easier to comprehend. Caught something? :)
Much easier it is to use the maketrans method from the string module:EDIT: This was for Python 2.7With 3.5 just doAnd an easy function to return a mapping.This function uses modulo addition to construct the encrypted caesar string.
