You should study the basic syntax of python first. Take a look at the  and  in python.There can be zero or more  parts, and the  part is optional.  The keyword  is short for , and is useful to avoid  excessive indentation.So after the first  to check for more conditions, you need something like this:There are more issues with your code.1. The  is wrong as more than one argument is passed. You can use string's  method like this:2. The condition in  has wrong logic. If you want check if the entered value is not in the range of 0-25000 inclusive, you should put a  before the condition like so:and possibly 3, 4, 5 and so on.
 can't have a condition. Change to  ("else if").
