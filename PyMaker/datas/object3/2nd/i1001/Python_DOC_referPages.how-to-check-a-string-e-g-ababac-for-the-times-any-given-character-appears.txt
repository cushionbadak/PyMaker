what i'm finding hard is that you can't nest "i for i in [list]" inside Boolean logic checks, and not wanting to list all 26 characters
You can use  to give you the amount of times  appears in , for example. In this example, it gives .Building on from this, you could implement some simple code to check how many times every letter of the alphabet occurs like so:Which produces the output:NB: you don't have to list all 26 characters in the alphabet because  has that for you. Note there is also  and so on.

Using this, you could rewrite the above code like so:Output:Edit NB:can also be written as:using the newer  interface. More information: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format.
using  you can do this way .output:
You can get the each available characters count in a given string using below codeYou can find the live demo here
