I am expecting the list to be sorted and then duplicates will be spaced by increments of 0.1. Why is my code below not working? Here is what I am expecting to get versus what my program is returning:Expected Output: Actual output:Python Code:
here is the solution according to your code.your code is right what you were lacking was the case when value is already present. ie in example when 20 is there you increase it to 20.1 (happening) but you miss that but when 20.1 is there . you just checkingonly for 20 not for 20.1 . that is why 20.1 is coming in your solution not 20.2.
You could use itertools.groupby to group equal consecutive elements:Output
I can propose simple fix to the original code:
The problem is you are only incrementing it once. You are not keeping a count of how many times a number has appeared before. What you need is some kind of frequency dictionary that will store how many times this number has appeared. Using that frequency  you add  increments to the number.
Try this improved code:
Using :Output:If you need the original values to still be integers, comment below and I'll change that.
Another (more advanced) option is to write a cusom generator:IMO, this is not the easiest solution. I'm sharing it anyways because it might help others understand generators, especially .
