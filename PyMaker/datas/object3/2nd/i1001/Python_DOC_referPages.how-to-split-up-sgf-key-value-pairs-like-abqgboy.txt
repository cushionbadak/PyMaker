In Python, I'm trying to split a string with SGF key/value pairs into a list or match object like so:(Keys are 'A' and 'G', values are '[B][q]' and '[boy]', respectively.)I've tried splitting them up with this regex patternBut this fails when there's only one key/value such as 'A[B]'Any suggestions? Thanks in advance.
