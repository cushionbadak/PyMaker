Recently I came across this  code from a python book:when passing  it produces  as output. But I am confused as to which variable captures the keys and which one captures the values. I understand that  will produce  containing  and , but there is only one variable, () provided to capture it, then how does it work? Can someone please take its parts apart and explain what magic is going on here? It is all the more complex as there is some string formatting also going on here simultaneously. 
 is a tuple consisting of the key and the value:Since  is a tuple, it can be used directly as the right-hand argument for , and its elements are consumed in order by the format string.(This is the reason why it is recommended that you always use an expicit tuple with  if you aren't positive that an argument isn't already a tuple. For example, if , then  would produce an error, but  would produce  as presumably expected.)
Output:But you should probably switch to  syntax on 2.7+ :https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#format-string-syntaxand to  in python 3.6+:https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#formatted-string-literalsYou might also want to visit https://pyformat.info/ for mor input on how to format properly.
 returns tuples of , and then the tuple is passed as parameter to the  operator, so it gets used to replace the placeholders in the string.
