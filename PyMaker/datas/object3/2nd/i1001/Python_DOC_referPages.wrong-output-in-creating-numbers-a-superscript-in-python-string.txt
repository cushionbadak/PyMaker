I have this code where I am trying to put numbers as superscript in a string. This code works but it puts all the numbers in the string a superscript whereas I only want it to put the number only at the end of the string as superscript(if any present). So basically if my string is  then I want to put 2 as superscript and my code does that correctly but if my string is  then it also makes 10 as superscript along with 2 whereas I only want it to make 2 as superscipt and leave 10 as it is.Also there can be n digit number at the end of the string and whole number should turn as superscript.My code is:How do I make it to only do numbers at the end of the string as superscript and leave other numbers as it is?
I'm sure there are a lot of different ways to do this, however, I try to break it down into smaller problems, that I know can be solved. This would be my way of solving the question at hand:Find words containing both characters and digitsConvert found words to superscriptReplace found words with conversionsFollowing the plan above, we can create a function to do just that in three easy steps.Testing that withReturns
