This question already has an answer here:Generate random integers between 0 and 9                    21 answers                Python Fibonacci Generator                    15 answers                I want to print a fibonacci sequence up to a random number. First I defined a variable () and assigned an integer number to it. It is actually the range to which the program will print a fibonacci sequence.  I want to do it by generating a random number, so I included the random library with . Here a random number is generated but I want to assign that number to  (a variable). How can I assign a random number to . For example: the random number generated is 5 so it should be equal to nterms.  If  the expected output should be 
In your code you are not assigning any value to .You should assign it like the following:
This is simply how you can assign a random number in variable and pass it later. Any more questions, let me know. edit:Like patrick said, the format of this is So you can add the range of the numbers you want to test with, in that case you do not have to check if it is less than zero in your code, because it will never be less than zero, if you enter two positive numbers as the lowest and biggest values. :)
