In Python's  module, it seems that anything that is not a generic type does not support subscripting:This will be the case whether  is defined with  or .  (In Python 3.7, at least.)It looks like there is a way to subclass , presumably like:But this will immediately raise .Is there a way to accommodate the above?  I.e., what is the recommended practice for subscripting user-defined (non-generic) typedefs?
You can't use a , alias or otherwise, as a generic type, no. Your union contents are also not generic, you can't state what types a  or  object can contain by using  or  directly, you'd use  or . You have a new union:Note that a dictionary has keys and values, you need to provide information on both. If this used as the input for an API, then consider using the more generic and immutable  and  types; this makes it clear that your API only needs to read information.Personally, I'd look hard at refactoring a codebase that is this muddy about what kinds of objects it can accept. Requiring that an API accepts only sets and existing code has to pass in  instead of  is not an arduous requirement, or perhaps the API really would work with any iterable of .
