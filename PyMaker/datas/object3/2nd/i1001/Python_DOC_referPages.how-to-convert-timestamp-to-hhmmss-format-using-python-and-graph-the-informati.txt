I am trying to use timestamp information to graph. However, when I convert the number into hh:mm:ss. It does not work.I have tried this:Also I tried this     timestamp = [dt.strftime(dt.strptime(str(datetime.timedelta(seconds=round(t / 1000))), '%H:%M:%S'), '%H:%M:%S') for t in timestamp]However, it is possible to see the list with the new values. However, I have problems with the graphs and these new values.Can anybody help me?
Try using this and make sure to import the time module!
In your code you're using datetime.strptime(date_string, format) function, it's main use is to parse time strings in order to create datetime object.In order to get a parsed string of a desired format you should use date.strftime(format) function instead.So basically in your code you can only add it and should get the wanted result:I'm not sure what was your input and desired output, but you could also use date.fromtimestamp(timestamp) for the parsing of timestamps
