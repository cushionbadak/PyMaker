I'm trying to convert this nested loop into a list comprehension but i'm not sure it's possible as there is different values possible for item in "tmp" list. Is it the best way to do this ? Thanks !
This can be done in one expression although I'm not sure readability is improved:Note that I've assumed you want to go through the whole of  and  rather than exactly 100 elements every time: the question implies 100-every-time but if the intention is really to go through the whole sequence, then it's better not to hard-code the 100 in there.  If I'm wrong about the intention, you can change that inner-comprehension  loop to  and use  and  in the conditional expression instead of  and .
nested comprehensions are not very readable a simple is awesome, but a nested one is often confusingyou can simply move the loops into a generator function - it will still be readable and allow for lazy iterationEDIT: just an opinionated addendum - this way the complicated nested loop can be named ( I named it  for obvious reasons ) but when a programmer seeshe immediately knows what that means while something likemakes the programmer read a lot of lines and it is not obvious what is going on
Your algorithm has large time complexity. First see if this is actually what you require. Once you are sure you need a nested  loop with 4 nesting levels, you can define a function to use within your list comprehension.In this case, notice built-in  can accept multiple iterable arguments.  allows you to define functions with pre-set arguments.
