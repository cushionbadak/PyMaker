I have 2 lists of the same size, one is a list of vectors and the second is their respective tags:I want to make 2 lists, all the (vi,tag)'s which their tag are true, and it's compliment.I'm trying to use the zip function for this like so:Both lists turn up empty. I don't see the problem here, the 'x' should represent the tuple (vi,tag)
No need to use is, you can check for boolean values directly. The  operator is for checking object identity, quoting the linked documentation:The operators is and is not test for object identity: x is y is true  if and only if x and y are the same object. Object identity is  determined using the id() function. x is not y yields the inverse  truth valueCodeOutput
Your solution should work fine, but for clarity you can unpack items within a list comprehension. Note you should test for Boolean  via :Since these lists are linked, much better is to use a dictionary to store "True" and "False" values. A  is convenient:Then use  or  in place of ; likewise,  or  in place of .The one-pass dictionary-based solution also has the advantage of working for arbitrary iterables  and . If either of these are iterators, the list comprehension solution will not work for , as an iterable may only be traversed once.
