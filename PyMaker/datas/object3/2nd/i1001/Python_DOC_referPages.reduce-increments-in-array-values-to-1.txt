I am trying to create a list (say ) which increments only when there is a difference in values of another list (say ), for example: to  or to  etc.The following code does it:Can anybody give suggestions to do it using list comprehensions (preferable using  functions)?
Here's a way using :Or for the other example: Details Get the first difference of the array with And use  to limit the values between  and :Finally take the  and add a  at the beginning as the difference will give you an array of length :
Use itertools.groupby:Output
I see numpy solutions, so here we go. and Using list comprehension with :
You can't do this with a traditional list comprehensions because they can't share a mutable state between iterations.In this case, using , , or a plain python loop (as in your code) is recommended. BUT if you really wanted to use a list comprehension, one way would be to rely side effects.For example:You are using the list comprehension to create a list called , but the actual contents of  are not useful at all. We use the iterations to call  on . Since  returns , the following is the actual result of the list comprehension.However, relying on the side effects like this is not considered good practice.
Method using  and list comprehension and slicingExplanation: this solution, rely on that in Python:any number other than  (or ) is evaluated as  when feed to  functionwhen such need arises  and  values are turned into  and  respectivelyhow  function works: in reality something like  means calculate  thus  means calculate , which is translated into
