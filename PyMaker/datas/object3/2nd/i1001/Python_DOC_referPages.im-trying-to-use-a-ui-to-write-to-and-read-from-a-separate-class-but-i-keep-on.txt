This question already has an answer here:What is the purpose of self?                    19 answers                Hey I'm trying to write a UI for an orbital simulator using PyQt5. I have created 8 planet objects and written functions for the UI to read to and from the class so that it can display the right information to the user.This code basically says if planet 1 is selected set the values on the UI to display the attributes of planet 1. I created a similar method to write to the planet when the user wanted to change the attributes of the planet. When I try either routes I get an attribute error.P.s I also tried to write a method within the planet class to change the attributes inside the class as I thought this may have been the issue.
Your  function is not a method. You need to pass the  argument as fist parameter:You can use the built-in function  to set an attribute value (instead of defining your own):
