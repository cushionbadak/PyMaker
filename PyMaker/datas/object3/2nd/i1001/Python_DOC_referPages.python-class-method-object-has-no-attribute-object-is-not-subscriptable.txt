When I ran this code, there was a TypeError: 'elem' object is not subscriptable.If I substitutewithit would raise AttributeError: 'elem' object has no attribute 'coords'.Can anyone please help me with this?
In order for an object to be substricptable, you need to implement getitem (https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.getitem) in the class.However you need to assign the value to the object, for exampleresults inThis should work with numpy as well, which I assume you use.Basically, what you want, is to extend the lists functionality. You can use the UserList class from the build in collections module: https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.UserListHowever, this does not work with numpy arrays, as far as I know.In numpy you can inherit from the ndarray class, for example:results in Links:https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.subclassing.html#basics-subclassinghttps://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/arrays.classes.htmlhttps://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html#numpy.ndarrayBoth examples are subscriptable.I hope this helps.Some moreYour code won't work, because you have a return statement in the class body, instead of a function.Please, do not forget to state import statements in questions. array is not part of the python standard library. I just guess it is numpy, because of the shape property.
