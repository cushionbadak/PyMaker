I notice that I can do this and get away with it, at least at first glance:Convenient. But I have a bad feeling about this. What sort of grue is going to eat me if I try this in a nontrivial program?
Beware that  is meant for dumping Python data structures, as it always prints the output of the  method of each object in the data structures pass to it, and is therefore not very suitable as a replacement to :So if you replace the built-in  function with  and want to print some readable messages, you would find the output looking funny with all these unintended quotes and escape sequences.
Nothing will explode, because this import will only change your local namespace.Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!You may go ahead and do it, without fear of breaking other namespaces or being eaten by grues.Do be aware, however, that the  call signature is different from , so it's possible some  lines within the containing module may need to be adjusted.  My recommendation is to import it under the usual name, , and use the find/replace features of your text editor to change existing  calls accordingly.
