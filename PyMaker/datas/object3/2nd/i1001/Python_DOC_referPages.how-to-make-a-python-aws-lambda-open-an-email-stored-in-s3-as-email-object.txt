Natural Text
I realize this is a total noob question and hopefully an easy solution exists. However, I'm stuck and turning to you for help! What I'm trying to do is this: I have an SES rule set that stores emails in my S3 bucket. The specific emails I'm storing contain a .txt attachment. I'm hoping to have a Lambda function that is triggered on S3 bucket "Create" function, open the email AND attachment, and then perform some other processing based on specific text in the email attachment. My specific question is this: How do I allow the Lambda function to take the S3 email "object" and convert it to the standard Python "message" object format so that I can use Python's Email library against it?Here is what I have so far...not much, I know:
Can you try something like this?. With this, you will get msg object back from stream you opened with S3 file.
