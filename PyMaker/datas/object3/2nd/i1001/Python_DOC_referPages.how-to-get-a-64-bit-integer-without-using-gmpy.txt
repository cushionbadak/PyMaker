I need to pass a 64-bit integer into a function from a DLL, but the native python int types are 12 bytes ( returns 12) and I get the error "ValueError: Procedure probably called with too many arguments (4 bytes in excess)". Is there a way I can initialize an 8-byte integer or convert to one?I've tried using ctypes to pass in the parameter as various different ctype integers, but I couldn't get this to work:, , , etc.I would like to avoid gmpy since the platform I am running on is not currently being maintained or supported by gmpy.
Using stdlib :It's usually an alias for , which represents the C signed long long datatype.Note that these types have no overflow checking!There's  /  if you wanted unsigned.Depending on how the interfaces looks, you may also be interested in :The 'q' refers to the 8 byte integer type ('Q' is unsigned). Other format characters are documented here. Byte order, size, and alignment options are documented here.
