I have a dictionary where the keys are integers, and are in sequence.  From time to time, I need to remove older entries from the dictionary.  However, when I try to do this, I run into a "dict_keys" error.  When I try to cast the value to an int, I'm told that's not supported.I see answers here saying to use a list comprehension.  However, as there may be a million entries in this dictionary, I'm hoping there is some way to perform the cast without having to perform it on the entire list of keys.
You don't need to convert  to . That's not a thing that makes sense, anyway. Your problem is that  needs a sequence, and the return value of  is not a sequence.For taking the minimum of an iterable, use the regular Python , not . However, calling  in a loop is an inefficient way to do things.  could help, or you could find a better data structure than a dict.
You want a list is you want to use numpy:but actually you can use the builtin  here, which nows how to iterate, and for a dict, the iteration happens over keys anyway
You could use an OrderedDict and  the oldest key-value pair. An advantage to use an  is that it remembers the order that keys were first inserted. In this code, the first key will always be the minimum in the  d. When you use , it simply removes the oldest or first key-value pair.If you'd like to remove the oldest 5 key-value pairs, extract these key-value pairs into a list of tuples and then use  again to remove them from the top(heap analogy):
