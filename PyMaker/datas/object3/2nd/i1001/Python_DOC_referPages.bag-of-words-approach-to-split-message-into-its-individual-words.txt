Did i need to replace the unicode by str in python plugin directory ?
I assume you're on python 3 so just try deleting the line  â€“ your  variable is probably a unicode string already. If it's not then it's probably a  object, in which case the right way to turn it into a unicode string under python 3 is . See https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html if you want more info.
