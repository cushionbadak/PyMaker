Is there an easy way to create a log record in Python where instead of sending a message, you just send a list of attributes? From what I understand, methods like  and  are just methods to create log records at specific levels. These methods call the  method, which itself calls the  method. If I wanted to create records where the message attribute is none, could I just call , passing  to message and a dictionary of attributes to the  keyword argument? Or should I call  and pass those arguments? Or do neither of these work? Can I instead just pass  to the  method too?Also, if this is possible, why is it not done more often? It seems like the ideal workflow would have only attributes being passed into a log record, and then the message would be compiled by the formatter after.Sorry for so many mini-questions in this post.
Why can't you format your logging string to take those extra args? The  kwarg is for this purpose explicitly. From their docs: is for kwarg mapping, so if you wanted it to build a string for you, it can. 'message' is positional, so there's no ignoring it. However, there's nothing stopping you from providing an empty string  as the  positional arg
