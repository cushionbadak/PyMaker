You have to install a module separately for every version of python you intend to use. If you installed it on python 2.7 it will not be installed on python 3.6. Even if you installed it on 3.6, it would not be installed on 3.7. You will have to separately install the module for every python version you intend to use it on.It may help to read this tutorial on pip troubleshooting and installing modules in Python 3.
