I have the following dict:I update this to  when something happens and triggers it. What I would like to be able to do, though, is check if any of the values in the dict returns False (and if they do return False for any of the values do one thing, and if not, do something else).So... how would I go about this? Would be nice if I could do this in a one-line check, but if not, I can work around that.Note: this is for Python 2.7x
What about doingIt is worth mentioning that So, pay attention to this possibility. Depending on what you want to do, you may want to check for 
You can not simply use the  builtin on the dictionary's values for this, because it will return  if it spots any falsy value such as , , , ...Demo:We need one more step, checking explicitly against .There is no :    There is at least one :(Checking against  or  with  is fine because these two are singletons.)
You could use all:Output
If you are sure that all values are either  or  then you could use  operator
You can loop through all values on the dictionary to find if any of them are False
