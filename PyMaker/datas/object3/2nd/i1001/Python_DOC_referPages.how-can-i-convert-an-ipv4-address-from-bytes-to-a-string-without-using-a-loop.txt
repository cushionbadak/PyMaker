I have a simple python script, that creates a socket , which parses all IPv4 packets and retrieves the source and destination IP addresses:Is it possible to refactor getting the IP address, so it will look better and doesn't use this loop:Format characters is described here:https://docs.python.org/2/library/struct.html
If you are using Python 2 (as you have linked to the Python 2 docs), you can use a bytearray and a format string to remove the explicit loop.If you are using Python 3.3+, you can use the standard library's ipaddress module.
