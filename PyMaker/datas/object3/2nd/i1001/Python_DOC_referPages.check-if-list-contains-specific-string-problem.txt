I'm trying to skip blacklisted items when working with my Selenium Python program, but I can't figure out how to make this snippet work - Even though when printed, the the channel name and blacklisted item (3) are exactly the same. It still follows the else, and prints out "there is still a problem" Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks!Edit - The continue there is irrelevant to the snippet, it's just for continuing a loop this is in.Solution - .Stripping() the blacklist and Channel name, to get rid of the whitespaces and /n I had for the newlines.
Pretty tough to guess the reason why  block gets executed. Perhaps the relevant HTML would have helped us to diagnose the issue.However I suspect value extracted by  contains blank spaces / white spaces.SolutionYou can use python's  method to remove the blank spaces / white spaces as follows:
why not just use this?Im not sure why you are using continue in an  statement
Just a side note on how to catch issues like this:As you can tell, it is easy to over look the "\r\n" with a normal print statement.This is where repr() is helpful:
