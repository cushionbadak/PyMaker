How could I do this?Code:My ideaI was going to use for loops to iterate through each  until I found the class with text , in which I could then extract the names. But I don't how I would code this as I am not too familiar with HTML syntax nor the module.

I will show how to implement this, and see that you only need to learn BeautifulSoap syntax.First, we want to use that method  for the "div" tag with the attribute "class".Then, we will filter all the divs without stars in it:If you have only one place with start you can take it out:Then again find all the text in tag "a"You can see that I didn't used any html/css syntax, only soup.I hope it helped.
You can also use regex
