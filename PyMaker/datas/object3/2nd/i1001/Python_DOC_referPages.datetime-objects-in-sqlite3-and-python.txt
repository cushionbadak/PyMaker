Trying to store datetimes in my database project using python and sqlite3. Here's what I have so far...At the minute the database takes start_date and end_date as text. I want to change that to dates that I can then start doing calculations with like counting down the days/nights until the job is finished etc.The user will also be inputing the dates and times so I cant use datetime.datetime.now()/today()I have been reading into datetime but its more advanced than I'm used to if anyone could explain it better I would appreciate it. I have been searching for the solution for a few days this is my first project it may be a little out of my league but I appreciate your attention. Thanks :)fixed! Thanks for the help! 
There is no native datatype for dates in sqlite. The manual that I link to advises (see 2.2) three possible ways to store a date:TEXT (ISO 8601 string)REAL (Julian day numbers)INTEGER (Unix Time)My suggestion would be to use ISO 8601 format, since it is standardized and unambiguous. Additionally, as opposed to the alternatives it is human-readable without conversion. And  objects have standard conversion methods to and from a string for it.See examples below:
You can use datetime.strtime to convert a string to datetime objecte.g.SO
