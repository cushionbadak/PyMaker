Natural Text
I am trying to parse api reponse in python script. The reponse is coming in as bytes. Basically content is coming similar to below.The first row has the header and the second row onwards have values under the header. I have tried using elementtreeBut getting the below responseAttributeError: 'bytes' object has no attribute 'text'I need to be able to parse it and find the student who passed in science. What is the better way to be able to parse it and filter the data to what I am looking for?
The response is essentially a CSV table. Decode it to a string and read using a CSV reader (e.g., from pandas):The last column is a consequence of having orphan commas at the end of each line. You can drop it:
The response is comma-separated data, and can be decoded using python's csv module.Each output row is a dictionary that can be accessed in the usual way
