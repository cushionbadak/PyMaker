Assume I have the following list: I want to do something that accomplishes the following: Set the values in the 1st column equal to "D" where the value in the 2nd column is equal to 0.So the list after the update should look like this:
Naming a variable  is not recommended, since it will shadow the builtin function .  If you wish to do this in place, use indices:Otherwise, you can rebuild the list with a list comprehension:You can also do it this way without unpacking:Theres also nothing stopping you from doing it normally:The list of possibilities goes on(no pun intended).Also in Python  evaluates to , so you can use  here instead of explicitly checking . You can decide if this is worth using, since empty types and sequences such as , , ,  etc. will also evaluate to  when testing for truthiness.
