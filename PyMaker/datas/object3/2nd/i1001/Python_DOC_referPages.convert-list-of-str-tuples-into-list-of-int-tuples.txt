I have a list of tuples which I would like to import into a dictionary. Those tuples consist of two strings. I would like to convert those tuples into integers. i.eThe resulting list should be:I have tried using:But that doesn't seem to work.
You could use  function to get the tuples, like this. Works in both python2, and python3.
You also need to split your strings by .Another option is to use the  module.If it's not terribly important the the inner elements of the result are tuples and that they are of type , we can simplify the  solution to~edit~thelogicalkoan's answer reminded me of  which provides the most elegant (and safe) solution here.
An alternative solution is to use  (instead of  which can be considered unsafe):So, you can do:
str.partition can be used to do this.The generator expression  produces the output of  on each element of the list, and then we call  on the parts that we require. 
This is a different option:
