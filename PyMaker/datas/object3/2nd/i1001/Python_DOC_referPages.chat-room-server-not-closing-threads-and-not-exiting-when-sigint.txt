I have the following server program in Python which simulates a chat-room. The code accepts connections from clients and for each of them it launches a new thread. This thread will wait for messages from this client. The messages can be  so that the server will respond with a list of connected clients,  the server will send the message  to the client . On client side there will be 2 threads, one for receiving messages from the server, the other for sending. The code has a signal handler for  to make the exit cleaner (closing connections, sending a message to the client (still to be implemented) and so on ). The handler writes a global flag  to make the infinite loops terminate.The code runs both in Python2 and Python3. However there are some problems with  signal generated by CTRL-C. When there is no client connected the program launched with Python2 exits correctly while the one in Python3 does not. Why this behavioural difference?Considering only running the program in Python2, when a client connects and I press CTRL-C, the main while exits, like the signal is catched always by the main thread and this interrupts the blocking system call . However the other threads do not, I think because of the blocking underlying system call . In C I would block  signals for one thread and then call  from the other thread. How to exit from all threads when  is generated in Python?The client program that for the moment works in Python2 only and suffers from the same problem is:
As for the difference in behavior with  in Python 3, look at the full description in the docs. I think this is the key statement:Changed in version 3.5: If the system call is interrupted and the signal handler does not raise an exception, the method now retries the system call instead of raising an InterruptedError exception (see PEP 475 for the rationale).The other problem, stated in your penultimate sentence:How to exit from all threads when SIGINT is generated in Python 2?Take a look at the threading documentation:A thread can be flagged as a “daemon thread”. The significance of this flag is that the entire Python program exits when only daemon threads are left. The initial value is inherited from the creating thread. The flag can be set through the daemon property.
