Natural Text
This script is a simple while True loop that checks a voltage value and writes a log file. However, I am not able to get the voltage value written in the log.Simple log files with a text string and date / timestamp work fine but the write fails when I try to use the variable name.I've also tried:Without trying to add the busvoltage1 value to the log, the log is created and the timestamp line works fine. With the busvoltage1 value, the log is created but nothing is written.When running this in the terminal, the errors for "str(busvoltage1)" and just the plain "busvoltage1" are:ValueError: I/O operation on closed fileandTypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'float' objects
The value needs to be formatted as a string before f.write is used.Added  and then referenced  in f.write: This is referenced in the 5th example of 7.2.1 here: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files. Thanks @PatrickArtner
