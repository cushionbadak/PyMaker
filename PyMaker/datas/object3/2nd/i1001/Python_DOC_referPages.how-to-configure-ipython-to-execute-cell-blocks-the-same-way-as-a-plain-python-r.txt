Vanilla Python REPL:IPython REPL with same interpreter:This difference is apparently related to the mode in which IPython compiles code, and unrelated to the display hook.  Is it possible to configure IPython to compile/exec cell blocks as a plain Python REPL does? I'd prefer if IPython would not interfere or modify such underlying runtime machinery.
Set the  setting to , either through the  magic command:or in your This will cause IPython to compile everything in  mode, the mode that triggers , instead of  mode, which doesn't use .The possible settings for  are currently: compile everything in  mode.: compile the last (simple or compound) statement of a cell in  mode. Differs from  in cases like would have printed the values of  from both loops.': compile the last statement of a cell in  mode if that statement is an expression statement. This is IPython's default.: compile everything in  mode.: like , but does some additional AST transformation to print the value assigned if the last statement is an assignment statement:
