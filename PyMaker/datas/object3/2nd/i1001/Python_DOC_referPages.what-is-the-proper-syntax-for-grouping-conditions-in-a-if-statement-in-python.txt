I'm having trouble fully understanding the syntax of if-statement in python. Is it possible to group up conditions as demonstrated below?Will python understand the above code exactly as: ?Provided it does understand exactly the same thing, how can I group conditions? e.g.:Suppose I have three conditions:What is the correct way to write the if-statement? ?And what happens if I start mixing 'and' and 'or' operators? What is the best way to write the following code:
Will python understand the above code exactly as: if my_age> 20 and neighborhood_age > 20: ?No, it will not. Python will interpret it as this:If you want to compare two values against a third, you must do it like so:Or, with grouping for absolute clarity:If you have many values to compare, you can use all:As for your last example, I would probably write it like this, using multiple lines and parenthesis to remove ambiguity:In almost all but the simplest of cases, you should use parenthesis to make your intention absolutely clear.
You have to write each condition on it's own. The  keyword is the same thing that putting a  statement inside a  statement.For example : Is the same thing thatTo mix  and  the cleaner way is to use well parentheses and end line.
