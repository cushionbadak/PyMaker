Writing a pandas DataFrame to a gzip-compressed CSV adds the timestamp to the archive:I'd like to write it without the timestamp, such that two subsequent exports of the same DataFrame are identical:
After looking through the Pandas code for CSV writing, the best I can suggest is to use the  module directly.  that way you can set the  attribute directly which seems to be what you want:This outperforms the two-step  approach below for this tiny dataset:I'm using a  to handle converting strings to bytes as Pandas does, but you could also do this if you know you're not going to be saving much data:Note that  still shows the "current time" but it's just pulling this from the inode's mtime.  dumping with  shows the value is saved in the file, and changing the files mtime (with ) causes  to display a different valueAlso note that the original "filename" is also part of the gzipped file, so you'll need to write to the same name (or also override this) to make it deterministic.
You can export as an uncompressed CSV and then call  with the  flag to avoid timestamping (this is also an instruction to not save the file name in the archive):
