You have to tell Python that it has to look in  for modules. E.g. by adding it to  in your script (before importing from it) or by adding it to your PYTHONPATH environment variable.
For this, you can just download the path.py file into your  folder and your path.py use case should work. You don't need install it with .Should you want  to be available for scripts in any folder on the machine, using the same syntax, use the solution from Roland Smith or install it the generic way with .
