need a small help on this codeI know if i change the variables in the highlighted lines to "other.name" i'll be getting the desired output as below.But if i just give "other" ill be getting the below output.Can you guys please explain me the importance of adding ".name" in the print statement.
In this line  you're passing  which is  object of class Employee.So when you print , you're trying to print the object of Employee class and not the name attribute of that class.If you want to print the  attribute of the object whenever you try to print the object, then You can override the  function and provide your custom string representation for the object.Something like this:Reference : https://www2.lib.uchicago.edu/keith/courses/python/class/5/#str
When you do  and  is , which is an object of Employee class. Hence, you are getting output as  Doing  will print  and doing  will just print the Employee object along with it's memory location (0x0000021858C64FD0).                   To achieve what you are trying to do use  in Employee class like this:              Output:         
If you want to return result from object of a class then you need to declare it.Using repr(for python2) or str(for python3 and python2).Now this will show desired output.
