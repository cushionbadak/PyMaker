I wrote a Python package  that can perform a set of related tasks, , , ..., . Each of them has its own module file, e.g. .Now say in  I import a third party package . It Works On My Machineâ„¢, but a coworker of mine (a) can't install , but (b) does not even need that module .My goal is to structure my package so that we can choose at import time whether we want to load the module  or ignore it.What's the most elegant way to solve this? I'm sensing it has something to do with the directories'  files.
A simple way to solve this problem:Identify all of the modules that may have unfulfilled dependencies.In the main module that does the importing, surround each such import with a  clause:If your colleague's code doesn't call a function that relies on  then all will be well.
I think I can only point you in the correct direction via setupscript because I do not have access to your data/package details.  To simply put, you will have to locate your 's  script, and specifically remove the module from inside the script.
