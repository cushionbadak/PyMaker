This question already has an answer here:Getting the index of the returned max or min item using max()/min() on a list                    21 answers                I need to print out the index position of the highest value of a list on its first instance.What I have at the moment:However, with the above code I don't get what I am looking for, as with that example list I'd get the result of 4 and not 2 as it should be.What am I doing horribly wrong?
You're doing a few things wrong.  First, you are checking if the new index is larger than the previous index, you're not checking the actual values.  Second, you're printing out the actual value at the index rather than the index itself.
