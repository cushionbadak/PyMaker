I need your help to automate branching a dictionary. I am iterating through lines of a big dataset with over 100 million lines. I split each line and select the parts of interest:Now I would like to define a function that does this automatically instead of always writing the branch manually (this should work for different branch lengths, not always 4)!My code should look like this:My try for such a function is the following but I might be humiliating myself:Any comments would be great, either pointing out my mistake or suggestions to new approaches. I really need to write my code with respect to performance. If it is slow I can't use it because of the several million iterations.   
For a dictionary , the following codecan be done in one line with a  object.Effectively, if the key doesn't exist, it creates a key with a value based on the function passed ( returns 0). If you want nested dictionaries where the last one is an integer counter, you'd want something likeThis can be generalised in a function.And to update a keyThen you can use it like this.
I manage to find the bug in the script and I also made it more efficient by directly handing the dictionary to the function instead of it having to repetitively search it through the globals() function.Here I present my working script to add dictionary branches in case someone finds this threat:And here an example how to use it:
