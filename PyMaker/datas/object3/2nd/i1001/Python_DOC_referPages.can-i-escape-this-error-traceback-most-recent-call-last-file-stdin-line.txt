I'm trying to put some info into the databaseI want to write to the database, but it creates the following databaseerror:data_entry(x,y,w,z)          Traceback (most recent call last):            File "", line 1, in             File "", line 2, in data_entry          sqlite3.OperationalError: no such column: name 
Your strings are missing quotes so they're treated as column names, try this:EditInstead of the line above (which is vulnerable to SQL Injection) you should do it like this:
Hey your last line is calling this:Its x,y,w,z, but in your function definition you are receiving this:So that created a bit confusion on what variable is what.And also your strings will need to be enclosed inside single quotes as @scope mentioned. So here's a working codeIf you have any doubt please comment.
