Please consider this code:Seems like i mutated the  in-place i.e. it is a mutable object. But it says everywhere that s and s are both immutable objects. I am confused. Furthermore, if it is an immutable object, why does it have a  method? 
 is definitely immutable. If you print the p1, its same even after  function. why do you have _replace then?It aims to return a new instance of the named tuple replacing specified fields with new values. It does not mutate the actual tuple itself. The operation is short lived.
Because you didn't assign it back, so replace this line:With:For it to be different.
The _replace method creates a new namedtuple, it doesn't mutate the original, so immutability is preserved.From the docs:Return a new instance of the named tuple replacing specified fields with new values
