How do I get the numbers from a, what? subindexed dictionary?  (I don't even know the right terms here).Still a relative newbee here but this is my first pass at a dictionary and while I understand the very simple basic concept I'm missing how to access things.  My dictionary seems to hold the data I want it in the way I want it, but I'm fumbling around on how to access it.Here's my code:with these results (all fine):So all well and good -- I have the data as I want it, with the two frames showing my x,y,z.  I can read how many items for each bone just fine so I know how many frames are there, and I can even access the x, y and z values IF I know the frame numbers:but how do I get the 116 in the first place? That's all I really want to know, is how to read those frame numbers so I can then access the data associated with them.I've looked at tons of tutorials but don't seem to get it, as they nearly always show a dictionary example much simpler.  Any help would be enormously appreciated.
You have multiple options, most of which can be found here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dictIn your case:to get dictionary view of keys, as mentioned in comments:to get both frame and coordinates at once (my favourite for most applications):to ensure ordering of frames (https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2017-December/151283.html):or just use  to retrieve simple keys list:
