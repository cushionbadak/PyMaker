This question already has an answer here:How can I multiply all items in a list together with Python?                    16 answers                I am trying to create a basic Python script that allows me to multiply each number in a list and print the total.For example, if my list contains 2, 5, 1, I want the script to multiply 2 * 5 * 1 which would give 10. For some reason, I am unable to produce this, I have been able to produce it by adding numbers together (which you can see below) but when I change line 8 to multiply, it doesn't give me the expected result (in the above example, it gives me 30 instead of the expected 10). Incorrect multiply list total:Script which successfully adds numbers in a list together:
Idiomatic way to do such things is  — literally to "reduce" your sequence element by element and end up with single value. If you need multiplication, you can use  — programmatic way to do multiplication:
To multiply the numbers in a list and print the total, you need to set the total to 1 and you need to use the *= operator. This simply means "[left hand side expression] = [itself] * [right hand side expression]"This prints 10 (2 * 5 * 1 = 10)
