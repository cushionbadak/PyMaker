I have something like this:And I want to retrieve the list that has the highest last value, first list in this case. How should I go about this?
Use  with a key:
Using  + :How the above works: fetches the last item, and applies it the  argument of , which indicates the max must be found by comparing the last element of every sublist.  A side note,  is always O(N), since you need to check every element of the list to determine the maximal element.
