So, I have a problem with my dataframe from dictionary - python actually "names" my rows and columns with numbers.Here's my code:I've tried to rename columns like this:, but it gives me a error:Is there any way to fix it?Edit:Here's the first part of my data frame:The 1st rows and columns are exactly what I need to remove/rename
By sorting the  object (), you have created a list.  You can check this with .  Then, when you try to use the  method, it fails because it is expecting a dictionary, which has 'values', but instead receives a list.Probably the smallest fix you can make to the code is to replace the line:with:.(The  argument is required here because  expects a dictionary to be in the form  but instead  is converted to the form .)Another option is to use  to generate a dataframe directly from the sorted items, although you may need to tweak  or the result to get the desired dataframe format.Alternatively, look at  (the documentation for which is here) to avoid sorting to a list and then converting back to a dictionary.EditRegarding naming of columns and the index, without seeing the data/desired result it's difficult to give specific advice.  The options above will allow remove the error and allow you to create a dataframe, the columns of which can then be renamed using .  For the index, look at  (docs) and  (docs).
 and  are properties of your dataframeAs long as  and , i.e. your dataframe has nonzero rows and nonzero columns, you cannot get rid of the labels from your  object. Whether the dataframe is constructed from a dictionary, or otherwise, is irrelevant.What you can do is remove them from a representation of your dataframe, with output either as a Python  object or a CSV file. Here's a minimal example:
