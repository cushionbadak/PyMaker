While doing this challenge on Hackerrank ( https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/merge-the-tools/problem), I came across this high-vote answer written by a user. It's nice to be compact but I find it VERY difficult to follow. Here's how I coded: By the Python standards, which answer demonstrates a better practice? I skimmed PEP8 and didn't find an answer to my question. 
It all depends on your intended audience and the intended use for your code. If the code is just for you, do it how you best understand it. Compact code is often, but not always more efficient, because you have to write less and there is less to look through if there are errors. If you intend for other people to be looking at your code and learning from it, definitely go for the longer more readable code, give room for them to figure out shortcuts so they can feel accomplished and proud of their work, but back to the question. There is no right or wrong way (in reference to compact vs. readable), to do it, it all depends on situation.
