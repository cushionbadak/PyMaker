I would like to fetch i'th element from all the sub lists in a list of lists.I tried using map and lambda function as belowI expect b to be [2,5,7]but I know the last line doesn't work. How should I approach this with map and lambda
You do not need to hard code the index.                IMHO, you should return a lambda function from  method by doing something like this perhaps:                  Output:      Note: Better(read pythonic) approach will be to use list comprehension like this:        
You can hard code in the :You normally don't want to store a  to a variable, this is better:Or simply this:You can also use a list comprehension, which I personally think is the best option:
The underlying problem is your first function argument needs to be specified when you call . This is possible via :But this is relatively inefficient, since a new function is created for each iteration of . Instead, as others have advised, use :As an aside, PEP 8 advises against naming  functions; define explicitly instead:
I would suggest using  here to fetch the second item of each sublist:Or using :Your anonymous function:Needs to instead map specifically an index:Then you can simply map this function to your list with . 
I also vote for the 'for' solution. Functional programming syntax looks beautiful but its too much overhead sometimes.Lets just check:2 times slower.
