This question already has an answer here:How to print a date in a regular format?                    21 answers                I've got a piece of script in python that parses a line containing date and time:it returns the date in YYYY-MM-DD. How can I get it to say Weekday DD Month YYYY? Or if that is not possible DD-MM-YYYY? Additionally, it also gives the time in HH:MM:SS, but I only need HH:MM, is there a way to lose the seconds? Thank you! I'm a complete novice to python so hope that anyone can help me, thank you very much!
Use datetime module's strftime to change the format according to the docs.
