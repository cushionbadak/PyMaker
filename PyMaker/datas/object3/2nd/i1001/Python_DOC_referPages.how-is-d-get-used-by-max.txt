The  method(?) is working fabulously for me to find the max of a value in a dictionary while returning the key. But I can't seem to understand or find any explanation for how  operates. Is far as I can tell:  iterates over an  and returns the iteration of greatest value. When iterating over a , this defaults to assessing the  .  My confusion comes from the difference between  and . How can you call a method without ? I'm not sure how else to investigate this. Using the optional argument to  one can sort by the  and return the . I just don't understand what is being assigned to the  argument.Thanks all.
 is a function that returns a value for the corresponding key in . When  looks for the largest value, it uses the return value of the  argument, passing in the input as an argument.This code:is equivalent to:or even more explicitly:When you pass  into , it iterates over the keys of the dictionary. Basically, with , you are saying: Give me the maximum key of ; however, instead of using the value of the key itself to determine the max, use the corresponding value in .
 simply returns the value in the dictionary for the key .When you iterate over a dictionary, the iterator returns the dictionary keys. So for each dictionary,  calls  to get the values to compare with each other. is equivalent to , so it returns the corresponding dictionary element.Finally,  returns the key that corresponds to the maximum of all these values.The code you gave is equivalent to:
It's not as much the get method as the max function "key=" argument, which takes a function as an argument.When you tell it    max(my_dict, key=my_dict.get)It iterates over the keys of my_dict, passes each dictionary key to the function given in the key= argument. And returns the key for which the function output was the highest. Would do the same.
