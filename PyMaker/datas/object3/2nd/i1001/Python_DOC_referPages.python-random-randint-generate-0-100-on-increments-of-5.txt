Is it possible to generate a random number with  from 0-100 on increments of 5?If its possible I need way to generate random integers from 0-100 but only with increments of 5.
Either use  which lets you pick a step value:or just generate a number between  and  and multiply that number by 5:I'm assuming here that  is a valid result. If  should not be generated, use  or .If you wanted to generate a  array of such numbers using the  function (instead of the standard library  module version), just use
The following code will generate random integer between 0 to 100
