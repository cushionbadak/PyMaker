Here is my current code:My issue is, I'm practicing List Comprehension but am confused as to why "count += 1" does not work in this type of format:I am, however, able to do it in a normal for loop as I did below. Can someone explain how I can accomplish the function below with a list comprehension?(The above lines of code with the list comprehension format are not necessarily related to accum(s).)
Comprehensions take an expression as its first element;  is a statement.Instead, use , which takes a generator producing  and returns a generator producing  where  is the index:
use  for this type of thingas a list comprehension
