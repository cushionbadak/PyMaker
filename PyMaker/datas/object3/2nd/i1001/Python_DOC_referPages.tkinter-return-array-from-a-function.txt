I am trying to create a window in which I can enter different values.The window should adapt dynamically to the data frame.This works quite well so far.Now I want to output the input as an array.The array can be printed in the function as well.Certainly a stupid question...but how would I get access to the array outside of the function?Normally, I get access to the return value as follow:It is the first time I am working with tkinter.Usually, I would get the  with something like this:But then I got this: Can anyone help me to get the  from the function?
GUI programming works different than procedural programming does because it's "event-driven" which means it keeps running in an infinite loop processing user input until it ends. The  has such a loop in it in it's constructor, which only returns when the dialog window is dismissed or ends. It is what calls the  method when the user clicks on the OK button, so that is where you have to do something to make it possible to retrieve the value later after the user event-processing loop ends.To work around that and allow you to use it the way you want, I've defined a function called  which creates the tkinter  window, hides it, and then invokes the dialog and waits for it to end. To make it possible to return the , I have made it an attribute of the  class instance so it can be accessed after the dialog itself has ended. So  returns that as its result.
Your code is incorrect - you are mixing numpy and normal arrays.Just replace  with .
