I keep getting an error that says "IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'C:\Temp\test2_empty\Storage\Poly1.kml'"What I want to do is copy a file from a directory move it to a temporary storage folder and rename the file and then move that file to another folder. What is the best way to fix this issue?
Create your destination directory -  before calling shutil copy.If you want to accept the pre-existence of this directory, you can:for python 3.2+ - add keyword argument for python <3.2 - add try / except block for OSError exception.
