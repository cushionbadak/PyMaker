This question already has an answer here:Items in JSON object are out of order using “json.dumps”?                    5 answers                I need to show an output like below as a result of a webservice callI have the below code to create the object:which reorders the key alphabetically as shown below. What should I do?
Rebuild your new dictionary with a , and append ordered dictionaries with a : here serializes the dictionary into a JSON formatted string. Note: If you are using Python3.6+, you can use normal dictionaries instead of , since insertion order of keys is remembered. However, in 3.6 it is an implementation feature, whereas in 3.7 it is a language feature. You read more about this at Are dictionaries ordered in Python 3.6+?. You can probably rely on this feature for applications that have a minimum requirement of Python3.6. Furthermore, its probably safer to user  anyways, so your code can be backwards compatible for all python versions. 
You can look into Ordered Dictionary. It remembers the insertion order, and you would be able to organise your json via this collection this way.  Example:  Using this, you can convert your  dict object into an  with your desired insertion order and then return that  object or convert it back into a  and return that dict
