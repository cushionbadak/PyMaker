Current code:Is there a way to place it on one line, e.g.:In C you can assign a value, then compare, then print it out on one line:
In Python 3.8, you will be able to writePython does not have Perl-style statement modifiers, but since  is a function, you can write an expression statement likealthough I wouldn't recommend it. (Actually, I'm not entirely sure the assignment expressions defined by PEP-572 interact with a conditional expression. I haven't played with any reference implementations to test it, but I believe  will be in scope for the entire expression.)A simple  statement like that, though, can be written on one line (although again, I wouldn't recommend it; PEP-8 explicitly frowns upon)
Instead of using a ternary  you can use  and  with a ternary telling  or  to avoid/use the newline after it:This prints nothing (not even a newline due to ) if the key is not present.See Why dict.get(key) instead of dict[key]?
Building on the answer here you could possibly cram multiple expressions using a semicolon. Something likeShould work, but I'm typing on my phone and can't test.
You can simply use inline  provided by .That it! Hope it helps:)
