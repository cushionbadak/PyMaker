I'm learning Data Structures and Algorithms with Python. For the textbook I'm using, I revisited an issue I never understood. For the following user-built Range class, why does something like [x for x in Range(0,5)] work? Essentially, why does the index move automatically? There are no calls to getitem or len.I've read the Python tutorial and the class section, and haven't been able to figure this out.
This is because the Range class is implementing all that is necessary to be a valid sequence, namely the  and  methods. This allows it to be used as an iterable automatically as described in the documentation:Iterables can be used in a for loop and in many other places where a  sequence is needed (zip(), map(), â€¦). When an iterable object is  passed as an argument to the built-in function iter(), it returns an  iterator for the object. This iterator is good for one pass over the  set of values. When using iterables, it is usually not necessary to  call iter() or deal with iterator objects yourself. The for statement  does that automatically for you, creating a temporary unnamed variable  to hold the iterator for the duration of the loop. See also iterator,  sequence, and generator.
