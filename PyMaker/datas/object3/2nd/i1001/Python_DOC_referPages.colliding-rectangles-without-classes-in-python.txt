So I'm making this cool avoiding game and I've got everything done except for the collision. Since I'm a noob to the pygame module, I didn't do any classes, and I don't know how I would check if the player hitbox collides with the enemy hitbox. Also, I know a few people have asked this before, but the answers they gave are either unclear to me or are for sprites, not rectangles. Here's my code: https://hastebin.com/exaximafiy.pyAny leads would be helpful and you can ask me to clarify in the comments below.
Every  object in Pygame has a method  which can test if that  object collides (overlaps) with any other  object. More infoTo check if a rectangle at point (,) with a width  and height  collides with a rectangle at point (, ) with a width  and height , you can implement this like so:In your specific example for example, you could implement what you are trying to do with:NB: the  I used here unpacks the tuple into arguments. I.e: the first element is sent as the first argument, the second is sent as the second argument, etc. More info.You were on the right track in your code, remember that this method operates on  objects and not on tuples of the information itself. You therefore need to instantiate the necessary  objects as shown above ^
