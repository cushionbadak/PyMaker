Natural Text

(in Python 2)For example, "hi i am a human named joe norman" should slit into "hi i", "i am", "am joe", "joe norman". I have the following code:the problem with this is that it splits txt by each space, not every other. I would like to use no libraries. Thank you.

Of course either could be rewritten to use list comprehensions, e.g:is equivalent to:
