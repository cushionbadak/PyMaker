I'm trying to modify some Python 2 code for Python 3.  The code imports .  Is there a way to import this into Python 3?
The  class is no longer available in Python3.The recommended solution is to subclass collections.abc.MutableMapping instead.As with the  class, your class will need to implement some methods itself for the subclassing to work.
