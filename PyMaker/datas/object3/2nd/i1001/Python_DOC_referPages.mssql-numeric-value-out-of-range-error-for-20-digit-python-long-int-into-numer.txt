I am attempting to insert a 20 digit, 64 bit python long integer into a MSSQL Numeric(24,0) column. This results in a 'Numeric Value Out of Range' Error from  MSSQL. I am using the pypyodbc module and ODBC Driver 13 for SQL Server to INSERT the data from my python application.   I've tried using a Numeric(38,0) column in SQL just to test the limit, but receive the same error. In the insert statement, I've also attempted explicitly casting the id as a Numeric(24,0) data type. All attempts resulted in the same error.  I would expect that a python long int of 20 digits and 64 bits would fit into a MSSQL column of type Numeric(20,0) or greater. However, an Insert results in a 'Numeric Value Out of Range' error.
The size of Python integer values is only limited by available memory; they are not restricted to an arbitrary number of bits. However, the largest integer value that the SQL Server ODBC driver(s) can handle is a (64-bit signed)  whose maximum positive value is , or  which is nineteen (19) digits long.When pypyodbc tries to pass a 20-digit integer the ODBC driver chokes on it, so this failsHowever, the following works because pypyodbc doesn't tell the ODBC driver to expect an integer
