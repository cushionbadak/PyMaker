Why has os.linesep() been used here in my code?
I don't know why you're using it, but from the docs: The string used to separate (or, rather, terminate) lines on the current platform. This may be a single character, such as '\n' for POSIX, or multiple characters, for example, '\r\n' for Windows.Basically represents the current line separator default for your current environment or platform.
