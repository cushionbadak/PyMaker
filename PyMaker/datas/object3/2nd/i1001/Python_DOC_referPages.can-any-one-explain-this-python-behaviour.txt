This question already has an answer here:Variables inside and outside of a class __init__() function                    5 answers                I have a problem with understanding this code.I called  3 times, but why is it not deleting the previous stack of the function each time?I am getting this output:Could you explain a solution? Also, where else could this problem occur?
When you delete ff, you are deleting a new object that inherited properties from K (which inherited properties from Hello()).When properties are inherited to an object, they change together, but do not get deleted together. You will need to reinitialize the properties to get them to change back.
