I've been fighting with mocking a form class to replace an instance of it in a class-based view. But it looks like that because the form is in a class attribute, it happens before I replace the form class with my mock. Case in point:app/views.pyapp/tests/test_views.pyAs you can see in the inserted comments in , I forcefully reloaded  and redefined the variable  using pdb, which made my test pass.It seems that for some reason, the  is [registered,instanciated,...] before I start patching . Any ideas on that?
The problem is that the view is already loaded by Django and the  field is already defined and pointing to the  production class.As @DanielRoseman and @foxyblue pointed out in their comments, it is possible to patch directly a field in a class. And actually there was already an answer for that on SO. As pointed out, it is possible to use  to patch a member of a class (which is, IMO, the best solution, as it's more explicit, and less prone to typos)Test corrected:With With
