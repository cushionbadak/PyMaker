I have the following  function and I am a bit confused how should I write a unit test for it. What aspects of it do I need to check?
You have to mock  and  and return some fake, but real-looking values for  and , then verify that the value returned by  is correct (based on  and ).Be sure to check edge-cases such as no team, duplicate domain, etc.
