This question already has an answer here:Merging dictionary value lists in python                    3 answers                I have the following two toy dictsand I would like get a unique dictionary where I stack the second dictionary values after the first ones, within the same square brackets.I tried the following codebut the output I obtain has two lists within a list for each key, i.e.whereas I would like to obtainHow can I do that with a line or two of code?
You almost had it, instead use  to append both lists:
if not all the keys from  are in , then the simplest thing is using set union and :
You could use extended iterable unpacking:Output
The code will work irrespective of whether  or  have the same set of keys. I have added a key  in  and  in .
You can use  to efficiently construct a single list from input lists:For the more general case covering an arbitrary number of dictionaries and keys which are not equal across dictionaries, see Merging dictionary value lists in python.
