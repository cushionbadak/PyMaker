Write a Python function called , which takes as an argument a  set of tuples of integers, calculates the product of the values in  each tuple, and returns the smallest such product. (Note that the  tuples may contain negative numbers, so the smallest product could be  less than 0.) If any of the tuples is empty its product should be  treated as 1; if the set is empty the value None should be returned. [  The product of the values in a tuple is obtained by multiplying all of  them together, e.g. the product of the numbers in the tuple   is 3x7x2x3 which evaluates to 126. ]
Here is some answer:
Lets look into decomposition of the problem, and simplify it down to standard python library.We have iterable of tuples, and we need to find minimum product.From iterable of tuples, create iterable of productsFind minimum value of that iterable2nd one is easy part â€“ use .Lets decompose 1st part:We have iterable, every element of each is tupleIterate over elements and apply some function that transforms tupleinto single value by multiplying all elementsWrite or find function that takes tuple if integers and return productEvery single step is easy to find solution for.Multiplying elements from iterable can be done with  + .  supports "initializer" out of the box, so requirement for "empty tuple should result to 1" is covered.
Without using :CodeOutputIf you are using , you can do:where  is the input (the set of lists you want to process)
