I am trying to process the results of this API in Python:https://www.cryptopia.co.nz/api/GetMarkets/BTC/12When I assign the results of the API call to a variable I cannot seem to iterate over it or even call objects in it. When I do something like  I'm only getting single characters. I need to be able to get to the "Data" object in there and iterate over it.I'm stuck so any help would be greatly appreciated.Thanks
I am not sure how you are retrieving the data from the API, but I would reccomend using the Python  library.You would send off the request:From there you want JSON data back, so convert the data to JSON like so:Then you can just parse the attributes you want from the API. If you wanted the  attribute for the 1st object in the  array, you would do something like this:Hope that helps
You haven't provided much detail, however, you probably need to decode the JSON response. Use the  module for that. Something like this should help, but it depends on what the actual response is:OutputIn this case  returns a dictionary, and the actual data is the value of the  key which is a list of dictionaries. To iterate over the dictionaries:If you are using the  module to retrieve the data you can simply use the  method of the response to access the decoded data.
