Is it possible that installing ipdb (or some other package written to do it explicitely) will result in  running ipdb instead of pdb without binding  to ipdb?https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0553/I'm not asking if ipdb does that or if it will, but if its possible to code that. I know that I can set environment variable . The question is if its possible to trigger this behavior by just installing .
During the installation one could programmatically create either a  or a  in the correct directories and alter  in there.These modules are imported by  early in the startup sequence and are suited for this sort of customization. Personally, I've never seen a package alter/create these files so I wouldn't expect  to ever do it.
One way would be to create  file in your  directory. If the line in that file starts with  statement then this line is being executed. In that file you can monkey-patch Example:
