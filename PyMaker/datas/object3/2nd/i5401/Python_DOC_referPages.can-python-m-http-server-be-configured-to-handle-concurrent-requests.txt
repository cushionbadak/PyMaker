I have a small demo page served with http.server. I tried sharing with my coworkers but discovered that http.server remains blocked on any open connection, so concurrent users can't be served.  Is there a way to run http.server to handle concurrent connections?  I found nothing useful here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html
IIRC there is no existing config option, but you could extend one with  if you like:ps: there is a related python ticket.
