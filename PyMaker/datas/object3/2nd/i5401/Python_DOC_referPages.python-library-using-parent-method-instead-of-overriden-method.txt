I have extended the  class with the  class. I have have overridden the  method to fix a bug that occurs in the  class. I fixed the said bug and this fix has been tested in the  class.I use the  class through an  class. By testing the  class to see if the previous bug is fixed, I discovered that it is not and that the traceback does not go through the  class.It seems to me that the  class uses the  method instead of the  method. Any clue on how to fix it or on where this problem comes from?I'm a beginner and have not been confronted inheritance a lot so, please, forgive my ignorance and my lack of experience.EDITTest that fails in  :Overridden method : in https://github.com/thefab/configparser_extended/blob/master/configparser_extended/ecp.py line 573Parent method : from (https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html#configparser.ConfigParser.read_string)Error :
Your code is not a complete working example, but it should do as you suggest.Here is an example you can run to prove the point:That prints 'child', proving the Child class has overridden method(self).
