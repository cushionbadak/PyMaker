I am a bit of a newcomer and am pouring through some tutorials like water from a firehose when I encountered an acquaintance post something on social media that looks like this:Now, I went and ran the code and was perplexed to see it print out a large set of varying characters. I tried to skip ahead to some tutorials talking about format and also perused the site: https://pyformat.info/ to no avail. Any pointers would be greatly appreciated.Cheers!
To be fair, running help(format) in the Python terminal doesn't give a lot of insight into what format() does. The official documentation page, specifically Section 7.1.3.1. of the following link goes into a lot more detail: https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.htmlformat(x, 'c') converts the integer (x for x in range(32,127)) to the corresponding unicode character before printing. 
This should help you understand formatBasically, your code prints every character with an Unicode value between 32 and 127.
