The following code block was tested with (cpython) Python 3.6.4 and Python 2.7.14.With the explicit  statement commented out, the following code runs and prints "Hello!" and then "World!" even though no  symbol exists.Uncomment the  statement and the ValueError is raised and the expected  is raised.I was expecting the NameError to show up well before runtime processing of the except block.Is there a different except syntax that would more aggressively check Names/Symbols during a parsing step?Is this an implementation bug?Thanks for reading!
After a comment from @DYZ, I found the right search terms to get the answer.https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#handling-exceptionsThe try statement works as follows.First, the try clause (the statement(s) between the try and except keywords) is executed.If no exception occurs, the except clause is skipped and execution of the try statement is finished.Another resource exploring this problem.https://dbaktiar-on-python.blogspot.com/2009/07/python-lazy-evaluation-on-exception.html-My Solution moving forward:-tl;dr - The except clauses are entirely skipped if the try clauses executes without exception.
Exceptions can be defined at run time. Example:myexcept.py contains:Your program slightly modified:This behaves just like your program: .But change: , and by the time the  statement is encountered, the  exception is defined and no NameError occurs.
