Natural Text
I would like to know how can I, using a  command, pick out the values of two user chosen keys to add together? What I have attempted is:I did borrow that line from another thread but can't figure out how to shape it the way I need to.All the above achieves is the sum of everything in the dictionary instead of the 2 the user picks. 

You are making this much more difficult than necessary. I suggest writing the steps out in words, then translating the words into Python. For example:Get the first key from the userGet the second key from the userGet the first value from the dictionaryGet the second value from the dictionaryAdd the two values togetherPrint the result
