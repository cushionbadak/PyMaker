I have written a code in python using Beautiful Soup for extracting user name and their rating from IMDB. But there are many user who did not gave rating for their reviews. Its become difficult to map exactly ratings with their reviews. So how can i do this part?    http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2866360/reviews?ref_=tt_ov_rtIn this url reviews are not assign rating. This is the code to check whether rating part exist in review part or not but it did not returning any thing?
The information you're looking for (username, rating) is located in 'div.review-container' tags.About the tags that have no rating, you can just ignore them.  The information  that shows when you press the Load More button is loaded via XHR requests.You'll find the all data you need in order to preform the request in a 'div.load-more-data' tag.  Just repeat the above process untill you have all the info.  
I suggest you should try to console the content from  of every review. Then select the specific data you want to retrieve.
