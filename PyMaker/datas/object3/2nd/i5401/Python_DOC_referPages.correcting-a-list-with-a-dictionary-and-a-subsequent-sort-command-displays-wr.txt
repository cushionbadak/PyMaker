sorry for the bad title. I am new to programming and I could not come up with a better description. So, I have this code:This gives me the following result: clearing the "reverse = True" gives the following:If i do something like that:So it seems, that the .sort() command views the 13 & 14 as a unit and the 3 & 4. Could somebody explain why that is?  Thanks alot!
You are sorting strings where  comes before . The following  call deals with the necessary type conversion:For every string in , the generator expression produces the corresponding value in the  dict or, as fallback, turns the string into an , such that a proper numerical, non-lexicographical comparison is possible.
You're sorting them lexicographically, as strings rather than numbers.  You could convert them to integers first, or you could expand your  dictionary:This uses the  method as a key function to guide the sorting without changing the values being sorted.
It does not see them as a unit, it compares the charakter for charakter:, so the ranking is You want all of them to be numbers, so change the following lines:toand:to
Because the list elements are string that's why while sorting its taking in account every character i.e. every digit in the number Which means every string char is sorted by its first character and then by its next character Which means  and You need to convert the list elements to int by  before sorting the list
You are saving the values as strings instead of integers.  And it is sorting them as strings.Try
