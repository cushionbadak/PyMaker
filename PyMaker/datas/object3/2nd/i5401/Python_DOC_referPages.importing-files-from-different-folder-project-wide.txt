There is a popular Python question called Importing files from different folder.But the top answer there mentions adding stuff to "some_file.py", and that will obviously only apply to imports inside that file.What if I want to specify an additional dir to import from, project-wide?I don't want to modify PYTHONPATH, as I believe a per-project solution is cleaner.I don't want to use python packages for this, because I feel they'll probably just complicate stuff. E.g. maybe I'll need to manually recompile .py files into .pyc files every time I make a change to the code in the other folder.
What if I want to specify an additional dir to import from, project-wide?Solution 1: Package installed in develop modeCreate a regular package with   and install it with  option:-e, --editable    Install a project in editable mode (i.e. setuptools "develop mode") from a local project                                path or a VCS url.Now, as soon as you update your code, the new version will be used at importwithout reinstalling anything.Solution 2: Dynamically modify You can add as many directories dynamically to the search path for Python packages as you want. Make this the very first lines of code you execute:or to make the first to be found:Now the files:can be imported anywhere in your project:No need to modify  again as long as this Python process is running.
