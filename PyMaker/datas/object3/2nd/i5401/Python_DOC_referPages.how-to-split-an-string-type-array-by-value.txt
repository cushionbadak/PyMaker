Say I got an array of :And I want to split it by value, in this case by , so it becomes:I don't want to enumerate every element since it's time consuming when input has a large scale. So I wonder if there are some functions or python tricks that can easily achieve this. P.S.I've saw this question but it doesn't help much. Mainly because I don't quite understand how  works with , also because I'm working on  type.Another thing might be helpful is that my final goal is to generate a matrix of numbers (maybe  type), so I'll also be glad to know if there's any numpy function can do this. 
You can use  which, of course, does iterate the list, but is highly optimized:Or, with float conversion:
Using :Alternatively, if we're sure to be dealing with a matrix, you could simply search for the first occurrence of , reshape, and slice using that.This might be faster.
I made a thing for this once upon a time. A chunking module. It's made to work similar to ThenThere's also , which is a generator variant of that.
