I am trying to look for a string,  in all of the files inside of  a directory.This code works on most files, but i have a file,  that seems to be encoded differently than the rest of the files.  I know the string I'm looking for is not in this file, but it breaks the program. How can I skip any files that can't be read?Here is my code:
Just use a  based on the exception that you know should be raised for the particular action you are performing. I'm pretty sure the exception you are most likely getting is . Alternatively, you could also open the file using "read-bytes" -> :More directly in your problem for using the try/except:Doing the above will raise when something unexpected happens so you can then determine how you want to proceed, otherwise, continue. I would also suggest as an added bonus, to either explicitly call  on your open, or even better and strongly recommended, use a context to handle the opening/closing for you, so you don't end up with a bunch of open files.Finally, to the point of this comment, you should probably ensure you even want to open certain files that you might not care about. Using the  as suggested in that respective answer, you will probably filter down to files you actually care about. Use pathlibIt would be a good opportunity to also start making use of pathlib, as it provides great tools.
Instead of using , take advantage of swanky new python features like  and (not new but part of path) . Wit it you can look for files names matching a pattern:This assumes the files you're interested in are s, but you can tweak this to your needs.
