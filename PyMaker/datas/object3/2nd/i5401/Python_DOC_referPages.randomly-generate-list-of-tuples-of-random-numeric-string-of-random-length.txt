For simulation purposes, I would like to generate a list of string pairs. Each string pair consists of two strings. Each string consists of numerical digits generated randomly. The length of string is of random number as well. How to achieve this function using ?
This is an infinite generator. You can either take a slice of it (shown in the last line), or iterate over it directly:produces:
You don't need  to get such simple result. All you need is the list comprehension with  as:Above solution will return 10 pairs of random number strings, with maximum length of each string to be 5 digit.  here will generate random number between  to , and since the selection is random, the number of digits will be random too. Then simply type-cast them to string to get your desired result.Sample result:
