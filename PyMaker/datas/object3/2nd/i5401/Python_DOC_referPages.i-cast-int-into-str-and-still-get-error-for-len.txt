The code below gives me an error that  has no length even though I cast it into . Where is the problem there?Code:The output I get:
You assign an integer to  in the loop:so the next iteration of your  loop now passes that integer to the  function and you get your exception.Convert the value to a string instead:I'd set  to 1 inside the loop to simplify it, and test for more than 1 digit:The loop can also be done using the  function, together with  function for speed. The  function can be used to turn the characters of  back to integers to multiply with. We can use  to produce the counter:
 loop check the condition after all code, right after  in your code. At that time, your  variable is a product, (maybe int?) as mult, and then python interpreter try to apply  in the int object, so it raise a .
