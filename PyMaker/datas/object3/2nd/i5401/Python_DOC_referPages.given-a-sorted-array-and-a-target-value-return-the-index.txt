Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order ? My question  here is:- If  target is different then how do I append the target before the ith element in the list ? ( which I have explicitly mentioned with [1] in the question)
Use one of the functions in the bisect module.  They handle both hits and misses.
