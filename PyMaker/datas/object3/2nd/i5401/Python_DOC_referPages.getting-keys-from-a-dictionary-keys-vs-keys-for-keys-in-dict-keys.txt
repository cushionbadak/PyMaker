Trying to figure out best coding practices as I'm getting started with python. I wrote a csv to dataframe reader with pandas. It uses the format: We're using a dictionary to determine the columns we want to import along with their associated data types. For example: Now to assign the second argument, usecols, we can take the keys from a dictionary in order to get just the names of the columns (column1, column2, column3). I used the keys method:Someone checking my code changed it to this instead:Could someone explain to me why one would choose one method over the other for assigning the keys in a dictionary to a variable?
In Python 3,  does not return a list, but rather a "view" of the keys in the dictionary.This view differs from lists in two major ways:You cannot modify it:If the dictionary changes, the view reflects those changes:You might want to turn this view into a list if you need to modify it or if you want it to be independent from the original dictionary.Other than lists, other standard containers that are suitable for these purposes are sets (read-write) and tuple or frozensets (read-only).One thing worth mentioning is that this code:Can be rewritten in a more compact and fast way like this (thanks Cleb for pointing it out!):Another thing to note is that iterating over a list might be slightly faster than iterating over the view. That's because list have a better memory representation. (However, this is a very generic statement: factors like the number of items in the dictionary, the time required to create the list, and the Python version can have great effect on the overall performance.)
