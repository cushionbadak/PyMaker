Consider this snippet:My attempt was to pass a  Python dict to , and then use  to get it back. But that doesn't happen, probably because JSON alays considers keys as strings. Is there any other way I can retain the original key types? 
The conversion of integer keys in Python dicts to JSON-compliant string keys by  is lossy: once done, there's no way to tell whether the original key was the integer  or the string  (unless that information is stored elsewhere).That said, you can force  to convert keys into integers wherever possible, by passing an appropriate function as an  argument:Usage:Expanding on this, it's also possible to write an  which converts not only integers, but all the other non-string keys which  might have converted to strings:Usage:
We can use  in place of , and  in place of Just posted as an initial solution, expecting a more sophisticated one.
