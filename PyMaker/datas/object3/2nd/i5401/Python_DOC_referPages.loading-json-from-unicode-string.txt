I have a json dumped string dumped in a file.Here is the file format - It's invalid json because its should have double quotes. How do I convert this into valid json?
If you have read this data from your file:You may be able to convert it to a Python object using :Note that it might not work with other contents, because it seems you dumped a string ( or ) representation of a dictionary to a file, instead of JSON. Other, more complex types may not be readable by . You should use the  module instead to produce and write proper JSON to the file.For reference:https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast.literal_evalhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/json.htmlAs it seems you are working with Python 2:https://docs.python.org/2/library/ast.html#ast.literal_evalhttps://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html
