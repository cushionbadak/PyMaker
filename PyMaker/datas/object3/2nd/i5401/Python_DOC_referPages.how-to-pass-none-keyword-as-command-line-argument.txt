Natural Text
I am trying to pass  keyword as a command line parameter to a script as follows, if I explicity mention  it works but the moment I switch to  it fails, any pointers on how to fix this?so I tried as below which still didn't workCommand line passage:
just an FYI. You can use ast module to convert sting 'None' to None typeEx:orFaster and better solution. 
As Stephen mentioned,  is not a string, so when comparing a  type to a  type, the result will always be .If I just put  around  on the right-hand-side of the comparison, we get:Resulting in: instead?However, I recommend using argparse instead, if you're in a position to do so. I use it all the time.The above code could be replaced with:Which will also tolerate no parametersAnd it auto-formats some help text for you!
I think more appropriate way to do this would be to check if there's any parameter passed or not. If not then set  to , otherwise set the value that is passed.Ex:So if you just call , category will be set to .If you call like , category will be set to .
