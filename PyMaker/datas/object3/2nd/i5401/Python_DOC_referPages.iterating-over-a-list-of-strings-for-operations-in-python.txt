I'm trying to do a rather simple loop in Python 3.6.1 that involves a list of strings. Essentially, I have a dataframe that looks like this:and I'd like to find the net change of X, Y, and Z, making them new columns in this dataframe. In its simplest form, this could bebut in actuality, there are about fifteen columns that need to be created in this way. Since it'll be a bear, I figure it's best to put in a function, or at least a loop. I made a list of our initial "root" variables, without the suffixes that looks like this:And I think that my code might(?) look something like: but that's definitely not right. Could someone give me a hand on this one please? Thank you so much!
You can use the relatively new (Python 3.6) formatted string literals:The  prefix before each string causes the  to be replaced with the value of the variable . If you want the code to be usable in Python versions before 3.6, you can go with the more usual formatting:
