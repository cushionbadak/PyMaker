I'm using NodeJS to fire a Python script by way of python-shell package for the cozmo api.The problem I'm having is when I execute my nodecozmo.py script from the command like it works perfectly.   When I execute the exact same script from my node app, its giving me a syntax error when it executes the py.Not sure how this could be a syntax error, maybe python-shell package somehow uses an older Python version?  Maybe it doesn't understand handling that syntax?  I tried to go through the source and couldn't see why its causing the issue.ErrorPython ScriptNode App

Notice how the error message points directly at the colon:Since type hinting is a nicety but not a necessity, you could make your script backwards compatible simply by removing the type hint:Change to
