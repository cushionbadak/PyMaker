I have three  columns where element are . For combining these lists, I can do by explicitly write the name of column and  them togetherHowever, if I have too many column names to write each of them, is there a way to do it by looping (or not looping) the list of column name:  instead?
Option 1Slice on the columns and call  along the first axis. Option 2Another option with :
You can use Python's builtin  function.
If you are having a large set of column's name then an easy way to solve this problem is shown below :where "allint" is the start column name and "allx" is the end column nameThis will give you the same result you got after writing the name of each columns.
