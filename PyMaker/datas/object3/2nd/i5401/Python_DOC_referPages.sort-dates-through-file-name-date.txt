I have a folder with *.txt files which contain a specific format (c is character and d is digit and yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss is the date format)cccccd_ddd_cc_ccc_c_dd-ddd_yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss.txtor cccccd_ddd_cc_ccc_c_dd-dddd_yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss.txtor cccccd_ddd_cc_ccc_c_d_yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss.txtwhen the single digidt d is equal to 0I would like to create a python script to obtain the dates and sort the files from that specific date. SO far I ahve done But I am bit new with regular expressions. Thanks
You can use  to split a string.It seems that we can split from the last occurence of "_", remove the part after "." to get the timestamp. So, method to return timestamp from the file_name is:As all the dates are of same format, python can sort those using the timestamp string itself.To get the sorted list of filenames using that timestamp, you can do:More about the Key function can be learned from official python documentation.
