Natural Text
I am trying to clean a dataset and while doing so I came across a column named "production_companies" with about a 1000 values. This column contains unnecessary symbols for example: The column values are like this .I wish to remove the unnecessary symbols like: " {} [] , the text values "name" and "id" as well as the integers. The problem is that  does not accept list as a parameter. It only accepts a string as an input parameter.I need to use a list to store the  values and iterate through it using a for loop because there are many values in the column and I need to remove the symbols and unnecessary text from all of them at once.Can anyone please tell me what should I do?Thanks a lot 
You can use a list comprehension to create a new list from an existing one.
