In your Document folder create a folder :Save these few lines as  Python scripts:Save the code below as :(Please note that both Python scripts were saved in to the same folder).Now using the OS X Terminal or Windows CMD window change the current directory to the folder you created:Now run:The process takes 2 seconds to complete. When completed it prints out the entire progress log all at once:Instead of getting the log printed (all at once after the process has been already completed), I would like the have a real-time progress update. I would like to get every printed line from the process at the same moment it occured.So, when I run command it will give me line by line update happening in a real time. How to achieve it?
To get a real-time feed from the subprocess you can use this code in the caller.pyNote the -u in the subprocess.Popen, you need unbuffered stdout.https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-uWith readline() you are reading a single line per time from the subprocess output. Be aware when the subprocess prints '\nCompleted!\n' you will read it in three loops.https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#methods-of-file-objectsIn the example, the loop will run until the subprocess will terminate.https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen.poll
