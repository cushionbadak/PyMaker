I am trying to use a list that has operations attached to them, but i can't get the numbers out of the list. Here is the list.I was wondering if there was a way to put them together as a float, and then do the operation so it would do 1-2*2 and output the answer. Smaller the better. thanks :) the expected output is -2.
You can use a  to map symbols to operations (that are all defined in ) and regular expressions to parse the strings in order to avoid evil . This applies the operations in the list from left to right, regardless of mathematical operator precedence:
By treating your example as a string, it is possible to compute the output after each operation listed, assuming the input is treated with precedence from left to right:Output:
