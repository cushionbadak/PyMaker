If you don't need to change these multiple values in the dictionary, use  as values:Otherwise use :And in both structures, accessing is identical:But assignment is only possible with  (as they are  data structures):
Yes, you could assign a tuple:And access like so:
you can add the value as a tuple or a list like this:This would be the list way to do it. You could access your values with the corresponding indexes.my_dict['key1'][0] would be the string and my_dict['key1'][1] would be the number. Good luck!
you can establish lists if you want to later append
Given a list of your new numbers, you can use :Output:
