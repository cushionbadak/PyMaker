I know, that  is evil. I'm sure there are much better ways.This is just a general question of approaching a problem.What do you think about using  in order to make a function more generic?In a very simple example, it could look like this:I have not used such a function, yet. But every now and then it pops into my mind when thinking about how to make functions more generic.Instead of having two functions   there would be  one function  or  or .I'm really not sure about it.
you can use the operator if you are interested in simple arithmetic operationsfor other operator like  I guess you better go with  functions
My mind goes with this thread. You must have already read it, but... in your case, you want to know if there is a case where it could be useful for generic programming.And... unfortunately, the answer is : If you can't prove at least one good use-case, it doesn't exist.If you truly believe such a use-case for generic programming exists, then find one, and come show us (But I understand the question might be interesting to think about as a group, more than as an individual, but then, you might want to consider going on another site).
