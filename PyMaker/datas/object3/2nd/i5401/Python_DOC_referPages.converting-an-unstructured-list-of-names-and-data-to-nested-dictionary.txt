I have an "unstructured" list that looks like this:Unstructured in that the list consists of sets of:(Name, Officer Status, Demographic Info) triplets, or(Name, Demographic Info) pairs.  In the latter case,  and in the former, .  The Demographic Info strings represent , with s represented by literal question marks.  Here is where I'd like to get to:Right now I've built two functions to do this.  The first is below and handles the Demographic Info strings.  (I'm fine with this one; just putting it here for reference.)The second function deconstructs the list and throws its values into different places in a dictionary result:This second function feels way too verbose & tedious for what it's doing.Is there a better way about this that is able to more smartly remember the categorization of the last value seen in the iteration?
This sort of thing lends itself very nicely to a generator:Code:Test Code:Results:Converting tuples triplets to :Results:
You can use  in Python3:Output:
