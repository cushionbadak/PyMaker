Natural Text
I have a large txt file (log file), where each entry starts with timestamp such as Sun, 17 Mar 2013 18:58:06 I want to split the file into multiple txt by mm/yy and and sortedThe general code I planned is below, but I do not know how to implement such. I know how to split a file by number of lines etc, but not by specified timestampexample of lines from txt 
You could use regex (such as [0-9]{4} ([01]\d|2[0123]):([012345]\d):([012345]\d) ) but in the example posted the date is always in the beginning of the string. If that is the case, you could just use the position of the string to parse the date.Which gives the correct output for the three examples you providedThe datetime object has attributed such as  and  so you can use a simple equality to check whether two dates are in the same month and/or year.
