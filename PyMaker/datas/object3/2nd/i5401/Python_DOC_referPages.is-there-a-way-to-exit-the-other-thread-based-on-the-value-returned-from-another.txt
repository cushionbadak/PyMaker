I have three threads : , , .  and  are spawned from . There is a  loop in  in which some processing is happening.  consumes a bool variable set by . I want that the control to exit the while loop in  as soon as  sets the bool variable to .t1:t2:I am checking for  in  but that is not solving the problem as I want the control to skip the rest of the lines in the loop if lets say the value of 'flag' is set to true by  somewhere when control in  is  inside the while loop.Is there a way to achieve this? 
You can use Event Objects from threading.You'll need to set an event object in your main method and use it as argument:And your threading logic should be something like thist1t2Here's another real, non-pseudo examplenot flag yet  not flag yet  not flag yet  GOT FLAG !Hope that's helpful and clear.
