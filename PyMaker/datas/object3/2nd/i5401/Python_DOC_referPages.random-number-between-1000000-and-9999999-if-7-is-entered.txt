As the title suggests, I'm looking for a way of generating a Random number between 1000000 and 9999999 if 7 is entered and similarly if any other number is entered
I don't quite understand what you mean byif 7 is entered and similarly if any other number is enteredbut what I can tell you is that the following Python snippet will generate a randomized number between your two numbers. If you're at loss as to how the snippet works you can use this to read up on Python functions for integers and this to read up on submodule importing in the Python docmentation
