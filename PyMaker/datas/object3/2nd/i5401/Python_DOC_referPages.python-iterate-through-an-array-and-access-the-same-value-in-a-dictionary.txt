I have a dictionary that consists of numbers and their valueI have an array with some numbersWhat I want to do is:iterate through the dict and the arraywhere the dictionary value is equal to the number in the array, set the dictionary value to zeroany value in the dictionary for which there isn't a value in the array matching it, add 1so in the above example, I should end up withThe bit I am getting stuck on is creating a variable from the array value and accessing that particular number in the dictionary - using  for example
Additional example:
You just need a  that will re-built your dictionary with an  condition for the value part.Note that I have re-named the dictionary from  to . That is because by using  you are overwriting the Python built-in called . And you do not want to do that.
Theirs always the  approach, which rebuilds a new dictionary with new values to each of the keys:This works because wrapping  will automatically convert mapped 2-tuples to a dictionary. Also you should not use  as a variable name, since it shadows the builtin .  
Just use .update method :output:P.S : don't use dict as variable
