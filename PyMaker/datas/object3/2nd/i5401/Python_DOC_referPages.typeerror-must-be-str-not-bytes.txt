So I am writing a function that pulls hex color values from a twitter account that posts a color of the day.  I am hoping to send this to an arduino to light up and LED with that color, but I am running into issues when trying to write to the Arduino.  I have converted the hex color value to an RGB value and stored it in a tuple.  I attempt to reference each value in the RGB tuple to write out of a serial connection to my Arduino, however I cannot encode the integers correctly so that they are sent. Here is the specific part of the code I am referring to:I thought I would need to convert the integer values to raw binary for use in write.serial, but that doesn't seem to be working.  Here is the output when I run the file:Any ideas?Here is the my full code:
The reason for your error is that struct returns a bytes string while you are trying to add it to a  type. See line . Type  into a python 3 shell and you will get the same error . You need to change "r" to b"r" which turns the string into a bytes string. https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytesSo you will need to change a few of your statements.
