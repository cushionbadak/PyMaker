I am getting this error.
You're definitely over-complicating this - to the point where it is not obvious as to what your strategy actually is.Here's a simple algorithm you could try and integrate:Get the length of Iterate through , accessing slices of the list of length  (eg the first slice would be , then the next would be Check if the slice is equal to  - if it is then return True (or add 1 to the counter)If you reach the end of the list - end
You can test all the  slices of the proper length for equality with . You can then use  to get the number of occurrences:
Here is one possible way to do it:Which Outputs:The approach of the above code:Convert  to a  object, which can pop objects off the front in  time. This is  in the code.Store a  of identical lists found equal to .Check if the  sub list, the first  elements in  as a list, is equal to . Increment the count if it is equal.Pop the first item from  with , getting ready for the next sub list. So if my list is , After processing , pop  from , and the next sub list to check is . Keep doing this process until no  sub lists can be extracted. Then you can just print out the count at the end.
