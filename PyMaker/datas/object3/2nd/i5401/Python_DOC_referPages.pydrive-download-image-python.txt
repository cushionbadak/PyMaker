I have mail messages which contain attachments.I need to upload the attachments from mail to google drive.For mail I'm using imaplib and for google drive I'm using pyDriveI'm using the below code to get attachment:I have  my attachment in mail. Now I can't understand how upload  to google drive using pyDrive. I've tried this, but it did not workUPD:This code is work, but i think its bad solution(we save image localy, then upload this image in google drive)

As a work-around you can write the data to a temporary file, upload to your drive, then delete the temporary file:
