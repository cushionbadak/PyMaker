You set your handlers to filter on the  level:andthen logged an  level message.  is a lower, less severe level from , so is filtered out by the handler.You need to log at  level or higher (so ,  or , or a numeric value of 30 and up), or configure your handlers to handle lower levels (so , , or , or a numeric value of 20 or below).For example,  causes data to be added to your log file. And if you used  for the second argument to , the  call would also have the same effect.From the  method documentation:Sets the threshold for this handler to level. Logging messages which are less severe than level will be ignored. When a handler is created, the level is set to  (which causes all messages to be processed.Bold emphasis mine; also see the Logging levels section for their ordering and numeric values.Note that creating a log message with a timestamp in the log message is rather redundant, as your log format already includes a timestamp:
