I have a base class and two different subclasses (they are in 3 different modules).In the base class I have test methods which I use for the subclasses.I want that the test methods in the base class to use the defined variables from the subclass. But I cannot access to the variables from the subclass, when I run the test methods in subclass.Can someone help me to resolve this problem?P.S.: I cannot use a  constructor (cannot collect test class)!Code:So, when I run the tests in the class , I want that variable  on the  to take the value  from the variable in subclass .
Use :Explanation: Python has a few namespaces â€” global, local, class and instance. You cannot access  because Python looks it up in local and global namespaces and fails. You can access  because it's instance namespace which also has access to class namespace if the name is not shadowed in instance (in ).
