Natural Text
I'm having trouble storing data minus the header into a new file. I don't understand Python enough to debug. Ultimately, I'd like to extract data from each file and store into one main csv file rather than opening each file individually, while copying and pasting everything into the main csv file I would like.My code is as follows:The csv files that are being "scanned" or "read" have text and numbers. I do not know if this might be preventing the script from properly "reading" and storing the data into the csvRow array.
The problem comes from you reusing the same variable when you loop over your file names. See the documentation for , it returns a list of filenames. Then your  isn't really pointing to the file anymore, but to a string filename from the directory. https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.listdir
