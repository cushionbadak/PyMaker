These are the remaining keys of sys.modules with all things at https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html and modules starting with _* removed.mpl_toolkits  # is part of matplotlibzope  # zopeI'm running Python 3.6.4 on OSX. There are no cython, matplotlib, zope references in .profile and no PYTHONSTARTUP environment variable in .profile. They still appear after starting python with -s.Cython, matplotlib, zope are installed packages I want to keep but I am not importing them. How can I find what is causing these modules to be imported?Edit:Removed genericpath from above list per @user2357112EDIT2: They do not appear with -S flag per @wimThere are references in the output of -v flag suggested by @wimthough they appear to be comments. I still would like to know how these are being called.The line before and after the mpl_toolkits and zope are included.
