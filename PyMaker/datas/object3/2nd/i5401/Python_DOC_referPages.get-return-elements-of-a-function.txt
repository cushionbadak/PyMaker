Is there a way to introspect and fetch the return values of a function.Eg.I am looking for a way to see the return elements  and  as a . Is there a clean way to do this?NOTE:I am not looking for the values of the return elements. Just the name and count of them.
This is generally not possible. Consider the function:Here we have a function that can conditionally return 1 value or 2 values (with different names).If your function has type annotations then you can get the return type using :returnsi.e. the type that you specified the function would return.Note: Because they are fixed, it is possible to get the names/default values of function parameters using that same method. I.e.  returns .
A bit of  transformations should get you there. A naive implementation can be done like this:Example usage:With more complex function (borrowed form Alex's answer):In its current form it supports only small subset of scenarios, but you can extend it, if you need.
