I have the 2d list mainlistHow to determine if a sublist of a sublist exists in a list where if slist1 is tested against mainlist will return True while slist2 will return FalseI am thinking of something like this (code from here)is there a more "pythonic" way to do this? thanksedit:slist1 tested against mainlist would return True slist2 would return False slist3 would return False slist4 would return Falseso basically, i am just testing if slist is in the first 2 index of mainlist[x]
Since OP did not respond, I am going to cover both cases.If order does not matter; both  and  are assumed contained in :If order does matter;  is contained but  is not in :
If i did understand your question i think you can use  and intersection between sets, like this example:PS: This solution have many weaknesses ... And it doesn't cover all the cases.
It seems you want to check if sublists in each list in  has  or . In that case, you can do something simple like this:or a shorter solution with :Which works as follows:Note: This also assumes that you are checking contiguous sublists, where order does matter.
