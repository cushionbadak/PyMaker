ContextI have a list of numbers in an array, I want to append a letter to the value in the array depending on the number.CodePsuedo-CodeI've tried something like this but got stuck it failed and just assigned [A-Z] to each letterI want to add A to 9, B to 8, etc... How do I do this dynamically?
You can use  to convert a number to a character with that ASCII value. Since 's ASCII is , adding 97 to the index in the list and converting it back to a character will give you an increasing series of characters. All that you're missing is some list comprehensions to put it all together:
Output: is a const that contains what its named after, takes n iterables and matches them on indexes as pairs - shortest iterable wins, elements of longer ones are discarded.Doku: zip and string
If I understand right you want a multidimensional array that looks like:In that case  is helpful and you can use :One cool side effect of how  works is we can pass this into  and get what you would expect ( maps to , etc.):Note that in your construction of  you don't need to use append you can just use a literal:If your intent is that numbers is always a descending series like that, you should look at range:
