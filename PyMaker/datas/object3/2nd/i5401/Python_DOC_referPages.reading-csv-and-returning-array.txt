Taking a video game design course and I've never had to use python before so I am very confused... I am tasked with the following : read in the CSV file into Python and store its contents as a list of lists(or 2D list/array). To do so, you will make use of the CSV[1] library.The reading of the CSV file should be done as its own function - please create a function called readCSV(...)that takes in the file name as the argument and returns the 2D list. As mentionned I have no previous coding experience with python. I have managed to do this so far and would greatly appreciate some support. 
Just append each row (which is a list of columns values) to your 2d list and return it in the end:The short version of that is:
You can just call  on the reader to get the full 2d list:This works because  is an iterable.
