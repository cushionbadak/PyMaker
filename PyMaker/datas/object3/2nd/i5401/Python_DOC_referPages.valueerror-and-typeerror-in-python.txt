I can't completely understand the difference between Type and Value error in Python3x. Why do we get a ValueError when I try float('string') instead of TypeError? shouldn't this give also a TypeError because I am passing a variable of type 'str' to be converted into float?
A Value error is Raised when a built-in operation or function receives an argument that has the right type but an inappropriate valuethe  function can take a string, ie , it's just that the value  in  is an inappropriate (non-convertible) stringOn the other hand,Passing arguments of the wrong type (e.g. passing a list when an int is expected) should result in a TypeErrorso you would get a  if you tried  because a list can never be converted into a float.Cite
