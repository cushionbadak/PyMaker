i'm trying to read a .gz file from S3 using AWS Lambda.when i try to unzip the file using gzip, i get OSError: Not a gzipped file (b'PK') error.Here is the code...Here is the response of the retr file.How to get that .gz file unzipped? i want to unzip it and read the .txt file in that .gz file. Can anyone guide me?
The file you are trying to decompress is not a gzip file.  It's a ZIP file.Here's what happens why I try to use the Python gzip module to decompress a ZIP file:You will need to use the zipfile module instead.
i was uploading a corrupted .gz file. The code is fine and is working well now.
