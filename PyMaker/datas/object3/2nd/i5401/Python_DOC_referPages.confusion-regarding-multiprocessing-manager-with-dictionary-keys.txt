Can anyone explain why the following code produces a key error? Does the multiprocessor namespace Manager have an issue with dictionaries? 
If you add a print after the update operation, you'll see that the update does not have any effect:prints:That is because each time  is accessed its value (the empty dict) is retrieved from the managed namespace. The state of that dict is not managed, only direct access to the namespace is.To make your example work you have to explicitly update the namespace with the changed dict, e.g:You could instead also use a managed dict as  with your original function:Now changes to that dictionary will be immediately visible, but changes to other mutable data structures in the namespace will still only be updated on write access.
not sure if this is expected or not, or if the namespaces behave like you're expecting they behave. An easy workaround here would be to create a  from the manager objectI getassigning this  object to your namespace attribute should also work.
