I have a .py file with a script. I want to run it from the PowerShell. I can do it by writing:However I want to pass some arguments to the script. Thus, I set all script as a  function. It looks like this:And the rest of the script continues.Maybe someone could tell me how can I run that script from PowerShell in one line and passing arguments?
I think something like this is what you are looking for:And from PowerShell:Of course you probably want to check your argv indices are within range.
The use of the main funciton should looks like this:You only define the function main but you never call it.Read for example here more about main: mainRead more about sys.argv: sys_argv
