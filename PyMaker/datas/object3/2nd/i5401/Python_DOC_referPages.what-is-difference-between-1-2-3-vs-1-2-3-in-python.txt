In following code, shape of size & randm is same only, 1-D Array (3,)Then why size=(3, 3, 2) & randm=[-1.10343097 -1.31819984  0.20597956]Q.1 Why different bracket () vs []Q.2 What is significant of each bracket () & [] Output- 
 is a multidimensional  array.  It is defined via a nested list of lists (the brackets and commas). is a tuple, and so displays with ().The other answers, and the supposed duplicate, focus on Python's distinction between lists and tuples.  But this needs a numpy focused answer.A simple 3d array:You can get the shape as a property, or via a function callBut the  does not have a shape property itself.   would work, since it is a tuple. is confusing.   will first turn its input into an array (if it isn't already) and return the shape of that:So I wouldn't normally take this shape of a shape.  However it does demonstrate a key point.   is a 1 element tuple.  The  is important.  The shape tuple for an 0d array is .The next part makes a 3 element arrayAgain, a (3,) shape tuple.  The  display of an array uses the brackets, but omits the commas.  That helps distinguish it from a regular list.(There is also an array type that displays with (), a structured array. But that's a more advanced topic.)

The  notation means that the data type is of  while the  denotes a .Additionally tuples use less memory and are immutable while lists are mutable.
