A colleague of mine wrote code analogous to the following today, asked me to have a look, and it took me a while to spot the mistake:The problem here is that there's no  parameter to  in 's constructor. What surprised me is that absolutely nothing happens in this case, i.e. no error, nothing. What does the  object created by  contain? As an object, it clearly has a constructor, so that's what gets called, but how is that object related to ? In particular, why is this valid code and doesn't throw an exception somewhere? Is  an object with some actual use and what would that be?
The only thing that causes all these ambiguities is that "why  works?". That's because  returns  and in that case you're calling the  objects'  like following which returns None:Regarding the rest of the cases, you can simply check the difference by calling the 's essential attributes in both cases:For the rest of the things I recommend you to read the documentation thoroughly. https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#super and this article by Raymond Hettinger https://rhettinger.wordpress.com/2011/05/26/super-considered-super/.Moreover, If you want to know why  doesn't work outside of the class and generally why calling the  without any argument works inside a class you can read This comprehensive answer by Martijn https://stackoverflow.com/a/19609168/2867928.A short description of the solution:As mentioned in the comments by @Nathan Vērzemnieks you need to call the initializer once to get the  object work. The reason is laid behind the magic of new  object that is explained in aforementioned links.
The confusion here comes from the fact that (in a class definition context)  gives a bound  object which then delegates  to its , while  creates an unbound  object which, because its  is , does not delegate. So when you call , it creates an unbound  but then immediately calls  on it; that, because of the magic described in the various links in this other answer, binds that unbound . There are no references to it, so it disappears, but that's what's happening under the hood.
