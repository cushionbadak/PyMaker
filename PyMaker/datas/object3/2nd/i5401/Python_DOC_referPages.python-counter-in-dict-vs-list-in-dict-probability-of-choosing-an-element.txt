I have a question for  with python dictionary. I build dictionary using Counter (it helps me to build adjacency matrix)I use  for this example. The values stored 48 - fourfold 52 - double?Let do this with list in dict:Now I will choose a random value from a given key (48). What is the probability for the list in the dictionary and for the dictionary with counter? It's better to do this with list in dictionary? Does it matter?I wonder the extract of dic with counter give me  or Counter only store number of elements?The real question is:Which way I should use to get random value from key? Dict with list or Dict with counter? It's the same? I woring on Markov Chain to generate music. I have set of notes and I build a dictionary. 
It depends on how you're randomly selecting the elements.  If you're using , then you want to use the dict with list values. This is because when you iterate over a  you only iterate over the keys, so  weights all keys of  equally.If you're using Python >= 3.6, you can use the new  to select the keys using their values as weights is a shorter way of doing something like
