I know it is possible to consistently rewrite the last line displayed in the terminal with "\r", but I am having trouble figuring out if there is a way to go back and edit previous lines printed in the console.What I would like to do is reprint multiple lines for a text-based RPG, however a friend was also wondering about this for an application which had one line dedicated to a progress bar, and another describing the download.i.e. the console would print:Moving file: NameOfFile.txtTotal Progress: [########              ] 40%and then update appropriately (to both lines) as the program was running.
On Unix, use the curses module.On Windows, there are several options:PDCurses: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/The HOWTO linked above recommends the Console modulehttp://newcenturycomputers.net/projects/wconio.htmlhttp://docs.activestate.com/activepython/2.7/pywin32/win32console.htmlSimple example using curses (I am a total curses n00b):
Ultimately, if you want to manipulate the screen, you need to use the underlying OS libraries, which will typically be:curses (or the underlying terminal control codes as tracked by the terminfo/termcap database) on Linux or OSXthe win32 console API on Windows.The answer from @codeape already gives you some of the many options if you don't mind sticking to one OS or are happy to install third party libraries on Windows.However, if you want a cross-platform solution that you can simply pip install, you could use asciimatics.  As part of developing this package, I've had to resolve the differences between environments to provide a single API that works on Linux, OSX and Windows.For progress bars, you could use the BarChart object as shown in this demo using this code.
Here is a Python module for both Python 2/3, which can simply solve such situation with a few line of code ;Dreprint - A simple module for Python 2/3 to print and refresh multi line output contents in terminalYou can simply treat that  instance as a normal  or (depend on which mode you use). When you modify that content in the  instance, the output in terminal will automatically refresh :D For your need, here is the code:
