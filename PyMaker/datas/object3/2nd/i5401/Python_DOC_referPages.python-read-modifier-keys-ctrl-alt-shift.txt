this seems to be a hard one in Python..I'm trying to read keystrokes and combinations with the modifier keys CTRL, ALT and SHIFT.I'm on Python 2.7.It only has to work on Linux, but without X.Currently, I can only read keystrokes using sys.stdin.read(), but the stdin.read() works like a file and doesn't give back the modifiers..I'm flexible in the way the function returns the keystroke combination. First thing that comes to mind is to return maybe a list or a dict with the combination in it.. But main question is, how to detect it?!
Stdin, by definition is a stream of bytes representing control codes and characters.  It is not a stream of key events.  To get keys, you need to use an OS specific function.  On Linux, the curses window objects have a getch methods.  (There is something for Windows in another module.)Tk, and Python's tkinter wrapper thereof, uses OS-specific methods to let one bind to both key press and release events, which include the modifiers you mention, in code that is mostly not OS specific.
