I am little bit new to Python and I got stuck a bit in this moment:it gives me error:Error: TypeError: file  line 39: coercing to Unicode:  need string or buffer, int found #Question is how to put variable  inside second bracket so it will be ? 
Avoid string concatenation when you can. This is a good use case for .Which works assuming  holds the value of an integer to begin with (otherwise, the  step fails).
Python does not automatically convert an integer into its string representation like some languages. You need convert it explicitly yourself with , , or an f-string.
In Python, you can't concatenate str and int.
