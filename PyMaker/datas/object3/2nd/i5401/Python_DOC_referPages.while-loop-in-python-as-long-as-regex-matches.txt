Ok, I'm aware that it's probably not the best way to edit a string with regex expressions in loops. Just for the sake of interest: How would I have to build a loop, that executes a regex pattern as long as it matches, run in a loop and stop when it doesn't hit anymore? Im doing this in python.
, since  returns  in case of no match, according to the docs. But you're not updating  in the loop. Did you mean something like:(Note that  takes no  argument)
