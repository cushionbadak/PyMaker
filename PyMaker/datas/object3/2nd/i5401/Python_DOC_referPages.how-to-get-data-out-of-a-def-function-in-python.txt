I would expect the value stored in BAL.txt to come back but it always says that readvar is not defined. I just defined it in a function that I ran. i am extremely confused 
In Python, variables from inside a function is generally not accessible from the outside (Look up variable scoping). You can put a  statement at the end of a function to return variables ( in this case) (and you almost always should). Then you can assign the returned argument () to a new variable (e.g. ). You can also give it the same name.
You're unable to see the value of  because it's only locally defined within the scope of the  function, not globally, as you're attempting to use it when calling . If you need a value to persist outside the scope of the function, you must  it to where the function is called, like so: I'd also suggest using a  block when performing file operations. It's best practice as to ensure the file handle is correctly closed, even if exceptions occur. This improves the handling of any errors the operation may encounter. For example: If you wanted to access the file line-by-line, we simply include a  loop within the scope of . For example, printing each line of the file:
