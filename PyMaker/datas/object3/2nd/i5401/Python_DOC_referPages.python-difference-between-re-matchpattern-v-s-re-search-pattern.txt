While reading the docs, I found out that the whole difference between  and  is that  starts checking only from the beginning of the string.Is there anything I am misunderstanding, or is there no difference at all between  and ?Is it a good practice to only use ?
You should take a look at Python's  vs.  document which clearly mentions about the other difference which is:Note however that in  mode  only matches at the beginning of the string, whereas using  with a regular expression beginning with '^' will match at the beginning of each line.The first difference (for future readers) being:Python offers two different primitive operations based on regular expressions:  checks for a match only at the beginning of the string, while  checks for a match anywhere in the string (this is what Perl does by default).For example:Regular expressions beginning with '^' can be used with  to restrict the match at the beginning of the string:
If you look at this from a code golfing perspective, I'd say there is some use in keeping the two functions separate.If you're looking from the beginning of the string, , would be preferable to , because the former has one character less in its name, thus saving a byte. Furthermore, with , you also have to add the start-of-line anchor  to signify matching from the start. You don't need to specify this with  because it is implied, further saving another byte.
