How is it calculated?  I understand the range part to it, what character you want it to start at and which one you want it to end at.  But it produces an integer value, how is this integer value calculated and what does it mean?https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/string/find(Got the code from here)^^  It has compiler on the website.
Did you read the documentation (link)?It returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring you're looking for, or -1 if it isn't in the string
You might want to read up on "slice notation".
andReturn the lowest index in the data where the subsequence sub is found, such that sub is contained in the slice . Optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in slice notation. Return -1 if sub is not found.The subsequence to search for may be any bytes-like object or an integer in the range 0 to 255.
