I have to accept input (using ) as a power expression like  and then print its value. I have tried a few pieces of code but these do not give desired results:Is it possible to achieve something like:
In f-strings expressions are parsed with the equivalent of:see https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast.parseBut variables will be replaced with their actual value. What are you looking for is sort of a nested evaluation which is not supported by f-strings. Instead as a safe approach you can first split with '**' then covert to int and finally use power:
So this works for all expressions (e.g. ) but I am not sure if this is the right way to go (since  is not recommended)
