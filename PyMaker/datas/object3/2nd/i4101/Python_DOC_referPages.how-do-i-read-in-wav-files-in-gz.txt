I am learning machine learning and data analysis on  files.I know if I have  files directly I can do something like this to read in the dataNow I'm given a gz-file I'm not sure what to do now. I tried:but it gives me:Can anyone help me out?
There are several things going on:The file you are given is a gzipped-compressed tarball. Take a look at the  module, it can read gzip-compressed files directly. You'll get an iterator over it's members, each of which is an individual file.AFAIKS  can't read from an in-memory buffer so you have to unpack the tar-members to temporary files. The -module is your friend here, a  will provide you with a self-deleting file that you can uncompress to and provide to .You probably want to implement this as a simple generator function that takes the tarfile-name as it's input, iterates over it's members and s what  provides you. That way everything gets cleaned up automatically.The basic loop would therefore beOpen the tarball using the -module. For each memberGet a new temporary file using . Copy the content of the tarball-member to that file. You may want to use  to avoid reading the entire wav-file into memory before writing it to disk.The  has a filename-attribute. Pass that to . the return value of  to the caller.
You can use PySoundFile to read from the compressed file.https://pysoundfile.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.0/#virtual-ioMaybe you should also check if you need to resample the data before processing it with librosa:https://librosa.github.io/librosa/ioformats.html#read-specific-formats
