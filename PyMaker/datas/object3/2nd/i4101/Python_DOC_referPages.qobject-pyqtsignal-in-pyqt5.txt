pyqtSignal follows the so called descriptor protocol. This is most famously used in the property decorator, but you find plenty of other uses. The result of this is that accessing an attribute allows it to get a reference to the object youâ€˜re calling it through. So in your case, the instance of QtSignal. The result is the bound signal. This is the same btw for methods of klasses! This is needed because when you emit the signal, you do need a sender. And this is the way pyqt learns who that is.
