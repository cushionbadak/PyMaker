I'm using multiprocessing.Pool too run different processes (e.g. 4 processes) and I need to ID each process so I can do different things in each process. As I have the pool running inside a while loop, for the first iteration I can know the ID of each process, however for the second and more iterations this ID changes or at least I can't find one property that seems to be the same for each process in all iterations. The relevant part of the code is as follows:I've tried with the following properties to properly ID the processes but it's not working for me:With this the output is:Any ideas how can I ID each process the same way every time?EDIT 1:I've simplified the program to this but the idea is the same:OUTPUT:
You are creating a new pool in each iteration of the loop, so processes in the pool are never re-used.Move  (and  and ) out of the while loop to re-use processes in the pool.
