I am trying to compare the time of an AWS EC2 instance object that is of type datetime with another datetime being represented as datetime.datetime.now. The line of code in question looks like, Where launchTime is of type datetime. However when I run it I get the error And I'm unsure of how to convert launchTime in such a way where I can successfully compare it. Edited fixed code below -----------------------------------------Full code as well in case any future people find it of value. It's Python 3 to stop EC2 instances that have been running for an "x" amount of time. In this case if an instance is running for five minutes. Terminate it. The lambda itself is set up with Cloudwatch to run every 4 minutes as well.
The main problem is that I'm assuming  is timezone aware, whereas  is not ().There are a couple ways to solve this, but the easiest would be to remove the tzinfo from :  should do the trick.Alternatively, you can convert your datetime objects to Unix timestamps and then you don't have to deal with timezone silliness.
Try like this, you have to make sure pytz installed :
