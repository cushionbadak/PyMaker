I am trying to print the output of a webscrape project into a CSV file.So for example I have this list of supplier names under a list called SUPP_NAME: (just an example, the actual list has 50 items inside it)and a list of numbers indicated years, under a list called SUPP_YEARS:My plan is to put them into a CSV, and then read them back in as a pandas dataframe, then perform decoding to get a bunch of values.Code so far:However, what I get is that under the  and  columns, one cell under each of these 2 columns is filled with a LONG list of items still contained in the list, instead of the items separated one by one. What am I doing wrong? Thanks in advance for answering.
The two  calls are giving you lists of items (hopefully both the same length). The idea is to then then extract an element from each and write this to your output file. Python has a useful function called  to do this. You give it both of your lists and the loop with give you an item from each on each iteration:The  object is designed to take a list of items and write them to your file with the desired (i.e. comma) delimiter automatically added between them.I assume you are using Python 3.x? If not you should change the following:
