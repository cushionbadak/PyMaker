I want to validate generated combinations only based on data with in "< >".I have an excel sheet consisting of all the possible combinations generated based on "<>" condition:   Below is the sample of that:I want to check if the generated combinations is valid or not.   For example: for the above list the original string before generating combinations is below:Kindly help me to find a generic method to validate all the powersets generated based on <>.To give a simple example:     I have the below list1.The list1 is all possible combination of:I want to check if the above list1 is valid or not
We can build the desired combinations using , which generates the Cartesian product of its iterable arguments. But first we need to split the input string up into its components. We can do that by first adding some extra spaces and then calling the  method.We can then transform each string in the list returned by  into a tuple. Items enclosed by  and  get transformed into a 2-tuple containing the item and the  string, all other items become 1-tuples. output
