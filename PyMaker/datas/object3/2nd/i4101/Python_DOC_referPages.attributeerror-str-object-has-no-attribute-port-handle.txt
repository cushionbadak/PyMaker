I want to communicate in Python using pySerial with a serial interface, but my problem is that I get this Error: "AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute '_port_handle'" when I start my program.Here is my code:I hope someone can help me, because everybody on the Internet has the same code to init the serial port.
Never call  directly. This is the constructor method, and is called implicitly when you construct an object.https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__init__Try:And if that does not work, check the signature of this  class. It's possible that the first parameter you give is not supposed to be a . But that should fix it.The doc to this  is there: https://pythonhosted.org/pyserial/pyserial_api.html#serial.Serial.__init__And it feels that your parameters are all tangled up. Try naming them in the constructor.
You don't need the init() method. You simple write serial.Serial(...). see here
