I'm trying to make some modifications to the  class. My plan was to make a child class and inherit most methods from the  class, like so:If I do this, I do not have access to the variables , ,  etc., which are part of the  method of : I noticed that these variables are not initialized in  class with the usual  in the  method. Perhaps this is why I can not access them from my child class? How can I access these variables , ,  etc?  
You can use inspect.getfullargspec to do this:Note that your code would only need to do this once, since the signature of the imported class won't change.
Why don't you just use the same arguments as the class you want to subclass?Else you could set some default yourself,
