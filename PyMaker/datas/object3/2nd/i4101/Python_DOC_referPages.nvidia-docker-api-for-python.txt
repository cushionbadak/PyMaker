I am currently running a lot of similar Docker containers which are created and run by a Python script via the official API. Since Docker natively doesn't support GPU mapping, I tested Nvidia-Docker, which fulfills my requirements, but I'm not sure how to integrate it seamlessly in my script.I tried to find the proper API calls for Nvidia-Docker using Google and the docs, but I didn't manage to find anything useful. My current code looks something like this: The documentation for the API can be found here.From Nvidia-Dockers Github page: The default runtime used by the DockerÂ® Engine is  runc, our runtime can become the default one by configuring the docker  daemon with --default-runtime=nvidia. Doing so will remove the need to  add the --runtime=nvidia argument to docker run. It is also the only  way to have GPU access during docker build.Basically, I want to add the --runtime=nvidia-docker argument to my create_container call, but there is no support for that as it seems.But since I need to switch between runtimes multiple times during the script execution (mixing Nvidia-Docker and native Docker containers) the quick and dirty way would be to run a bash command using subprocess but I feel like there has to be a better way.  TL;DR: I am looking for a way to run Nvidia-Docker containers from a Python script.
 and  methods have  parameter according to https://docker-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/containers.html Which has sense because  cli tool is pretty simple and every command translate in a call to the docker engine service REST API
