I'm new to Python and could really use some help on this. I want to create a function to filter which files I want to open and which months and day specifically. That way, the users need to input which city(files) they want to analyze on which particular month or day. However, I want the user to be able to input something that is not case sensitive. For example, the user can input 'chicago'/'CHICAGO"/"ChIcAgO" and the it still give you the right output and not the error handling message. Here is the code I use:
The best way to do so is just take the required input and convert it into the required case. Use the inbuilt functions of python or 
I am new too but I think you should look at string functions. Presuming you use python 3 since you use input and get no ValueError, you can just add .lover().title() after the parentheses of the inputExample:Should do the trick as like If you input cHIcaGO it will be converted to Chicago instantly.Hope it helps!Edit:(After correcting misspelling of lower() function tried it on webbrowser, pycharm and Python itself. Works just fine for me(I'm using python 2.7 so I corrected all inputs as raw_input,If you are using python 3 you don't have to change them. ).)
You should use  to remove case sensitivity. As per the docs, this is stricter than :str.casefold()Return a casefolded copy of the string. Casefolded strings may be used  for caseless matching.Casefolding is similar to lowercasing but more aggressive because it  is intended to remove all case distinctions in a string. For example,  the German lowercase letter 'ß' is equivalent to "ss". Since it is  already lowercase, lower() would do nothing to 'ß'; casefold()  converts it to "ss".For example:
