I am using Python and requests library. I just want to download an image to a numpy array for example and there are multiple questions where you can find different combinations (using opencv, PIL, requests, urllib...)None of them work for my case. I basically receive this error when I try to download the image:A simple example of my code can be:The main this that is driving me crazy is that, if I download the image to a file (using urllib), the whole process runs without any problem!What can I be doing wrong?EDIT:My mistake was finally related with URL formation and not with requests  or PIL library. My previous code example should work perfectly if the URL is correct.
I think you are using data from  object somehow before save them in  but requests response raw object is not seekable, you can read from it only once:First open is ok:Second open throws error (stream position is on the end of file already):You should save data from requests response in file-like object (or file of course) if you want to use them several times:Now you can read image stream and rewind it as many times as needed:
