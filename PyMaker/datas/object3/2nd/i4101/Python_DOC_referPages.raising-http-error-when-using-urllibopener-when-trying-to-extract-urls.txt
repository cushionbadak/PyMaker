I'm trying to build a script that scrapes Craigslist for a Mazda Miata. I'm getting an error with the function "extract_post_url" when it tries to request. Here is the tutorial that I'm trying to follow: https://github.com/vprusso/youtube_tutorials/blob/master/web_scraping_and_automation/selenium/craigstlist_scraper.pyHere's the code so far: Here's the error I am getting: Chrome opens up the right URL, but it's getting the error when I'm downloading the URL files. 
2 issues with this line:what type of string is f"blah" ?

If not - print the url instead of requesting it .
