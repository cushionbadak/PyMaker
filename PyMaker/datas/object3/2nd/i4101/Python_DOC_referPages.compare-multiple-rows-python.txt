You can use the csv module in python to get the data from a csv file like so:Using this comma-separated example.csv with your data, this program reads each row into a Dictionary for easy access as you can see in the ifs looking for the Start and End (). Then it fills the  and the  Dictionaries with their respective values. In the end those dictionaries will look like this:The one above is . Each column of numbers on the "Start" rows is neatly packed into a list. Then all you have to do is  and there's your average, neatly formatted into 2 decimal places using String.format.You can learn more about working with CSV files on the official documentation. And here is a handy guide for formatting strings!
