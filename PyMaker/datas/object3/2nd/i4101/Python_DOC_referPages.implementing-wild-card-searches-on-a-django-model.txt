I have a model called Host where I store all the information about all my servers. In the model I have a field .I would like for the user to be able to specify wildcard searches like:  where they'd get all the hosts with hostnames ending in  or where they'd get all the hosts with hostnames starting with and  and  and  and  and  and so forth.I have tried iterating over the results of  but I end up with confusing if/elif continue mess.  Does anyone know a more elegant way to handle wildcards?
Are you looking for  ?GivesYou still have to iterate, but have to handle a single one .
