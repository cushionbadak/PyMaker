Suppose I have following simplified files structure I have two copies of the , e.g.  and I want to compare both versions and get names of all files that differs (for example, get  in case its content was updated in )And I use below codeThe problem is that I will get  in case it was updated in , but I will never get  as it seem that comparison of files in  not performedIs there any possibility to compare folders recursively using filecmp and get names of files that differs or  is the only solution?
[Python]: filecmp - File and Directory Comparisons supports recursive traversing via . No need for  (or any other similar functions).code.py:Output (for a dir structure similar to yours):@EDIT0:Modified the  function to return the list of files, instead of printing them, as requested in one of the comments@EDIT1:Added generator functionality (as a personal exercise) which is the new (and preferred) style, and doesn't consume memory in case of huge dirs (!!requires Python3.3 or higher!!, or  statement can be replaced by the 2 commented ( and ) lines below it)
