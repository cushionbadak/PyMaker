I am developing a game with python 3.6, I want in its multiplayer version to send to the server objects modified by the client ( the player) I thought to serialize them for transfer. I use pygame and thus pygame.Surface in my objectsI have objects with this structure:When I serialize another object without pygame instance it's okBut with the object described above I get this error message:Do you have any idea how to transport these items to the server. Or bypass this pickle restriction?The same problem would arise if I wanted to save a part, so save these objects
Here is an example of what @IonicSolutions pointed to in the comments:To see what modes you can use to store the data as a string (here "RGB") look into the documentation
