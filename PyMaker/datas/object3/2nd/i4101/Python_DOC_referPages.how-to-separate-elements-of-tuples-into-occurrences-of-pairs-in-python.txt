I have a tuple that looks like:I need to rearrange it so I have a new tuple that will look like:Basically the new tuple takes pairs (of 2) from each element of the old tuple. But I am not sure how to get started. Thanks for your help. 
Try this out :You can also try another way. If the problem is reduced to do this for one tuple alone :Then this can be mapped for all the tuples Explanation :
Use a generator expression with  to pair and convert to a  at the end:
Here's what I came up with really quick
You can use this easy to understand code:Obviously it isn't very optimized like other answers but for an easy understanding it will  be perfect.That is something equivalent to:That is a generator expression, something quite similar to list comprehension (it use brackets instead of square brackets) and they basically do similar things, or at least in basic codes like this one. I still don't understand very well their differences but the generators are one-time fasters while the list comprehension are slower but reusable...Nevermind: the generator means:I know, make two generator/list expression/comprehension on the same line is strange. I always look at an answer like this one to remember how to do that.My old answer was:But I notice that adding a  to the  of the loop I can avoid that line, because I won't never get an out of index error.
