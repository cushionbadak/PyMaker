Natural Text
I have a seemingly simple problem, which I cannot seem to solve. Given a string containing a DOI, I need to remove the last character if it is a punctuation mark until the last character is letter or number. For example, if the string was:I want the following output:ie. remove I wrote the following script to do this:However, this produces  but I would like it to produce . Why is the  removed from the end? 
Corrected code: This gives the output you want, while keeping the original code mostly the same.
The string function  is designed to do exactly this:
This is one way using  and  with a generator expression utilizing  / .The default parameter is used so that, if no alphanumeric character is found, an empty string is returned.
If you dont wanna use regex:Removes the last character until it's no longer a punctuation character.
