Is there any alternative one liner for this simple code block:I tried:It takes an input, but gives the following error:My problem is a little bit different than this qs. That qs helped print items in a list whether I need print them in newline.
As Jon and Patrick mention, that's not an error, it's what happens when you print the  of a generator expression.So you just need to "splat" that generator. :)demo outputIn that demo I entered  at the  prompt.In the comments I wondered how the speed of  compares to . On my old 2GHz 32 bit single core machine, running Python 3.6.0,  is around 3 or 4 times faster than . Here's some  code.output
You should wrap the expression into  in order to have a .If you want to print the results line by line just use .
This is no error. Your statement inside the  is a generator expression - the string representation of it is printed - thats what you deemed an "error".You can convert it by feeding it into a list:or by iterating it:The last one will lead to an output (for ) of:as each result of the generator is passed to print and printed with the default  which you could change to  - see PM 2Ring's post
This prints each  on a separate line as your code does:
