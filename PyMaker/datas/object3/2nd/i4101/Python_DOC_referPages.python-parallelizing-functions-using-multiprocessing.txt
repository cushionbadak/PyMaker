I am new to python and using python 2.7.  I am writing a program to parse  raw re files . I have written a function which calls a file and puts every 4 line in a list . My file is big say 4 GB of raw dna data.Now how can i parallelize this function so that i can get speedup.Is there any way when i can run this function on 5 cores of my server?
As I mentioned in my comment above, you can likely gain a lot of speed just from optimizing your function. I suggest to try the following:If you do not need the return value to be a list, but are fine with an iterator, you can remove the . Then, quite likely the slowest part will be loading the data from disk, which you need to do anyway.
