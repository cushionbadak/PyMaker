Suppose you want to constrain a type variable to implement a certain interface. You might write something like so:Why is Python unhappy about this use of type constraints? PEP 484 and the Python source code are unhelpful in this regard.Note: in my particular case I am interested in constraining a type variable to implement an abstract base class, but the principle is the same.
You’re looking for :From the docs:a type variable may specify an upper bound using . This means that an actual type substituted (explicitly or implicitly) for the type variable must be a subclass of the boundary type, see PEP 484. means that the type has to be one of , so all instances of  would just be replaceable by  if  were allowed.You should be able to see the difference here (though I didn’t actually try it, heh):
