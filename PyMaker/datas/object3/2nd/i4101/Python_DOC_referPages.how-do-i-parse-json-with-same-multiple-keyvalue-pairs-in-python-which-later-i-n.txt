I need to parse the JSON file which looks like the same as in the example below. I need to add each properties values with other properties values to club everyone together like  with other properties  and so on. I need JSON file as an outcome with these added values-  together, p_tot together and so on. Please help me out as I am very new to Python. I am able to parse it through  and giving me  as well but when I go like  it converts it into  and even in  I am unable to get each properties keys-values, on which I apply .
