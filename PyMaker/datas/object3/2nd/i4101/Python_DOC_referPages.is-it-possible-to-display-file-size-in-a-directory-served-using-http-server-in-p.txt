I've served a directory using It works well, but it only shows file names. Is it possible to show created/modified dates and file size, like you see in ftp servers?I looked through the documentation for the module but couldn't find anything related to it. Thanks!
 is meant for dead-simple use cases, and to serve as sample code.1 That's why the docs link right to the source.That means that, by design, it doesn't have a lot of configuration settings; instead, you configure it by reading the source and choosing what methods you want to override, then building a subclass that does that.In this case, what you want to override is . You can see how the base-class version works, and write your own version that does other stuff—either use  instead of , or just call  on each file, and then work out how you want to cram the results into the custom-built HTML.Since there's little point in doing this except as a learning exercise, I won't give you complete code, but here's a skeleton:1. Although really, it's sample code for an obsolete and clunky way of building servers, so maybe that should be "to serve as sample code to understand legacy code that you probably won't ever need to look at but just in case…".
