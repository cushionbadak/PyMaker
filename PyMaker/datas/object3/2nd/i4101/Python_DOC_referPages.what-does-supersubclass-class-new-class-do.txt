In the following  implementation of the Singleton pattern:What does the line  do?  Among other things in this line that I don't understand is the  usage. I saw usage of  with , but here we pass it . So is it going to have  as arguments?Live example
The second argument to  is used for two purposes:To supply an ordered list of classes to search through; the order is the Method Resolution Order (MRO), and searching for attributes on  starts at the class following the one named as the first argument to To bind any descriptors (like methods) to.So  will look for a  list, then search for , then continue searching the remainder of the list for the attribute you wanted. It then uses the descriptor protocol to bind the object to .The  method only makes sense on a class, because it creates a new instance; there is no instance yet when that method is called; it is the factory that is supposed to produce the instance for that class.So you can't pass in an instance as the second argument. You can only pass in a class, and  can handle that. For instances,  looks at , but for classes,  is used instead. So passing in  is perfectly fine here. is also a static method, meaning that it ignores the binding process. No automatic passing in of the first argument, the class, takes place. You need to do this manually, hence the  call.So in this specific instance, the line:will search for  in , find the next object with a  attribute, and then try to bind that  attribute to . If you didn't use multiple inheritance, that is going to be . The  method is static, so no binding takes place, so you are given , which is then called with  as the first argument. This produces an instance of the  class (or a subclass thereof), which is then assigned to the attribute  on the class object.
