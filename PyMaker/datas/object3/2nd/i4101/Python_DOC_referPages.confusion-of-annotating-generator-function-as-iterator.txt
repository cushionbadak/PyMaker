In the python typing documentation it is written:Alternatively, annotate your generator as having a return type of either Iterable[YieldType] or Iterator[YieldType]:I wrote a very easy example of printing an infinite stream. I have a generator function which is passed to another function and then called.With mypy i get two errors:error:Iterator[int] not callableerror:Argument 1 to "print_infinite_stream" has incompatible type "Callable[[int], Iterator[int]]"; expected "Iterator[int]"I am confused why i am getting these errors as i worked according to the documentation and have the latest python (3.6.5) and mypy (0.590) installed. What is wrong here?   
annotate your generator as having a return type of either Iterable[YieldType] or Iterator[YieldType]Generator functions return generators, they are not generators themselves. If you do:, you will get something like .What you want is the return value of the function, the actual iterator.This makes more sense as now  handles any iterator, not just your generator function. If you  you should get something like , which is exactly what you want.
