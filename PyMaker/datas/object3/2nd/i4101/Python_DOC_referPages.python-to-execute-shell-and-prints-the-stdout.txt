An alternative way that could be faster on large outputs, or when streaming output is to consider itertoolsThis will keep feeding characters into the join function until it finds a newline character, or the end of the output.It's worth noting that this specific implementation of the solution will only work with the first line of the output - so adjust accordingly.
