Can any one help me with the below:I am trying to pass the literal input, example if I enter 10 the function should be passed with int, but in below case its still passing string. Can anyone please edit this for the code to pass as is entered type?

However, you can get around this by using a  block to attempt to cast to a particular type, and if no error is raised, you know a valid type for what the string contains.Sample runs:
