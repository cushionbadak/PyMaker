This question already has an answer here:Python: frozensets comparison                    1 answer                Python: See if one set contains another entirely?                    7 answers                How do comparison operators work? I thought they could be used only to compare numeric values, 5 <= 8, etc. But in this code sets are compared:I thought that it is impossible to do. , you know literally is, e. g. . Does an operator implicitly call  on such objects to find some numeric values to compare?How does it know that one sequence is bigger, less or equal etc. to another?
Python supports operator overloading, which means that any class can implement methods that provide access to the standard operators.For full documentation of what you can do in Python, including which methods a class can implement to support different operators, check out the Python data model.For a description of how a built-in type like  implements its operators, see that type's documentation. For example, documentation for the set type.
From the Python manual:       Test whether every element in the set is in other.There are a variety of magic methods you can implement if you want to overload operators for your own classes. When you call  Python defers to  if such a method exists.
