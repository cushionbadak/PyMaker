Currently, I have the following code using  and :The first two lines are fine, but I'm not very happy that I have to store the  on my harddisk just in order to load it again in the next line.Is there a way to set up a temporary filesystem that is forgotten as soon as the program ends? (On a Mac)
Hope this might help you.
