I have a bash script file called g2p which runs as following:Now I am writing a python script using python 2.6, I need to run this bash script( g2p) inside python.I checked this answer:Python: subprocess and running a bash script with multiple argumentsI wrote:my problem is how to send standard input to g2p (bash script) inside python code, and also I get a bit confused about pass value to @g2pumap argument.
The restriction to Python2.6 was added to the question later on. A portable solution is at the end of this answer.Since Python 3.5,  should match most "call program with X" use cases. It's  parameter does what you want:The  argument is passed to [...] the subprocessâ€™s stdin.You can feed it a bytes string directly:This is equivalent to your bash call. Note that you must add appropriate newlines ( at the end) by yourself. Any arguments, such as , can be passed in without escaping.If you want to have the Exception of , use  afterwards.If you are stuck with an older version or need backwards compatibility, using a bare  is the most portable. The following should handle your use case:Note that you can also capture stdout and stderr if you need to. Use  and/or  in the call to . Doing so lets  return a meaningful tuple of .See the  method docs on how to work with such an object. It is usually a good idea to check its , or  dangling processes. You can also replicate  if you feel like it, since it does proper error handling.
