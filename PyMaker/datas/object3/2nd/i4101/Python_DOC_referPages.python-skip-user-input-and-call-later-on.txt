I'm fairly new to Python and am currently just learning by making some scripts to use at work. Real simple, just takes user input and stores it in a string to be called later on. The questions are yes/no answers but I wish for the user to have the option to skip and for the question to be asked again at the end, how would I do this?Currently this is what I've got:then at the end of the script after all the questions have been asked I have this:I understand this is very messy and I'm just looking for guidance/help. Regards,Trap.
Since you're rather new to Python I'll give you some tips:Store all the questions which receive "skip" as a response into a list.At the end of all your questions, iterate through (hint: "for" loop) all the questions which the user skipped and asked them again.
