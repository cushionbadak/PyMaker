You could wrap your current data with a class that could provide the specialized update methods you specified, without changing the entire structure of your original data to begin with:Output:
Change your data structure, if  is a key then simply:would allow you to do:
If you need to access those dicts by player name, it is better that you adapt the format of your data to this need.E.g.:Now you can youse  as in your example:
In my opinion, a list of dictionaries is inefficient and not a recommended solution to hold structured data of this kind.You can use  from the standard library, but I prefer 3rd party library , which accepts a list of dictionaries directly:You can then perform manipulations using the  API:
You can make new structure data for that.e.g.
