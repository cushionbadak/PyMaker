I have this code: where  contains the time,  contains the volume , contains the opens,  contains the close, contains the low,  contains the highAnd actually I would like to make easier this defining r like this: But I don't know how to do this in Python.
you can work with pandas:output:
You want to "reduce" your data here. You could use  here, but it probably would be easier to just write your own function. Something that cycles over each result and appends it to the relevant column.You could probably also automate this a little bit more by describing the mappings.But to me that looks less clear, just saves repetition.
If I understand correctly, you don't know what how to loop over the dictionary or list in the parsed JSON
