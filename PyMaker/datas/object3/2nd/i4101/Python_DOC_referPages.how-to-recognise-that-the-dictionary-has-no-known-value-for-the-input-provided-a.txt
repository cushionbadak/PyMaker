I am using a Python dictionary to read DNA bases into codons however want the program to recognise if nonsense is inputted into this. Currently all that happens is there is a key error when using something like "codon += cod[F[x]]"Is there a way to search the string of bases (AGCTATATCAT) (for example) for strings not found in the dictionary? For example if other characters that aren't ACGT were in it how would I detect this? Thanks
You can check if all characters in a string are in a given  by doing the following:
A quick way to validate that every char in a string is a valid base is to use the  method. Eg,outputIf you wish to identify the illegal chars, you can use set difference:output
