Natural Text
I am new to coding and I need some help. I'm trying to randomize these rooms or 'scenes' in a text adventure but whenever I try to randomize it they don't even show up when I run it! Here is the script:
You need to call the method on the class returned by . It would help if each class had the description printing method named the same.
Somehow you have the syntax the wrong way round. You create a dictionary with -instances as keys and  as values. If you want to call functions/classes randomized you have to assign a variablename to each function, randomize the order of these names and call the returned function by applying () to it. If you want to use classes or functions as values of your dict, does not really matter - for classes you would also somehow have to store which method to call (or simply print the class and code a working str() for it). My example uses functions directly:  Output:Link to docu for random.shuffle()Why using classes here would benefit your code is not clear to me...
