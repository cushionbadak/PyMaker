I'm trying to figure out why I can't simply get and set the python path through its C API. I am using Python3.6, on Ubuntu 17.10 with gcc version 7.2.0. Compiling with:gcc pytest.c `python3-config --libs` `python3-config --includes`Setting the path works fine, unless I also try to get the path prior to doing so. If I get the path at all, even just to print without modifying the returned value or anything, I get a "double free or corruption" error. Very confused. Am I doing something wrong or is this a bug? Anyone know a workaround if so?Edit: Also errors after calling . Updated code. Now errors even if I don't call Py_GetPath() first.
[the below answer refers to this version of the question.]From the docs:Initialize the Python interpreter. In an application embedding Python, this should be called before using any other Python/C API functions; with the exception of ,  and .But the code you show does call  before it calls , which it per the above paragraph implicitly should not.
From alk it seems related to this bug: https://bugs.python.org/issue31532Here is the workaround I am using. Since you can't call  before , and also seemingly you can't call  after , you can add to or get the path like this after calling :
