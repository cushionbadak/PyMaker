Some of my api views have something like this:Ideally I don't want to log in every piece of code like this but use a general exception handler that catches APIException, so I changed my code to:exception_handler.pyMy problem is the exc in the handler isn't the keyerror but the apiexception, can I somehow get the KeyError from sys.exc_info or stacktrace? 
The good practice is to raise your own exception (here it is ) and attach the original exception.You can take a look at six.raise_from (if you want a Python 2/3 compatible solution):Raise an exception from a context. On Python 3, this is equivalent to . On Python 2, which does not support exception chaining, it is equivalent to raise exc_value.You can also create your own exception class which can do the chaining.Of course, instead of printing/logging your APIException error message you can log your original message:Edit: Use class hierarchy for exceptionsBut, if  is part of your API, itâ€™s a better practice to do the exception handling inside this function and throw your own exception which can inherit . This solution is the best, IMO. 
Since you are using Python 3, you can simply raise the :Then in your exception handler, if  is the , you can access the original exception with .The  is not actually needed to be able to access , but it makes it clear that the  was converted to , rather than  being raised during the handling of .See the exception docs for more info.
