so i have a list of pointswith a starting point ofnow what i am trying to do it is get the closest point to my starting point, then the closest point to that point and so on. So i get to calculate distancebut again, i'm trying to get the closest to my starting point, then the closest point to that one and so on.ok, because you are complaing i didn't show enough code?so i get passing my starting point I getSo now i need to use 2.5, 3.6 as my starting point and find the next closest and so onHas anyone done anything similar?
A possibility is to use a breadth-first search to scan all elements, and find the closest point for each element popped off the queue:Output:The result is the listing of closest points, as determined by using .
You can try the following code. Much simpler and short. Uses a comparator to sort the list depending on the distance from the starting point 
You can simply sort a list by a key you define as you wish - f.e. by your distance function:Output:
