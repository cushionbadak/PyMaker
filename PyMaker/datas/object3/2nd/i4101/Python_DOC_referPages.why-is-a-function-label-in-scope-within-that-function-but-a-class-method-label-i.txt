 can refer it itself if  is a global function.However, it seems that a class method cannot refer to itself:The exception raised is a :Why is this?Is it because  is in  whereas  is in ?functions can refer to variables outside of themselves, such as:Is the error caused because  has access to the names  and , but not ?
 is a global name,  is not. Methods are an attribute on the class object, which is available as a global:In the  body (suite) itself,  is a local name; at the end of the  statement all locals are taken to form the class body; once the class is created, the local names are no longer available.From the Class definitions section of the Python reference documentation:The class’s suite is then executed in a new execution frame [...], using a newly created local namespace and the original global namespace. (Usually, the suite contains mostly function definitions.) When the class’s suite finishes execution, its execution frame is discarded but its local namespace is saved. A class object is then created using the inheritance list for the base classes and the saved local namespace for the attribute dictionary.So in your code, the line  is analogous to accessing locals in a function body. Just like  is not available outside of the  function scope,  is not available outside of the namespace available during class creation.The  suite can otherwise refer to globals just fine, as can methods:
