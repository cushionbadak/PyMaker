I'm trying to implement mergesort. I have a working merge subfunction that works on sorted lists, and just need to manage the merging of all the lists properly.The function works fine until it's down to the last two lists. It prints 'ayyy', which means it made it into the first elif statement, then does nothing else. The program doesn't terminate, it just spins its wheels. Debugger shows that the value of  isn't updated either.
You only have one small error, because you don't deal with equal elements in . Here is a small fix:
I couldn't resist the temptation to rewrite  using iterators, in a fashion that doesn't mutate the argument lists. Clearly this could be unified by treating the lists equally. This particular version prefers placing items from the first list first.Note that  is the most expensive item deletion operation; it moves all entries except the first. deques support a more efficient popleft method (but are more costly when you create many small instances, and the mergesort does).
