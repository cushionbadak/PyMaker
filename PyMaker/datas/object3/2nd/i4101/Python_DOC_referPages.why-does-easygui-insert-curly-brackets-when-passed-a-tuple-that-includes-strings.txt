Natural Text
Easygui inserts curly brackets when we try to break the text is there a way to break the text without it giving the curly brackets.
How to fix this? assumes its  to be a string, like , but you are passing it a tuple, a sequence of objects like .You can fix the problem by passing a string to .  Your output is a string with embedded variable values, so this is good case for using a format string.  A format string is a string that contains placeholders - usually curly bracket pairs  - that you can replace with variable values.Change this line:to:And it should work.Why is this happening? assumes its  to be a string, but doesn't actually check that this is true before passing  to the code that creates the GUI elements.  As it happens, the default GUI provider is Python's tkinter package, and tkinter ultimately relies on code written in another language, tcl, to render GUI elements on screen.tcl generally treats all variables as strings.  Given a tuple like tcl needs to be able to recognise that the three strings that make up  belong together.  The way to do this in tcl is to wrap (or "quote") the string with curly brackets.  This is why you see the curly brackets in your message box when you pass it the  tuple.
