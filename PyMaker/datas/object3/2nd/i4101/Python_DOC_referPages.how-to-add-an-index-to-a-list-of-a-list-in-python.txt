I want to sort a List within a List that i currently have which isnt the issue, its that I believe I have saved the values as a single index in the array, but need the finishTime to be a seperate index as I would need to sort the arrays by this value. The context of this code is a simple Athlete race data entry form.The code is belowIt should look like thisAs you can see they should be two different indexes so that I can then sort the lists within the list by the number on the end.
First use a proper data structure - this: is mixing data (the ,  and  values) with presentation stuff, and is barely usable. Either just store the values ie:you know that for each "row" in ,  is the gender,  is the name and  the time.or use dicts if you want something more explicit:so for each row you can get the values by key instead of index:Then you very certainly want to make  an integer -  returns a string, and string don't sort the same way as integers:Then you only have to pass the proper  callback function to . If you use tuples:If you use dicts:
Using your list of lists, use either  to sort the list in place or  to get a new sorted list. Use the  argument to either function to sort on the last element of the list. If you need the items sorted from largest finish time to shortest, set :this will sort the list based on the numeric floating point value of the last item of each nested list. You might prefer to use s instead of s to avoid any loss of precision, particularly if you need to perform calculations on the times.I think, however, that you'd be better off using a dictionary, named tuple, or even an ordinary tuple instead of the inner list. Here's an example using a dictionary:
