You need to parse your string first to find out which  substrings are inside a tag, and which aren't. I have done this below with re.split.My use of re.split returns a list of substrings surrounding the regex pattern , and because I enclose the pattern in parentheses, the tags are included in the list as well. In this use of re.split, the non-tags will always have an even index, and the tags will always have an odd index. So I check if the index is even, and if so I replace  with .This will work as long as you don't have tags nested inside other tags.
