I would like to give slice string as argument, see belowIt works fine with positive index, e.g., ,  (which gives rise to ) is also fine, but errors out with negative index as first parameter, e.g., How should I support negative index as first slice parameter?
Fortunately,  by default does understand the  tokenThe reason why  works directly as one might expect is due to  having implemented some heuristics, which are detailed in the linked documentation (basically  looks like a number,  does not).This issue is caused essentially by argparse treating all  (by default) as flags.  This can be redefined using .
