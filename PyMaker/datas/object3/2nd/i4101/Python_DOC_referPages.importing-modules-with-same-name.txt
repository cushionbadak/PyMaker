Basically, I have two python projects, one is located under  and the other . I'm currently developing the  module and want to import functions from  using .My folder structure is as shown bellow:I structured my project following this answer.My  is basically as bellow:I activated my  and installed the screening project by navigating to  (same directory as ) and ran .Finally, both  and  are such as bellow:When I run  or  I get:This error makes sense if I'm running  because local  existis and might be overwriting the installed  that contains the  modules.Is there a way to import stuff from  using ?!
So, after some more research I found this similar (in a way) question that leads to import python modules with the same name and How do I create a namespace package in Python?.The answer for "importing modules with same name" is not useful since it says to rename one module or turn the project directory into a package.The other question is exactly what I want. It basically talks about the  with which you can 'append' modules to a given namespace.I understand and share some opinions against this technique for some cases (such as this) but since it's presented here sometimes you want separated structures so you don't patch everything togheter even when you don't want everything
