Is there any way to remove a directory and itâ€™s contents in the PathLib module? With  it only removes a file, with  the directory has to be empty. Is there no way to do it in one function call? 
As you already know, the only two  methods for removing files/directories are  and  and both doesn't do what you wanted.Pathlib is a module to that provides object oriented paths across different OS's, it isn't meant to have lots of diverse methods. The aim of this library is to provide a simple hierarchy of classes to  handle filesystem paths and the common operations users do over them.The "uncommon" file system alterations, such as recursively removing a directory, is stored in different modules. If you want to recursively remove a directory, you should use the  module. (It works with  instances too!)
If you don't mind using a third-party library give path.py a try.Its API is similar to , but provides some additional methods, including  to recursively delete a directory tree.
