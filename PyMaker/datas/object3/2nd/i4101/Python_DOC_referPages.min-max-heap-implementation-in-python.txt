This uses a comparator to reverse the sequence of storage in the MaxHeapThe MinHeap seems to work fine, however the MaxHeap throw up the following error.I don't quite seem to understand what am I doing wrong here. Can someone help me with this.
I've added  and  methods to your  class, so the code now runs, and the  instances display their  when printed.The important thing is to get those comparison methods to do the comparisons correctly between two  instances.You'll notice that I've eliminated most of the methods from . They aren't needed because the methods inherited from  work ok. You may wish to restore this one to depending on how you intend to use .outputIt's probably a Good Idea to give  the full set of rich comparison methods. They aren't needed to make the above code work, but they will make the  instances more flexible. So in case you want them, here they are:
