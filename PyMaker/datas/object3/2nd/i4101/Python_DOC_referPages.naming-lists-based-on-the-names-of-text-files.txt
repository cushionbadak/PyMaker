Natural Text
I'm trying to write a function which takes word lists from text files and appends each word in the file to a list, with the same name as the text file. For instance, using the text files  and  would result in all the words in  being in a  list and all the nouns in a list. I'm trying to do it in a  loop:Of course, I could do it easily once for each text file:but I'd like my function to do it automatically with each one. Is there a way to do this, or should I just stick with a for loop for each file?
You should use a  for that like (untested):also you don't need the list comprehension, you can just do:
You can create new variables with custom names by manipulating the  dictionary, which is where local variables are stored. But it is hard to imagine any case where this would be a good idea. I strongly recommend Stephen Roachâ€™s suggestion of using a dictionary, which will let you keep track of the lists more neatly. But if you really want to create local variables for each file, you can use a slight variation on his code:
