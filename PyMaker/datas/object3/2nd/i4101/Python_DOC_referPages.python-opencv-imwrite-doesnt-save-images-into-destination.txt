I am trying to resize all images in my samples folder and then save all the images back in the test folder. The code below resize the images but it doesn't save them into the destination folder "test". I fail to understand what is the problem and I have referred to all documentation and nothing can help me understand what goes wrong here.The script can read the images and resize them successfully, the only part is imwrite doesn't function as expected.
May be the special character. Try to change the name of the image.I don't have reputation to add this idea as comment. I'm Sorry.
