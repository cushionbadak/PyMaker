The code isn't mine, and it seems that the nested for loop is iterating over a list of regular files, so the loop wouldn't know anything about the directory to which each element belongs.Current output isDesired output isThe implementation isAdditionally, I'm new to the community so any concise input on how to improve my question asking would be greatly appreciated.
If you put  in a shell, you will see:For each directory in the directory tree rooted at top (including top  itself, but excluding '.' and '..'), yields a 3-tupledirpath is a string, the path to the directory.  dirnames is a list of  the names of the subdirectories in dirpath (excluding '.' and '..').  filenames is a list of the names of the non-directory files in  dirpath. Note that the names in the lists are just names, with no path  components.So you need:It's pretty annoying.
