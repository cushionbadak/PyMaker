Simple question - I want a loop that counts up and returns to 0 when it reaches a certain number.Tried something like:My Python actually crashed when I tried the above.EDIT: Yes, the  condition is never met - it still crashes when I change it to  though.
The problem is the i-=1 line. Your code works as i counts up to 6, but when it reaches 6, it is incremented to 7, and then subtracted down to 6 again. Your current sequence is 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,6,6,6,...
If you want to count up to 7 then count down to 0 here is what you can try:
This is your corrected code,It reaches 0 on reaching 6.Lot's of syntax Error fixed.
