I have a method that reaches out to an external API and pulls in some content, then it performs some logic and proceeds. The problem is, while testing, I don't want my test cases to trigger this external API but I do want it to mock the response. ExampleBut  reaches out to an API that I want to mock. I know I can mock instances if it's like this:But how do I handle cases where the class is instantiated in a method that I end up calling to test? 
If you had a python module  that had this:You would mock it out this way in It is a best practice in unit testing to mock out all external services somehow so you're testing the unit, ie the function being tested, and nothing else.Another way to do this is to use the  functionality in the standard unit testing library.https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#attaching-mocks-as-attributes
