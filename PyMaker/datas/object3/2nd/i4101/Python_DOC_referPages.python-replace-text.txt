Natural Text
Hello I have trouble with replacing all texts from HTML. I wanted to make a censure with BeautifulSoup but it doesn't replace a content and I got error when I print contents (not all texts from HTML were printed)Anyone know how to fix it?Error :
You have two major issues here.  The first is an encoding issue, where you are trying to print a non-printable character. For that you can use answers found in:UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode - character maps to <undefined>, print function Or, for a more in depth explanation:Python, Unicode, and the Windows console (Now that I look at this more it's probably outdated, but still an interesting read).However, you also have a logic problem with your code.This line doesn't check if  is found in words, but instead compares  to a list of words, which isn't what you want.  I would recommend making the following changes:Converting  to a  allows for average  lookup, and using  checks if  is found in words.
It looks like one of the characters you are trying to print is not found in the codec python uses to print messages. I.e. you have the data for a character but you don't know what symbol it should be and so you can't print it. A simple conversion of the HTML to a unicode format should solve your problem.Good question on how to do that:Convert HTML entities to Unicode and vice versa
