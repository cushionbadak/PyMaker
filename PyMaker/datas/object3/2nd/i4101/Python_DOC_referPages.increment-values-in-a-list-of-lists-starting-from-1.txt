I have a list of lists e.g My desired output is That is, I wish to modify the list such that if the value is not zero, I set it to the count, which starts at 1 and increments by 1 for each non-zero value. If it's 0, I keep it as 0. How do I go about this? I started by indexing using  but it's harder than I thought.Here is what I have done:  generates the initial list. This is not my full code because it is too long to post.Thank you
This would also work, probably more pythonic and shorter, using a list-comprehension:Learn more about how  works here, meanwhile here is a small snippet for a better understanding:
I think you're over-complicating this. If either elem is 0, you don't need to touch it. If it's something else, increment the count and stick it in the right place.Output:
If your sublists are two element you can get rid of enumerateFor longer or variable sublists you may use either enumerate, map or list comprehension
