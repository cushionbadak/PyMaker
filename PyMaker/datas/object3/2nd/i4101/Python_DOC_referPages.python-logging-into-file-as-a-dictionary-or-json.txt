I am trying to set up logging where I can log in both stdout and on to a file. This i have accomplished using the following code: The output of this something like this:What I am trying to accomplish is logging this output to a file not as it is printing to stdout, but as a dictionary or JSON object similar to something like this (while keeping the stdout as it is at the moment):Is this doable? I understand that I can post process this log file after my process is finished, but I am looking for a more elegant solution because certain things i am logging are quite big objects themselves. 
So based on @abarnert, i found this Link which provided a good path to making this concept work for the most part. The code as it stands is:Although it does not fully meet the requirement, it doesnt require any pre processing, and allows me to create two log handlers. Afterwards, i can use something like: to pull  objects instead of fighting with improperly formatted JSON to accomplish what i had set out to accomplish. Still am hoping for a more elegant solution. 
The cookbook specifically shows how to format for structured logging, here in the section entitled Implementing Structured Logging.The other bits (multiple handlers), you already know.
