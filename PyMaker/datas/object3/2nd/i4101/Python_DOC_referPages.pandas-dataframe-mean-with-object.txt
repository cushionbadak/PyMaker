I have a dataframe with 2 column nbr and tag. Nbr contain integer and tag contain Tag object. And I want to get the mean of all the tag object (using value attribute, and the result is a new Tag with that value).For  I had the add a the  method to the Tag class.Example:But for  I get this error .Pandas first try to convert the object to float: , then if it fail it try this: . My question is their a way to make  or  return the value attribute by adding a method to my Tag class like I did with ? Thanks in advance.
Looking at the source code, it seems like Pandas's mean coerces the results to a numeric type. You can get close by adding the special  method to :Once you do so, you getNote that this doesn't do exactly what you wanted (it doesn't create a  with value 5.0 - Pandas wants the result to be a numeric type).
