I'm using similar approach to call python function from my shell script:But I don't know how in this case I can pass arguments to python script and also is it possible to call function with parameters from command line? 
orThere's also argparse (py3 link) that could be used to capture arguments, such as the  which also can be found at .A second library do exist but is discuraged, called .
You don't want to do that in shell script.Try this. Create a file named "hello.py" and put the following code in the file (assuming you are on unix system):and in your shell script, write something lke thisand you should see  in the terminal.That's how you should invoke a script in shell/bash.To the main question: how do you pass arguments?Take this simple example:We expect the len of the argument to be at least two. Like shell programming, the first one (index 0) is always the file name.Now modify the shell script to include the second argument (name) and see what happen.haven't tested my code yet but conceptually that's how you should go aboutedit: If you just have a line or two simple python code, sure,  works fine and is neat. But if you need more complex logic, please put the code into a module (.py file).
You need to create one .py file.And after you call it this way : And after in your file, you have sys.argv list, who give you list of argvs.
