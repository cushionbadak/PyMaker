I sometimes want an object to be treated as a number. This is what I do:Explicit casting works:However, automatic (implicit) casting doesn't work    Is there a way to perform automatic casting in Python. How bad is this idea?UPDATE @BrenBarn has pointed me to the "emulating numeric types" section in Python documentation. Indeed, it is possible to define every possible operator, which gives a lot of flexibility, but is also very verbose. It seems that automatic implicit casting is possible only if one defines all the relevant operators. Is there a way to make this less verbose?
As @BrenBarn said, you can use inheritance:It will be not so verbose.
This is not the way Python thinks about objects. There is little value coming casting  to a float because Python usually doesn't care what an object is but how an object behaves. You should implement the custom comparison functions like  and . See here. This will also be handy.The solution may look something like
