I wrote this recursive function that returns the largest value in a list of integers:The call  returns , but calling the function on a longer list:results in infinite recursion.  Why?
It isn't infinitely recursive, but you are doing the same recursive call twice when you don't need to.  Seems to complete quickly enough with the following change:This isn't just a matter of calling the function recursively twice as many times, I'm not sure on the exact growth rate but it seems be exponential since each extra recursive call will be making more extra recursive calls.
