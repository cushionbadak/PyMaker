Novice to threading here. I'm borrowing a lot of the code from this thread while trying to build my first script using threading/queue:In this case the job_list is a list of URLs. I've found that this code works fine when this list is equal to or less than 50, but it hangs when > 50. There must be something I'm fundamentally not understanding about how threading works?
Your problem is this line:If  has more than 50 elements, then you try to read more results from your queue than you have put in. Therefore:or, even better:[EDIT]It seems you want your program to do something different than what it does. Your program takes the first 50 entries in , handles each of these in a thread and disregards all other jobs. From your comment below I assume you want to handle all jobs, but only 50 at a time. For this, you should use a thread pool. In Python >= 3.2 you could use  [link].In Python < 3.2 you have to roll your own:(untested)[/EDIT]
