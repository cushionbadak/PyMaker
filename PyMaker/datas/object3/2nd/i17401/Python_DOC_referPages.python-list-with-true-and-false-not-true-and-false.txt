-----------------------  UPDATED  ---------------------- Since there was so much confusion, I decided to give a more detailed explanation. Take a look at the code below, and focus on Here is the code:When I print dict, I get the following but my boss wants this this doesn't work eitherDoes this make more sense? Is it possible to get as a value? I tried doing thisbut it crashes. I'm out of ideas. I've tried googling a variety of things, and I can't seem to find anything. Your help is greatly appreciated. I honestly don't believe this is possible, but that's what I've been told to do.NOTE: They have to be lowercase. This doesn't work
It's possible to get what your boss wants, just not using the built-in True and False:Result:You don't actually need , but (in Python 3) it allows the objects to be used in logical conditions.So as requested, it's not a valid Python literal since it uses  instead of ,  and it's not valid JSON since it uses single-quoted key strings instead of double-quoted. Presumably it's parsed by something that doesn't accept  and also doesn't accept double-quoted strings? I don't suppose there's any chance of just fixing the original API to accept JSON?
This is JSON, so you should just convert your week into JSON formatTo convert back, just load and parse it:
You can use the  module to convert your boolean list to a string and reciprocally:
Your value is Which is JSON representation. Second value is Which is List with "true" and "false" strings.Which is pure python code.You have to decide which value you have and which way you have to select to convert it in which form. For first value you can use .For second value you have to check manually string for "true" and "false"Third is python only so no need to change it in python again :).
