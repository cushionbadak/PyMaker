This question already has an answer here:Transpose/Unzip Function (inverse of zip)?                    12 answers                I have a list of many 2-tuples. I would like to split the list into two lists, one list consisting of the first elements of all the tuples in the list, and the other list consisting of the second elements of all the tuples. I wonder how to do that efficiently? Thanks!For example, I have a list :I hope to get two lists  and .
is all you need ... or if you need them as lists and not tuples
Use  and a list comprehension:
zip with  argument unpacking will give you tuples:If you need lists, you can use map on that:
try this:
One way to do it is first convert the list into a temp dictionary, then assign the keys & values of the temp dictionary into two lists
l1    ['ab', 'cd', 'ef']l2    [1, 2, 3]Appending each value into another
