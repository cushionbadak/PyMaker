I've got a list like so:I'd like to perform an operation to each of the inner values - say concatenation, converting to an  and incrementing, etc.How can I do this for all of the list items; given that this is a multi-dimensional list?
You can use list comprehension (nested list comprehension):BTW, why do you use lists of strings?I'd rather use a list of numbers (No need to convert to , back to ).

We can use eval function here. About eval()  What does Python's eval() do? 
If list comprehension scares you, you can use sub-indexing. For example, is a list of lists, therefore you need to access the subindex of 0 (the first item) before you add to it. , for example, is the first item in the first sublist. Moreover, each of your subitems is a string, not an integer or float. The  function makes the proper conversion so that we can add 1, and the outer  function converts the final answer back to a string.
