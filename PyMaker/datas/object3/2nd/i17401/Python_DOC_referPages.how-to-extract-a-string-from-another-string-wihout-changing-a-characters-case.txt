There are two variables. A variable drive was assigned a drive path (string). A variable filepath was assigned a complete path to a file (string).First I need to find if a string stored in a drive variable is in a string stored in filepath variable. If it is then I need to extract a string stored in drive variable from a string stored in a filepath variable without changing both variables characters case (no changing to lower or uppercase. The character case should stay the same).So a final result should be:I could get it done with:But approach like this messes up the letter case (everything is now lowercase)Please advise, thanks in advance!EDITED LATER:I coould be using my own approach. It appear IF portion of the statementis case-sensitive. And drive in filepath will return False if case doesn't match.So it would make sense to lower()-case everything while comparing. But a .split() method splits beautiful regardless of the letter-cases:
