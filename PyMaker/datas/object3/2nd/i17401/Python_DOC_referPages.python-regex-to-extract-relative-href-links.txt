Natural Text
I have an html file having tons of relative href links like;There are tons of other http and ftp links in the file,I need an output txt file;I tried to write my own but it takes too long for me to get used to Python regex.I can open the source file, apply a specific regex which I couldn't figure out yet, and write it back to the disk.I need your help on the regex side.Thanks.

I know it's not exactly what you asked for, but I thought I would show a way of converting the dates from your link text into the format you show in your example of desired output(dd/mm/yy). I used BeautifulSoup to read elements from the html.names and dates use list comprehensionsstrptime creates datetime objects out of the date stringsstrftime reformats the date into the format in your example:then write the entries in  to a fileFor info on the methods I used such as  and  in the code above, I recommend you look at the  docs via the link at the top. Hope this helps.
