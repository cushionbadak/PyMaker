In Python 3.3 I need to convert an integer into the middle of three bytes to send it over a serial connection. That is, I need to have a value of: , except that the \x00 byte will need to take the single-byte value of an integer variable that may vary from 0 to 255. I thought chr(value) would work, but that gives a string rather than a byte. For example, if value is 255, I want to get .
Using :You can also use  in place of . But using  does not work in Python 2.x.
