This question already has an answer here:What is the difference between re.search and re.match?                    8 answers                I am very new to regex and learning by practice. I wrote the following regex for finding a number inside a string of characters, however, it returns nothing. Why is that? Regards
 must match from the beginning of the string.Use  instead.
 matches from the start of the string. Use P.S semicolons are not necessary.
