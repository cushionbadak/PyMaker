I wouldn't recommend doing this in your tests unless you're sure you need to; it'll make for hard-to-maintain tests. I'd suggest that your code needs refactoring - consider changing your function to return a string, which clients can print (or write to a file, or display on a GUI, or...) at their leisure.
