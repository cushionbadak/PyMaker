Using python and bash, I'd like to accomplish two things:Need to split an ipv6 address and port combination in the format [fec2::10]:80 to fec2::10 and 80.Given an IP address and port combination, I need to determine if the IP is a v4 or v6 address. Eg: 1.2.3.4:80 and [fec2::10]:80Please suggest a way to do it.Thanks!Sample code:This works for all cases except when the input is specified without a port. Eg: 10.78.49.50 and [fec2::10]Any suggestions to address this?
Assuming  is like  or , it is easy to split the port and find out the ip address:
You can use  (called  in 3.x) to separate the URL into each of its components:Then you can split the port off by finding the index of the last colon using :Identifying which type it is should then be as simple as , right? (Not 100% sure because it's been a while since I learned about how to write IPv6 addresses in URLs.)Finally, removing the brackets from your IPv6 address is simple, there are many ways to do it:Edit: since you expressed concern about not always having port numbers, you could simplify significantly by using a regular expression:(I'm having trouble being more clever with my regular expression, hence the inline ternary.)
This is the code I came up with. It looks lengthy and laborious, but it addresses all possible input scenarios. Any suggestion to condense/better it is most welcome :)
