I'm currently trying to to learn how to parse PPM file. I did the following in a python interpreter:I understand the basic structure of a PPM file. I'm most curious about the last line, however. The byte encoding that contains the info on the pixel's colour. The file above should parse back intoBy using , I see that the integers get packed into the byte encoding above. However, I'm not sure how to reverse this process using . Most importantly, I'm not sure where to cut off each of the byte encoding since they all appear on the same line, and each doesn't seem to have the same length either (?).I also tried to pack the whole line by doing . I don't understand why it could not directly convert the byte encoding into integers.How can I use  to parse the byte encoding back into integers? Also, what is happening as those values are being packed/ unpacked? 
First three strings are not packed by . So simply use them ( or  if you want remove spaces around).For the last bytes:or using : (You can use  instead in Python 3.x); Iterating  yields s.NOTE As Martijn Pieters commented, you'd better open the file with binary mode when you're dealing with binary data.
