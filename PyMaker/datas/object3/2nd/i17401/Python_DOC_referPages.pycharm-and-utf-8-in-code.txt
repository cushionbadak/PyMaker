When I try to run this code:in PyCharm, I get the following errorIs PyCharm not able to support UTF-8 in files? Or am I missing a setting somewhere. The same file builds in Sublime.
I've had a similar error before in PyCharm, I think it is something to do with the encoding detection selecting 'ascii' rather than UTF8. There is however a simple work around:The encoding option will force the file to load UTF8.
