I've heard that python functions are objects, similar to lists or dictionaries, etc.  However, what would be a similar way of performing this type of action with a function?How would you do this? Further, is it necessary or proper?Here is the sense in which I would like to use it for better context:I have a  for selecting items which are associated with keys in a dictionary. The values in this dictionary are also dictionaries, which hold certain properties of the items, which I can add. These certain properties are stored as keys, and the values in them are initialized or updated by calling different functions.  So, I'm storing a variable in the window which gets updated when a button is pressed to tell this script which property to update.  As you can see, I would like to store the function to map to the data using the correct function based on the situation.
First, the reason this doesn't work:… is that  only allows an expression, and defines a function that returns the value of the expression. Since  is a statement, not an expression, this is illegal.However, this works just fine:In Python, a function that falls off the end without a  statement always returns . So, these are equivalent:However, I don't see why you want to write this as a lambda and an assignment anyway; the  is shorter, and more readable, and gives you an introspectable function object with a nice name ( instead of ), and so on. The only reasons to ever use  are when you don't want to give the function a name, or when you need to define the function inside an expression. Obviously neither of those are true, because you use the  directly inside an assignment statement. So, just use .Meanwhile, this is in a sense an "empty function", or at least as empty as possible (as you can see by, e.g., calling , it still takes two bytecodes to do nothing but fall off the end and return ), but it's not useful for your case. You don't want an "empty function". If you try passing your  to , you're just going to get a , because you're trying to call a function of no arguments with one argument. (Because that's what  does.)What you might want is an identity function, which just returns its argument as-is. Like this:But I'm not sure that's what you want. Did you want to append  as-is in that case? Or did you want to do something different, like return early, or raise an exception, or not append anything, or …?Finally, I don't see why you want a function at all. Why not just not call  if you have nothing to map? You have a perfectly good  clause that already catches that case (especially handy if what you want to do is return early or raise…). Or, if you prefer, you can start with , and then use an  do decide whether to map or not. Or, if you really want:… or …As one last note, instead of a long / chain that repeats the same thing over and over again, you might want a :Then, all that cruft turns into these two lines:Or course an even better design might be to replace all those  functions with a single function that you call as  or … but without seeing what they actually do, I can't be sure of that.
I am surprised to learn that you can even do...
this feels so much like you're looking for a  functor, I am guessing that if you had knowledge of Monads you wouldn't even need an empty function , as inspiration PyMonad has a nice  implementation, I usually like to create my own, but it's a good starting point. 
For completeness and since the title is "empty function object in python", more general case is an empty function object that takes any number of parameters, so you can use it in any callback. It's this one:Explanation is here: http://echochamber.me/viewtopic.php?t=64825
