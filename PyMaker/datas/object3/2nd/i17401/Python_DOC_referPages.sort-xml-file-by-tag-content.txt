Natural Text
I have a lot of XML-Files which aren't sorted. I'd like to sort them by a tag-content named "title". I know the order of titles:1.) editorial2.) content3.) clubetc.Each file has another "title"-content.The XML-structure of file number 1 looks like this:How can I go through all files and sort them by the defined order?The file-names can look like: "sorted_01.xml", "sorted_02.xml" and so on.How can I get this?Thanks a lot for any help! :)
Use  or  with the function that return the text of the  tag as a key function.See demo.
