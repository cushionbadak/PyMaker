I thought this is a great moment to use , but I'm stuck.When something fails, I would like to send the item back into the generator. I've read that this is possible, so I'd really like to use my first generator.How to use a generator in such a case?
You are probably referring to a coroutine, which leverages the yield expression.  It works a little like this:and (contrived) usage:Salient points - normal  behavior assigns  to .  If it's not None, something has been -ed into the generator.  When we  something into the generator, it resumes operation until it reaches the next yield expression.  So keep that in mind - the above control flow in the coroutine isn't what I'd call "standard" since there is no ing done in the error block.Here is a coroutine that operates a little more like what you were talking about:We  our state back into the generator, and it keeps yielding it until we stop sending it.
Two generators, sending back the value if the return value evaluates to false for some function. (random in this case). 
While it's possible to do what you're asking with regular generators and  and , your code will be very complicated. It may be easier to write your own iterator type, which supports a method other than  for getting the "sent back" items:If you only need to deal with repeating an item that just came out of the iteration, you could make it simpler yet:Here's how you could use that last version:
