I have a list of sentences:I need to form bigram pairs and store them in a variable. The problem is that when I do that, I get a pair of sentences instead of words.

What I want is The last word of the first sentence should not merge with the first word of second sentence.What should I do to make it work?

Rather than turning your text into lists of strings, start with each sentence separately as a string. I've also removed punctuation and stopwords, just remove these portions if irrelevant to you:To use it, do like so:Note that this goes a little further and actually statistically scores the bigrams (which will come in handy in training the model).

Just fixing Dan's code:
Read the datasetCollect all available monthsCreate tokens of all tweets per monthCreate bigrams per monthCount bigrams per monthWrap up the result in neat dataframes
There are a number of ways to solve it but I solved in this way:
