Natural Text
I wrote an HTML parser in python used to extract data to look like this in a csv file:so I used a delmiter ":::::" thinking that it wouldn't be mined in the dataThis works for most of the thousands of lines, however, apparently a colon : offset this when I imported the csv in Calc.My question is, what is the best or a unique delimiter to use when creating a csv with many variations of sentences that need to be separated with some delimiter?  Am I understanding delimiters correctly in that they separate the values within a CSV?
As I suggested informally in a comment, unique just means you need to use some character that won't be in the data â€”might be a good choice. For example:Output:If you're not using themodule and instead are writing and/or reading the data manually, then it would go something like this:
Yes, delimiters separate values within each line of a CSV file. There are two strategies to delimiting text that has a lot of punctuation marks. First, you can quote the values, e.g.:The second strategy is to use tabs (i.e., ).Python's built-in CSV module can both read and write CSV files that use quotes. Check out the example code under the  function. The built-in csv module will handle quotes correctly, e.g. it will escape quotes that are in the value itself.
CSV files usually use double quotes  to wrap long fields that might contain a field separator like a comma. If the field contains a double quote it's escaped with a backslash: .
