In my program that I am writing in Python, I am trying to say:if a letter is found in word 1 and is in word2:delete the letter from word2I tried:When I did this, a syntax error came from the word in in the very last line.
 is only used to remove names (variables) in Python.If you want to remove individual characters in a string, you should use . Also note that instead of iterating over indexes, you can just iterate over the characters of the string:Of course,  won’t actually replace anything if it can’t find a match, so you can just remove the :And finally,  may contain characters more than once, in which case you would try to remove single characters multiple times. So instead, you can just iterate over the unique characters of :
The  keyword does not do what you are thinking it does in python. To delete from a string, try something likeThere is rarely a good reason to use the  keyword in python
your del line uses incorrect syntax. del cannot be used on characters in a string. Assuming word1 and word2 are strings.. you can't just delete a letter from a string. However, you can use str.replace():You must create a new string to do this, as simply doing  won't actually modify word2.Hence the  bit
The str.translate method is very well suited to this task.  If you pass None as the first argument, the second argument lists all the characters to be removed:Q.  Variant of the question: A. Use str.find and string slicing to isolate and remove one character at a time (don't use str.replace which does a multi-replace):
