Python Question:  i need to run a program that asks for a password but if the wrong answer is input three times the user is thrown out of the program i can run it in a while loop but cant get it to quit if the wrong password is entered.  Thanks for your help
Adding an approximation of how I'd do it, in the absence of an example containing the problem.   on a for loop will only execute if you did not break out of the loop.  Since you know the max number of times to run the loop is 3 you can just use a  loop instead of a  loop.  will still break you out early.
How about http://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html
