When I try to call "torch.save" to save my model in a "tmp_file", it rises a . the trace back is as follow:Traceback (most recent call last):  File “C:/Users/Haoran/Documents/GitHub/dose-response/python/simulations/hdr.py”, line 234, in   test_hdr_continuous()  File “C:/Users/Haoran/Documents/GitHub/dose-response/python/simulations/hdr.py”, line 195, in test_hdr_continuous  model = fit_mdn(X[:split], y[:split], nepochs=20)  File “C:\Users\Haoran\Documents\GitHub\dose-response\python\simulations\continuous.py”, line 192, in fit_mdn  torch.save(model, tmp_file)  File “C:\Users\Haoran\Documents\GitHub\dose-response\python\venv\lib\site-packages\torch\serialization.py”, line 161, in save  return _with_file_like(f, “wb”, lambda f: _save(obj, f, pickle_module, pickle_protocol))  File “C:\Users\Haoran\Documents\GitHub\dose-response\python\venv\lib\site-packages\torch\serialization.py”, line 116, in _with_file_like  f = open(f, mode)  FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: ‘/tmp/tmp_file_4358f298-a1d9-4c81-9e44-db4d8f1b4319’It is weird that everything works perfectly on my mac, but I got this error on my Windows desktop.
As shmee observed, you are trying to write to  on a Windows machine. Therefore you get .To make your code OS agnostic, you may find python's  package useful, especially : this function creates a temporary file and returns its name, so you can access/use it in your program.
