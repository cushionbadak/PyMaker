I wrote some unittest code, and it's great, I can see it on the CLI when I run it manually.Now I want to hook it up to run automatically as part of a merge to master hook on my repo. I have everything set up with dummy code except for the part of grabbing the results of the unittest programatically.When I call  to run them all, it throws a SystemExit. I've tried catching it and re-routing the stdout, but I wasn't able to get it to work, and it also feels like I'm doing it wrong. Is there an easier way to get the results of the unittests, like in a python list of line strings, or even a more complicated result object?Really for my purposes, I'm only interested in 100% pass or fail, then showing that visual in the repo on pull request to master, with a link to the full unittest result details.I'm also not married to unittest if some other python unit test framework can be called and pass off results easily.
You can pass  to , and capture the return value.  To run it from another script, or the interactive interpreter, you can specify a target  as well. That gives us an instance of the  or  class that was executed.  The internal  machinery will make a  object available in the  attribute of that object.That object will have a  method that gives the result you're looking for.Assuming you have some file :
