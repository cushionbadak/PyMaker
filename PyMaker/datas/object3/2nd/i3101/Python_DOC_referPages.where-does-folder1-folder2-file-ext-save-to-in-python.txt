I know there must be a really obvious answer, but it eludes me. Where does "/folder1/folder2/file.ext" save to in Python? In some code I thought (incorrectly) that it would save the file to a relative path, but when I checked folder2 it wasn't there. However, it seemed to still take up the hard disk space. I did a search on my hard drive and couldn't find the file. Where did it go? Again, I'm aware that there must be a really obvious answer out there, but I am just learning to code.
Firstly I would read about the os module and the module search path.I opened the IDLE 3.7.0 on my Windows 10 machine and did the following:Windows expands the  to represent the current working drive, thus wherever the interpreter is looking is where your folders will reside.In the links, it talks about how sys.path works (in short the directory containing the current script is placed at the front of it [e.g. the current working directory] for searching).So, in short, either run your script directly from the directory or call .
