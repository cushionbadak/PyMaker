These strings may contain replacement fields, which are expressions delimited by curly braces . While other string literals always have a constant value, formatted strings are really expressions evaluated at run time.
 is really an expression evaluated at runtime, not a constant value. In Python, an f-string is a literal string, prefixed with , which contains expressions inside braces. The expressions are replaced with their values.So,  gets evaluated to .
