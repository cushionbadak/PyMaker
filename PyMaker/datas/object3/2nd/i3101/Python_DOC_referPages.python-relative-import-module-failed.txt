I have a file structure like the following:classification looks like this:This works fine for example1.py that looks like thisbut import classification from example2.py like the following will failbecause in the example2.py scenario  in classification would simply be  rather than  as example1.py, therefore there's no parent node here, hence the import module failed.I know one of the solution is to add the script directory to sys.path in both example1.py and exaple2.py, and use  in classificationo. This will work in both example1.py and example2.py, but is this a good method, and is there any other alternatives?
Since  is in the  directory, this make me think that  is the source root of your project. So, this directory must appear in the Python path, ie: .And, each directory which is under  should be a Python package. So,  must have a  file (usually empty).You should take a look in the official Python tutorial about Modules. EditIn your second example (below) you try to import classification as if it is a root package but it is not.To fix that, you need to use relative import or a full package name:Of course, to run your example, you need to do:
