Directory 1: I have some number of txt files and one xml file which I want to change in each iteration according to txt file content.Directory 2: I want to copy altered xml file to this directory after each iteration.After execution I can observe the altered xml file in directory 1 which contains last txt file content as expected. However, directory 2 contains empty files with expected names.May be there is some issue in my cp command? Could you please help?Entire script:
It seems likely you're encountering synchronization issues. Files aren't immediately written to disk, but buffered in memory to increase overall throughput. This means that the  call isn't seeing the latest changes you have made the files. Try calling  before  to ensure the change is committed to disk.
