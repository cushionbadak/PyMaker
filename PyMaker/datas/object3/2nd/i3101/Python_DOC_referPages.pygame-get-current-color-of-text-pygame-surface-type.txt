Natural Text
I want to randomize colors and change color for text every few seconds, so I want to make sure that I dont use the same color. How can I know the current color of text?
You could define a set of the colors and use the difference of the set and the current color to get a set which only contains different colors. Then convert it into a list and use  to pick a new color.
