I am getting this error "TypeError: 'str' object is not callable" when i am trying to convert a str to float inorder to do summation.Screenshot of the error occurring when i run the code
I see that you ran that code in Spyder. That is a great environment, which I use, but it does have one disadvantage. Any variables you have defined are still defined at the start of your code.Almost certainly you have defined a variable with the name  that holds a string value. So your program tries to execute  but misunderstands the meaning of . We could have seen that if you had your "variable explorer` window visible, rather than the "help" window in your screenshot.Try your program again after closing and restarting Spyder and see if you still get that error. And from now on, avoid using standard names like  for your variables.
