I'm trying to replace every instance of a single letter followed by a = sign followed by a letter with spaces between = and the letters.  So  would be replaced with .  This is what I have right now:But that yields  rather than .  What am I doing wrong?
The replacement shouldn't be another regular expression, it should be an ordinary string (or a function).https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.subReturn the string obtained by replacing the leftmost non-overlapping occurrences of pattern in string by the replacement repl. If the pattern isnâ€™t found, string is returned unchanged. repl can be a string or a functionFor example:But it would be easier to use a word boundary here:
You can avoid consuming the part of the string you don't want to replace, but still assert that the parts around it match something by using lookahead/lookbehind assertions.You can put whatever pattern in these. e.g.
Change to
The docs for  specifically mention thatUnknown escapes such as  are left alone.A literal space in the replacement is all you need.  is meaningless there. You also need to add groups to your expression to capture the part of the substitution that you don't want to replace:Backreferences, such as , are replaced with the substring matched by group 6 in the pattern.Your substitution should look something like this then:
