my function return a dict so i did try but gettingcan someone explain me how can I get a value that is minimal in this dict?
You are getting this -Because  expects an iterable. Look at the docsBut  gives you  and you can not iterate over an  object. Pass a list like -
One of these should do it
Sure, you are trying to get the min value of an int.In fact in your code you're doing:you must insert the dictionary and not its value in the  function (which takes an iterable argument)so you can do:But in fact you pass the keys arguments.If you want the  value of the dict values, you should do:
If you want the key for the minimum value,  takes a  function which is used for the comparison. You can pass a lambda which will compare values instead of keys:Or, more tersely, and using a dictionary lookup instead (which may be slightly less efficient):
