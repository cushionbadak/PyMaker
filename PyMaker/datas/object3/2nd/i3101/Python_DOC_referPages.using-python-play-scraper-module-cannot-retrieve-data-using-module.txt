Here is the link to the module:https://github.com/danieliu/play-scraper I am looking to scrape a collection from the google play store for a project. I run the following code. Traceback:UpdateI use python3 when running code and updated my print statements to include brackets. Now I receive the error I am new to python and scripts, and any advice on how to move forward on this issue would be much appreciated. I know this a basic problem and apologise if it's easily answerable elsewhere. -- NOTE: Originally helped on syntax because I was not adding in the bracket in accordance to python3 syntax and was receiving a syntax error. I now return this error in my terminal. 
You are probably on python 3.x, where print statements need bracketstry For your second issuetry runningTo make sure you have the latest requirements. Note
