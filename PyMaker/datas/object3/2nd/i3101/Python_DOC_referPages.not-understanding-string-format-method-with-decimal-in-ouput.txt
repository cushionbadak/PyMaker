This question already has an answer here:Is floating point math broken?                    28 answers                I was going through the basic mathematical operation in python terminal and using format to manage the output. I tried to generate output with the 10 decimal places.print('{0:.10f}'.format(1.0/3))Got this output 0.3333333333Again I tried to generate output with the 20 decimal placesprint('{0:.20f}'.format(1.0/3))Got this output as 0.33333333333333331483I think this should return 0.3333333333333333333 Why format function is not working as desired.
The format function is working normally. This is mainly because of the limitations of programming languages regarding floating point precision when producing decimals from division.I encourage that you read about that here. https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html
