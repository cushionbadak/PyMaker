I have a question and I need your help.I have a word file which contains many references like:[1] M.-H. Han, Y. Li, and C.-H. Hwang, "The impact of high-frequency characteristics induced by intrinsic parameter fluctuations in nano-MOSFET device and circuit," Microelectronics Reliability, vol. 50, pp. 657-661, 2010.[2] E. Maricau and G. Gielen, "Computer-aided analog circuit design for reliability in nanometer CMOS," Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems, IEEE Journal on, vol. 1, pp. 50-58, 2011....It would be possible that some of these references are similar but their numbers be different. do you have any idea to find a way to delete or reveal similar references with #python?thanks  
You can split the footnote text into a number and the rest of the reference:Python has a  class which is useful for building histograms.You can add the references to a  object and then query it for when there is more than one:You can create a loop of all your footnotes:Then access the counts that are greater than :
