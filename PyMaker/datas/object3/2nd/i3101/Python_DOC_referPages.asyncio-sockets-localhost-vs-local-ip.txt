I have an Asyncio script I'm writing. Everything is working but I had a question about what I'm seeing in a tuple asyncio returns as the address.This line of code returns two different things depending on weather I connect with a client using localhost or my local IP address.With localhost as my connection in my client, I see this on my serverAnd with an IP address as my connection in my client,What are the meanings of the two zero's in the first tuple? And why aren't they there when I connect with an IP?
See https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/socket.html?highlight=socket#socket-familiesYour localhost connection is arriving via IPv6:For  address family, a four-tuple  is used, where flowinfo and scopeid represent the  and  members in  in C. For  module methods, flowinfo and scopeid can be omitted just for backward compatibility. Note, however, omission of scopeid can cause problems in manipulating scoped IPv6 addresses.Your explicit IP address connection is an IPv4 connection, for which:A pair  is used for the  address family, where host is a string representing either a hostname in Internet domain notation like 'daring.cwi.nl' or an IPv4 address like '100.50.200.5', and port is an integer.The hostname  can be resolved to either an IPv6 or IPv4 address, whereas  is an explicit IPv4 address.
Additional fields seems to be related about the IPv6 address scoping.See also socket.getnameinfo and socket.getpeername.
