I want to change a Python 2 code to Python 3. In particular, I would like to change  to .I would to know if it is possible to define a new function so that when the program comes across , it will run my new function instead of its original one?Thank you very much.
as @aws_apprentice said : go to https://docs.python.org/3/library/2to3.html specifically read this section  :dict Fixes dictionary iteration methods. dict.iteritems() is converted  to dict.items(), dict.iterkeys() to dict.keys(), and dict.itervalues()  to dict.values(). Similarly, dict.viewitems(), dict.viewkeys() and  dict.viewvalues() are converted respectively to dict.items(),  dict.keys() and dict.values(). It also wraps existing usages of  dict.items(), dict.keys(), and dict.values() in a call to list.so all you need to do is run 2to3 script on your files and you customize your code to suit Python 3 convention.
