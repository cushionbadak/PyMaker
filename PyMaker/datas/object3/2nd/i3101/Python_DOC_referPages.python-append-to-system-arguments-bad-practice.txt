I'm parsing system arguments in my Python project using . At some point i had to modify the script after having written the logic that parses system args. I added a line the basically appends a string to  so the logic that parses it won't be changed - Is it a bad practice to modify the system arguments after they have been created for the program ?
It is bad  practice to modify  in Python and it's equivalent in other languages.In these situations I recommend a  variable which has all your parsed data from , any default values that you would like to set, and any modifications that "middleware" would make.
In my opinion in such case it would be better to first parse those arguments using argparse. That way you can get  object, that can be modified and much easier to maintain than hardcoding.After that you can modify  any way you wantSmall example:
