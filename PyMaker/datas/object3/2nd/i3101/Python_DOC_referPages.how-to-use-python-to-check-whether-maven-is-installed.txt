I'm writing a python script to build a project with multiple technology stack. I need to check whether all prerequisites are ready and Maven is one of the prerequisite.Normally, the Maven tutorial will ask the user to set an environment variable  and add  to the path. It's easy to check the environment variable with code below,However, if the user doesn't set  as an environment variable but adds  to the path, it can still be thought as Maven being installed successfully and I think the latter is more comprehensive. So, here comes the question: How can I use Python to check whether Maven is installed?In my view, it's possible to launch  as a process from Python and check what the output is, for example by calling . Any other suggestion?
