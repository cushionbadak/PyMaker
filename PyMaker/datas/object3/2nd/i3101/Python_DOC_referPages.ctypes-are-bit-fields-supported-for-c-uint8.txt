I was playing around with some ctype-structures and found out something interesting that got me wondering about my implementation. A MWE is as follows:Whose output is:9, 0 ,9Which was something that I was not expecting. By turning  into a , I get what I would have expected from the beginning: .Having a glance to the documentation I see that bitfields are only possible for integer fields, which doesn't really specify that  are not supported. I then referred to the available tests, where I see that no  or  is included. However, trying to use a  throws a TypeError, whereas c_uint8 doesn't throw.Could someone just clarify what is going on? Are bit fields just not implemented for ? Or am I just using it wrong? Any type of clarification is highly appreciated!Thanks in advance!
Note: Mac OS X python 2.7 and 3.6 have the same outputso... for some reason you can't use the 8 bit types signed or unsigned and divide them with a bitfield ... I will look into docs for the "why"outputs:  which is cool, dropping the 2 top bits: and prints:  ok... saneBut,prints:
