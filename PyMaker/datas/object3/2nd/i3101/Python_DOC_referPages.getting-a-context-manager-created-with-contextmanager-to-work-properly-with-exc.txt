I have the following codeRight now it prints outwhich tells me that the context manager isn't closing.How can I get it to close and print the "finished context manager" line?Since I'm using the decorator, I don't have a dedicated  function that I think should be called according to this.So I'm not sure how to get my context manager to exit in the case of an error occurring inside of its context.
You need a try-finally:If an exception propagates out of the  statement, the  decorator will throw the exception into the decorated generator at the point of the .  lets us execute a cleanup block regardless of whether an exception occurs, so we use that.
