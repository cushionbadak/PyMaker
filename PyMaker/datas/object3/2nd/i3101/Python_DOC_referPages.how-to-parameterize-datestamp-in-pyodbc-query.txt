I'm using  together with  to construct an ODBC query. I'm having trouble inserting datestamp parameters. Here you can see the escalation starting from the literal version (1) to string-format version (2) to error-state versions. (Note  & ):Subsequent attempts with the insertion syntax ,  and the variables:Reading the  Wiki page on inserting data, I don't read about any speed bumps with insertion strings. This must have something to do with how pyodbc processes (escapes) the datestamp.How do you parameterize datestamp--Especially with the  flavor of datestamp.
It is almost never necessary to use ODBC escape sequences like  in a pyodbc parameterized query. If the parameter value is a true Python date object then pyodbc will inform the ODBC driver that the parameter value is a  as shown in the ODBC trace logand we can just use a bare parameter placeholder in our SQL command text
