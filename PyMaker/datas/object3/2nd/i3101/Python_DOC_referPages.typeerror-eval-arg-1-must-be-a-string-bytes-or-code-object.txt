I'm trying to evaluate a function at x0I tried this:but it throws up a traceback:I also read that using eval() is bad practice. What'd be a good way to do this then? Thanks. 
The  function evaluates a string as if it were source code.1 For example,  would do the same thing as calling  directly.But you don't have source code, you have a function. To call a function, all you have to do is:It doesn't matter that you got the function as a parameter, , instead of directly from a  statement or  expression. Function values are just objects, like anything else in Python, and you can pass them around the same as any other values, and then call them whenever you want.But really, there's no need for this function at all. Instead of this:… you could just call it directly:The only reason you'd ever need something like your  is if someone else has passed you a function and a bunch of arguments separately, and you need to put them together into a function call. Python used to have a function for this, , but it was removed long ago because it's almost never necessary, and a one-liner if it ever is necessary.I also read that using eval() is bad practice.It usually is. That's because it's about treating strings as code:If the string comes out of your source code, you probably didn't need  and could just run the code. That's why you don't want to use it here.If, on the other hand, the string comes from user input or the internet or something, it can be dangerous—something like  is just one typo away from being a really bad idea to evaluate.1. It can also evaluate compiled code objects, which is why the error message is a bit more complicated than you might expect, but don't worry about that.
