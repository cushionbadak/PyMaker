You can use iteration with a dictionary to construct a mapping. Then apply this mapping to your original list.Here's an alternative solution using  [equivalent to the  recipe in the  docs]:Both solutions have the following features:O(n) complexity.Require elements of  to be hashable.
Create a set with items from the list. Enumerate the set and create a dictionary with key to enumeration values. Then use the list and the dictionary to produce the desired output.
You could try this:
Order dict will remove duplicate and remain the order. You can also do it in one shot with following:result:
