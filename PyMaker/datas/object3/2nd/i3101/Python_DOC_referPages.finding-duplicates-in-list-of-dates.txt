I have two lists:and I am trying to find duplicates in list x and if there are any, then sum values with the found duplicates index in list y. Then erase. I figured out following code:the problem is with datetime values in list x, they are being deformed. Is there a way to avoid this?
You can combine both lists into a list of tuples with , sort the list and group it by the first element (time), and apply the  to the second elements:The result is a summed list of tuples:You can split this new list into x and y again:
You can simply use a dict.Input:    Result:
You can use  for an O(n) solution:Result:If you require lists, you can use  with unpacking (omit  if tuples are sufficient):
