So I have the following example of code; simultaneously iterates over multiple sequences combined with enumerate, assigning the values to tuple variable after which outputs it.What I want to achieve is something like this if it is possible: I have been searching around but I could not find yet a solution which achieves my results from the method written above: or 
Perhaps you're looking for a flattened list or a flattened tuple? Not clear from your question, so I'll just include everything.
You can make a generator expression to create the tuples, then  from that expression to get the flattened resultThis looks much nicer as a multiline functionEdit:My original code (for a tuple of tuples) was 
Because this is so much clearer...example:
While I don't advocate abusing , it is possible to do this in order to concatenate tuples togetherOr in your caseIt is important to note that this can be inefficient, given the behaviors of sum. And it is not quite as clear in this instance.Note: I do not advocate using this in production code. It is merely to show that it is possible.
