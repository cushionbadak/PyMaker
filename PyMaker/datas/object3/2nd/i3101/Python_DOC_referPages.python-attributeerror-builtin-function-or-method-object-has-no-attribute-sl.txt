I'm receiving a strange error when running my program? I'm not sure why it wont let me sleep.Code:
snakecharmeb is right, and also, you need to import random rather than from random import random.
Change  to Then you can use sleep directly instead of time.sleep
you are importing wrong way "time" package...That is all.
You should write like this:you can see the full doc.
So I had the same awkward problem. I say awkward because a couple of days ago when I solved an exercise and used the following import statement: "from time import sleep", my code worked just fine when using . After a couple of days of adding code to the same .py file, my previously working function definition that used  did not work anymore.This is the error it threw at me. I did not change anything to the import statement used when I have initially imported sleep from the time module. Resolve:I ended up having to delete  from  and used only  as Agile_Eagle suggested. Thx for that! But why would it work initially and then crash with that error...? All of the above import methods work just fine for importing the time module/or for importing just "sleep" from the time module, but now I can only use  instead of  (as I did initially when I solved the exercise).
