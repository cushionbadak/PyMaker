On the command line, quotes and spaces are consumed by the shell; with  you need to split up the tokens on whitespace yourself (and ideally understand how the shell processes quotes; or use  to do the work for you).Unless you are stuck on a truly paleolithic Python version, you should avoid  in favor of  (or, for slightly older Python versions, ).
