I made a bunch of functions that control a message-based instrument. I know how to use them but the functions should be fool-proof in case somebody else wants to code with it after I'm gone. Here is an example function:To comply with the input requirements I initially added a  at the start in an ugly way:After reading about  I replaced the  with this:A possible neater variant would be this:The second option is nicer now that I think of it because then I can tell specifically which input was invalid. So my question is: is this how you should handle assertions? 1  for 1 input? If not, what is the adviced structure? Thanks in advance.
Why not do what Python does?Let's see an example: is in C, but you can see how it looks like for e.g :Don't be scared of making the code a little longer; you can't really avoid it in Python. And also, "Error in Keithley.Autorange(): Input not allowed." doesn't tell the programmer which input is not allowed. In this case, explicit and clear is better than clever and short.I'd do:Not directly relevant to your questions, but it is best to stick to the language's coding style: in Python, variables are in  (lowercase with underscores).
