I am trying to use re.sub() in my Python script to remove some String. The  command I used is (on Linux):  Which would output . Now, with Python, I tried to do this for the first  group: But it only outputs the copy, which is How can I perform such  command ? Edit: My question is not about my regex expression. The inputs String are more complex than the one I presented as an example. Question is about how to prorperly use re.sub() with the regex I used :) 
  command is translated as .Note:BRE POSIX interval quantifier is written without escapes,  =>  means replace  with , and is equal to  (as there is no  modifier in the sed command,  is passed to  to only replace one, first, occurrence).Modifiers are passed as options, or flags, in the , e.g.  ( is a case insensitive modifier). Mind there is no need using  modifier as  replaces all occurrences by default.You can learn more about Python regex syntax in the Python  documentation.
Your regular expression does not match what you're trying to do.Actualy your code is replacing a 5 char long alpha-numric char string that starts by an hyphen by the first match in 'helloworld-5b5cf484-g582f' (or something like this).This case can not occur since your string does not begin by an hyphen.If  I'm correct you want to remplace by an empty string any 5 char or 8 chars long lowercase alpha-numeric string that starts with an hyphen.This could be achieved with this code:CodeResultHere are pointers to re module doc:python2: https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.htmlpython3: https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html
