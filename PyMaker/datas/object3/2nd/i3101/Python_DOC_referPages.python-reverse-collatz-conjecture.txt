What the program should do is take steps and a number and than output you how many unique sequences there are with exactly x  to create . Does someone know how I can save some memory - as I should make this work for pretty huge numbers within a 4 second limit.If someone knows a version with memoization I would be thankful, right now it works, but there is still room for improvement. 
Baseline:  takes 6.96s0) Use the LRU CacheThis made the code take longer, and gave a different final result1) Eliminate the if condition:  to  takes 0.679s. Thanks Pm2Ring for this one. 2) Simplify  to  and use floor division where possible: takes 0.499sTruth table: Code: 3) Rewrite code using sets takes 0.381sThis lets us take advantage of any optimizations made for sets. Basically I do a breadth first search here. 4) Break the cycle so we can skip keeping track of previous states. takes 0.256sWe just need to add a check that  to break the only known cycle. This gives a speed up, but you need to add a special case if you start from 1. Thanks Paul for suggesting this!
