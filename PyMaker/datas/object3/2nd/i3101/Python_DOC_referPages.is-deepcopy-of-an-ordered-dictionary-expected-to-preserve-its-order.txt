I made a small program and tested that it does keep the order. However, I still want to be sure that  is guaranteed to do that.The output of this program is 
In CPython, it appears the order is preserved. I drew that conclusion from inspecting the implementation of . In this case, it will find either the  or  method on your  object to use for pickling:(https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/copy.py#L159-L161)Those return  objects for constructing, so order would be preserved:
Correctly implemented copying via  should produce an object that is equal to the original (assuming equality is defined at all). While no, there is no explicit documented guarantees regarding  and  specifically, if the ordering of  changed in the copy, it would not be equal to the original , which would violate the expectation of copy-equality in a big way.No firm guarantee can truly be given, since the  method of a key or a value could do something truly terrible (modifying the source  for instance), but aside from pathological cases, you can rely on  to preserve ordering.
deepcopy of an object should return an object of the same type. so an ordereddict returned as a copy should remain ordered?EDIT - This is not completely correct answer. Please look at Greg's comment below.
