I have a class that is essentially a wrapper around a dictionary:When checking the annotations with , it yields an  when checking this code. My guess is that this stems from the concept that  is the ancestor and successor of all other types. How should I annotate such function where I want to allow anything to be returned?
If you really need a custom mapping (do you?) I'll recommend to not inherit from  as it can cause a lot of pain in the future (you should re-define its methods or sometimes you will be using  and sometimes not).We can simply use  ABC from  module and define basic methods (like ), the rest (, ,  are defined already).About : I prefer to define helper type variables for elements/keys/values/etc. inside of a class.So we can end up with something likeTestRunning  with  flag causes no errors/warnings.
This happens when the  is set to  for that module in the configuration file. Just remove that option for the default .
You have provided insufficient information in the question to recreate this error but if your sole question is:How should I annotate such function where I want to allow anything to be returned?The simple answer is don't annotate it at all. It will by default act as .
