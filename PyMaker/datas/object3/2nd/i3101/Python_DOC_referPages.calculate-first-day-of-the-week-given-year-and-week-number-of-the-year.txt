to get the beginning date of the week , try this
I am making the following assumptions about what your question means. If they are off, it should not be hard to adjust the code.1) The first day of the week is Sunday. (so the answer is always a Sunday)2) The week in which January 1 falls is week 1 (not 0).Then the work breaks down into two parts.a) Figure out the first day of the first week.b) Add the right number of days onto that.In Python, it looks as follows:
I am using an algorithm which starts with a close-by date and then simply loops down till it finds the desired result. I am sacrificing some CPU cycles for ease of readability since the cost is not significant. I have done some limited testing but I hope the general idea is clear. Let me know your thoughts.
