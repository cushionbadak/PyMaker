As an internal function (it starts with an underscore), it is not well-documented, but you can find its definition in the source code. is a utility function that basically calls , but unifies handling in the case the regular expression does not match. This is important as many extractors use regular expressions and it would be tiresome (not to mention a huge code duplication) to replicate the error handling all over the place.Here are its parameters:: The regular expression being searched. For instance something like . Usually, the first captured group (i.e. the stuff in parentheses, but not beginning with . For more information on regular expressions, consult the Python standard library documentation.: The string to search in (i.e. the haystack), downloaded from the service you are connecting to.: A name you chose; this is presented to the user if something fails. Should be unique withing your extractor. Examples are  or . That way, you know immediately where the problem lies if a user posts an error message without the stack trace.: Default value. Sometimes, there is a default in case the regexp doesn't match. If so, pass it in here.: If no default is given, this determines the behavior if the regular expression fails to match. : abort extraction and throw a detailed error; for instance if extracting the video URL fails. : Only omit a warning and go on; if searching for an optional field (e.g. description) fails. - Explicit regular expression flags. Rarely used; see the Python standard library documentation for more information. - Match a different group but the first one. Rarely used, only sensible if your regular expression contains named groups. Refer to the Python standard library documentation (keyword named groups) for more details.
