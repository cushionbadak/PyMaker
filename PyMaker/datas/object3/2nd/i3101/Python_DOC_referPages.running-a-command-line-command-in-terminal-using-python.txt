How do i ensure that everytime its triggered using python, it opens in new terminal tab printing the output?Checked couple of refernce online and tried usingbut doesn't help.I am on OSx Sierra but a platform independent solution is welcome!!
You can use check_output from the subprocess module. As your command must be executed more than once, you can just call the function inside  loop. The script may look something like this (the upper bound of the  may be variable):As mentioned in the documentation, the  function returns the data as encoded bytes, but as the encoding is specified in my example, the output will be UTF-8 encoding string. Depending on your command the decoding to text may need to be handled separately.
