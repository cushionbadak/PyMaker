Natural Text
So I have inherited a "simple" web application written in PHP and stores most of the transaction data in one table on MariaDB by using json in a long_text field.  I need to parse out the data so it can be put into a traditional relational database table(s).  Preferably using SQL and/or Python.  This is the current table structureHere to one record of the existing data.Here is what I have so.And this is my result.My question is how do I keep working my way through the data getting key:value information?
Fetch the row.Use a python function to turn the JSON into a python structure.Walk through the structure using python code.Create  statements as needed, and execute them.That is, steps 2 and 3 are better done via the application language than via SQL.
