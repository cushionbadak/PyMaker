Natural Text
As of right now, this produces false. I just want to know is it possible to set a variable to set up for like special formatted types of strings   so in this example, I want the string format to be a string with a comma followed by a space and another string. Since x is in that same format i would want it to produce True.
You can use regular expressions for this. The regular expression in the code below is pretty basic, but you can change it according to your need.
