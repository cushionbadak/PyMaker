If I have a package , I want it to tell pip/setuptools that it also provides package . So that when I later install another third party package that depends on the  package, it sees that  is installed, and therefore won't install the  package. Is this possible?
There is no such ability.  is a rather simple package manager and doesn't have features from advanced package managers like . It has neither "This package also provides…" nor "This package obsoletes…" nor "This package is incompatible with…" Alas!The only way is to upload to PyPI a  package that consists of a single  that lists  as a dependency.
