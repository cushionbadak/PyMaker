Natural Text
I have a python script where I'm trying to read all .txt files in a directory and determine if they return True or False for any conditions that are in my script. I have thousands of .txt files with text in .json format. However, I'm getting an error message saying invalid .json format. I have checked that my text files are in .json format. I want the script to determine if the .txt file matches any of the statements in my code below. I then want to output the result to a csv file. Your help is very much appreciated! I have included my error messages and example .txt file.Example .txt file with .json formatttingError messageCode
I suggest (1) limiting your script to only parsing  files, and (2) adding some basic error checking in the form of a / statement to catch any JSON errors that do occur. Something like this:You can fill in the rest of your code around this.
Your are trying to decode JSON from empty file (size ). Check your filepath and content of that file.Note: the example you have provided in your question is valid JSON, it should load without problem.
You are not opening files... listdir - lists all dirs and files in the path.
