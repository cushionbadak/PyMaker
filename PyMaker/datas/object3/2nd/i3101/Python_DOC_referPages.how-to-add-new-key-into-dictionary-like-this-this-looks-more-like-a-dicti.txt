I would like to add new key into the dictionary list. Example: (with empty list)I tried to use loop into "seed" and then to "argument" then use .update("label":[]) in the loop but it won't work. Can anyone please give me an example of using for loop to loop from beginning then to add these new "label"? My prefered goal: ( to have extra "label" within the dictionary according to my input)Example:I am new to dictionary so really need help with this 
If I understand your problem correctly, you want to add 'label' to  in  where there is no . You could do it like so -Where  is your dict. But what's ?Let's simplify your dict -How did we reach here?Let's see-I hope that makes sense. And to add more dictionaries in  Now your  will become -
First things first: access the list of dict that need to be updated.according to your given structure that's Then iterate that list and check if  already exists, if it does not then add it as an empty list.This can be done by explicit checking:or by re-assigning:Full Code:Output:
You have a list with one nested dictionary. Get the list of the inner dicts, and iterate. Assuming your initial data structure is named data
