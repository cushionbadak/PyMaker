Natural Text
I'm very new to python so play nice, but I'm trying to write a program that helps me write a list of things to do in different countries. It is supposed to ask what country, what thing to do, and then put that activity under the country heading. the text document is set out as such:This code definitely works but I have a strong feeling there is a simple way to do this.I have tried appending the text document but from my understanding that always appends to the end. Also tried using  and writing at a certain index, but that seems to overwrite, and can't find a way to stop that. Cheers for any help :) 
What you could do is create a  with  like so -And the data that you are going to have this way will be a dict. For example, if data was -You will have a dictionary as -Now to grab a country, all you need to do is -Will give you a list of activities for SpainAnd since it's a dict, it only takes  to retrieve a list of activities for a country
Instead of editing the file as a string, leave it as a list and edit it. When you go to write the file, convert it back to plain text. This way you will not have to work with string indexing, but a much more robust list indexing that is less susceptible to errors with calculating the exact index of the string.Moreover, you should use  statements as shown below when you work with files.  statements will automatically open and close your files for you and make the code look cleaner.  One last thing is to use the  method to remove unnecessary newline characters. You can also do .
