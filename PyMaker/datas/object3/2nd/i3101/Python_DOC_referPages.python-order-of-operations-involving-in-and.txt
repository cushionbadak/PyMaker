This question already has an answer here:Why does (1 in [1,0] == True) evaluate to False? [duplicate]                    1 answer                I noticed the following strange behavior:How is the first expression parsed? Both placements of parentheses yield different results.(Python 3.6)
From the docs:Note that comparisons, membership tests, and identity tests, all have the same precedence and have a left-to-right chaining feature as described in the Comparisons section. and  are membership and comparison operators respectively.From Comparisons:... expressions like  have the interpretation that is conventional in mathematics:[...]Comparisons can be chained arbitrarily, e.g.,  is equivalent to , except that  is evaluated only once (but in both cases  is not evaluated at all when  is found to be false).
