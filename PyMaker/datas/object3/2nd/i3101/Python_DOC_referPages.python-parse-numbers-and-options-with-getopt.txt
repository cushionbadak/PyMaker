I am trying to add command line options to program. The program should accept both a list of numbers, and parse options. For instance a call to the program could look like:The 4 and the 3 will be processed in one way whereas the v=100 command will set the internal variable v to 100. I found the getopt library is supposed to have this functionality: http://stackabuse.com/command-line-arguments-in-python/ Is there a better/simpler way to do this?When I try to parse the input like the above, I believe getopt should place arguments which trigger its keywords into a special list, and those which do not trigger are placed elsewhere. However, when I try to use getopt following the example above, no matter what I do, the v=100 option does not appear to trigger the special arguments list. When passed to getopt, I expected the 'v=100' string to be split up into argument v and value 100. For instance, the print(arguments,values) command below results in: [] ['4', '3', 'v=100']. There are values, but there are no arguments.Here is my code:
If you can use  the following will work:ExampleUsing the  keyword argument you can set it to '+' requiring one or more numbers. The  with a hyphen is by default optional. If this is not wanted, you can add the  option.UsageFurther readingFor more information about the argparse module you can have a look at:The official tutorial: https://docs.python.org/3/howto/argparse.htmlThe module doc: https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#module-argparse
