I'm trying to apply genetic algorithm for 8 queens puzzle. I've coded whole algorithm but it keeps getting stuck when it finds solution with 6 unhit queens and can't get over it. I feel like there's some diversity problem but I can't figure out what to do with it. My question is what is wrong with this realisation and why it keeps getting stuck on 6 unhit queens and can't make a final move? I've already examined every bit of code and I think there's some misinterpretation of algorithm itself evolved. That's why I attached whole code. So I hope that someone would tell me where I did wrong. Thanks in advance.
One problem with your code is the way you use Python function . The documentation says that  will return a random number  such that  (note that  is not included). When you write something like  you will get a random number from the semi-open interval , while what you (most likely) want is the number from closed interval , because board size is 8x8. So check all calls to , fix them if they are incorrect and see whether it solves the problem.
