I'm trying to do something in a loop (in this example print to 100) and cancel the count at any time by pressing 'Ctrl+C'.The test code I'm using is below, however this doesn't work (EDIT: it works in a script launched from terminal but does not work when run in the python shell of my IDE - Wing 101). KeyboardInterrupt doesn't catch the 'Ctrl+C' command or any other key. I've read this question here and I'm pretty sure that's not my problem because I've put the 'time.sleep(0.5)' command in to slow the program down. I've also read this question but since it's 5 years old now I assume this bug would have been fixed by now? I know that I can use threading to achieve what I want, but if only for the sake of learning I'd like to know why this method doesn't work.I'm using python 2.7.6 in Ubuntu 14.04 and I'd appreciate any help or advice in solving this issue. (EDIT: I know the code works in isolation, but I'd still be interested in knowing why it doesn't work in the python shell of Wing 101 IDE) EDIT 1I've tried putting the while loop inside the try block, as suggested:But unfortunately that doesn't work either, instead I get the following error:
This is a limitation of Wing IDE 101.  The only way to stop a loop like this is to restart the shell.
