Natural Text
I have a process that requires me to identify different machines, and I'm not sure what's the best way to do it.I do not want to save that ID on a text file or something, but I want to generate it from hardware every time I need it (in case the text with the ID gets deleted or something)I've checked UUID, and it seems ok but I'm not sure.I've taken a look at uuid.getNode(), but I have 2 problems with it: One part says "If all attempts to obtain the hardware address fail, we choose a random 48-bit number with its eighth bit set to 1 as recommended in RFC 4122", which means that I may get a different unique on some systems for some reason - is there a way to identify which time it failed and generate something else?another part says: " “Hardware address” means the MAC address of a network interface, and on a machine with multiple network interfaces the MAC address of any one of them may be returned.", which means if i have 2 different network adapters, each call I may get any one of them? that's not good for me.If you have a better way of obtaining a unique ID for a machine, that I can generate each time and won't have to worry about deletion of it or something - I'd be glad to hear it. all of my attempts to find something have failed.Thanks.
You could use .Linux:Windows:NOTE: Requires dmidecode for WindowsCross-platform:NOTE: Requires dmidecode for Windows
Please note that you can get the same UUID from Windows without installing any additional software with the following command:
For windows this seems to get same uuid every time por each device based on the MAC address: str(uuid.uuid1(uuid.getnode(),0))[24:]But it does not seem to keep same ID on Android 4.4.2.
or use bios serialnr
