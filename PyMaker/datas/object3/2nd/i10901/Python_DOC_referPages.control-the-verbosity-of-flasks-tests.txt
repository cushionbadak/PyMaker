I'm running tests for my Flask app from Bash using . In addition to failures and errors, the console prints outfor every single test. That's super annoying when you have a lot of tests. How can I control the verbosity of the printout?
@jonrsharpe was right. I didn't realize that the project was using Flask-Script, which I guess is the reason for the manage.py file. Flask-Script calls unittest with a default verbosity. I reduced the default verbosity and that culled the extra output.
