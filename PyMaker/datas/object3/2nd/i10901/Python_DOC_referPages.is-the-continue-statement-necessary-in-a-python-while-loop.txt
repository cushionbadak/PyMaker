I'm confused about the use of the  statement in a  loop.In this highly upvoted answer,  is used inside a  loop to indicate that the execution should continue (obviously). It's definition also mentions its use in a  loop:continue may only occur syntactically nested in a for or while loopBut in this (also highly upvoted) question about the use of , all examples are given using a  loop.It would also appear, given the tests I've run, that it is completely unnecessary. This code:works just as good as this one:What am I missing?
Here's a really simple example where  actually does something measureable:You'll notice that if you run this, you won't see  printed.  That's because when python sees , it skips the rest of the while suite and starts over from the top.You won't see  or  either because when  is seen, we encounter the break which exits the  suite entirely.With all that said, I'll just say that over 90%1 of loops won't need a  statement.1This is complete guess, I don't have any real data to support this claim :)
 just means skip to the next iteration of the loop. The behavior here is the same because nothing further happens after the  statement anyways.The docs you quoted are just saying that you can only use  inside of a loop structure - outside, it's meaningless.
 is only necessary if you want to jump to the next iteration of a loop without doing the rest of the loop. It has no effect if it's the last statement to be run. exits the loop altogether.An example:result:
