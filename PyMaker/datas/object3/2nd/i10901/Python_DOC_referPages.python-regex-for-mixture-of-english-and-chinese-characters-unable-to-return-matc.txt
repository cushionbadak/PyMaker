Natural Text
I am stuck and need some help in pointing the mistake.I am trying to extract a portion of the html code from a webpage which is done using tables, and with same class and id in many places. Hence I am unable to use only BeautifulSoup4 to extract it. I will need a little regex to extract. Only then to use html parser to extract the info I need based on the returned string from regex. But the problem arises when the regex is unable to work with some of the chinese characters. I have read somewhere it is related to need to change the string to unicode to work, but can't get it to work on myself. Part of the code as below:the error i get is Traceback (most recent call last):  File "C:\Python27\check4d_r5_today.py", line 98, in     matched = mo.group()AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'part of the html code:I think it must have something to do with the Chinese characters, as after I remove it, it returns OK. But leaving the Chinese characters will return matches that I do not want.
This is my suggestion.
