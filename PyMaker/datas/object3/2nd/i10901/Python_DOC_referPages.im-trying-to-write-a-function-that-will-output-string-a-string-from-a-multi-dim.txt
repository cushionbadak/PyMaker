Natural Text
Here's the function that I wrote: This function originally printed the dictionary and worked perfectly. However, I now need it to output a string instead of printing, so I added the CMD_str input argument, so I can keep passing the string into the function until I've made my way through the dictionary. However, it's getting stuck somewhere and I can't figure out why. By printing indent values, I can tell that it runs through about 10 times before getting stuck. Any help would be greatly appreciated. 
You have some duplicate code in your recursive function that could be reorganized for clarity and to lessen the chances of a bug occurring. Here is an example:The output is
Be aware of pprint.Separate work by scopes - your function does some work itself and expects caller to do the same work too, which leads to code duplication. I've reworked your code a bit:Note that the function is supposed to take care of its indentation on each call. However, it's the caller that is supposed to supply  after the text - returned string does not end with .
