I have a CSV with the first column having many duplicate values, and the second column being a predetermined code that maps to a value in the third column, such as this:I'm trying to create a dictionary of dictionaries from a CSV, that would result in the following:My code creates the key values just fine, but the resulting value dictionaries are all empty (though some print statements have shown that they aren't during the run process)...
Use collections.defaultdict for this. is nothing more than a dictionary which initializes values for unknown keys with a default. Here, the default is to initialize a second, new dictionary ( is the dictionary constructor). Thus, you can easily set both mappings in the same line.
You don't need  and you are not setting it to be the value dict anyway. Try this modified version:You can also use  to skip checking for existing keys.
