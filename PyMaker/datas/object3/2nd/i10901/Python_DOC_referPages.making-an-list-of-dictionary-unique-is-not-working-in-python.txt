I have duplicates in list of dictionary but i could not make it unqiue when i use set in pythonErrorHow to make this list of dictionary unique
Python dictionaries are unhashable which means they are mutable containers. They are not integers or strings that are always the same; the order of contents can change but semantically be the same.What you could do is try to change the dictionaries into frozensets, or some other hashable type.
As suggested by Julien in the comments, you can convert to a hashable type like tuple, and then do your unique over that:
