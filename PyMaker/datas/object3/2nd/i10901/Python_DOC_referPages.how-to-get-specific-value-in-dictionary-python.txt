I have dictionary like,I want to get just value of "title" using json decoding method.Note: The value of "98" is dynamic so it changes everytime.How can I achieve this?
If you mean that you have several fields like  but they all contain a title, you could do this:or, as suggested in the comments
I'm going to assume that the "dictionary" you're providing is a string in JSON format and that you want to decode it into a Python object (dictionary) THEN access tittle.If that's the case, the json module is your friend!Documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.htmlPseudo-code
