Python's for loop accepts three arguments in the range of the for loop. How could I manipulate the third argument to be a factor?Now I realize this will go up 2 every time, but how would I make it to where the first value is going to be multiplied by  each time and that is stored in the  value?The desired affect would be (assuming  is set to ) And yes, I know this makes more sense in a while loop.
I would use a  loop as suggested by @Delgan. Nevertheless, if you still prefer to employ a  loop, here's the solution I came up with*: returns the desired list. The th element of the list comprehension is computed as , where the index  varies from  to , being  the smallest integer number that satisfies:Demo:As a final note it is worth pointing out that this approach could be affected by the round off errors associated to floating point arithmetic.* I'm assuming you use Python 3. To get the code working in Python 2 an additional  sentence is needed to avoid integer division errors: 
You cannot do such a thing using the built-in . However, you can define your own generator, like this:
