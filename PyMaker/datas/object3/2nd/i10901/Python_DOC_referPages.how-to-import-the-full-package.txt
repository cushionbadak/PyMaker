This is my app structure using python 3.5 I am full aware I can access test with the following. note I am running this using the following cmd  need access to I can also import it into global scope (bad practice)And I know i can also useBut what I would like to do is import the full module (or package sorry for my terminology)I want to import the full package, example:But I seem to get bonus question If importing the full package is not a good practice then I don't mind being explicit and using , please let me know.PS I have tried adding imports in /app/module/__init__.py because it gets called during the import, but it seems that it doesn't workI added  in   but when I try it test seems empty.As you can see it's missing test_function()
Few additional thoughts to Loading all modules in a folder in Python__init__.pytest.pyrun.pyResultYou can import any modules, sub modules or anything else to make it part of "public" interface of package.UPD: I'm highly recomend you to read packages topic from documentation. As it sad Itâ€™s important to keep in mind that all packages are modules, but not all modules are packages. Or put another way, packages are just a special kind of module. Specifically, any module that contains a  attribute is considered a package.You can think in this way: when you importing module, you are loading all objects from  file, but when you importing package you are loading  file.Packages usually contain so called public interface, which contains only reusable components related to this package without helper functions, etc. In this way packages hides some code from outer scope (where it will be used) while importing.
