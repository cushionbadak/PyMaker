I've put together the following regular expression to extract image ID's from a URL:URL example:I want this bit:I've tested it on regex101 and it works: https://regex101.com/r/eS6eS7/2 contains the correct URL and is not empty. I tested this. When I try to use  I get an exception that  is not a function.  is .Am I doing something wrong?
Two problems:those enclosing  are not a part of Python regex syntaxyou should use  instead of Working example:If you want just the number part, use this (, and note the additional ):
This is the correct python code from Regex101. (There's a code generator on the left). Notice the lack of slashes on the outside of the regex... I'm not sure how you got  as None, but you might need to compile the pattern and use that to match first.    Otherwise, try to fix the expression first
