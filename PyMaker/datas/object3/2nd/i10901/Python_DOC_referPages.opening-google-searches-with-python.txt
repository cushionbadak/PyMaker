I want to make my program open first 5 searches of google. Currently I have only simple google search generator which opens a search. Is there a way to open 5 searches into new tabs then close them ?EDIT:to open new tab, but now could anyone tell me how to click first 5 results which I get from opening some google searchEDITso I figured a way out with lib called googlealso I just decided that I would close them all just with task kill because webbroser lib doesn't have close window command
Use the  function:This should open your URLs each in a new tab, if supported by the browser. If not, it will fall back to opening a new window for each tab.If you have issues getting it to open specifically in Chrome, even as default browser (see here), try replacing the last line with:using the equivalent location of your Chrome install.
