For example: I want to get 2 random numbers from this list and add them together: for example.
For unique selections (sampling without replacement), you can make use of  for selecting multiple random elements from the list and use the built-in . A  will be raised if you attempt to obtain a sample larger than your list (or more generally, population) size. For non-unique selections (sampling with replacement), a simple approach for small samples is just repeatedly calling  for whatever sample size you require. Obviously when sampling with replacement, the sample size can be larger than the size of the population. 
I guess that if you want distinct elements, you can use:
Here you have the solution, but what I'd like to tell you is that you wont go too far in programming by asking that kind of questions. What you need to do before asking is to do some reflexion. for example, if I were you, I would have searched:On google "" > How do I randomly select an item from a list using Python?.    Good luck!
For taking random numbers from the list you can use In your case use
You should use the function:'a' will now be a random number from the list
