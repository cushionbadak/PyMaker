I have a  instance . The only thing I know is that it mocks a class with a  method. I need to determine whether  has been set and if not, provide a default value. Is this possible?In other words, how to implement  below?I have tried checking  directly, but it is initialized to a new mock upon the first access.
As long as you haven't actually accessed  yet, you can test if a non-standard return value has been set with:The moment you use the  property, if  is set to  still, a new  instance is created and stored in  for future re-use.Note that this attribute is an implementation detail, which is why it starts with an underscore. It is not documented and may change in a future release. However, there currently is no other method to check if  has been set explicitly.
