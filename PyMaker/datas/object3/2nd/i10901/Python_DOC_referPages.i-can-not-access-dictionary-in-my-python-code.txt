I tried to access values by doing and that didn't work. I was given an error message saying something like I then tried and all that was returned was I also tried and that didn't work. So while googling and researching python books I saw a values function being used on a dictionary like thisbut when I tried it I got Heres my code for my functionand here is what it returnsI tested it in a json validator, it has double quotes like json is supposed to, it's enclosed in curly brackets.
