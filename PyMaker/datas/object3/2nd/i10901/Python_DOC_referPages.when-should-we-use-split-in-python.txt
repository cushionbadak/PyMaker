So I would like to remove the white space from my integer input and store them into a list.However, the output's still the same when I don't use . Can somebody please explain to me why we should use . I saw a couple of posts on the forum and people also frequently use . I understand  returns all the numbers by eliminating the white space, and  also does the same job.Thanks!
I don't understand the confusion. The  function return a list of all subparts of your string by removing all occurences of the given argument.For example, if you have the following string : "Hello world!" and split this one by split("o") then your output will be : ["Hell", " w", "rld!"]With a code:Then, the output will be :str has type string with the value Hello world!split_str has type list with the value ["Hell", " w", "rld!"]So, if you have a string that represents a sequence of different integers separated by space: you could operate with this solution.It's a very basic use of string so, for the next time, have the reflex to read the doc. It's the first tool that you may read to have your solution.
 returns a list with dividing the input by the split_item will remove the strip_item from leading and trailing end and will return the remaining item.eg: will give  will give You can specify any string inside the  will give  will give  --> same string
