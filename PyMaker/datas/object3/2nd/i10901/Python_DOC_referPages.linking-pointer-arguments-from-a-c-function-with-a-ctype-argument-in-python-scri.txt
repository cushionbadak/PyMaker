The following is a simple code showing division of a number: As shown in the pointer.c, remainder is a pointer type argument whose value will be calculated in the function itself. Can anyone tell me how to get the value linked from this function to the python script as written below:The below is the error that I'm getting.mydll.divide(4,32,3)      Traceback (most recent call last):        File "", line 1, in           mydll.divide(4,32,3)      ctypes.ArgumentError: argument 3: : expected LP_c_long instance instead of int
EditIt looks like you're calling your wrapped divide function with three integer arguments ().  That won't work.  See the below code for how you probably want to specify the third argument.  The rest of my post may be unnecessary, but I'm leaving it anyway for any future readers with different problems.I'd first make sure you're compiling your DLL with the same bitness as your python distribution (e.g. 32 vs. 64 bit).Next, your code has an error in that  should be  (Presumably you're working from here.)Lastly, the following code works for me (under Linux, so using gcc and .so files instead of .dll files):pointer.ctest.pyWhen run, this correctly prints .Notes:Using gcc, this was compiled with: I was able to remove the  because gcc exports all symbols by default, if you're using a different compiler, you may need to leave it in.I didn't use a .h file
