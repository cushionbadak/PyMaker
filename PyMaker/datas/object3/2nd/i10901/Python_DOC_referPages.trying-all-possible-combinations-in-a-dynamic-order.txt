Basically I'm looking for an implementation of  that allows me to change the order in which the combinations are generated.Example: If I use  it generates the combinations in this exact order:I need an implementation that responds to requests like "Please change A to B next", for example like this:Ideally, the generator would accept a list of variables like this:It should then attempt to change the value of , and if that isn't possible, change the value of  instead, and so on.How would I go about implementing this? Is there something in the standard lib that can help me?
Alright, I've managed to write an iterator that does what I want. It's the ugliest piece of code I've ever written, but it gets the job done.I'm still hoping for a better solution though - this implementation keeps a set of all returned combinations, which can grow to use quite a bit of memory.
