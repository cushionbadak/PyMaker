Hi i dident know really how to write the title but i hope i can explain it better.Anyway im making a tool for Cable marking for my work. Its pretty simple the program asks what the Cable name is and how many parts it has. then it should print it out. This is how i want it to work. The program will ask the Cable name lets say Cableone and then it asks how many parts lets say 3 then it should printcableone.1cableone.2cableone.3Now my problem is the last part where it should make the list i dont know how to write it.
