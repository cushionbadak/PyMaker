I have a functioning piece of code that suits my purposes but I wasn't sure if there was a better way to meet the end I am looking for. Here is my code : What this is doing is looking for one of two images and then clicking on whichever ends up being true. Is there any method or function I can use that can determine which of the conditions around the "or" returned true without running a subsequent set of "if" operations? Even if the answer is "No, you need the if statements" I'd appreciate it so I am not going on a wild goose chase for no reason.Thank you for your time!
I'd probably do something like this. You create an infinite loop that repeatedly tries one image, then the other, breaking once one of them suceeds.If you prefer a  loop to a  loop,Or, you can do more with  to avoid an explicit loop altogether.(I'm mildly surprised you can't use  as the predicate to , similar to how you can with .)Update: actually, since  and  already return iterators in Python 3, there's no need to use  and :Bonus content!To take the functional approach to an extreme, you could write the following in coconut:
