I have a binary file that contains 4-byte binary values that represent a set of two  each. I know that I can unpack a single 4-byte binary value into two short integers like this:Now, I want to unpack the entire buffer. For the moment I am doing:Which takes over a minute for a 277MB file and seems to produce a huge memory overhead.I would like to unpack the entire filebuffer directly into the two variables. How do I accomplish this?I suspect that  is my friend, but I am unsure how to formulate the format.only extracts two values, and (i know the number of elements of my file)expects this ridiculous amount of output variables. So:How do I unpack the entire filebuffer directly into the two variables?
I don't know a way to unpack the values directly into two lists, but you can unpack the entire file into a tuple and then slice it in two:Alternatively, use  to create an iterator, which will reduce memory consumption.
I think this might be a faster way to do it:
