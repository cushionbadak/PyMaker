My code is currently looking like this:My goal is that its gonna look something like this: https://gyazo.com/26f997ed05c92898d93adaf0af57d024If you look at my method "welcome", I do want to print my self.spelarlista, just to see how its gonna look, but all I get is "Player object at 0x7fac824....", I realize something is wrong with my str, how should I change it? 
If you are getting  or anything similar, it seems that you are calling the  on the object (indirectly), which in turn calls the object's  method.Since there is no  method defined,  will also default to calling . returns a string representation of the object (usually one that can be converted back to the object, but that's just a convention) which is what you need.
When you print a list of objects python doesn't call the objects  method but the container list. If you want to print them all you can call the  method by applying the built-in function  on them using  or a list comprehension and join them with  method.Or as another alternative approach you can define a  attribute for your objects, which returns the official string representation of an object:
