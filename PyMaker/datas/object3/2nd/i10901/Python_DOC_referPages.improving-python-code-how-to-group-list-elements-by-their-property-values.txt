I have the following piece of code in Python, it is organizing(grouping) playing cards by their ranks. I did this in old-school way but I am sure there is a better way as Python is actually famous of that kind of thing.How can I do the same in shorter and more elegant way?Here is the method code:The idea behind that method is to group cards by their RANKs (not suits). I also decided to have 4 self variables because it is  easier to use than the list. The reason is quite simple: figuring out the hands later on. Having cards grouped by ranks I can then easily check the figure, for instance:and so on, every check is a matter of 1 - 3 lines of code (except Straight which requires loop).
Real improvement is only possible here if you get rid of your , , etc. lists. Whenever you see yourself creating variables like that, you should be using a list instead.The following code does what you want (I omitted the  because it's not relevant to the code):
PEP8 instead of Indent using 4 spaces instead of 8Use lists / dicts and for loops to make it more compact and thus more readable (and less prone to make an error)Add a docstring (I like Numpydoc)So here is the adjusted code:Of course, I can't make really good comments as I don't know what the meaning behind this is. You should replace this by whatever makes sense in this game.
It looks like the number of ranks is pre-determined, judging from the use of variables self.value1 to self.value4.If that is in fact the case, dictionary could come in handy.
(Edited example)I would use a defaultdict:
