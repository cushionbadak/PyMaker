This is printing this OK!!!! :But How can i print this ? :
You can use:This means  will get the following values:(as the list comprehension loops over ). This means that  starts at  and in increments of  it'll increase until it reaches the highest value but no more than . There is a longer explanation in the Python 3 documentation about  which can be helpful to read.This means it'll slice  into the desired segments (the notation  means it'll take the slice from  to  of ). It'll first take the slice , then the slice  and lastly the slice  which are the strings that you're looking for.We're subtracting 1 from the length of  as otherwise we don't end up with the result that we want:

Using  here might actually be counter to the zen of Python ("simple is better than complex").Though the other list comprehensions answers are correct, it takes a while to understand why they work.On the other hand, a code like the following isn't hard to figure out at first glance:
