I have been having trouble with updating this global variable that is an array of strings. This  is supposed to be updated as the rf data is coming in from another device. Now, when I have tested this without sending anything over to the cloud servers, it works (the  gets updated as frequently as the data is being sent) however as soon as I start sending the data, the  array seems to be stuck at the initial array and does not get updated ever again...I need to update the variable (so the  is updated to send over to the cloud servers).
You are running into a race condition. The array is trying to store values before the cloud can send it back. You need to do the operations asynchronously. One solution is to use the callback methods from Python multithreading. Alternatively, you could use some 'locking' mechanism and not execute the rest of the program till you get a response from the cloud.
