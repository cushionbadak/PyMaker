I need to read a large file multiple times and need access to the total number of words in the file. I've implemented a wrapper class that contains an iterator, a copy of the iterator (to reset the iterator) and its length:I then create the actual file reading iterator and start iterating:For some reason though, I get a  while iterating:File "my_script.py", line 164, in my_iter   for line in f:MemoryErrorSince this does not happen without the wrapper, I assume  is to blame. But is there another way to reset the iterator?
The problem here is that if the data is only read once, and must be iterated multiple times, it has to been kept in memory. If the file is large enough to exhaust the memory you will end with a MemoryError. Here the  is indeed the culprit, even if IMHO it is not to blame for it because it has no other way to do ;-)If you cannot keep the data in memory, the only foolproof way would be to open a new file handler for each iterator - provided the OS and file system allow it. That way the memory will only contain one buffer and one line per iterator instead of the whole file.
