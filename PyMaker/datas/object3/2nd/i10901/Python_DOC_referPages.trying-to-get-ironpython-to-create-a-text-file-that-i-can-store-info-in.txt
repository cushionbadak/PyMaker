Natural Text
I'm writing a gui for ironpython and I'm trying create a text file that the user can name in a textbox. The textfile is being used to give me a python script from a vector file. Any suggestions
With the following I was able to create a file with IronPythonHere's the Python documentation about the . It opens the file for writing, truncating the file first.So I guess you just need to insert the name of the file in the script...
I am putting up the code that worked for me when I was writing in python. Hope it helps.
