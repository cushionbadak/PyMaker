I am a beginner so I apologize if my question is very obvious or not worded  correctly.I need to send a request to a URL so data can then be sent back in XLM format.  The URL will have a user specific login and password, so I need to incorporate that as well. Also there is a port (port 80) that I need to include in the request.  Is requests.get the way to go?  I'm not exactly sure where to start.  After receiving the XLM data, I need to process it (store it) on my machine - if anyone also wants to take a stab at that (I am also struggling to understand exactly how XLM data is sent over, is it an entire file?).  Thanks in advance for the help.
Here is a python documentation on how to fetch internet resources using the urllib package. It talks about getting the data, storing it in a file, sending data and some basic authentication. https://docs.python.org/3/howto/urllib2.htmlGetting the URL would look something like this import Note that this is for strings and Python 3 only.Python 2 version can be found here What is the quickest way to HTTP GET in Python?If you want to parse the data you may want to use this https://docs.python.org/2/library/xml.etree.elementtree.htmlI hope this helps! I am not too sure on how you would approach the username and password stuff but these links can hopefully provide you with information on how to do some of the other stuff!
Import the requests library and then call the post method as follows:
