Like some of the comments said, in order to do that, the user needs to either be in the same directory as  or add the  directory to your  variable.  Like this:See also: Import a module from a relative pathFurther down the tutorial, they touch on what you are trying to do, which is intra-package references.  You could use this technique without adding  to your :For example from your  module, this should work to import :
