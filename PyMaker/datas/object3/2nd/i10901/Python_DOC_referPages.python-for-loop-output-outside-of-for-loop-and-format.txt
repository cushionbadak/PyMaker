I'm a Python newbie and I have a few questions. In the below example I want to use the output of x in the for loop outside of the for loop with while maintaining its format.  I tried to append it to a list outside the loop but when I print the appended variable it does not show in the same format.Question 1: How can I use the output of the loop outside the loop in the same format?Question 2: How can I assign the output of the for loop to a variable outside the loop while maintaining the format?Question 3: Is there any quick way to count the number of unique Colors in the final output? For example Red:2, Blue: 2, Green:1, Orange: 1, White: 2, Black: 1, Purple: 2, Indigo: 1The output in the for looks like this:Output after appending looks like this:
You're actually creating two lists when you call . If you want to store them in the list, you need a second loop.With respect to your third question, I would suggest using  as suggested in the comments to the answer:From the Python Collections documentation.
The first output you have is the x's printed line by line. The second output has all of the x's in an array, so that's why they show comma-separated. If you want to print them in the same format, you'll have to run a for loop on my_list, and call print on each line instead of printing the entire array.So,
