I have an "homemade" python package which i can successfully install via pip package manager.I'd like ti distribute it without giving the source code (*.py files)... i tried to compile them withand then installed by typing However it can't find the module when i try to import it in my application.What do you suggest to solve?Thanks
I guess it is to do with setuptools not packaging up  files, because normally you don't want them.You should create a file  with the contentThis tells setuptools to exclude  source files and include  compiled files.Afterwards create a source distribution packageor a wheelwhich also compiles C extensions.
