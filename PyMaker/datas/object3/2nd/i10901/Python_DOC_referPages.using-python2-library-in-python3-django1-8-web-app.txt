I'm trying to use this SDK/API, but it's built for Python2 and I'm working in a Django 1.8.8 / Python 3.5.1 site. I'm sure I could trigger a Python2 script from Python3-Django, but is it safe to pass secure, web-submitted information to it? Is there a better way to handle this altogether? I can't find anything about SecureSubmit in StackExchange, even though it seems to be huge, and I'm not finding much on using mixed Python (Python2 + Python3) libraries at all...Heartland has been around awhile and their SecureSubmit service has APIs for many languages (PHP, .Net, Java, Ruby, Python and nodeJS). If it's better to integrate one of those with my Django site rather than launch a Python2 script, let me know! (I've contacted Heartland, too, but who knows when I'll get a response...)Thanks!
I think it's great you grasped the nettle, I am sure all who use your work will appreciate the ability to use python 3 with this. I am happy to have inspired you to try.
