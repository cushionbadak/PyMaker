I am a beginner working on Django Project.Settings.py file of a Django project contains these two lines:I want to know the difference as I think both are pointing to the same directory. Also it would be great help if you could provide some links os.path functions.
 is pointing to the parent directory of . You can re-write the two definitions as:because the  function simply removes the last segment of a path.In the above, the  name points to the filename of the current module, see the Python datamodel: is the pathname of the file from which the module was loaded, if it was loaded from a file.However, it can be a relative path, so the  function is used to turn that into an absolute path before removing just the filename and storing the full path to the directory the module lives in in .
