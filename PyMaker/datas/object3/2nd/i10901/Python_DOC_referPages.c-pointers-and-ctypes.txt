So, I have C++ class that I wrap in C so I can use it in Python using ctypes.Declaration of C++ class:C wrap:Python script:Result of t.AddC(a, 2, 3) is always some negative integer.There is a problem with a pointer, but I do not know what is a problem.Does anyone have any ideas? 
As  is a static function the pointer is not your problem.You need to pass  values to , and get a double type back:The documentation for ctype explains all this.
As stated in the documentationBy default functions are assumed to return the C int type. Other return types can be specified by setting the  attribute of the function object.So just addand you'll get  instead.
