I have run a websocket on Linux server to serve connected clients using a local network. my aim is to let the client to control some configurations.A Web Application (compounded of PHP and HTML pages) play a roll as an interface,when the home page is loaded it connects to the websocket using pure Javascript an HTML element = input['text'] should send a JSON object that has a key and value like the following: var data = {};   data.key = input_value;   socket.send(JSON.stringify(data));To be more clear: let's say that  is Greeting and  is Hello, So after JSON encoding, the string  will be sent to Server using web socket as mentioned, where the Server stores it in the buffer STDIN until the web socket script read it.Python Script of Web Socket:in one word:How to call function (Greeting)  and pass the argument Hello as input parameter My Web socket is OK, and I can receive the any string from any client,NOTE: I know that I can make a if/else to check the key if it's contained in the array then call the matched function, but it's useless because I have a lot of functions and For..Loop spent undesired time.Sorry for this long question but it's so necessary to solve that problem.I'm grateful for every help or suggestion.
Normally, you'd pack the functions into a dict:And then to call the function,Of course, there might be some improvements that you could make here (e.g. error handling for functions that aren't present, etc).
