I am learning python, and one of the exercises is to make a simple multiplication game, that carries on every time you answer correctly. Although I have made the game work, I would like to be able to count the number of tries so that when I've answered correctly a few times the loop/function should end. My problem is that at the end of the code, the function is called again, the number of tries goes back to what I originally set it, obviously. How could I go about this, so that I can count each loop, and end at a specified number of tries?:
You could surround your call of  at the end with a loop. For example:would allow you to play the game 5 times before the program ends. If you want to actually count which round you're on,  you could create a variable to keep track, and increment that variable each time the game ends (you would put this inside the function definition). 
I would use a  loop and  out of it:Here's some documentation on  clauses for  loops if you want more details on how it works.
