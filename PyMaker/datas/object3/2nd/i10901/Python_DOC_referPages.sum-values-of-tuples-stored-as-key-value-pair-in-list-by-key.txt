I have a list like I want to sum all similar keys and get  in any order is fine.Is there a better way to do this instead of using a dictionary. Preferably using list comprehension something like In Python-3, the last line requires 
This is feasible alternatively with  in a list comprehension, although your approach seems fine and there is no inherent benefit to always using list comprehensions. Getting worked up about an extra line or two of code with no further issues is a fruitless venture, IMHO. It may also make sense to maintain this result as a dictionary instead of a list in case you wish to further add to any of the counts - the dictionary is the more suitable structure. Using the  approach, you are summing the sorted groups based on first tuple elements. Outputs:This would evidently also work (and perhaps be better suited) as a dictionary comprehension
