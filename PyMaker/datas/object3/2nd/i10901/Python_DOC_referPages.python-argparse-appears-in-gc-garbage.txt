I'm trying to debug a memory leak in a python application and I can see a lot of non collected object belonging to the module  Here a minimal script reproducing the errorand I got the following outputI can't find any report of such a problem in argparse, am I doing something wrong?
This lineIs equivalent to sayingAnd by setting ,When set, all unreachable objects found will be appended to garbage rather than being freed.In fact, these would have been freed, had you not set .  (Try your code it without setting )The flag you likely want is , which displays information about objects that are unreachable (and should probably be freed) but cannot be freed by the garbage collector.You could also look at  to help identify circular references that can be freed.
