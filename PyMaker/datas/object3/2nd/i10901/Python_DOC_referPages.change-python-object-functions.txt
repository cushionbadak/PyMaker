I've seen somewhere that there was a way to change some object functions in pythonI wondered if you could do things like in ruby, with the :Can we actually change some predefined classes by applying the function above to the class int for example? If so, any ideas how I could manage to do it? And could you link me the doc of python showing every function (like lshift) that can be changed?
Ordinarily not - as a rule, Python types defined in native code -in CPython can't be monkey patched to have new methods. Although there are means to do that with direct memory access and changing the C object structures, using CPython - that is not considered "clever", "beautiful", much less usable. (check https://github.com/clarete/forbiddenfruit)That said, for class hierarchies you define on your own packages, that pretty much works - any magic "dunder" method that is set changes the behavior for all objects of that class, in all the process. So, you can't do that to Python's "int" - but you can have a Will result in  being printed.The Python document thta tells about all the magic methods taht are used by the language is the Data Model:https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html
