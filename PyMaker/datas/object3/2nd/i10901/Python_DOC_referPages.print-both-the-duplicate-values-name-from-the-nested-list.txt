I'm trying to solve a task and i'm new in python.I am not getting what i want can anyone explain me how one can do it 
One option would be to group the values into a :
I would do it like that:Explain:I grab an object from the original list . Object is  and its  on the first iteration for example.Then i slice the list  to create another one in memory that contains all the elements of the original one apart from I check to see if there is any item in the newly created list that has the same  index value as that of . If yes, i append the  value to a third list that holds the results.I do this for as many elements as there are originally in the  list.Can anybody provide a list comprehension for the above?
