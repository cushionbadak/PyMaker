So in the event that you have several optional arguments in a class, how would you loop over the optional arguments to set their values after the base instantiation is done? Also looking for any recommendations of more pythonic ways to handle this code overall. Thanks!required args:... etc.optional args:init of mysmtp:main function to instantiate mysmtpoptional argumentstrying to simplifiy setting all of these params if they are present without having a million if's:how would i expand the value of  in the for loop and place it in ?when  runs it appears that all of the optional variables are not getting set by the loop in , so their value is blank as they are default set in :full source code below. 
This is what you might be looking for. You can use  when you're not sure in the problem how many arguments might pass to your function. It allows you pass an arbitrary number of arguments to your function
