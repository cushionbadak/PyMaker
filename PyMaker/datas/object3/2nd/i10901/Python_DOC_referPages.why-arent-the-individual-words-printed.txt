Natural Text
I am writing a mini program and within my program there is a function which reads in a text file and returns the individual words from the sentence. However I am having trouble seeing the individual words printed even though I return them. I don't really get why unless I have a big problem with my whitespace. Can you please help? For your information I am only a beginner. The program asks the user for an input of a filename the program then reads the file in the function should then turn the fie into a list and find the individual words from the list and stores them in that listSorry I am using notepad:
it seems you only have one word for each line in your file.--update---if you have more than one word in each line and separated by space
In fact, I can not reproduce you problem. Given a proper CSV input file 1) such asyour program prints this, which apart from the last  seems fine:However, you can significantly simplify your code.instead of appending a  to each line, and then joining by , just join by  (this will also get rid of that last )do the  directly in , using a generator expressioninstead of  and then , use a double-for-loop list comprehension:instead of doing all this by hand, use the  module:assuming that order is not important, use a  to remove duplicates:and if order is important, you can (ab)use :use  to open and close the filePutting it all together:1) Update: The reason why it does not work on your "Example text..." file shown in your edit is because that is not a CSV file. CSV mean "comma separated values", but the words in that file a separated by spaces, so you will have to  by spaces instead of by commas:
If all you want is a list of each word that occurs in the text, you are doing far too much work.  You want something like this:
You can simplify your code by using a  because it will only contain unique elements.The output for a file with the contents:is
