I have a list which contains several large I want to only keep a slice of each of those arrays, and clear my system memory. I have tried using the keywords  and  but those do not seem to have any effect (I use the fedora system monitor to monitor RAM usage).The issue is that I want to save my slices using  but I run out of memory, hence my question.For example I have:And I would like to end up with:So I have tried to doandbut none of those seems to work.EDIT : I run out of memory when using the  function, not when slicing my array. I want to free some memory before calling  so it does not get killed by the system.
You can achieve this by transposing the list twice: returns:If you save this in a new value you should be able to just delete the old array.You can then trigger the garbage collection to remove unreference values with the  package (see documentation):
