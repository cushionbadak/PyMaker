Please read my code for better understanding of my question. I'm creating a to do list in python. In the while loop where there's try and except, I want to set the user input type as string. And if the user types in an integer I want to print out the message in the "except" block. But it doesn't execute the ValueError if the I type in an integer when I run the code. Here's the code:
 returns a string. See the docs for the  function. Casting the result of this function to a string won't do anything.You could use  to check if the string is a numeric.This would fit in nicely with your existing  clause.
Two problems with your assumptions:Calling  on an integer will not raise a  because every integer can be represented as a string.Everything coming back from  (on Python 3 anyway, which it looks like you're using) is already a string. Casting a string to a string will definitely not throw an error.You might want to use  if you want to throw out all-numeric input.There seems to be some confusion in the comments over the word 'all-numeric'. I mean a string that is entirely composed of numbers, which was my interpretation of the OP not wanting "integers" on his to-do list. If you want to throw out some broader class of stringified numbers (signed integers, floats, scientific notation),  is not the method for you. :)
In Python,  always returns a string.  For example:So  won't throw a ValueError in this case--it's already a string.If you really want to check and make sure the user didn't enter just numbers you probably want to check to see if your input is all digits, and then error out.
