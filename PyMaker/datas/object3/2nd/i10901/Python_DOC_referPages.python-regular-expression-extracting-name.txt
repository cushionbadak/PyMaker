I'm using a Python script to read data from our corporate instance of JIRA. There is a value that is returned as a string and I need to figure out how to extract one bit of info from it. What I need is the 'name= ....' and I just need the numbers from that result.I just need the 2016.2.4 portion of it. This number will not always be the same either.Any thoughts as how to do this with RE? I'm new to regular expressions and would appreciate any help.
A simple regular expression can do the trick: .The primary part of the regex is  which will search for any digit () or period () in succession ().Now, to use this:
Use a capturing group to extract the version name:where  is a capturing group matching one or more digits or dots, parenthesis define a capturing group.A non-regex option would involve some splitting by ,  and :This, of course, needs testing and error handling.
