I'm trying to create an output that would look something like this: As can be seeing in here, the left column spaces are lined up to the left and the right column is lined up from the right side. But for my output, I am getting left column lined up to the right side and right column lined up to the left. I want to do vice versa. Here is the output of what I am actually getting out of my second code where I have tried to use the format function:  It works but I am just trying to learn adjusting and formatting spacing when the string output moves.  It would also be nice to know how to do it if I were to have more than 3 variables.Here is my initial code where I attempted to do that but the spacing is screwed up but the left column in here lies perfectly fine, but the spacing can be seeing on the right side after the output increases to double digits.Output:I'm new to python so still a complete noob. I would really appreciate the explanation of how to deal with format or weather there is alternatives to it.Thank you!Code:
Give this a try:The big gnarly print is just because I tried to parameterize everything. Given the fixed column names and spacing, you could just do this:EDITCloser to your original code:
Check out The Docs Section 7.1.3.1You can pass  a  as int, which should take care of your whitespace problem.From the Documentation Example:produces: 
You can use this one.The value 3 can also be made dynamic by use  which is more flexible than  construct.
