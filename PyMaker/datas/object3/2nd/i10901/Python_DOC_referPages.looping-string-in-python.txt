I need to do the same analysis on 2000 data files which has a name like abc_0.dat, abc_1.dat .... abc_1999.dat. I wonder is there anyway to make a loop for this kind of problem in python. Here is the script I was working on. Most of the script are just draft to illustrate the concept of the script
Your question is really badly phrased, but if i get the gist of what you're saying, here's a better way.(Ensure all the files are in the same directory).etc.
I have solved the problem with for loop and combining string.
