If I have an iteration like:Is  possible to be a dictionary in this case? If possible, could you please give me an example of what  will look like?
 cannot be a  as dictionary keys must be hashable types. Since dictionaries are themselves not hashable, they can not serve as keys to another dictionary.iterates over the dictionary keys and will yield the same result as You can however have a dictionary nested as a value of another dictionary:
Dictionaries are an unhashable type in Python so another dictionary cannot be used for as a key (or index) to a parent dictionary but it can be used as a value. That dictionary would look something like this:And if you wanted to loop over it and select the dictionaries rather than the keys the code would look something like this:Which if you've been following along with the example should just output .It wasn't part of your question but I'd recommend using a tuple for the kind of data storage and access you want, and if you'd like I can show you how to do that as well.
