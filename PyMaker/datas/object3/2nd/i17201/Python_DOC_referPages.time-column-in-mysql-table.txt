I want to store a time value in a mysql table, it is 1345 hours and 55 minutes. What type should column have?And if I want to pass a time variable from python to this column using  module, which time type should i use in python? ?
Generally speaking, one can use MySQL's  datatype to store time values:MySQL retrieves and displays  values in  format (or  format for large hours values).  values may range from  to .Obviously, in your case, this is insufficient for the range of values required.  I would therefore suggest that you instead convert the value to an integer number of minutes and store the result in an 4-byte  column (capable of storing values in the range 0 to 4294967295, representing 0:00 to 71582788:15).
