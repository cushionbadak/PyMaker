Or may be I am calculating it wrongAny idea what is wrong? How do I find out which one is causing problem.UPDATE:-Below error I got - 
There is no error in your json text.You can get the error if you copy-paste the string into your Python source code as a string literal. In that case  is interpreted as a single character (newline). You can fix it by using raw-string literals instead (, Use triple-quotes  to avoid escaping  quotes inside the string literal).
The control character can be allowed inside a string as follows,You can find this in the docs for python 2, or the docs for python 3If strict is false ( is the default), then control characters will be allowed inside strings. Control characters in this context are those with character codes in the 0â€“31 range, including  (tab), ,  and .
Escape your newlines.Works for me.  Also, if you get an error like this in the future, a debugging technique you can use is to shorten the string to something that works and slowly add data until it doesn't.
