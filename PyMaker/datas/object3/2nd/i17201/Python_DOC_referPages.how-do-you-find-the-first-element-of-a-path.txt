I just downloaded Python 3.4 and I'm wondering how you would go about finding the first directory of a relative path?  I.e. given the path  I would like to print .The closest I've gotten is:or in both cases the  part is a bit magical.  I've read the docs and the PEP, and haven't found any better way.. did I miss something obvious?
Use  attribute:
Path.parts is what you need.
From the documentation,  gives you an immutable sequence providing access to the logical ancestors of the path; the last element of that sequence would be the logical root, and the second to last element would then be the first directory in the path, which is what you're looking for. That is why you need to use the  shortcut ('-2' is for the 'second to last' element of a list).Note that  always gives you full formed paths. If you only want the directory name you might want to use  instead. In that case the first element is the logical root, so you'd want .
