I am a python newbie and have a question. Why can a if allow a brackets and not for. First one and third one are valid syntax but not second one.
Because  isn't syntactically correct.Lets assume  was parsed anyway, it would return a boolean. So then you're trying to say  or , and booleans can't be iterated, and it's invalid syntax.The reason why your other examples work is because they expect a boolean, which is what is returned from  and 
 expects a value ( of ). You can put parenthesis around any values:  is a fixed syntax which does not expect a value single value, but rather two inputs:a variable namewhat you will iterate overSo why would the Python language allow extra parenthesis there?As someone had pointed on a now deleted answer (why?), this is the syntax for the  statement: http://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-for-statement :
