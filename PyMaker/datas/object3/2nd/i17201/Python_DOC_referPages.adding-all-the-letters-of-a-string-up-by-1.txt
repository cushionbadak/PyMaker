When I input  I would like to get  as output. So I want  to be  and  to be  and so on upto  which will be . So how would I go about doing this I have not the slightest clue.
You can use  to directly change a letter to a different letter:
You can use  function to get the code point of the character and then increment it by 1, convert it back to the character with  function. Finally, join all the characters with  function, like thisThe special case of  can be handled like this
Using reduce:output:EDIT:For corner case:
You can use the  function in python to get the codepoint of a character, and then  to turn a codepoint back into a char. For ASCII characters, the codepoints of the letters are continuous and sequential in alphabetic order, so for instance , etc. So you can do something like this (written our in long form for clarity, but it can easily be shortened with list comprehension):That's the basic case, but you will also need to handle wrapping from  to , presumably. You may need to do some error handling in case a char is outside of the valid range. You can do that like this:
Edit: code below only works in Python 2, in Python 3 the module is named  and  is a function.Use . Following is for letters a-z only, not A-Z, left as exercise:
