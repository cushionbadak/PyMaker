I know you can use syntax like . To me, it looks like  is being used here to create a tuple, such that the code is effectively . But that is just an uneducated guess.
 is a list of tuples, which the  statement iterates over. On each iteration,  is assigned the first element of the tuple (the strings  and ), and  sets  to a tuple consisting of the rest of the tuple (e.g. ). These are then spread as arguments when calling  and .
means taken each element in the iterable . That element will be iterable.Put the first element of that element in , and put the rest in a tuple named .means pass of the members of  to  as arguments.So the listcauses
This is a feature available in Python 3+.Similarly,The python interpreter creates a list of appropriate size for the variable beginning with . I hope the purpose of  in the above loop is now clear.
