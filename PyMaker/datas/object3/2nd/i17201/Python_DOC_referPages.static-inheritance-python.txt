I'm trying to make some kind of static inheritance happen.The code below prints "nope".I'm not sure how to explain myself but what I want is thatclass A uses B's method if it exists.
 as a closure reference was never meant to be used as a reference to the current instance type; it'll always refer to the class you defined a method on (e.g.  for ). It is a internal implementation detail used by the  function. Don't use it here.Use  instead;
