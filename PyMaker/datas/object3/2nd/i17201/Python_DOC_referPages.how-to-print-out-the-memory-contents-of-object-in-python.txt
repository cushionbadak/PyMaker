As in C/C++, we can print the memory content of a variable as below:Yes, I know we can use pickle.dump() to serialize a object, but it seems generated a lot redundant things..How can we achieve this in python in a pure way?
The internal memory representation of a Python object cannot be reached from the Python code logical level and you'd need to write a C extension.If you're designing your own serialization protocol then may be the struct module is what you're looking for. It allows converting from Python values to binary data and back in the format you specify. For examplewill display  because those are the byte values for the double precision representation of 3.14.NOTE:  returns a  object in Python 3.x but an  object in Python 2.x. To see the numeric code of the bytes in Python 2.x you need to use  instead.
You can not do this in pure python. But you could write a Python extension module in C that does exactly what you ask for. But it would probably will not be very useful. You can read more about extension modules hereI assume that by Python you mean C-Python, and not PyPy, Jython or IronPython.
