Please see the code,why list(w) properly display  ,and  display nothing ?
In Python 3,  returns an iterator1.Make an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables.An iterator remembers to where it has been iterated; at the  line, the iterator is already "at the end" and thus results in an empty list/sequence.Try with , which would force the iterator to a list once.1 The zip from Python 2 returns a list, and thus this behavior is only exhibited in Python 3.
