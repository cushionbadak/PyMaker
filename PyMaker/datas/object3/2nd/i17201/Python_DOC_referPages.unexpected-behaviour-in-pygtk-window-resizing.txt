I am writing some code to obtain the size of the physical screen and use those dimensions to resize my window :With line1,line2,line3 commented out of the code, a regular window with  is displayed on screen. But with the aforesaid lines included in the code, a calendar is displayed for some reason! Also an error is thrown :There's no mention of any arguments for  or  in the docs.What's happening?
You are using a class instead of an instance in two locations, line1 and line2, try gtk.gdk.screen_get_default() instead of gtk.gdk.Screen in both locations.
