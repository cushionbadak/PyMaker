I use Python 3 and PyQt5. Here's my test PyQt5 program, focus on the last 2 lines:I know  is a language keyword in Python. But code on Official PyQt5 Documentation (specifically the Object Destruction on Exit part). I see that example shows use of  which confuses me.When I tested it on my machine. I found there is no any visible difference from my end. Both with and without  produces the same output in no time difference.My question is:Is there anything wrong going when I use ? like clashing with Python's internal ? I suspect because both 's are executing something.If not, can I use both interchangeably?
That's because until Python 3,  was a reserved keyword, so the PyQt devs added underscore to it. From Python 3 onwards,  is no longer a reserved keyword (because it is a builtin function; same situation as ), so it made sense in PyQt5 to provide a version without an underscore to be consistent with C++ docs, but keep a version with underscore for backwards compatibility. So for PyQt5 with Python 3, the two  functions are the same. For older PyQt, only  is available. 
On the question of whether to prefer one over the other: using  means you have one less thing to worry about if you ever decide to add support for PyQt4 and/or Python >= 2.6, and want to maintain a single code-base.
