First of all, I'm a total noob at this. I've been working on setting up a small GUI app to play with database, mostly microsoft Excel files with large numbers of rows. I want to be able to display a portion of it, I wanna be able to choose the columns I'm working with trought the menu so I can perform different task very efficiently. I've been looking into the .CSV files. I can create some sort of list or dictionnarie with it (Not sure) or I could just import the excel table into a database then do w/e I need to with my GUI. Now my question is, for this type of task i just described, wich of the 2 methods would be best suited ? (Feel free to tell me if there is a better one) 
It will depend upon the requirements of you application and how you plan to extend or maintain it in the future. A few points in favour of sqlite:standardized interface, SQL - with CSV you would create some custom logic to select columns or filter rowsperformance on bigger data sets - it might be difficult to load 10M rows of CSV into memory, whereas handling 10M rows in sqlite won't be a problemsqlite3 is in the python standard library (but then, CSV is too)That said, also take a look at pandas, which makes working with tabular data that fits in memory a breeze. Plus pandas will happily import data directly from Excel and other sources: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/io.html
