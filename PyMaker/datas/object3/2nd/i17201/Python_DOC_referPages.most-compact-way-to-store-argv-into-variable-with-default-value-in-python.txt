Perl has the following syntax:So when the code has no argument it will automatically take  as the value for .What's the Python way to do it?

It seems slight overkill for a single argument but it gives you a usage message and an obvious way to expand the code when you want to add options, extra arguments, and so on.You get some helpful functionality immediately:

Note that it will raise an exception if  itself is empty.See the docs for more information on truth value and Python's Boolean operators.
You can create simple function to make it more compact:Then:
