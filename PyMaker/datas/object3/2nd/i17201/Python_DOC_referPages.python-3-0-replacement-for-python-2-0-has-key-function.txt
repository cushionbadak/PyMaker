My program works in Python 2.0 but I need it to work in 3.0 or higher. The problem is that the new Python does not have the  function anymore. I need to know how to fix this so it will work in the new version.
Use  for key testing:and replace  with ; in this case a plain  would suffice (in either Python 2 or 3).Your code, rewritten a little more compactly with more current techniques, replacing  with a  object:although you could also use  to list keys in order by frequency (high to low) instead.You may want to read the Python porting guide if you are porting code from Python 2 to 3.
