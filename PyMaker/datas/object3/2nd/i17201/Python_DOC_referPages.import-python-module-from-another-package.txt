I have a script with the following structureI want to use module.py both on foo and bar package, but i can't find a way to import it!I can put the module inside both packages, but if I need to make any alteration I would have to do it on both.
This is actually somewhat tricky, assuming we have structure like this:the correct way to get objects from  in  is by adding:and then running some_foo from top level directory as a module, with  option like so:add some print statements to  to test it, if everything goes right you should see some output from something.py after running some_foo. Remember you need to run some_foo from top level, not from foo directory.
Put the  next to .More information http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html?highlight=packages#packages
If  works then  should work in your case too.If you need to use  to import  then you could use  to import .
