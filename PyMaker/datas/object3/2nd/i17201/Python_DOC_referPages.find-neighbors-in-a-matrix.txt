Here is a 7x7 matrix:The numbers  â€¦ are the values of the positions.If a radius, the number of row and the number of column are given, how to find the neighbors?For example, function  should return a matrix: should return a matrix:When the neighbor is out of boundary, its value should be 0.For example,  should return a matrixI've been thing about this problem for 3 days, but I still can't develop a solution for it.
It might be hard in other languages but in Python this is quite easy. Here is a function that can do what you asked for:Here is a 2D list:See List comprehensions.
My original solution was not correct, @Gnijuohz's is correct.  The following is exactly @Gnijuohz's solution except that the function takes a matrix ( of s) as the first argument and the list comprehension has been replaced by nested  loops.
I like to use a bounds checking function when doing operations on 2d arrays.  This code doesn't do exactly what you want (It starts from the upper left corner), but it should be enough to boost you along.
