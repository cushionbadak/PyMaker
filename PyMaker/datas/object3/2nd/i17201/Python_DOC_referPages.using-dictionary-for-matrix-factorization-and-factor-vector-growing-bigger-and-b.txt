I'm trying to build a toy recommend system using latent factor model. So I simply copy the code from (http://www.quuxlabs.com/blog/2010/09/matrix-factorization-a-simple-tutorial-and-implementation-in-python/) and run it. Everything is just fine. Then I rewrite the code using dictionary and something goes wrong and I can't figure it out.The original code is here:You can see error is smaller in each step. And my code:Almost the same as previous section. The only difference is I wrote it using dictionary. But it shows:The error is becoming bigger in each step.I'm so confused about it. Thank you very much for your time!
The replacement of the  function with the  function seems to be done in the wrong way. Also I think that  should be .I changed the function  as follows, then the result seems right and you can see that error is smaller in each step. 
I think this one is better
