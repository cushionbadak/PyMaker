I understand that functions are useful for code which will be used multiple times so I tried creating a function to save myself time and make my code look neater. The function I had looks like this:However, I am not sure how to return these variables as they are local(?). Therefore, I can not use these variables outside the function. I am just wondering if someone could help edit this function in a way where I could use the drawnCard and drawnCardValue variables outside the function?
Use :Note, you could also write  this way:These two functions behave differently if  contains duplicates, however.  would always return the first index, so  would always correspond to the first item which is a duplicate. It would never return the second value (which in theory could be different.)If you use  then every item in  has an equal chance of being selected -- assuming .
