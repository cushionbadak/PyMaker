I have a list that contains other lists with coordinates for multiple tile positions and I need to check if that list contains another list of coordinates, like in this example:Can you please help me find out how to do this?
Just use a containment test:This returns  for your sample data:
Just use the  operator:From the docs:The operators  and  test for membership.  evaluates to  true if  is a member of , and false otherwise.  returns  the negation of .
Use the  keyword to determine if a  (or any other Python container) contains an element:returnsSo if you do:Your code will then .I need to know if totalList contains a list that has exactly the same elements as redList.We see that list implements and from the docs:Called to implement membership test operators. Should return true if item is in self, false otherwise. And:The operators in and not in test for collection membership. x in s evaluates to true if x is a member of the collection s, and false otherwise. x not in s returns the negation of x in s. The collection membership test has traditionally been bound to sequences; an object is a member of a collection if the collection is a sequence and contains an element equal to that object. However, it make sense for many other object types to support membership tests without being a sequence. In particular, dictionaries (for keys) and sets support membership testing.For the list and tuple types, x in y is true if and only if there  exists an index i such that x == y[i] is true.So we know that one of the elements must be equal to that of redList.
