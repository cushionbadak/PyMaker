In Filemanager (Linux and Windows) I can right click a file and see its properties. I would like to set them using Python. It seems complicated. With os.stat(file) I can retrieve standard file properties, but I can not set (custom) properties. There seems to be a solutions, for C# Retrieve metadata column feilds , and for VisualBasic How do I add a custom property to a file using VBScript but I could not find anything for Python. Your help is much appreciated. Python is polymorphous, so I would expect :but this does not work.
Check out this answer.With a few modules you can change e.g. the creation time by @Claudiu's solution:pywin32, which includes pywintypes etc, is available from here. I'm not sure if there is specific documentation for pywin32, but these types of modules are usually wrappers around the MS API, e.g. for VBA or C#. So it's often quite easy to find answers in the e.g. MS C# docs (based on my experience with office applications). This might help you to set any arbitrary file property.
Do not try to set metadata for files in Python. Because even if it would be possible, copying the file might lose the metadata, see http://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#module-shutil  This mean using metadata will result to unpredictable results. Which is bad. Better something is not possible at all, then being unpredictable.Work around :I created an addition textfile meta.txt and archived these files using :Not beautiful at all. But this archive file can be copied, without the change loosing metadata. When un-archived all metadata of the file are accessible.
