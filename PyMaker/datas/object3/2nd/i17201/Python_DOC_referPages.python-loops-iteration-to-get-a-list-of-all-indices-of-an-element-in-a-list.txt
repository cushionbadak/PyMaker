I am trying to write a function which consumes a string and a character and produces a list of indices for all occurrences of that character in that string.So far this is what I have, but it always gives me [].I don't understand why this does not yield the answer. And it has to be a list of non-empty length.Anyone aware of how to get the indices for all occurrences?
You're returning on the first iteration of your -loop. Make sure the  statement is outside the scope of the loop.Also, be sure to put  before the -loop. Otherwise, you're effectively resetting the list on each iteration of loop.There is also a problem with . This will always return the index of the first occurrence of , which isn't what you want. You should keep track of an index as you are looping (e.g. with ).And I'm not sure what you were trying to do with the sort; looping through the original string should be sufficient.Lastly, note that you can loop over a string directly; you don't need to convert it to a list (i.e.  is unnecessary).Note that your task can be accomplished with a simple list comprehension:
You could implement it using a quick list comprehension.or by using a for loop instead:
You are returning a on the first loop of your for loop iteration.Change for loop to this for starters:
