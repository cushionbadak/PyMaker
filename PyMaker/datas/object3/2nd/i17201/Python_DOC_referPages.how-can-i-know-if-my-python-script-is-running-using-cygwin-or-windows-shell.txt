I have a python script named  that I start in a CygWin shell by doing:I am planning to create a shell script (I don't know yet if I will use Windows shell script or a CygWin script) that needs to know if this  python script is running.But if I do in CygWin (while  is running):and in Windows shell:So it seems I have no info about the  file being executed. All I know is that python is running something.The  (long) option for 'ps' on CygWin does not find my  file. Nor does it the  (verbose) switch at .What should be the appropriate shell (Windows or CygWin shell would enough; both if possible would be fine) way to programmatically find if an specific python script is executing right now?  NOTE: The python process could be started by another user. Even from a user not logged in a GUI shell, and, even more, the "SYSTEM" (privileged) Windows user.
It is a limitation of the platform. You probably need to use some low level API to retrieve the process info. You can take a look at this one: Getting the command line arguments of another process in WindowsYou can probably use win32api module to access these APIs.(Sorry, away from a Windows PC so I can't try it out)
Since  is your script, you could modify it to create a file in an accessible location when it starts and to delete the file when it finishes. Your shell script can then check for the existence of that file to find out if  is running. (EDIT)Thanks to the commenters who suggested that while the presence or absence of the file is an unreliable indicator, a file's lock status is not.I wrote the following Python script :... and ran it in a Cygwin console window on my Windows PC. At the same time, I had another Cygwin console window open in the same directory.First, after I started :... then after I had shut down  by using :Thus, it appears that Windows is locking the file while the  script is running but it is unlocked when it is stopped with . The equivalent test can be carried out in Python with the following script:... which correctly reports:... when  is running but successfully removes the locked file when  has been stopped with a .Note that this approach works in Windows but it won't work in Unix because, according to the Python documentation:On Windows, attempting to remove a file that is in use causes   an exception to be raised; on Unix, the directory entry is removed   but the storage allocated to the file is not made available until   the original file is no longer in use.A platform-independent solution using an additional Python module FileLock is described in Locking a file in Python.(FURTHER EDIT)It appears that the OP didn't necessarily want a solution in Python. An alternative would be to do this in . Here is :The script  just runs a time-consuming operation:Now, while  is running, we can test the lock status using another variant on :The first two attempts to lock the file failed because  was still running and so the file was locked. The last attempt succeeded because  had finished running.
