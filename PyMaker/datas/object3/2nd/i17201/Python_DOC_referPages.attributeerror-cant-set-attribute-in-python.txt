Natural Text
Here is my codeIn the last line I cant set the  value to  as I want, and am getting the error I don't know what's wrong but it must be something based on syntax as using statements like  is also showing same error. I'm new to Python, so please suggest a way to make the above change possible.
(Note: Don't be discouraged to use this solution because of the leading underscore in the function _replace. Specifically for namedtuple some functions have leading underscore which is not for indicating they are meant to be "private")
