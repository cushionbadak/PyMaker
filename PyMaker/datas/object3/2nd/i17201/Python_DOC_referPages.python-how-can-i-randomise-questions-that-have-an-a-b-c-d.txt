My aim is to have it so it can randomise questions. For example, the test starts and the first question could be question 8. The word  is only a comment at a moment. I want it to look like this:Here is the code:
You could put answers in a list and call  on it:Each time you run it, it may produce different output e.g.:
You could hold all of your questions in a list of dictionaries:Now you can give the user a given number of randomly-selected questions each time:And then ask the question:and present the answers in a random order, storing each against the corresponding key (, , , etc.) in :Take the user's input:And finally check whether they're correct and report back:This supports the possibility of multiple correct answers for a single question, and hard-codes as little as possible so the whole thing is configured by . That reduces repetition of code, and makes it easier to find bugs later on.Example output (for  and  as shown above):
you can do simple one pulling information from files like so,
Name .Then choose one from or shuffle these  randomly.For example:If you want to shuffle choices in the question.You can do same above.Output:As you can see in the output, it seems you shouldn't hard-code the name of choices. You should add A,B,C,D after shuffling.
