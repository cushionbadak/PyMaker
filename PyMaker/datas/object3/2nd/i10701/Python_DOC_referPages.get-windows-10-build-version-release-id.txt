I want to get Windows build version. I have searched everywhere for this, but to no avail.No, I don't want to know if it's 7, 8, 10, or whatever. I don't want the Windows build number. I want to know the Windows build version (1507, 1511, 1607, etc.)I am not sure what the official name of this would be, but here is an image of what I'm asking for:I tried using the ,  and  modules, but I can't seem to find anything built-in that can do this.
It seems you are looking for the  which is different from the build number.You can find it by query the value of  in  registry key. You can query the value using  module:or REG command:
The build number is sufficient and can be found with:or the platform module. Match the build with the table at this link to determine the  you'd like to target:https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10_version_historyIn this case  corresponds to TH2 and build :
You can use ctypes and GetVersionEx from  to find the build number.
I don't know of any libraries that will give you this value directly, but you can parse the command window output when you open a new command window via .The boot screen for the command window has the version/build data on the first line.  I'm running version 6.1, build 7601, according to the following output from :And when I run , I see that I'm running Windows 7, Version 6.1, Build 7601: SP1:Which ties to the interpretation of the first line in the output from .
