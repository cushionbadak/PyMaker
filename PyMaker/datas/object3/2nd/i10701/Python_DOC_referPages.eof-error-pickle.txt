I am looping through a list of Pickled files and some of my files have EOF Errors, which means they did not write properly. Is there a way to loop around the files that have these errors and continue to the next file instead of the entire script stopping?
Use :
First of all, ensure that you are opening the pickle files in binary mode as this is a potential cause of EOF errors when reading/writing pickle data.When you are reading the pickle files use  mode when calling . Similarly, if it is your code that is writing the pickle files, ensure that the files are written in binary mode by specifying mode .Secondly catch the exception and ignore it, where "ignore" means that you issue a warning message so any genuinely bad pickle files will be noticed.
