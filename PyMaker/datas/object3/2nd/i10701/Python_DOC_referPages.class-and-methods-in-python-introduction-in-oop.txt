You don't actually need it since you now have access to .Will output
You need to declare  ->  as an instance method (by passing in ) to be able to access the instance variable . Sample output:Please note however, that the first parameter in a function within a class is reserved for either a class, or object to pass itself to (unless a  tag is applied to the method, then the first implicit parameter is not passed; which essentially behave as module methods).Also keep in mind that  is not a reserved word, so you could name it anything (even though  is PEP convention). The below example executes the same output as the example above, and is semantically the same. 9.3.5. Class and Instance Variables
Your problem is that your giving your introduction method the parameter , but never supplying it with a  valid argument.You can simply do:your giving the introduction method, the variable from your class .But the above is not even necessary.
