I have 2 questions about Python3 and PySerial (serial module).I must send data over USB port to my IC's stand-alone ATMega32. A possible snippet code:Now if I try to send "first_data" with "ValueToWrite=firts_data" I have this error:Well. Reading documentation about method write (class serial.Serial - http://pyserial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyserial_api.html) I see:Write the bytes data to the port. This should be of type bytes (or compatible such as bytearray or memoryview). Unicode strings must be encoded (e.g. 'hello'.encode('utf-8').My first question: I don't understand how to send my float and int data. How to convert them into string?My second question: I'd like to send data all together, a unique value like this:99.7F100S56.7TIn this case, using ATMega's Firmware, I can split and update data in the corresponding variables, when encountered "F" character for the first data, "S" character for the second data and so on.How to do this in Python3 using pyserial?
converting float, int or most other non-strings to strings by using the string function, e.g. in your case would output '99.7' (a string).by using the string format method, e.g. would output '99.7F100S56.7T'These strings you can use as parameters to serial.send
