Natural Text
The arrays are as belowI would like the data to look like the information below in a text file called star.txt.Can anyone please help?
How's this?OutputFile  in same folder with the following contents:For the record it would be nice if you used more descriptive variable names than , , etc. so that I could use more descriptive variable names than , , etc.
Disclaimer: as soon as you are already using NumPy i would use vectorized approach, i.e. (no loops, use NumPy's or pandas's power to do it for you) You can use  function as @pathoren has mentioned in the comment:or using pandas module:NOTE: i would NOT recommend you to use space/TAB delimited text as it might cause problems in future (for example when you will need to read/parse this file and if you will have stars that have multiple words in their names)
It's so simple it hardly worth pointing out that you should really be able to work this out yourself.  I suggest you follow a basic Python tutorial, there are plenty on the web.    There are several solutions, here is mine:That assumes Python 3.
