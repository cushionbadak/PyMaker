Natural Text
I'm using Tweepy streamer to collect some tweets for certain tags, in this case #python.  The streamer part of the script works fine but where I'm struggling is extracting the information from the output. Tweepy sample:{"created_at":"Fri Aug 05 17:27:00 +0000 2016","id":761614496666361857,"id_str":"761614496666361857","text":"Use different Python version with virtualenv #py                                                                                thon #virtualenv #virtualenvwrapper https://t.co/ecedKrCX0L","source":From the sample, I want to extract and print the bold text however I can't seem to get this to work properly.  So far I've come up with:However this doesn't extract the specifics I'm after and continues to print a full tweepy output. Any assistance would be appreciated! Thanks
