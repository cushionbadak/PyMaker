I've just started learning regular expressions and the documentation for   states:Changed in version 3.5: Unmatched groups are replaced with an empty  string.Deprecated since version 3.5, will be removed in version 3.6: Unknown  escapes consist of '\' and ASCII letter now raise a deprecation  warning and will be forbidden in Python 3.6.Is re.sub() deprecated? What should I use then?
You misunderstand the documentation. The  function is not deprecated. The deprecation warning concerns specific syntax.Earlier in the  documentation you'll find this:Unknown escapes such as  are left alone.If you used and unknown escape with an ASCII letter the escape will no longer be ignored, you'll get a warning instead. This applies both to  replacement patterns and to the regular expression patterns. The same warning is placed in the section on regex pattern syntax.The Changed in version 3.5 line also concerns how  works. Rather than raise an exception when there is no matching group for a  backreference, an empty string is inserted at that location.
The two entries are not related, and  will  not be deprecated.In Python version earlier than 3.5  failed if a backreference was used to a capturing group that did not participate in the match. See Empty string instead of unmatched group error SO question.An example where the failure occurred:As for the second one, it only says that there will be a warning (and later forbidden) if you use an unknown for a regex engine literal backslash followed with an ASCII character. The backslash was just ignored in them before, in Python 2.x through 3.5,  prints . So, these will be forbidden in Python 3.6.
