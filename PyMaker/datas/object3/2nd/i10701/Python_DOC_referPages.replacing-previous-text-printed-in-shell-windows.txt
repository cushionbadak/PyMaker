I have been researching this question, and it seems that it is possible, but not possible on Windows.I am trying to achieve a loading bar that will print 'Loading', then 'Loading.', 'Loading..'... etc.This code seems to work on Linux but not Windows(Python 3.5):How do I combat this problem?
The problem is buffering: everything appears at once when the script ends. You can force Python >3.3 to flush after each print output:Of course a loading bar may look cool, but a fake one that just wastes time sleeping is not going to make the user happy. If your program really is doing business, have a look at threading or subprocess.Your original idea works for me (Python 3.4 on Win7 64 bit), too:
