I have to two arrays (in my code below): "donlist" is a list of random donation amounts between $1 and $100, and "charlist" is a list of random charity numbers between 1 and 15. I need to create a third array using the total donations for each charity. So if charity #3 appears 8 times in "charlist", I have to get the sum of the corresponding floats from "donlist". I have absolutely no idea how to do this and have been trying to figure it out for the past 2-3 hours now. Does anyone know how to do it? Thank you.Sample output:
Use a , with the charity number as the key. You simply add the donation to the corresponding  value. If the  element doesn't exist yet, set it to zero as its initial value.I'm using : the  argument will guarantee a zero value if the key doesn't exist yet, otherwise you can just add to it.Updating your script (with a few minor other alterations):nb: I removed the  import, since you're only using s in the code.
This seems a good example to use the zip function. It gets two lists as argument (in your case the  and ) and creates an iterator of these, so you can iterate one time adding the values from  in the right charity position.  example:will outputI strongly recommend generating the data lists before creating the third, so you can doThis is a simple syntax to create a list from an iterator. You can read more about it here.This way, you can guarantee that it works for cases when these lists are not generated during the calculation, for an example, where the user input the values.After the lists generation / input you can just:In the end each charity  has it's donation value in .
You can now index  by charity number and get the value of donation.
