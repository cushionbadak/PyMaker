Natural Text
I am trying to create a list in Python from a text file. I would like to open the file, read the lines, use the  method, append them to a list. This is what I have so far. All it does is print the text file:My file  looks like this:  I want this to come out:  
As other commentors have observed, variable naming should provide the context of what your variable is assigned to. Even though you can name a variable a multitude of names, they should be relevant! You can use the  statement to open and close a file within the same scope, ensuring that the file object is closed (generally good practice). From then on, you can print the  returned from the  function as a  that is  based on a  delimiter. Sample output:File: 
If your file only consists of one line then you don't need to do nearly as much work as you seem to think. returns a list, so there is no need to  the individual elements.  When you call  without any arguments it will split by any whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines etc) so to do what you want to do would literally just be:open the file, read the contents, split it up by whitespace, store the resulting list in a variable called . (or whatever you want to call it)Note that spliting by any whitespace means it will treat new lines the same as spaces, just another separation of words.
