Got some strange import error which is as much strangely reported by interpreter.I use CPython-3.5Directory structure:main.py:outer/__init__.py: emptyouter/inner/__init__.py:outer/inner/first.py:outer/inner/second.py:then, I run  and script fails with this stack trace:So, Python does not want to bind names correctly. Although import statement in first.py:  is executed without crashing, this statement binds to name  something like an empty package, which doesn't have (but should) the module named  What do I do wrong?
It's better to import relative paths, not absolute ones. I do not know what you are trying to achieve, but correct way to import something from a file on the same level is to use a dot  so In your  file use something like:And in your  file something like:This allows you to avoid name conflicts as well as keep names simple, unique and generally more readible code.EDIT:Also if you are nw to python consider adding interpreter comment in your  module. It's convenient for users of Unix-like systems (OS X, Linux etc.)
