I am hoping someone can point me in the right direction along with any documentation that can provide even more info than just the answer. Here we go, I have a list of strings:I want to turn that list into a list of lists so that the new element will be its order of appearancethe reason for this is because I would like to then sort that list by length of string, and in case any are of identical length, I can use the 2nd element of the list to know which one was first from my original list.hope that makes sense. thanks!
Simple and pythonic.where  is your list.
Try the following for loop:
Python's sort is stable, per docs:The sort() method is guaranteed to be stable. A sort is stable if it guarantees not to change the relative order of elements that compare equalSo just sort the list like the deleted answer of @JulienBernu:Note that the items of equal length remain in the original order.  You don't need to track it.
 will do the job.
this look like a job for Counter
