I want the first 9 digits and last 9 digits of a fibonocci series for an infinite loop. Running the tests individually, I get better result for the last 9 digits using modulo operator no where comparable to the first 9 digits. I ran different tests like  but still the same result. I think this happens because of number to string conversion of higher digits. Is there any other way of printing the first 9 digits without converting into a string or an efficient way with/without strings?
Here are a few versions and timings for getting the first 30000 prefixes. I left out the first two yields and the last digits for simplicity. is the original way just using . keeps track of the appropriate power of 10 to divide by. keeps the first 9 digits in  and  and the remaining digits in  and . Compared to , this avoids dividing a large  by a large power of 10. Large numbers are only added/subtracted/compared, or multiplied with a tiny number. uses  suggested by @therefromhere. uses the  module.The output:Just for comparison I also tried , i.e., the last nine digits, and that took 0.506 seconds. Which is slower than my fast solutions for the first nine digits.The code:
