I created a function and I would like to be able to call it with a set of keyworded-parameters that I call :Inside this set of parameters one of them will be called 'SumInc' and I would like to pass a range to it. The range will be of the form of [1:15] or [1:] or [:15]. Something that will essentially let me check whether a variable in my code is greater than a certain boundary or lower than another boundary or both.In the same way, as these lines of codes do:But I am looking for a neater way to pass both boundaries without having to create a parameter for each and many if conditions to get things done.Something that would look like this:Is there something of this kind existing?Thanks for your tips,
Something like this?Also, you'd better use  instead of  because in your case if there is no  it will raise you a  exception.
