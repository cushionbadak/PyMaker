This question already has an answer here:How to clone or copy a list?                    20 answers                I am using a recursive function on a list of lists with an accumulator, but instead of creating the right list of lists, it makes a list with duplicates of the last item inserted in the accumulator. I recreated the problem in a much simpler recursive function and list. This function takes a list of lists and makes 2 copies and reverses them n times.The output comes out wrong and the accumulator does not have the right things that were put into it.I know that there is an easier way to do this, but the function I'm actually making requires recursion. Like I said, this is just a simplified recreation of the problem I am having.
The above line does not create a list of two copies of the original list; in fact, it just stores a reference to the same original list twice. If you want a distinct copy of , try using the list copy constructor like  or alternatively the shallow copy method .See the below example.
