This question already has an answer here:Simple argparse example wanted: 1 argument, 3 results                    9 answers                I currently sitting on a macbook, and therefore i'm using Terminal. Anyway, I have created an adventure game in a file called adventure.py. The thing I want to do is to send a parameter to that file, for example:-h/ --help That explains what parameters that work-i/ --info Gives a description of the game-v/ --version Gives the version of the game-c/ --cheat Gives out cheats for the game or a explanation of how to complete the game as fast as possible.What i'm guessing it that in terminal you write: adventure.py --version for example. But I dont know how to get started with this or how to even implement this. I've tried to google for an answer but havent found anything.Thanks. :)
You can also try argparse - it's a Python package for doing exactly this. Examples, etc. are all in the documentation.
