Natural Text
I am creating two lists by reading from a text file with  two columns, which always has the same layout but the length of the columns differ.Then I'd like to find the minimum value in the Y listHowever the corresponding x value of the minimum y-value should be higher than a certain value. Like ignore all y values with a corresponding x-value lower than 0.01. Any suggestions?for exampleI should get minimum_y = -6 in case I want to ignore all x<2
You have a couple of problems in your code besides what you're trying to do. I've tried to fix the errors and explain what I was doing.Note that if I weren't worried about the file existing, I'd probably do something like this:That approach uses a list comprehension, a generator comprehension, and argument unpacking. They're very powerful techniques.
