I am teaching myself how to program in Python, and I have a question about "print".I know that print statement has a newline "\n" feature embedded into it, but I noticed that whenever my code ends with a print statement, for example,  print("This is the end"), it does not create a newline.Is it a feature of Python that the newline of the very last print statement is suppressed?p.s. I am using IDLE
No, Python has no such feature. You might be confusing "not printing a newline" with "not ending with a blank space".For example, in bash, it might look like this:Notice how  exited without any newline and the prompt immediately continued.This applies in the live interpreter as well:Windows () always appends the end of a program with a newline:
In python, a  is added by default. You can specify what end argument you want concatenated to the end of your print statement in Python 3 with the following (output copied from sublime 3 to demonstrate the newline):Output:Other wise, a   is default if no value is passed to the keyword argument .Output:Things work slightly differently in python 2 as  is not a function ( is default), however you can emulate this behavior in the following way:Output:Here are a few examples in an interactive shell running in Terminal to demonstrate.In shell (Python 2):
