I am using Python but there is something strange. Why does cos(x) give me a result of x as was in radians? while cos(radians(x)) gives the answer as x was in degreefor example :but the truth is if 75 is in degree, then cos(75) = 0.26 but the truth is if 75 is in radians, then cos(75) = 0.90I am wrong ? why is that happening ? 
 means "the cosine of 75 radians". (See documentation.) means "convert 75째 to radians", i.e. "the number of radians that's equivalent to 75째". (See documentation.)so  means "the cosine of {the number of radians that's equivalent to 75째} radians", i.e. "the cosine of 75째".
