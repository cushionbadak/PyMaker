I have got a problem when using python imports. I wrote a finished module, that itself uses several submodules (those are imported).e.g.Now I want to use this finished module by another supermodule, so the folder structure would change like thisHowever now all imports that are used in the code of  inside the module fail (I guess because the import now works in the namespace of )Any idea how to solve this problem without restructuring the entire sources?The concrete error:In my  I use the line:In my  I use the line:When executing the superclass that imports  of course the  line is executed as well, but fails as it can not find the module in the namespace of .
If you are on python 2 you should add   to your files (not needed on 3) so you can do the imports like Guido states in PEP 328According to this you shouldMake sure all your package folders have a  in it to mark them as importableIn main_class.py: replace  or  with In main_class_super.py: replace  with This way you don't have to care about any outer package structure.The option to use absolute and explicit relative imports was added in Python 2.5.
