I have a PyQt program and in this project I have some calculations based on earlier set preferences.As an example, I created a small calculator which contains the following files:example_run_vars.py:example.py:The idea is, when I press the run button in the script, it gives an answer in the textbox. The point is that I have no idea what is the easiest (or programmically the best) method for returning the answer.I have an idea there are two or tree options:Every checkbox/combobox/textbox does something and puts this somewhere, and the calculate button reads this out.When calculating, read out all checkboxes/comboboxes/textboxes and add this to the function.A combination of those two.What is the best method of dealing with kind of situation, and why?
The data is already stored in the widgets, so it is inefficient make another copy of it. Also, you would need to set up handlers for each individual widget, which is unnecessarily complicated. In general, it is best to gather all the information from the widgets at the point when the calculation is made.In your example, I would suggest you keep the  slot connected to the run button, but get rid of all the other signals/slots. You should then create functions for all the mathematical operations you need. Each of these functions must have two arguments, which will take the A/B values from the line-edits. You could use some of the functions from the operator module for this, or just write your own:You can then link these functions directly to the combo-box items like this:With that in place, the  slot would then look something like this:Doing things this way makes it very easy to add, remove or re-order the functions in the combo-box (i.e. the  slot never has to change).
