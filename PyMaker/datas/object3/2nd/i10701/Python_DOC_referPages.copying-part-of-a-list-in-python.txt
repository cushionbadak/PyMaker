I've searched for a relevant thread on how to do this but I cannot find anything.I have an array:I want to copy the elements of the array into a new array until I find 'b'. I tried to do this with a loop but I get an error that "y is not defined", I tried initializing y but that didn't work either. Any ideas? I'm sure there is a better way to do this.

You could use :When using a loop, you have to use ; if you do , then you will get an  as you try to set e.g. the first element of an array that has zero elements. Also, when you loop like this  then  is already the element from , i.e. you do not have to do . In your case, this did not give an exception, since  would be a valid element of , but it would not be what you expected.
Try this:For example:See  and the shallow-copy slice for more information.
Way to get things done with generator expression:
Though it is somehow similar  to Will's answer, but in here it shows the use of  built-in slicing object:
I would split the array by the  index:
