I'm trying to create instances of a class by loading a textfile and using some strings from that as input.This is supposed to spit out all the scene headers from a film manuscript and create an instance of a Scene class for every time it reads a scene header that is characterized by starting with either INT or EXT.While it does find all the scenes correctly, I am having trouble creating the actual instances. How do I make instances of Class in the create function, and then print them out ?
Your function shouldn't be a method of , since it doesn't actually do anything but create a bunch of objects. You can use generators to emit your  instances as you parse the file:Original answerYour  function is an instance method, so it requires you create an instance of your class first and then call the  method. This is kind of backwards if you think about it, since your  method should not require an instance of a class, since it should be the one creating the instance.The solution is to make your  method a class method. Instance methods take in an instance of your class as their first argument, while class methods take in the class itself, letting you create instance of your class using different functions.Since the function is a class method, you don't need an instance of your  class to call it:It's equivalent to doing something like:
