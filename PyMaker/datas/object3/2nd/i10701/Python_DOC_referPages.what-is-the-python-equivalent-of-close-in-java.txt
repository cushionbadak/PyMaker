In Java, using the  method frees resources by removing out of scope objects. I am confused as to what is the Python equivalent for this? Does Python's garbage collector automatically do this?Is it the  method?Should I use the  statement?Any help will be appreciated.Edit: My goal is to explicitly remove class objects when desired, not file objects.
Should I use the with statement?Yes, according to the documentation:It is good practice to use the with keyword when dealing with file objects. This has the advantage that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised on the way. It is also much shorter than writing equivalent try-finally blocks:
You will find your answer here: place gc.collect() before your code.
ICart's comment is spot on for many different situations. However, regarding the creation and disposal of objects in general, I think this other thread provides a pretty good explanation of how python handles their objects (reference counts), and where garbage collection comes in.
