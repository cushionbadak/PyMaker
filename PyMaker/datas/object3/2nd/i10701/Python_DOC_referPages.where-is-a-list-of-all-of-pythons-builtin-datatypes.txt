I'm using comparisons like:I've once discovered, that I've missed the bool type: , Okay - I wondered which other types I missed?docs.python.org - There is no table with ALL types...I've started googling:diveintopython3:Python has many native datatypes. Here are the important ones:Booleans are either True or False.Numbers can be integers (1 and 2), floats (1.1 and 1.2), fractions (1/2 and 2/3), or even complex numbers.Strings are sequences of Unicode characters, e.g. an html document.Bytes and byte arrays, e.g. a jpeg image file.Lists are ordered sequences of values.Tuples are ordered, immutable sequences of values.Sets are unordered bags of values.Dictionaries are unordered bags of key-value pairs.Why is that everywhere people are talking about many types, but I can't find a list of all of them? It's almost always only about important ones
You can iterate over 's , and use  to see if something is a class:(Note that as @user2357112 pointed out in the excellent comment, we are explicitly excluding , as it is not useful.)Note also that  can take a tuple as the second argument, which you can use instead of your series of s. Consequently, you can write things like so:
