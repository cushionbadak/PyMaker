I have tried to install language_check library in Python 2.7 by using...and...In both cases, I get the following error...I also tried doing...and that throws a different error...How do I install language_check in this case?
I check the sources of the file  (github language_check).It appears that the error occurs when you try to move the folder  with the command  from your  to your Anaconda Lib folder.So far, @Orions is right, it is a permission problem.Firstly, you should check your folder permission:Go to your Local folder (should be C:\Users\Gaurav M\AppData\Local)Right-click on  folder on select Go to  tab and  and  your name if it doesn't appear under .Repeat the operation for your Anaconda folder. (should be C:\Users\Gaurav M\Anaconda)Secondly, you can try:But the pip --user option install the package only for the user.Install to the Python user install directory for your platform. Typically ~/.local/, or %APPDATA%Python on Windows. (See the Python documentation for site.USER_BASE for full details.)Last but not least,I presume you are using  or as Command-line interpreter. In my opinion, using cygwin on Windows makes a lot of things easier. Although It could be painful to configure, I would recommend a pre-configure  solution like Babun.Good luck!
