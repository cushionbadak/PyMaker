I want to write a script that takes optional  and  arguments. It is legal to specify neither of them. It is also legal to specify both. However, specifying just  or just  should raise a command line parser error.After I call  I can write code to check this condition and raise the appropriate error, but is there a way already built into  to do this, a sort of converse of ?
No there isn't that kind of grouping or builtin test, just this one  test.But it isn't hard to implement the test after parsing - provided your arguments have reasonable defaults (such as the default default ).Another possibility is to define one argument  with  - it requires 2 values.Yet another is to provide one or both with a good default, such that you don't really care whether the user provides both values or not.
