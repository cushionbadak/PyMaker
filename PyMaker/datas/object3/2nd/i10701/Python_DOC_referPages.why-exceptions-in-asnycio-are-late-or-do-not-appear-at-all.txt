Natural Text
Sometimes after using  syntax I see the program no longer work correctly. But there are no any exceptions.For example:But if I use  syntax exception can be catched:So. Can I see exception immediately without catching? Or I can only use steps and debug it all?
Exception is raised, stack is unrolled.The real question is: what do you use to run your coroutine? will process an exception as you are expecting. Another usage scenarios may differ.
