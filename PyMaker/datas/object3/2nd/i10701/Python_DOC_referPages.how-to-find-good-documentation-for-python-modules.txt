I can't seem to find a good explanation of how to use Python modules. Take for example the  module. It has commands such as.How would I find out what specific commands, like this one, are in certain Python modules?For all the examples I've seen of people using specific Python modules, they just know what to type, and how to use them. Any suggestions will be much appreciated.
My flow chart looks something like this:Reading the published documentation (or use  which gives you the same information without an internet connection in a harder to read format). This can be overly verbose if you're only looking for one tidbit of information, in which case I move on to...Finding tutorials or similar stack overflow posts using specific keywords in your favorite search engine. This is generally the approach you will use 99% of the time.Just recursively poking around with  and  if you think the answer for what you're looking for is going to be relatively obvious (usually if the module has relatively simple functions such as  that are obvious by the name)Looking at the source of the module if you really want to see how things works.
