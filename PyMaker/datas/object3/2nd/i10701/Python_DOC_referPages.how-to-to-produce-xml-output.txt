This question already has an answer here:Creating a simple XML file using python                    7 answers                I'm creating an web api and need a good way to very quickly generate some well formatted xml. I cannot find any good way of doing this in python.Note: Some libraries look promising but either lack documentation or only output to files. 
Using lxml:Output:See the tutorial for more information.
ElementTree is a good module for reading xml and writing too e.g.Output:See this tutorial for more details and how to pretty print.Alternatively if your XML is simple, do not underestimate the power of string formatting :)Output:You can use string.Template or some template engine too, for complex formatting.
Use lxml.builder class, from: http://lxml.de/tutorial.html#the-e-factoryOutput:
I would use the yattag library. I think it's the most pythonic way:
An optional way if you want to use pure Python:ElementTree is good for most cases, but it can't CData and pretty print.So, if you need CData and pretty print you should use minidom:minidom_example.py:minidom_example.xml:
I've tried a some of the solutions in this thread, and unfortunately, I found some of them to be cumbersome (i.e. requiring excessive effort when doing something non-trivial) and inelegant. Consequently, I thought I'd throw my preferred solution, web2py HTML helper objects, into the mix. First, install the the standalone web2py module:Unfortunately, the above installs an extremely antiquated version of web2py, but it'll be good enough for this example. The updated source is here.Import web2py HTML helper objects documented here.Now, you can use web2py helpers to generate XML/HTML.
