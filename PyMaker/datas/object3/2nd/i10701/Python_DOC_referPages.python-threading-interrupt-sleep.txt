How about using condition objects:  https://docs.python.org/2/library/threading.html#condition-objectsInstead of sleep() you use wait(timeout). To "interrupt" you call notify().
The correct approach is to use . For example:In the other thread, you need to have access to . You can interrupt the sleep by issuing:This will immediately interrupt the sleep. You can check the return value of  to determine whether it's timed out or interrupted. For more information refer to the documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#event-objects .
