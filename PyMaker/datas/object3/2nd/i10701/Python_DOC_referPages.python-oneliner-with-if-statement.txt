Natural Text
I am wondering if it is possible to write the following python if statement in one line. I would also like to know why I am getting the error below:
Only simple statements can appear in a semicolon-separate statement list:An  statement is a compound statement, so it's invalid syntax to include it.Allowing compound statements in a semicolon-separated list would lead to ambiguity.  This is valid syntax:Both assignments are only executed if the  is true, and this is how most people would intuitively read the statement.  If we allowedit would become unclear for readers of the code whether the  is part of the  statement or not.Python uses indentation to delimit code suites, and you can't use indentation in a semicolon-separated statement list.
