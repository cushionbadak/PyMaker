I am running a program that works in parallel, utilizing the  object from the multiprocessing module.What I am trying to do is run a function n number of times in parallel, each having a separate loading %, and I would like it to be updating the percentage for each function without replacing other percentages... example:And I would run the function multiple times in parallel.The effect I am trying to achieve is the following, for f(10000000), f(15000000), f(7000000):And the percentages will be updating in their individual lines without replacing for other values of x, in this function  which will be running three times at the same time.I tried using the carriage return '\r' but that replaces every line and just creates a mess.Thanks for taking the time to read this post! I hope you can tell me.I am using Python 2.7 but if it can only be achieved with Python 3 I am open to suggestions.
CursesAs @Keozon mentioned in the comments, one way to achieve this would be to use the curses library.There is a good guide for curses on the python website. ANSI Escape CodesAlternatively, you might try using ANSI escape codes to move the cursor around.This is in Python3, but it'll work just fine in any version, you'll just need to change the print statements around (or ).Output:Edit:I've done way too much work for you here, but hey, here's basically a full solution using the ANSI method I mentioned above:
