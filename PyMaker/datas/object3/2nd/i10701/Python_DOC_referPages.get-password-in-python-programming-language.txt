Is there any builtin function that can be used for getting a password in python.I need answer like thisInput:    Enter a username: abcdefg    Enter a password : ********If i enter a password abcdefgt. It shows like ********.  
OriginalThere is a function in the standard library module :This function does not echo any characters as you type.AddendumIf you absolutely must have  echoed while the password is typed, and you are on Windows, then you can do so by butchering the existing  to add it.  Here is an example (untested):Similarly, on unix, a solution would be to butcher the existing  in a similar fashion (replacing the  in  with an appropriate  loop).
Use the  function and then print the number of stars equivalent to the number of characters in the password. This is a sample:The drawback is it does not print  side by side.
