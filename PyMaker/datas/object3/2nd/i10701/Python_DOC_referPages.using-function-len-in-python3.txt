When I need to count the number of positive numbers in a given range (ex, range-->>(1,100)),I use function , but it doesn't work and gives:TypeError: object of type 'int' has no len()Can someone explain this error, or suggest the correct function to use with this problem.
len(s) takes as an argument a sequence (such as a string, bytes, tuple, list, or range) or a collection (such as a dicttionary, set, or frozen set).That is,  can only be called - and only makes sense - on one of those data structures. Passing an  will fail with the posted error - it simply doesn't make sense, s don't have length.TypeError: object of type 'int' has no len()As such, something like , or  works, but  doesn't.In your example, in the comments: is an int, a different one in the  in every loop, which explains why  fails.P.S. Posting a direct snippet from your code may help the answerers get a better understanding of the problem you are having.Update: From your comments and code it is evident that you are trying to store a  of inputs.When you do the assignment ,  will be a different value every loop, a , hence  fails. What you want is to store all your inputs in a list  and then print the  of that. You can store values in a list by ing them - 
You are likely calling  on an individual integer rather than the output of the . Instead, use it as such:
The easy way to solve this problem is to filter the range and then count the results:
