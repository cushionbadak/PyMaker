I am playing with Flask to understand it better. I have a simple app that queries a large database and returns a random element. The following code is not working but I know exactly where it fails. It fails when I can random.randint() to get a random element in the list. There is however no error shown in my logs, what is the root cause of this? It works if I use a hardcoded value instead of a random int. I use curl to test it. I snipped the database code as it seems to be correct.
You have redefined  by defining a function named .This shadows the imported module, causing the problem that you see. When you  again in  your code can access the module  instead of the local function .Fix this by renaming the function, perhaps call it  since that is the route name.
It is something I don't understand but here is what is happening. I need to import random inside the random() function. Otherwise the global "import random" statement does not seem to be sufficient. Not sure why. So adding one import line inside random() made it work.If anybody can explain this I would be grateful.EDIT: Now I understand what is going on. The function name random() was causing some sort of conflict. If I change it to rand() everything works fine now with just one global import.
