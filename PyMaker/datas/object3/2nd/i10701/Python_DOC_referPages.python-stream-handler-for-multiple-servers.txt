There are servers running in multiple locations,I need to stream the application log data from these servers to a ZMQ(Zero Message Queue) using python stream handler.How do i use the stream handler to get this done? I have already referred the Python Handlers documentation https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.StreamHandler
You can post your logs from different servers as  to the ZMQ iteratively. For the ZMQ make a PyZMQ application which will have a message handler, listening to your incoming json from these servers. Then as per requirement the incoming json data can be processed and stored in a file (or wherever you want to store). This file can be read for the incoming logs ( eg: tail -f fileName.txt or fileName.log)Here is link which will help you setup a PyZMQ application:Designing and Testing PyZMQ Applications â€“ Part 1For logging specifically you can use these example:A simple Python logging exampleLogging, StreamHandler and standard streams
