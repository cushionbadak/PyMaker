Noob question. Is there a more ideal way to express a range using both range and calendar. Looking to set up a print True if any of the years in my range are leap years 
List comprehensions are good for thisAs are filters, if you prefer the map/reduce/filter way of doing thingsThe former should be preferred unless you have good reason to use  (hint: you probably don't)N.B. that this gives you which years are leap years (if any), rather than a boolean "There are leap years" or "There aren't leap years." See fuglede's excellent answer using  for a boolean response.
It sounds like you want to make use of the Python  built-in;
