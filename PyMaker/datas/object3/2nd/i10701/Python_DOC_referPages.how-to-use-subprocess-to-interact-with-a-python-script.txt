I'm writing an IDE for python, in python, and need to use subprocess to intereact with a user's script.I am completely new to using subprocess and not sure what I'm doing here. I've created a test snippet representing what I'm trying to do:And here is the test script I'm trying to interact with:Unfortunately it just waiting (presumably) on line 2. How do I read what has already been printed and how to I then input the string?
You have to flush stdout regularly, because, if the script is not connected to a terminal, the output is not automatically flushed:and you have to terminate the input by return :
Remove . Currently you are not executing the script at all, but just launching a  interactive interpreter.The problem is that when you use  the way in which the first argument is interpreted changes. You do not need  and the arguments you provided are correct for the  version.See the difference between:Which as you may notice launches a python interpreter which gets stuck, and this:Which tries to execute .Also you should consider using the  method instead of reading and writing directly to/from /.
