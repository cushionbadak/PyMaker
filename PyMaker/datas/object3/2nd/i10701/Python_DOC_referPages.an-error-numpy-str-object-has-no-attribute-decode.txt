I tried to run a test on Crab(an open source recommender system) based on python3. Then an error occurred:I tried to use 'decode()' to convert the string, but it's not working:Any help will be appreciated!
The problem is that  is a string within a string, so when you try casting a string like  into a float, it gives a  because you still have the  in front which cannot be converted into float.I imagine you need the byte encoding in front of the , so one way would be to evaluate  to convert it from a string to bytes before typecasting it into a float (beware though,  can have some safety issues).
