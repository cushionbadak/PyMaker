Having trouble with this one.  Feel as though I've whipped through similar transformations of data, but this one is throwing me for a loop.Looking to convert a spreadsheet data into a nested JSON that will be used for a D3 visualization, seen it referred to as "flare.json".The target JSON would look something like this (where, obviously, a dictionary would be just as good):I'm pulling data from a spreadsheet with openpyxl that provides a root tuple that contains tuples of each column value.e.g.I know there are 101 different ways to do this, considered using dataframes from pandas, and I'm sure openpyxl has a myriad of methods and conversions for this kind of thing.  But for whatever reason, having a hard time envisioning this process today.  Thanks in advance.
This should do it:You can obviously use something like  to output it as a JSON string.
