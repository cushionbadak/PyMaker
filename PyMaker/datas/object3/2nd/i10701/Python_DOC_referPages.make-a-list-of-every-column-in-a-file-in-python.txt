Natural Text
I would like to create a list for every column in a txt file. The file looks like this:PROBLEM 1 . How do I dynamically make the number of lists that fit the number of columns, such that I can fill them? In some files I will have 4 columns, others I will have 6 or 8...PROBLEM 2. What is a pythonic way to iterate through each column and make a list of the values like this:etc.Right now I have read in the txt file and I have each individual line. As input I give the number of NAMES in a file (here HOW_MANY_SAMPLES = 4)I need a dynamic way of creating and filling the number of lists that correspond to the amount of columns in my table.
By using  you can create a list of list or a dic to get what you are looking for.Create a  from your file, then iterate through each column and add it to a list or dic.Then you will have a list of list for all the columnsReturns and returns if you need to keep track of columns name and data
Problem 1:You can use  instead of having to specify .You can also try using Python's CSV module and setting the delimiter to a space or a tab instead of a comma.See this answer to a similar StackOverflow question.Problem 2:Once you have a list representing each row, you can use  to create lists representing each column:See this answer.With the CSV module, you can follow this suggestion, which is another way to invert the data from row-based lists to column-based lists.Sample:this yields:
