I am using logger in my python script as :Now there are many functions inside the python script and every time i have to use a logger i need to mention following line :again and again. In order to resolve this i declared function which returns logger object as follows:Now i am using set_log() inside func() but what happens is it sometimes it inserts NUll at various locations inside the log but actually null should not get entered. So, why is it that i am getting null inside the log files sometimes?
You don't need to call  each time, no. You only need to call it once. The  function always returns , so you can't use it to access a  method anyway.You can always access the root logger (in configured state) with . That's because the  module uses singletons, global state, to configure all logging operations.The convention is to store a global reference to a logger in your module:Here the module name is used to indicate where log messages come from, and this also lets you adjust configuration per module.However, subsequent calls to  will always return the same singleton logger object (not passing in the name gives you the root  in the hierarchy).At any rate, the top-level  function just delegates to the root logger, it is equivalent to . It does call  if it wasn't already called before.Your updated sample function will add new  and  instance to the singleton  logger object each time  is called. That'll lead to undefined results you re-open the file (truncating it each time).Stick to calling  once, at the start of your program. The rest of your code should only concern themselves with direct  calls.
