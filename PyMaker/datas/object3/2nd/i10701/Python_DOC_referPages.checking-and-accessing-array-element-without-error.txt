I have array, which I want to validate, 2nd item of that array. There are 2 ways which comes to my mindCheck for  lengthCatch  and process in  block.Which one is better?If you have any other option, I am ready to learn :)
Python encourages EAFP coding style:EAFP  Easier to ask for forgiveness than permission. This common Python  coding style assumes the existence of valid keys or attributes and  catches exceptions if the assumption proves false. This clean and fast  style is characterized by the presence of many  and   statements. The technique contrasts with the LBYL style common to many  other languages such as C.This means the  /  is perfectly fine, but you do not have to use the  clause, simply do:
If your array should have at least 2 items, I would do an assert:If your array could have 2 items I would use the first form:For me the try form can be less readable in the long run especially if you need to catch exceptions in the "Process for array[1]" part...
