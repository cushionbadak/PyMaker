Natural Text
Conceptually, this is pretty easy, but I can't seem to figure it out. I want to turn a list of strings into a dict with each key being the first letter of the list of words associated with it.My output look like this:I'm missing an append function here, but each time I try to implement it fails to give me the correct output, or it throws a SyntaxError. What am I missing?
this can be done in one go with just the standard librarythe solution with itertools is fine, but it require the extra step of sorting the list, making it O(n log n), while this do the same in just one go so is O(n)the collections module offer defaultdict which have a build in 
No problem, itertools to the rescue. You can group the elements by their first letter, then create a dict out of them.
Is this what you are trying to achieve?
This is not a good use for a dict comprehension - you will end up with more loops than you need. If you write it directly then you only scan the input list once:
