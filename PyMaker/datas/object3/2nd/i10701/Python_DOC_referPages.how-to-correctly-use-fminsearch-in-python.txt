I'm trying to translate a part of my matlab code in python. Actually I'm looking for how to translate  and I found it on this website with this example :My first question is how to return also the value of  ? And in my code when I type :Python answered me :I don't understand why Python told me that because what i want to do is to minimize the function  changing the values of , i precise  is an array of length 10.Thank you very much for your help !
Python told you that because in Python, keyword arguments always follow non keyword (i.e positional) arguments (keyword args have a name assigned to them, as in  in the  call). Your function call should look like:in order to comply with Python's calling conventions. Alternatively, and, according to the function definition of , you could only supply positional arguments for these two first arguments:this will return the values that minimize the function, so, just call the function providing these arguments:Alternatively you could call  with  and get a tuple of elements back, the second element of that tuple is the minimum value:Now  contains your full output.
