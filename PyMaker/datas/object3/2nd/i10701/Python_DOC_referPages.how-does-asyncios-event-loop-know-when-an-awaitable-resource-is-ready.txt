I'm learning Python asyncio for asynchronous programing. I know that the event loop watch over Future objects until they are ready and then resumes the appropriate coroutines to continue the execution in the point where the await keyword occurred. This is very understandable when you use something like  because the sleeping function knows how many time it will take and so will know the event loop but what happens with something that relies on networking ( for example) where the waiting time is unknown?. How does the event loop know when a resource is ready or how many time will take to gather data from some source? 
How does the event loop know when a resource is ready or how many time will take to gather data from some source?The default event loop (based on SelectorEventLoop) uses the selector module to keep track of all the resources to monitor and get notified when new data is ready. BaseSelector.select is where the magic happens.
