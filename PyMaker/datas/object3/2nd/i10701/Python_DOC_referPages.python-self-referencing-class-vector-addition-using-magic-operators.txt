Yes,  is the right-hand-side expression result,  in your case.From the  documentation:For instance, to evaluate the expression , where  is an instance of a class that has an  method,  is called.The expression  creates a new instance of the class with new values for  and , which here are constructed from the sum of the current instance  and  and the same attributes on the right-hand side instance.A new instance is created because the normal semantics of  are to return a new instance, leaving the operands themselves untouched.
