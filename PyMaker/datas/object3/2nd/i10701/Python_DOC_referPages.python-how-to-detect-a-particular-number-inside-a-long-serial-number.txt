I have been working on this project, a small Python and Tkinter project as I'm a beginner and I almost finished it if it weren't for this little issue I have with it that I detected after doing a few tests.The program should say whether a serial number that I entered in an input is a "devil number" or not depending on whether the number does have the number "666" in it or not. in the positive case, there should be the number "666" in it and it should away from other 6s, which means there shouldn't be something like this "666". If the number "666" is repeated several times inside the serial number (without being stuck together "666666") it can be considered a devil number too.The issue I have is that when I test numbers that only have one "666" within them and that at the same time end with that number (666), those numbers are not considered as devil numbers while they should be. I can't seem to solve this problem.To realise this project, I used Python and Tkinter. The code is as follows:Here you go, guyz. I hope my code is neat enough and that you would be able to help me which I have no doubt about.Thank you.
If you mean that , found anywhere in the number should be a match, then it's very simple:However, you say that  must be a "lone" , i.e. exactly three  side by side, no more, no less. Neither two, nor four. Five 's are right out. In that case, I would use tobias_k's regex. Though, if you had a passionate hatred for regex, you could do it using :Here's what the performance looks like:I'm as surprised as you are.
You should use a regular expression for this. Something like  seems to work. This means "start of string  or  something that is not a 6 , then , then something other than 6 or end of string ".In your code, this should do the trick (not tested):If performance is an issue (but in your case it should not be), you can precompile the regex.Timing:
