I want to search for all variations of a string that is completely the same other than a single character. Here is an example of the string:AccordionPanelTab cond1_leftAccordionPanelTab cond2_leftAccordionPanelTab cond3_leftI would normally just iterate through a for loop however this string is the class I'm trying to use in beautiful soup. My code looks like thisI was thinking there is a command that I could put in the string in the place of the 1 that would tell the computer I do not care what is in this place. I'm sure this is a simple fix but I researched far and wide and couldn't figure it out. Thanks
As per my understanding, you needed a list of all the strings that needs to match your conditions.You can use regular expression for that. re.findall(pattern, string) returns a list of matching strings.You can do that by
