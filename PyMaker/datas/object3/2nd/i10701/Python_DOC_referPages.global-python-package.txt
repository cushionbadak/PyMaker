so I have this package. In the cmd I go to :Everything is working fine but I want to have a directory in which I could add my scripts and be able to open my cmd->python->import my package and do whatever I am going to do and not get this instead:PS: keep in mind I have added the directory  to the path and I have global bat files which work
RunIt'll list 2 important pieces of information:The Python module search path, The location for the  directory, and wether or not this exists.Python looks for modules along those locations. Put your module in a  location (in one that ends in  preferably), or make sure you created the  directory and put your code in there.And you can always extend the path by setting the  environment variable.
