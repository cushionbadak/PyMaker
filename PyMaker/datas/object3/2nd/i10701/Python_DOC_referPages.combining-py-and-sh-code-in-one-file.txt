I was wondering how can I combine sh and py code in one file and then execute it. What format should I save it in and commands for executing it?Here is an example script I have written have a look at it and tell me the modifications to it

The command for executing it is "python3 scriptname.py". Keep in mind that you have to set the permission to executable with "chmod 755 scriptname.py"
You could save a Python file and run the shell script with Python code:
