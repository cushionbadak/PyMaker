Please explain the use of  function in the following example:Example 1:and in example 2:
 is a dictionary, but the dictionary’s value are lists, which have the  method.In the loop, the dictionary is being filled with the values from . Apparently, it is possible that there are multiple values for a single . So in order to save that within a dictionary, the dictionary needs to be able to store multiple values for a key; so a list is being used which then holds all the values.The two examples show two different ways of making sure that the dictionary value is a list when the key is new.The first example explicitly checks if the key is already in the dictionary using . If that’s the case, you can just append to the already existing list. Otherwise, you need to add a new list to the dictionary.The second example uses  which sets a value if the key does not exist yet. So this is a special way of making sure that there’s always a list you can append the value to.
