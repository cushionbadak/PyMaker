If password is correct, then it affects  to a boolean named  ('password_is_valid' in english) which was  before, and destroys the window of connexion. It's a function that changes that value, so I used a  statement at the top of the function. However, when it closes the window, the value  is back to Here's some code to help you understandFirst, the main program that will call the other function:Then, the function which is not working:Test :The problem is here : the function verification () does change the value of mdp_valide into , but after returning the value, it's back to 
The problem is that in ,  is not global. So it is a local variable. Then in , you use , so that one is a global variable.When  finishes, you return the local variable from .In python 3 you can use : https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-nonlocal-statementIn python 2, you can declare  as global in  so that both variables are in the global scope, and therefore are the same
