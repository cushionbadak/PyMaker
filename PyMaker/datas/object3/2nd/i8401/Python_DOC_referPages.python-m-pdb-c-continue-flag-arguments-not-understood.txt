I'm trying to run , in order to enable debugging upon errors. The  arguments should allow me to do this without specifying 'c' upon program start. However, I receive the error: . I will demonstrate the versions and setup below with a  example.Then:After installing pdb locally into the virtualenv:Running without  works fine (although I'm surprised to see it using  instead of the local pdb? even when I retried with , it still showed that same path):
You are using Python 2.7, which doesn't support the  parameter:New in version 3.2:  now accepts a -c option that executes commands as if given in a  file, see Debugger Commands.By upgrading your Python to version 3.6 would solve the problem.I didn't find any package on PyPI that backports the 3.2+  package to Python 2.7. The one you were trying to install is a "password database".
