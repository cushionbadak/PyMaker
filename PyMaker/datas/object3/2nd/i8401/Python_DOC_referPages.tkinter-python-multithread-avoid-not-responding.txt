I'm trying to write a Python GUI program with tkinter.I want to make two thread. One runing with the main_form function to keep tkinter from keep update and loop (avoid "Not Responding").The other, when the button1 (btn1) is clicked make function sci_thread() start running and start thread2 that execute the main_scikit with long time code.But tkinter keep Not Responding. Below is my code:
Your app is unresponsive because your target parameter executed when declared and result of that passed as target. And, obviously, because of that you GUI is unresponsive while  being executed in GUI's thread. To deal with it  - get rid of redundant parentheses.Try this snippet:Links:Similar problem with a tkinter button's parameterMore general: How to pass a method as an parameterThreading docsP.S.:Also, be careful when you start a tkinter application not in the main thread because tkinter expects (in general) that  is outer-most loop possible and that all Tcl commands invoked from the same thread. So there can be many and more synchronisation problem with all that, even if you just trying to quit GUI!In conclusion, maybe this and that would give you some new ideas.
