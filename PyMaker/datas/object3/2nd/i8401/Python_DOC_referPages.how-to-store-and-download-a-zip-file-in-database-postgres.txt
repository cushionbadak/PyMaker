I'm trying to store and then download a zip file from Postgres database. I know that this is not the best approach (i should only save the path to file) but i need to do this way, just for learning and practice.I did a python script to store the content of the file into a bytea field but this was not my final goal. I really want to know how to save the zip file.Any ideas? I just know python so i'm trying to this in pythonThank you guys! 
If you can store the file as a bytea field then storing a zipped file is just the same. Postgres doesn't have a concept of "file" field - you simply store the content (as you did for the original content) in bytea field. If you're asking about zipping a file on the fly,Take a look at zlib it's one of the common modules for such tasks. Regards Jony
