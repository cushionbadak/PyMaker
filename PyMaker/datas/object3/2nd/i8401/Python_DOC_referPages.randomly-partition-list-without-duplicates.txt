I've got an array that contains each of a set of numbers  times. Example with :What I would like is a partition of this array in which the members of the partitioncontain elements that are drawn randomly from the arraycontain no duplicatescontain the same number of elements (up to rounding) Example output for :Invalid output for :(this is a partition but the first element of the partition contains duplicates)What's the most pythonic way of achieving this?
A combination of  and  can be used:This is a generator that s the samples, so you can simply cast it to a :The last case shows that this method can give weird results if the "random" part in the function returns the "wrong" samples. If that shouldn't happen or at least not often you need to figure out how the samples could be weighted (for example using ) to minimize that possibility.
