I want to unit test some Python extensions. To achieve this I'm running  in a script: To avoid leaving junk in the test directory I want to cleanup the build after the tests run. I'd like to run  in the unittest . How do I get the  object for the distro that must be passed as an argument to ?Thanks
It looks like your call to  should return a  instance.See the  function for a list of keyword arguments accepted by the  constructor.  creates a Distribution instance.
