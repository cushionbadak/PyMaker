I have a problem with I have already seen this question return self problem but I can't understand what the benefit is of ?
Returning  from a method simply means that your method returns a reference to the instance object on which it was called. This can sometimes be seen in use with object oriented APIs that are designed as a fluent interface that encourages method cascading. So, for example, Now we can use method cascading:Notice, the last call to  returned , which is .Now:Notice, you cannot do this if you did not return :Notice, not everyone is a fan of "method cascading" design. Python built-ins do not tend do this, so,  for example:The one place you do often see this is when your class implements the  protocol, where  on an iterator returns  by convention, although this is suggested by the docs:Having seen the mechanics behind the iterator protocol, it is easy to  add iterator behavior to your classes. Define an  method  which returns an object with a  method. If the class  defines , then  can just return :Notice, this in effect makes your iterator only useful for a single pass:
This is needlessly complex code. Pay little attention to it. There's no reason on earth to implement it this way.That being said, what it does is this:This is all much easier to express as:Examples:
