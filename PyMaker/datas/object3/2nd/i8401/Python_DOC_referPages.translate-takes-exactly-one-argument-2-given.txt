I want to write a python program to rename all the files from a folder so that I remove the numbers from file name, for example: chicago65.jpg will be renamed as chicago.jpg.Below is my code but I am getting error as translate() takes only 1 argument. please help in resolving this
You are using the Python 2  signature in Python 3. There the method takes only 1 argument, a mapping from codepoints (integers) to a replacement or  to delete that codepoint.You can create a mapping with the  static method instead:Incidentally, that's also how the Python 2  works.
