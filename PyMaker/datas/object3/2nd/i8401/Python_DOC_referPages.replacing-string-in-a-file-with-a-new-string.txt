Natural Text
I have a list of strings in a text file. The strings are morning, night, sun, moon. What I am trying to do is to replace one of these strings with another string. For example, I would input morning to remove and replace it with afternoon. I am getting an error saying "builtins.ValueError: list.remove(x): x not in list" when the string clearly is in the list.If there is a better way of achieving the same results doing it another way, let me know. Thanks for the help!
Here are some ideas:The str.replace() function is the simplest way to replace strings, .The re.sub() function will let you search for patterns and replace with strings: .The fileinput module will allow you to modify in-place.Here's one way to do it:Here another idea:Instead of processing line-by-line, just read the whole file in as a single string, fix it up, and then write it back.For example:
Assuming your txt save in :In windows,you can use this batch script,save in :Useage:or .Use  or  may be more simple.
Perhaps you are looking for the Python replace() method?
