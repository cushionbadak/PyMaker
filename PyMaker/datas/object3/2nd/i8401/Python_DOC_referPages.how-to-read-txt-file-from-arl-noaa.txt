Natural Text
Good evening! I will like to create a dataframe from txt file and it is on https://ready.arl.noaa.gov/readyou/174479_METGRAM.TXT. The text file is:I read data so:df=pd.read_table('https://ready.arl.noaa.gov/readyou /174479_METGRAM.TXT',skiprows=1,sep='\s+',header=None)i will like to get this:          how can i get this?
If each column is separated by 2-or-more spaces, then you could parse the data using the regex pattern . For example,If some of the columns only have 1 space between them and yet  must be recognized as a single value, then you could use the regex pattern . This regex matches 1-or-more spaces not preceeded by a plus or minus sign. Thus a single space between numbers can be recognized as a separator, but the space between  and  would not be considered a separator because this space is preceeded by a plus sign.If the columns are separated by tabs, then you could specify the column separator by the regex pattern , which matches 1-or-more tabs. The snippet you posted does not appear to use tabs as separators, but I thought I'd mention this just in case the tabs somehow got converted to spaces during the pasting process.
