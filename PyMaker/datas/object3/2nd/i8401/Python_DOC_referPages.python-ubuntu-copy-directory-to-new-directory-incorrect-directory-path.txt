I'm trying to write my first Python script, and it is not going well.I am trying to copy an entire local directory on my Ubuntu machine and place it and its contents in a different on my OS. I did some research and found  should do just that.This is the contents of my backup_images.py file:When I run it, I get error(s) on every line. When I run  in terminal, this is the output:If I run the same command with sudo (), I get completely different errors:Based on the first couple errors of this, (,), it seems Python isn't able to find the directories I assigned the   and  files to. Is this correct?Because of the changing errors, I'm unsure of how to fix my code.
Don't use  to do this. Instead use  to perform a recursive copy of a directory and all its files and subdirectories.
