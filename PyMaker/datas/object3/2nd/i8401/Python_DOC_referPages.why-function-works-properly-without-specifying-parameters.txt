In the below code, I don't understand why  works without passing parameters when it is called from within the  method.The definition of  states that there are three parameters that have to be passed: .But, when the  is called from  there are no parameters passed. Why doesn't it fail?Here is the full code:
I get everything, but the point where the function  gets called from within function That's where you went wrong. The function is not being called. It is only being referenced. There is no  call expression there.Python functions are first-class objects, you can pass them around or assign them to other names:Here  is another reference to the function object . I can call that function object through that other name too.So the following expression:doesn't call . It merely gives that function object to the  function, and it is that code that'll call  somewhere (passing in the required arguments).From the  documentation (which ultimately handles that hook):If reporthook is given, it must be a function accepting three numeric parameters: A chunk number, the maximum size chunks are read in and the total size of the download (-1 if unknown). It will be called once at the start and after each chunk of data is read from the network.
