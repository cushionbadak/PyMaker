You do not have to import  from math module. The  function exists but for defining an infinite value you can use .
As mentioned,  is new with python 3.5.  has always been around as  and  is really just a convenience. If you like using , you can restrict your code to supported versionsor you can just add it yourself
Which python version do you use?The  constants in package is implemented at Python 3.5(related link: https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.inf)You should check the version of Python you use.
