Is there any difference in performance between a one-liner like the one in the example below, or the for loop? Here's a snippet of code that I was using to do stuff:Is it better to do that, or write out this:Also, is there a reason to use one over the other?
For this specific case, you don't gain so much in terms of performance using a  instead of a for-loop. Probably, using the map is a bit worse than the latter approach, since you are implicitly using "extra-stuff" that, in this case, is not very useful.The "map-approach" can be very useful when you have the capabilities to parallelize tasks. In that case you can surely achieve better performances than a plain for-loop.I prefer the second version, thanks to readability. Another way is to use a list-comprehension:
