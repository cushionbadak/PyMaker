I have simple application written in django with one form that uploads file.My CSV file has a lot of columns with cyrillic letters. Just for testing I made my view handle html form like this:When I try to upload my CSV, I get this error:First I thought that my CSV is corrupted. Then why other CSV readers and Excel can open it?
You may want to take a look at this answer "Line contains NULL byte" in CSV reader (Python)which utilizes the codecs library:to open the file with different encodings (ex: utf-16)Good luck :)
