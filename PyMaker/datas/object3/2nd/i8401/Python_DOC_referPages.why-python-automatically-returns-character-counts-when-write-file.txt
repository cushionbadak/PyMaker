Natural Text
I recently noticed that when I have the following code:I got "7" as an output and it is the count of characters in the variable "Content". I do not recall seeing this (I used ipython notebook before, but this time I did it in the python environment in shell) and wonder if I did something wrong. My python version: Python 3.3.3. Thank you for your help.
As always this behaviour is normal for most  implementations, see also I/O Base Classes.For example Write the given bytes-like object, b, to the underlying raw stream, and return the number of bytes written.or Write the string s to the stream and return the number of characters written.Which -class is used depends on (the OS and) the parameters given to . But as far as I can see all of them return some sort of "characters" or "bytes" written count.
