I would put the JSON data into something called  or  instead of  so you don't obscure/confuse the name . I'm assuming that the data that you show is in string format in your  variable. I copied your data into a variable as multi-line text, but I had to change the  to a single quote in the string. I don't know if you'll need to do that to get json.loads() to work on your data, but if so, then when you need to extract the HTML, you can convert the single quotes back to double quotes. Then I fed it into the json package which makes a list of dictionaries. Then you can extract the titles from that using a list comprehension.When that is pasted into the REPL, titles contains:If the variable you show a  is actually a list already, then you just need to use the list comprehension to get the titles. If you have a new  that you want to see if it is in the list , you can just say:
