This question already has an answer here:Convert list of ints to one number?                    15 answers                I want to generate a random 4 digit number in which none of the digits are repeated.This generates a random set of 4 digits but I want this as an integer. how do I do that?         
(Assuming OP meant all the digits)Instead of using numbers and have to manipulate to  and back to , just start with ascii digits:You can convert to  if necessary.It's unclear what the OP intends to do if the first digit is .For a purely numerical approach you can use :
You can do this by converting each digit to a string, joining them, and casting them as an integer.
if you need to generate 4 digit number, just for knowledge purpose use.As suggested by AChampion this solution can contain duplicatesfrom random import randint      randint(1000, 9999)Use bernie Solution to generate a random 4 digit number in which none of the digits are repeated.
In case if you want potentially infinite sequence of numbers with 4 unique digits (or any other condition â€“ write your own)Works only in Python 3 because  returns iterator-object (in Python 2.7 it returns , more at docs)
You can multiply with powers of 10:This works as long as the first element of  is not zero.
