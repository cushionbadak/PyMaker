Natural Text
I am creating a function which reads data of a txt file, the text file is set up as one sentence per line. I have 6 requirements to strip the file of to make it usable later on in my program:Here's what I have so far...I am a little stuck, so how do I strip this file of these 6 items?
This can be accomplished via a series of regex checks and then a loop to remove all items with less than 2 characters:CodeInputOutput
