I'm trying to start a simple dir server on a local network But I am getting this error Error responseError code: 501Message: Unsupported method ('GET').Error code explanation: HTTPStatus.NOT_IMPLEMENTED - Server does not  support this operation.This is the example given at https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html If I run it from the command line it works python3 -m http.server. I need to control this server over time so I need to turn it on for a while and turn it off automatically 
The answer is in the documentation that you linked to:The  must be given a  on  instantiation, of which this module provides three different variants:This class is used to handle the HTTP requests that arrive at the  server. By itself, it cannot respond to any actual HTTP requests; it  must be subclassed to handle each request method (e.g.  or  ). ...For your case you should use  instead:This class serves files from the current directory and below, directly  mapping the directory structure to HTTP requests.
