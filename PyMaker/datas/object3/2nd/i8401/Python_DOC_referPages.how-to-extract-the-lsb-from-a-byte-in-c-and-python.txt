I'm sending a byte to my Raspi 3 and my Arduino via Bluetooth Serial.e.g.  (mode),  (mode),  (direction)The LSB indicates if the byte is a direction command or a instruction to switch mode, so I need to extract it in Arduino C and in Python.Does anyone know how to do this?Thanks in advance!
Use a bit operation:C codePython codeLSB = Least Significant Bit (in your case)
