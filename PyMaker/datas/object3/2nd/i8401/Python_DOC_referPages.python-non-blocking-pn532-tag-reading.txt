I'm planning to use Adafruit PN532 nfc https://www.adafruit.com/product/364 breakout card in my project.Is there a way to write a non blocking-code in python (using interrupts ?) in a way to avoid a loop as in this code sample ?https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_PN532/blob/master/examples/readmifare.py
(with respect to my comments..) While  is a bit lighter weight,  also has an event calling system, and is currently a bit better documented (threading has been around longer than asyncio and is a bit less abstract). As I understand it, you want to be able to read from a blocking resource while working on some other task. In this case we will create a thread to wait for a card to be read, while slowly printing a text file to stdout. This is just an example of how to do something like that. There are many ways to accomplish a similar result.
Here's the code I've tried based on @Aaron answer
