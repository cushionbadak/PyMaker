In the following code whith goal to do a wordcount, the add_counts function is concurrently called as a thread, is this operation of reading and updating threadsafe, this answer says that the dictionary update may be threadsafe but what about reading and updating like below: 
Reading and updating is not thread-safe ­­­– here's an example that you can try to use locally to see the effect in practice:The results obviously depend on the scheduling and other system/timing-dependent details, but on my system I consistently get different numbers under .Solution 1: LocksYou could require the threads to acquire a lock every time before they modify the dictionary. This slows down the program execution somewhat.Solution 2: Sum the counters at the endDepending on your exact use case, you might be able to assign a separate counter to each thread, and sum the counts together after the threads have finished counting. The dictionary-like  allows you to easily add two counters together (here's the above example modified to use Counters):
