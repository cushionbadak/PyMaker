This question already has an answer here:ValueError: Math domain error (for a 2nd grade equation function)                    2 answers                Can someone tell me why am I getting this error?I'm a newbie coding, so need some help :)My code looks like this:
You have to make it so that math.sqrt doesn't take in negative values. So if b*b-4*a*c is a negative number, then you will get the math domain error. A way to solve this is to check beforehand if the value that's going in the sqrt operation is going to be a negative value with an if statement.
I'm assuming you aren't looking to find imaginary rootsif you were you should look at cmathYou should change that block to This is called exception handling, and it's the perfect tool for situations like this. The only time that it will go to the except statement is if a math.sqrt() is given a negative. And in that case the roots are imaginary so print("No real Solution") or whatever error message you want!
