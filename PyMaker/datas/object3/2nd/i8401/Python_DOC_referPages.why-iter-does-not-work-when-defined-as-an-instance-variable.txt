If I define the  method as follows, it won't work:Result:As you can see, calling  works, but  is not iterable.However if I define  for the class, then it will work:Does anyone know why python has been designed like this? i.e. why  as instance variable does not work? Don't you find it unintuitive?
It is done by design. You can find the thorough description here: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-lookupShort answer: the special method must be set on the class object itself in order to be consistently invoked by the interpreter. Long answer: the idea behind this is to speed up well-known constructions. In your example: How often are you going to write a code like this in real life? So, what Python does - it skips a dictionary lookup of the instance, i.e.  simply does not "see" that , which is actually  in this case. It also skips all the  instance and metaclass lookup gaining a significant speedup.
