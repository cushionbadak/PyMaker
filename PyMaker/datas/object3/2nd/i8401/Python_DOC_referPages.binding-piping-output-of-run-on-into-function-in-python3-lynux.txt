I am trying to use output of external program run using the run function.this program regularly throws a row of data which i need to use in mine scriptI have found a subprocess library and used its /Example:Now assuming that foo is already in a PATH variable and it outputs a string in semi-random periods.I want the program to do its own things, and run every time foo sends new row to its output. which boiles to two problems. piping the output into a for loop and running this as a background subprocessThank youUpdate: I have managed to get the foo output onto some_function using ThisAccording to this os.popen is to be deprecated, but I am yet to figure out how to pipe internal processes in python Now just need to figure out how to run this function in a background
SO, I have solved it.First step was to start the external script:Next I have started a function that would read it and passed it a pipeLimitations are:If your wish t catch scripts error you would have to pipe it in.second is that it leaves a zombie if you kill parrent SO dont forget to kill child in signal-handling
