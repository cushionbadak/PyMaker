After updating PyCharm to 2017.1, a new inspection warning started to pop up in a place where everything's seemingly simple and correct. It looks as following:It looks like  doesn't return the expected type for  parameter, but the code is pretty straightforward and, most importantly, does work as expected (using Python 3.5.2).Python docs mention a way using  and it removes the warning indeed, but is it the correct pythonic way to specify output stream for ? If so, why? Is this warning important to follow?
The only solution I found is to type hint PyCharm correctly:This keeps PyCharm happy and does not in any way impede the correct running of your code.
