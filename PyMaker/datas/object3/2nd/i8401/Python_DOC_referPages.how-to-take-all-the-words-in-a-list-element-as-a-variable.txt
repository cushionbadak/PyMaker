Natural Text
I have the following program, in which I am trying to pass a list of elements to consecutive Google searches:Unfortunately my program is not taking ALL the words in each list item, but taking only the first one, giving me this output:Altough you can see the whole item with every word being added to the search above, when I verify the link, it is going concatenating as element ONLY the first word of each item, as such:What am I doing wrong and what's the solution to concatenate ALL the words in each list item to the google search?Thank you
This line:should be split and joined with a %20 joiner:
You can use urllib.parse.urlencode in python3. For python2 you can use urllib.urlencode.
Neither of these answers address the base issue: you need to encode the entire string as a url.I chose :Notice the  are also encoded, as will any other strange characters that might bork your query.In your case, it would be: the equivalent in Py3:so
The thing is that URLs need to be percent-encoded, there are characters with special meaning in URLs, for example:: goes to a certain position in the page: I think you know what this one does...You should use  to fix that, and just remember that: is for Python2 is for Python3Here are some examples for Python3:So you code is now:As  could include other characters that won't be escaped by , you'll have to use its safe argument:This last one, outputs:I would suggest you to see: https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html#url-quoting for further information (See? a  character!)
I believe your problem is with url-encoding.To allow spaces in the URLs they are place by '%20'Try changing your links to be likehttps://www.google.com/search?q=The%20CERN%20Recruitment%20Services
Google queries have the format https://www.google.com/search?q=keyword_1+...+keyword_N so you should format your query like so:
