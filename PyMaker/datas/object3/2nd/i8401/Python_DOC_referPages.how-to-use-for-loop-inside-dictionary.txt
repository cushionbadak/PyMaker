Can anyone please explain the below implementation:The values I am getting in various variables:I am python novice and I am unable to understand how forloop is used within dictionary as values are also absurd.Thanks for help!
let's make first the code clearer:What you have here, is not yet a dictionary, but a constructor of a dictionary, using a generator. After this is run, the variable  it is assigned to will contain a dictionarythe for loop inside this constructor is the generator to create all the elements: it loops over all elements in r, if it satisfies the condition, then it will create a tuple ( key, value) -> creating a 'on-the-fly' list of elements.The boolean selector for the 'value' is also simple if we write it differently:
Firstly, lets decompose your example:Now, if you look at the definition of the type   in python (), you will see that a dict object can be initialized with an  of (key, value) pairs. The  variable contains a generator and yield an iterable of tuples.Next, look at the expression . You may not understand the second part of the expression because it looks like a boolean operation but is actually a conditionnal assignment operation which means:if  is  then assign  else, assign Finally, the  object is a generator of 2-uples where, for each element of r, the first part is the tag and the second is the text (stripped, if necessary). The tag will be used as keys and the text as values in the final dict object.
