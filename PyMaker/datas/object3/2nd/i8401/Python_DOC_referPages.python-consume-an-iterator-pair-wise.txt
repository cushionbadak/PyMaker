I am trying to understand Python's iterators in the context of the pysam module. By using the  method on a so called AlignmentFile class one get a proper iterator  consisting of records from the file . I can the use various methods to access each record (iterable), for instance the name with :   It happens that records come in pairs so that one would like something like: Calling next() is probably not the right way for million of records, but how can one use a for loop to consume the same iterator in pairs of iterables. I looked at the grouper recipe from itertools and the SOs Iterate an iterator by chunks (of n) in Python? [duplicate] (even a duplicate!) and What is the most “pythonic” way to iterate over a list in chunks? but cannot get it to work.
First of all, don't use the variable name , because that's already the name of a builtin function.To answer your question, simply use  (Python 2) or  (Python 3) on the iterator.Your code may look as simple asedit: whoops, my original answer was the correct one all along, don't mind the itertools recipe.edit 2: Consider  if you deal with iterators that could yield an uneven amount of objects:
