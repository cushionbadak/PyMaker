I have a Python twisted application whose work is to execute os processes, monitor their life cycle and collect their logs and exit status.Now I wanted to add a feature which allows child process to notify about it's progress(e.g 50% complete) to parent. How can I enable this communication in best way?I thought of a rest endpoint in parent where child posts.Is there any other better way to enable this communication between parent process and child(can be any is process)?PS: application is written in twisted.
Consider os.pipe or multiprocessing.pipe and queues to communicate between child and parent processes. You can also use semaphores.You could also use RabitMQ to do IPC or just read a file that's being written to.
