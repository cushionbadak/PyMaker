I am learning multi-threaded Python (CPython). I'm aware of the GIL and how it limits threading to a single core (in most circumstances).I know that I/O functionality can be run multi-cored, however I have been unable to find a list of what parts of the standard library can be run across multiple cores. I believe that urllib can be run multi cored, allowing downloading on a thread on a separate core (but have been unable to find confirmation of this in the docs).  What I am trying to find out is, which parts of the standard library will run multi-core, as this doesn't seem to be specified in the documentation. Taken from the docs:However, some extension modules, either standard or third-party, are designed so as to release the GIL when doing computationally-intensive tasks such as compression or hashing. Also, the GIL is always released when doing I/O.
With the multiprocessing package you can write truly parallel programs where separate processes run on different cores. There is no limitation to which libraries (standard or not) each sub-process can use.The tricky part about multi-process programming is when the processes need to exchange information (e.g., pass each other values, wait for each other to finish with a certain task). The  package contains several tools for that.
