I want to extract the sunrise hour and if I do the followingI got the errorI can print the string  but not extract from it (?)I tried solutions from similar problem posts on extraction but couldn't make any progress, apologies if this appears to be a double post.
As I understand your question you want to print only hour of sunrise.  is object of ephem.Date type. You could make it with brute forceor you could convert  object to , and  to  representationor convert it to  firstAll available options you could read at this page in section .
@kvorobiev answered the question of how to extract from a string representation of your data. But the other half of your question was the error: According to the PyEphem documentation for the  function, If the search is successful, returns a Date value.Furthermore,  objects have an important property:Dates are stored and returned as floats. Only when printed, passed to str(), or formatted with '%s' does a date express itself as a string giving the calendar day and time.When you gave the command , the Python interpreter attempted to get call Date.getattr() to get the fields from a Date object corresponding to the slice . Without that method, slicing has no meaning to a Date object.But all is not lost! You can still get the  object's time information:Call .tuple() to split a date into its year, month, day, hour, minute, and second.You can then slice this tuple as needed to get the hour:Or exhaustively:
