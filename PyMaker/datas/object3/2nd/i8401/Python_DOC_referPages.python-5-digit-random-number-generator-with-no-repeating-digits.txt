I am supposed to print a random 5-digit number with no repeating digits, then ask the user for a three digit number. If the user's number contains three digits from the random number, print "correct". I am using this code for the random numberThe problem is it will not always print a five digit number.Also, I don't know how to match the user number with the random number.Thank you.
Take a random sample of the digits 0 to 9:
You can generate all the 5 digits ints with unique digits like so:Then use  to select one at random.(but tdelaney's answer is better)
Use zfill and set like so: Edited to account for numbers with repeating digits
If you generate your numbers like this:And got the numbers from the user like this:You could determine if the user's numbers were in the number list like so:And then it would be a really simple matter to combine this all together into a program. Note that the numbers are never actually treated as numbers - they're just strings.
