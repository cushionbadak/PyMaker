I have a function that can accept a date or a datetime as one of its arguments.  If the value is a datetime, I would like to convert it to its  components.  What is the pythonic way of doing that?
Since  objects are  objects, you should be able to call any  functions on  and have it work.But if you must:will normallize any  and  objects to  objects... now you only have to deal with them, as  objects are not  objects:NOTE: the reverse is not applicable:as  inherits from .
You could first check if it is of type  and then go on to convert it to its  component using .An example of this in code would be as follows.Importing the  module, and setting a variable  to be the current .Then checking if  is a  object, and if it is set it to be its  counterpart.
