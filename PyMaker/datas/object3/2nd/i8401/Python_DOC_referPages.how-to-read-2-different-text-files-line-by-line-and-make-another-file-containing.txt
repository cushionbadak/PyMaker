There are problems with the statement  on so many levels that I get a kind of vertigo as we drill down through them:The apparent intention to use a variable called  (a bad idea because it would overshadow Python's builtin reference to the  class). Let's call it  instead.Not initializing the dictionary instance first. If you had called it something like this oversight would earn you an easy-to-understand . However since you're calling it , Python will actually be attempting to set items in the  class itself (which doesn't support ) instead of inside a  instance, so you'll get a different, more-confusing error.Attempting to make a  entry assignment where the key is a non-hashable type ( is a). You could convert the to the hashable type  easily enough, but that's not what you want because you'd still be...Attempting to assign bunch of values to their respective keys all at once. This can't be done with  syntax.   It could be done all in one relatively simple statement, i.e.  but unfortunately that doesn't get around the fact that you're...Not stripping the newline character off the end of each key and value.Instead, this line:will do what you appear to want.
