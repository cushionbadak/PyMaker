Natural Text
I have implemented an algorithm in C++ and inside the implementation I count some statistics, like cache misses, instructions, branch misses etc. This information is printed in the end with .  However I would also like to know how much space the implementation is using. I use  as follows:unfortunately only the output from  is stored in  and not the output of  as well. Here is one possible output from :I am only interested in . If I could somehow store this big text inside , then I was hoping that I could parse it. But the output is not stored at all in , it is simply printed. What is the best way to approach this problem?
 outputs to STDERR, so you need to redirect that to STDOUT, or capture it separately. From the  command manpage:When command finishes, time writes a message to standard error giving timing statistics about this program run.Bold italic emphasis mine.Redirecting is done with :or use  to capture the two streams separately: is new in Python 3.5 and up; use  directly if you have an older Python version (and consider upgrading ASAP):
