I would like to use the  package in Python to do some association rule mining. The package includes a function called load_transactions package that according to the doctring, "Load transactions and returns a generator for transactions." Now I cannot understand how to use this function. If I use a file name I get each character of the file name, like this:I would like to know how to load these files so that I can use the other functions of the package. Any form of help will be appreciated.
A little late here, but I've found it easier to re-write the loading and dumping functions for  myself (for JSON in my case). Here's some code that should work in your case (and that adds context management to make it a bit safer):The code above is basically straight out of the csv docs, with the original generator from  intact. I just submitted a pull request for my fix, so I'll update you if/when the request is accepted.As an aside, if you're unfamiliar with context managers it's worth reading up on, and this link provides a great tutorial.UpdateThe package author responded with the following:...In my opinion, load_transaction() should be able to takes a file-like object as the csv.reader() do, even if it can also take a file path....opening file externally and giving the file object to load_transaction() can solve that problem as below.
