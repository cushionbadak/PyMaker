I have a simple string "abc". Now I have to write Python code for creating all possible unique substrings, except the empty string, from this string.The answer should be as follows:abcabacbcabcI wrote something like this :But this is probably the wrong way , since it is not giving expected results.Can someone please help me with an efficient solution.Thanks in advance.
The build-in itertools library (https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/itertools.html) has some wonderful functions that you can use. Basically you want to get the possible combinations of letters, for different length of strings. So the code sample below loops over the size of the string: (1,2,3), gets all possible combinations for that particular size, and "chains", or appends them. The functions from itertools use iterators, which means that the final answer isn't stored in memory, but created when you need the values. For larger strings this will use much less RAM.

Use itertool combinations to create combinations of different length.You can later change format of result, for example:
