Natural Text
Suppose I have K and V. K contains a tuplewhile V is a floating-point numberWhat I'm trying to do is to write both into a text file like this:orMy code is this:However, when I open the text file, the output looks like this:What could be causing Python to print like this? How do I fix this?
As discussed in the comments here is the code;and it produces this output the file which you specified as a desired output in your question;you can also use a  statement when writing to files because a  statement automatically closes the file so you dont need to explicitly close it so for your example it will be;just dont forget to indent where you need the file because as soon as it isnt indented anymore the file will close
you have a wrong understanding of str.join(xx) function. This function "return a string which is concatenation of the string in the iterable xx". You can use str.format() instead.
You can do:And, it will be just fine.           
The problem lies here - .The join method expects an iterable (like a list) in the parameters. When you give it the string 'String1 String2 Float', it 'joins' every two letters with a new line.It seems all that you want to do is write every entry in a new line (not every letter!), so replace the line with something like If you haven't come across  yet, read up about it here.
