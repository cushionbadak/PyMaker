You are probably using  wrong.I suspect, you need to give it a flag to use binary-mode like (docs):The docs explain the default-behaviour: But you can make it simple and just use the filepath itself (as np.load is able to take ):(A simplified rule: everything which is using general-purpose compression is alway's working with binary-files; not text-files!)
