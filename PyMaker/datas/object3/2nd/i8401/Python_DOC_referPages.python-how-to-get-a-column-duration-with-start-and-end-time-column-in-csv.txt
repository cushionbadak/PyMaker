I have a problem in manipulating csv file.In my csv file, there is a column 'Start Time' and 'Complete Time' and I want to get a column 'Duration' using it.When I tried , it showed me an error message.
Since the data you obtained from csv file is of str type, you can not do the operation:I would advice you to first convert row[2] and row[1] content, and then do the operation.
