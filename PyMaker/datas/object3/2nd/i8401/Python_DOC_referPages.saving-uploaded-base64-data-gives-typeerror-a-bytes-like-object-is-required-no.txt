I am using a JavaScript library to upload an image. It places the image data in a form field that is a JSON encoded object with the file name and base64 encoded data.When I try to save the image in Flask, I get this error: The image file is created with the correct name, but the data is corrupt, I can't open it. How do I save the uploaded data?
 represents a string, not bytes, you want . Base64 encoded data is not the actual image bytes, it needs to be decoded with .
You need to encode either  or ,  to be a byte-like object. Try the  method.
