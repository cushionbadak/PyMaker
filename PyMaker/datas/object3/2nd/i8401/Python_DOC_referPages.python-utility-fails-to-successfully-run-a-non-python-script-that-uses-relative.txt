My Python3 utility has a function that doesn't work (unless it's placed within selected directories, where it can then run the non-python  scripts successfully).  I want to run the utility from a set location on any of the template.tex files I have, stored in various other locations. The Python utility prompts the user to select a  template file from an absolute path using a tkinter.filedialog GUI, then runs the user's selected script using, for example:  Python's  runs , which then runs its  script.   has numerous inputs written with relative paths like .So, the Python utility works fine as long as it's in the exact same path as   that the user selects.  Otherwise  can't finds its own input files.   delivers an error message like:  because the execution path is relative to the Python script and not the  script.[ needs to use relative paths because the folders with its .tex files get moved around, as needed.]I found the following similar case on Stack Overflow, but I don't think the answers are geared towards this situation: Relative Paths In Python -- Stack Overflow
By referring to other files with relative paths like , your  file is assuming (and requiring) that  is only run on it from the same directory that  is located in.  You thus need to satisfy this requirement by changing to the directory containing  before calling :Even better is to use , as it handles the change of directory for you and isn't vulnerable to shell quoting issues:
Use  instead of  and pass in the  parameter as the directory of the latex script.See the  docs here, and look at the  parameter for .Example:
