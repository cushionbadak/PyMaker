This question already has an answer here:Why does the expression 0 < 0 == 0 return False in Python?                    9 answers                Is `a<b<c` valid python?                    3 answers                I'm newbie in python. I have a three variables , ,  as a . I have comparison three variables in  condition. I'm confused about following code result.The expression  evaluates to false.Let's assume ,  and . if  become False, then  become True. but output is False. Why?My python script:
The document say:Comparisons can be chained arbitrarily; for example, x < y <= z is  equivalent to x < y and y <= z, except that y is evaluated only once  (but in both cases z is not evaluated at all when x < y is found to be  false). neither means  nor .  is equivalent to , and is evaluates from left-to-right.Logical AND do not have associativity in Python unlike C and C++. There are separate rules for sequences of this kind of operator and cannot be expressed as associativity. only evaluates the second argument if the first one is true because  is a short-circuit operator.
That expression is evaluated as:So now you see why it is false is because  is not less than
