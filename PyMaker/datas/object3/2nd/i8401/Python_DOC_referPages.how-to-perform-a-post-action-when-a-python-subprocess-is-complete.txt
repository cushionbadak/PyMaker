I have a python script that creates a subprocess to run indexing operations (logstash to elasticsearch).the code snippet is as follows,I do not call process.wait(), as the subprocess I'm creating needs to run independent of the rest of the script. But I do have to update the database record when the subprocess is complete. The indexing operation that I am running does not allow me to create a post job call that will allow me to update the database.How can I handle this with python subprocess? I do store the PIDs of the jobs in a text file, but I'd like to have a trigger in place that knows when the subprocess is complete to execute the next script. 
Since you appear to stash the  variable somewhere, later you can check its  attribute after calling its  method.If the process has completed then its  value won't be  and you can update your database.
You could create your process in a thread. You can  from the thread, so you get the output, and it's non-blocking and in your main thread:
