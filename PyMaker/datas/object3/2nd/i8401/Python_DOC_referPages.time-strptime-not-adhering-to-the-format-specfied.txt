Natural Text
Although I passed  as the format string in , it is operating on  and therefore causing error. Any idea on what might be causing it?The same thing runs perfectly in python console but not in the actual code.
The value for %Z comes from the  object attached to the  object, but there is no  object (and thus no  either) if you're using  instead of .  Indeed, the only  objects which come with the standard Python library are the fixed-offset  objects, and then only in Python 3.  The standard library does not have a canonical list of these, besides a standard UTC value; instead, you're expected to create them as needed, or use pytz instead.  As a result, the Python standard library has no mechanism for translating arbitrary three-letter codes into timezones.  It should be able to handle , some synonyms, and perhaps your local time as returned by your system locale, but that's about it.(Hint: For most people, pytz is the Right Thing to use.)Three-letter codes are not globally unique anyway, so there is no "right" way to do what you're asking for.  You need to have something like an Olson database identifier (e.g.  is roughly synonymous with Eastern Standard/Daylight Time).
Actualy I just made a very silly mistake the order of parenthesis is wrong in above, it should be like this I was actually passing only time string to time.strptime() leaving the format Sorry for inconvinience caused
