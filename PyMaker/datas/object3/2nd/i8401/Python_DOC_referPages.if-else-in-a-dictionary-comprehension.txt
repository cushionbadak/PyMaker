This question already has an answer here:Ternary expression in dictionary comprehension                    2 answers                Is it possible to use the  statement (and if yes, how?) in a ?It is not possible to use  as part of the comprehension itself (see this) but at least in  and  comprehensions it is possible to use the  (see this).An example for  is here.My example code is:This does not work.The weird part is that does not work either, although it should be ok. does work,but this is not the result I want. should not work, as I pointed out above.I know that I could bypass the problem by using two dictcomps, but I want to know why this does not work.
That's because the conditional applies for the value of the dictionary, not for the key value pair, i.e it is evaluated as:and  is not syntactically valid here, it's only valid inside a pair of curly brackets or in a function signature (so, you could place  in brackets and fix the  but, that changes the end result).The solution is to simply supply the value in the conditional since that is what changes:Another option, of course, is to instead supply tuples to the  constructor:
