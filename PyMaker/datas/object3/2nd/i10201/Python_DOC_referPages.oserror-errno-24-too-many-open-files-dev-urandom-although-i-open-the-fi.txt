I am using subprocess to call another program and save its return values to a variable. This process is repeated in a loop, and after a few thousands times the program crashed with the following error:Any idea how to solve this issue is much appreciated!Code supplied from comments:
In Mac OSX (El Capitan) See current configuration:Set open files value to 10K :Verify results:
I guess the problem was due to the fact that I was processing an open file with subprocess:Here the cmd variable contain the name of a file that has just been created but not closed. Then the  calls a system command on that file. After doing this for many times, the program crashed with that error message.So the message I learned from this isClose the file you have created, then process itThanks
You can try raising the open file limit of the OS:
A child process created by  may inherit open file descriptors (a finite resource) from the parent. Use  on POSIX (default since Python 3.2), to avoid it. Also, "PEP 0446 -- Make newly created file descriptors non-inheritable" deals with some remaining issues (since Python 3.4).
As others have noted, raise the limit in /etc/security/limits.conf and also file descriptors was an issue for me personally, so I did And added a line with fs.file-max = 100000 to /etc/sysctl.conf (reload with sysctl -p)Also if you want to make sure that your process is not affected by anything else (which mine was), use to find out what the actual limits of your process are, as for me the software running the python scripts also had its limits applied which have overridden the system wide settings.Posting this answer here after resolving my particular issue with this error and hopefully it helps someone.
Maybe you are invoking the command multiple times. If so, each time you're doing . Between each call try doing .
opens file in subprocess. It is blocking call.
