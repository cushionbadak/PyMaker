I encountered a quite odd problem while dealing with the max of a long list of lists of of pairs, such asI am trying to get the maximum of the first element of all the pairs.Pythonically, I was doing:which actually returns the correct number, IF the list is shorter than 281 lists.In fact, as soon as the list is longer than 280, I get this messageSo, for a long listit's fine, whilebreaks.Am I doing something wrong here?
You have an empty list among your list of lists, at index 280. Slicing up to  excludes it, and it is included with .This is easily reproduced with a shorter sample:You can avoid the issue altogether by chaining your lists together, here using :This treats all nested lists as one long list, an empty list somewhere in between simply doesn't contribute to that new sequence.
Why not just this?You can extract the first item from the beginning.  Empty lists and tuples are ignored.EDITis more efficient.
