Natural Text
I'm currently using RethinkDB, which has a nice web UI with a Data Explorer which allows the user to print out the contents of the database like this:Note that each key-value pair starts on a new line, and the keys and values (mostly) have different colors. By contrast, if I print out the same using iPython, I get an almost illegible result:This is slightly ameliorated if I iterate over the cursor and  each item, like so:However, this requires more typing and still doesn't look as good as the RethinkDB web UI. Is there perhaps an iPython plugin that I can install to improve the appearance of the printed output?(I had a look at pprint, but this seems to control only the positioning of the text and not its color).
You could use :Although this does not display the keys in sorted order, as appears to be the case in the example, it might be sufficient for your needs. As pointed out by @coder, you  can sort the keys by specifying the  parameter.It might also be possible to print the object directly (haven't tested this):which might also print out the surrounding "list" object.To handle objects that do not support serialisation to JSON you can use a custom . Here is an example which handles  objects:You can use  to format the date time string as required.
mhawke's answer works if one adds the keyword argument  to RethinkDB's  command. (Otherwise, you get a  because RethinkDB's object containing the time zone is not JSON serializable). The result looks like this:which is much more legible. A slight drawback is that the  is more difficult to interpret than the original time format.
