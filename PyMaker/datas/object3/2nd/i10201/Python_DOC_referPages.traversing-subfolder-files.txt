I have wrote a script to erase a given word from docx files and am at my last hurdle of it checking subfolder items as well. Can someone help me in figuring out where I am failing in my execution. It works with all the files within the same directory but it won't also check subfolder items right now. Thanks for your help.
os.walk iterates through subdirectories yielding a 3-tuple  for each subdirectory visited. When you do:things go badly wrong.  is the name of the subdirectory in each iteration which means that  is really enumerating the characters in the directory name. It so happens that the first directory you iterate is  and just by luck its a single character directory name so your for loop appears to work.As soon as you walk into another subdirectory (lets call it 'foo'), your code will try to find subdirectories called ,  and  a second time. That doesn't work.But you shouldn't be re-enumerating the subdirectories yourself.  already does that. Boiling your code down to the enumeration part, this will find all of the  in the subtree.
