I don't know what attributes an object supports. How can I open up the module and figure out what's going on "under the hood"?For example, I want to figure out what attributes the  object from the  module has in its :But, since  has no  method, there must be a different way of accessing each part of the time (, , , etc.)I have found (by trial and error) that you can do this:but I'm not sure what the proper name for what I'm doing here is, and how I can find other methods that belong to this object/class.
In your terminal, type  and you should be able to see all the variables and functions it has. If it's undocumented,  is the way to go. In any situation, obviously Google.BTW, to clarify the terms in your question,  is a module. You have to understand modules, classes, and objects are different things. You can learn more about modules and the  function here.
I find the  function to be the most useful when dealing with unknown and undocumented objects ( is well documented, btw).But if it weren't documented:and so on...
