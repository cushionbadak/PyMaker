I have a pandas dataframe that I am looking to convert into an xlsx and attach to an email. I can send emails based on outlook(this is the only way I can do it). I am able to convert the dataframe into an xlsx and save it on my drive and afterwards send it as attachment but I am looking to attach it directly without having to save it on my drive. see bellow my function to send emails:attachment is the dataframe that has been transformed into xlsx

Unfortunately,  works with either a string (interpreted as a path) or an . In that case, we need to create the  ourselves, and wrap a  with it.I am not familiar with the Outlook Python tools for sending emails, I use SMTP:I hope this helps, good luck!
