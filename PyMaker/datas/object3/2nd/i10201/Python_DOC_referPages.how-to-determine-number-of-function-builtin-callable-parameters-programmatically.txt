I want to be able to classify an unknown function/builtin/callable based on its number of arguments.I may write a piece of code like that:but I have no idea how to implement .   does not work with builtins. I can not use exceptions, since it is potentially expensive to call the function.It would be great if the solution work with both Python 2.7 and Python 3.3+
From Python 3.3New in version 3.3.Introspecting callables with the Signature objectAnd then you can count them, and do whatever you like.
You can somewhat do this, but only in Python 3. This is when  made information about the signature of objects available.Take note, not all built-ins are actually available as of right now, currently:do not expose information about their signature. For the rest  (a thin wrapper around ) and  would do.In Python 2, you only have the option of  which doesn't do the trick for built-ins and probably never will. So, there's no solution that spans across python versions. For the most compatible solution, I'd use  as of right now.As for the most simplistic way to check, just count the  from the  returned:
