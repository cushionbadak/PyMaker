Could you help me understand why  equals true?
If you use the  method of a compiled regex, it will act as if you've passed  (well, not exactly, but for the purposes of , it is). This means that it'll think  is at the end of the input (which is what  matches).However, when this is not the case the extra whitespace at the end of  will prevent  from matching, so no match is found.
