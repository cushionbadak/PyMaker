I am writing a client-server application. While connected, client sends to the server a "heartbeat" signal, for example, every second.On the server-side I need a mechanism where I can add tasks (or coroutines or something else) to be executed asynchronously. Moreover, I want to cancel tasks from a client, when it stops sending that "heartbeat" signal. In other words, when the server starts a task it has kind of timeout or ttl, in example 3 seconds. When the server receives the "heartbeat" signal it resets timer for another 3 seconds until task is done or client disconnected (stops send the signal).Here is an example of canceling a task from asyncio tutorial on pymotw.com. But here the task is canceled before the event_loop started, which is not suitable for me.
You can use   wrappers to execute a task via the  method. will automatically wrap your coroutine in a  wrapper and attach it to your event loop. The  wrapper will then also ensure that the coroutine 'cranks-over' from  to  statement (or until the coroutine finishes).In other words, just pass a regular coroutine to  and assign the resultant  object to a variable. You can then call  when you need to stop it.Note that tasks are meant for long-running tasks that need to keep working in the background without interrupting the main flow. If all you need is a quick once-off method, then just call the function directly instead.
