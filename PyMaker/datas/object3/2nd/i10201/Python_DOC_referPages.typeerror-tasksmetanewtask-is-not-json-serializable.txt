I am trying to dump this json - and it fails for the key 'name'. I have decoded it in utf-8 but still not luck. I am getting the following error.TypeError: 'tasks:meta:newtask' is not JSON serializablewhat is not serializable about the above string ? I am clueless.
The "name" value in your dict is a  object, not string. You have to decode it or you can write your custom JSON encoder:
Notice how that item is displayed in the dictionary:That leading  indicates that 'tasks:meta:newtask' is a byte string, not a regular character string.  JSON is telling you that it doesn't know how to handle a byte string object.Does it really need to be a byte string?  If not, you should convert it to a regular string before calling json dump.
