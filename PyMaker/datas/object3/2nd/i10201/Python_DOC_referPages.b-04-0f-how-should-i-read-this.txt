This is the "new" formatting string syntax, explained in https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#format-specification-mini-language.The first  means pad with "0"The  means align to the left (so the number will be followed by a bunch of 0's, e.g. '4' will be formatted as "400000â€¦")The  means the minimum width is 4 charactersThe  means the precision is 0, i.e. don't show any decimal parts.The  means the type is a fixed-point number.Examples:
The Python documentation for format strings explains what this means.In the case of , it means:
