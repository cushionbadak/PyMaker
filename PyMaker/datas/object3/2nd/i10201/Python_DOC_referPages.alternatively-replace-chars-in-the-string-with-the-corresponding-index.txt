How to replace the alternative characters in the string with the corresponding index without iterating? For example:should be returned as:I have the below code to achieve this. But is there a way to skip the loop or, more pythonic way to achieve this:where  hold my required value
You could use a list comprehension, and re-join the characters with ; the latter avoids repeated (slow) string concatenation):Note that you can't evade iteration here. Even if you defined a large list of pre-stringified odd numbers here () then re-use that to use slice assignment on a list  Python has to iterate under the hood to re-assign the indices. That's the nature of working with an arbitrary-length sequence.
