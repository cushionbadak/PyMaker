Interest Calculator Let the user calculate the amount of money they will have in the bank after their interest has compounded for a certain number of years. Note: A = P(1+r)^t where A = total amount, P = principal, r = rate, and t = time.This is what I tried: I used actual_principal, actual_rate, and actual_time to convert the strings into (exact) integers...I used float instead of int because float will maintain an input with decimals, right?But I got an error message on line 9I'm assuming that the 'float' object refers to either actual_principal or actual_rate, or both, since those are the two values that I converted. Why, then, aren't they callable? How can I fix this program to calculate interest correctly? Thank you!  EDIT Learned that power function in python is ** and that implied multiplication operators don't exist in python syntax. Reworked my equation to look like this: When entering 13.58 for "How much money do you currently have in the bank?", 0.3 for "What is your interest rate?", and 5 for "Over how many years is the interest compounded?", I got the answer 1714808.43561 - so the calculator works! EDIT 2Replaced my equation with this one - it's a better / cleaner way to create the interest calculator - although both will get you the same result: 
A few things wrong with what you have.  is not what you think it is in Python.  is an XOR binary operator not power. If you want power you use math.pow() module.Also using  is wrong. You are trying to call the function  with the argument  instead of multiplying it. Try  instead. 
Your code is wrong: you are elevating the entire equation to the power of actual time instead elevating only (1+r) !!! Check this:
