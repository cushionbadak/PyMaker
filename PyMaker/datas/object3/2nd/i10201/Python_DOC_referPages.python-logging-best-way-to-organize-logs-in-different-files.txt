I have different loggers (log1, log2, log3, ..., logN) which are being logged to "registry.log" for a big N. I would like to divide "registry.log" into N different files as "registry.log" can become really large.Is there a way to accomplish this automatically, for instance, with a  rotating handler?
Create a  subclass which determines which file to write to based on the details of the event being logged, and write the formatted event to that file.
