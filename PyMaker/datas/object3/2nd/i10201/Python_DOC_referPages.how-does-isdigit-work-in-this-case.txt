When I was looking for a solution for the problem "count digits in a given string containing both letters and digits" there was one with built-in function .isdigit(). Here it is:It works nicely but I cannot get how it works. I have read that the  returns true if there is at least one digit in a string false otherwise. And one more question: how the function "takes out" the digits from the string and converts it in integers and how it skips the letters? Why  when  is a letter does not produce an error? such as:
First of all, the function doesn't count digits in a string. It sums up the digits in a string. Secondly,  only returns true if all characters in a string are digits, not just one of the characters. From the  documentation:Return true if all characters in the string are digits and there is at least one character, false otherwise.This means  is false, because there is a non-digit character in that string. Iteration over a string produces 1-character strings, so there is always exactly one character in your function loop.So,  is never called on any non-digit, because the generator expression filters out any character that is not a digit.You can see what happens if you use a simple  loop instead:Because  only returns true for strings (here consisting of just one character each) contains only digits.Instead of a  loop, you could use a list comprehension to produce a list:Now it is easy to add that  call and see the difference:Because only digits are passed through,  always works, it is never called on a letter.Your function then uses  on those values, so for my sample string, adding up 4 + 2 + 8 + 1 is 15:
