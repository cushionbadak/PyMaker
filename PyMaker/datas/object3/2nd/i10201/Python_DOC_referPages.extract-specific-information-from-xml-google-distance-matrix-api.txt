Natural Text
Here is my XML output:I am trying to use Python to save this XML from the web locally (this part is complete). After the file is saved, I want to extract the 'duration' value (of 19, in this case) and the 'distance' value (of 154, in this case). I just can't seem to figure out how to read and extract the necessary information from this XML. I have tried working with ElementTree and trying to implement others solutions from stackoverflow, with no luck. I'm about 3 hours into what should be a quick process.Here is my code as it sits now:Current error message is: AttributeError: 'Nonetype' object has no attribute 'text'I know the code is incomplete to grab both the duration and distance, but I am just trying to get something working at this point!
Just use XPath queries:Here's a nice XPath tutorial: http://zvon.org/comp/r/tut-XPath_1.html.
