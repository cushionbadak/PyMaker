Natural Text
I am currently running this code for search for bigram for entire of my text processing.Variable alltext is really long text (over 1 million words)I ran this code to extract bigramThe code above searches for the frequency occurrence for possible bigrams.The code prints me lots of bigrams and its number of occurrence.The output is similar to this.How can i sort the frequency from highest to lowest number of occurrence. My desire result would be.Thank you very much, I am quite new to nltk and text processing so my explanation would not be as clear.
It looks like  is a dictionary. In that case, in Python 3 the  method does not return a list, so you'll have to cast it to one.Once you have a list, you can simply use the  parameter of the  method, which specifies what we're sorting against:You have to add  because otherwise the results would be in ascending order. Note that this will sort the list in place. This is best when you want to avoid copying. If instead you wish to obtain a new list, just use the  built-in function with the same arguments.Alternatively, you can replace the lambda with   module, which does the same thing:
