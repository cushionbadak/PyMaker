I got this piece of code to spit out the unique "area number" in the URL. However, the loop doesn't work. It spits out the same number, please see below:Results are:http://millersamuel.com/aggy-data/home/query_report?area=38&housing_type=3&measure=4&query_type=quarterly&region=1&year_end=2020&year_start=198023http://millersamuel.com/aggy-data/home/query_report?area=23&housing_type=1&measure=4&query_type=annual&region=1&year_end=2020&year_start=198023As you can see it spits out the area number '23' which is only in one of this URL but not the '38' of the other URL.
There's a typo in your code. You iterate over  list and bind its elements to  variable, but print a slice of  variable, so you get the same string printed on each loop iteration. So you can change  to , but it's better to call your variables with more descriptive names, so here's the fixed version of your loop:And I also want to show you a proper way to extract  value from URLs:So instead of using  method, you can write this:Used functions:
You need to change:
