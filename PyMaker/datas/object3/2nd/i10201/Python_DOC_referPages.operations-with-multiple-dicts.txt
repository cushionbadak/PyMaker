The main questions is how do I have to iterate / indicate correctly to work with two dicts?I have given two dicts  which I have to compare. If the key i is the same in both, an operation is followed due to a given function. The result goes into another dict (). If either  contains the key i, the value goes in to . The return is a . Here is an example.I am struggling with the correct way to properly indicate the two dicts d1 and d2. Here is my code:Do I have to loop over d1 and d2 ()? It seems like I have to somehow integrate both given dicts to make the for loop work. Thanks for any hints!
 gets rid of duplicates.    combines the two lists of keys in the dictionaries
Use  to get an iterable of all keys in your dicts.
