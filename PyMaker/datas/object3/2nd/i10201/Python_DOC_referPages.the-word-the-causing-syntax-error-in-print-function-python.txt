I'm using "The coder's apprentice: Learning Python with Python 3" (http://www.spronck.net/pythonbook/pythonbook.pdf).I'm doing this exercise: "The cover price of a book is $24.95, but bookstores get a 40 percent discount.Shipping costs $3 for the first copy and 75 cents for each additional copy. Calculate the total wholesale costs for 60 copies."This is my code: For whatever reason, the word  in this line of code:Produces a syntax error. Given that I remove each word until I reach  I still get a syntax error. When only  and  are left, the error: EOL while scanning string literalis produced. I don't have a clue what to do.Here's my code: Using IDLE editor (not prompt).
Because you got an extra . Instead ofdoYou can also omit calling , from  docs:All non-keyword arguments are converted to strings like str() does and written to the streamUPDAlso you skipped  at the end of error line.And as @tobias_k mentioned you forgot closing  for  method So for your code to work without  methods:Or even better with It's now more readable.
