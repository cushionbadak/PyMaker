Natural Text
I recently made a program which prints a word diagonally. Whenever I go to the console/python interpreter and type , it will just continue onto the next line and won't do anything.However, if I do:  it enters python and lets me enter inputs for my programWhy is this happening?My code (copied from comment below):I got this error:
The flag  tells python to process the script, and then enter interactive mode. Without the  python will just process the script and then exit.A script might define functions, classes etc, but not call them. If you want the script to do something, you must have at least one line in your script that calls a function.The usual pattern is:The error you get is because the diagonal function has one required argument, the text. You need to supply this argument in some way. You could use an  function in the code (as in my example), or you could use the command line by , and reading . The python documentation has examples of this
