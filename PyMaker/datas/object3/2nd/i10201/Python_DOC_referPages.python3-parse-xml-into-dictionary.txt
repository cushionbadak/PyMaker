It seems the original post was too vague, so I'm narrowing down the focus of this post.  I have an XML file from which I want to pull values from specific branches, and I am having difficulty in understanding how to effectively navigate the XML paths.  Consider the XML file below.  There are several  branches.  I want to store the  value of certain branches, but not others.  In this example, I want the  values of counter1 and counter3, but not counter2.From that I would like to build a tuple with the following:('20140126234500.0+0000', 58, 7)where 20140126234500.0+0000 is taken from , 58 is taken from the  value of the  element that has  and 7 is taken from the  element that has .I would like to use  since it seems to be standard and should be more than capable for my purposes.  But I am having difficulty in navigating the tree and extracting the values I need.  Below is some of what I have tried.From a pseudo code standpoint, what I am wanting to do is:I'm not clear when to use  or .  Also, I'm not having the best of luck with using  within the functions, or being able to extract the info I'm needing.Thanks,Rusty
Starting with:Now  has the xml tree and  will be the dictionary you're trying to get the result.The counters are in :At this point,  is:Some shortening, though possibly not as read-able: the code in the  loop can be:Or further, building the  can be done in just two lines with the counters first and  after:Edit:From the docs,  finds only elements with a tag which are direct children of the current element. only finds the first direct child. iterates over all the elements recursively.
