To calculate cartesian product with python is very simple. Just need to use itertools.productBut I can't find the reverse operation. How to find the source  from the result of a product. Does anyone know the universal solution?I appreciate any suggestions.
Its only a partial solution but assuming you know for certain that the result is a valid cartesian product generated by  and it is over lists of distinct valuesHere we simply use the  idiom to unpack the tuples and then use  in lieu of an  to reduce them to their unique values.This approach generalises to larger  of distinct values.
