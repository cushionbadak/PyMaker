Hey try to put the print value in variable and print that at the end. Like this.Hope this helps
In Python, the simplest way to reverse a  is with a slice:Slicing will give you a copy of the sequence in reverse order.In general, you want a function to do one thing. Returning a value and printing some output are separate concerns, so they should not be conflated in the same function. If you have a function that returns a reversed string, you can simply print the function:Then, you can see that your actual algorithm is fine, if not entirely Pythonic:You can clearly see now that it's the print function in your way.
