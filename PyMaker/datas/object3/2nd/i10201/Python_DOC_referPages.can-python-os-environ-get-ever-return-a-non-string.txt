In this code here, they use  to get the value of an environment variable, and then immediately check to see if it is an instance of their custom classes.Is it actually possible that the  will be an instance of their custom classes? Is this dead code?
Anything that comes from the outside will be just a string, I guess.On the other hand if you are adding something to the environment from the Python code, then you have just a bit more freedom.Adding anything but a string still fails:However, you could make your own class inherited from str:In Python2 this seems to do the trick:However, in Python 3 it does not. It looks like it just saves a string:Still, that does not explain the code from pyhocon. I don't see how that object could be pushed into .Unless they monkeypatched ... In that case, anything would be possible.
The  is just a simple mapping of . It just adds some flavour on top of a dict to interact with the environment. Environment variables do not have type - their plain strings.You can set variable types in bash, but this is not passed on to other programs.Even when you call a process from inside of python, you cannot pass other types than  or .
