I suppose to write a code that prints out the value of a number that occurs twice in the list given, but they don't allow us to use a built in function on python. How would I be able to write it without using enumerate? 
 is pretty much similar to a construct of the form:So, in your code, replacing  altogether could be done by:Or, without assigning to an  name to temporarily hold the sequence item:Creating a little  function, is also rather simple: has also been defined as to match that as used in  and gets a default value of .Rather than ing values (if this is mystifying to you), you can create a list (generator comprehensions are similar to ing) comprehension and return that instead:
Your own enumerate function might be something like this: Unlike the built-in , which is a generator that yields one item at a time, your function is returning a list.
