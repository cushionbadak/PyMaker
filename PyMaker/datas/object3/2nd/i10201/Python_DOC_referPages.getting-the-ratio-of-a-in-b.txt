Natural Text
This is the current code I have, the issue is clearly that I can't divide strings by strings, but I'm unsure of how to go about editing the code to get it to run.In theory, 0.5 should be printed;  forms half of all text in .
Apparently you want a ratio here; a number between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating what percentage of a larger string is using a smaller string:Demo:
