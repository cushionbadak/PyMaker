Natural Text
I am new to threads and multiprocessing.  I have some code in which I start a process and I wanted the output to show an active waiting state of something like this The code is similiar to this below:import threading    import timeWhen I run the code above, I receive the output:not a big surprise, except that only the 'timer started' appears at the beginning and the rest of the text appears in an instant at the end.If I change the line print(".", end="") to print("."), I receive the following output:where the dots appear in 1 second increments, which was my intention.Is there a way to get the 'Waiting...' on one line without the end=""?And secondly I am guessing this is something to do with the internals of the print() function, and if not, should I perform the threading in another manner?  I do not think the problem is the GIL as I have tried multiprocess.Process and got the same result. 
This is probably due to  buffering. It is flushed on  and on some other occasions (like buffer overflow or program exit). Instead of  try this:everywhere.
