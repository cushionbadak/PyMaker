Natural Text
People,I need a regex to remove punctuation from a string, but keep the accents and URLs. I also have to keep the mentions and hashtags from that string.I tried with the code above but unfortunately, it replaces the characters with accents but I want to keep the accents.The output for the following text "Apenas um teste com acentuação. Para pontuação também! #python @stackoverflow http://xyhdhz.com.br" should be "Apenas um teste com acentuação Para pontuação também #python @stackoverflow http://xyhdhz.com.br"How could I do that?
You can use Python's regex module and  to replace any characters you want to get rid of. You can either use a blacklist and replace all the characters you don't want, or use a whitelist of all the characters you want to allow and only keep those. This will remove anything in the bracketed class of characters:(tested with Python 3.5)To keep URLs you will have to do a little more processing to check for that format (which is pretty varied). What kind of input/output are you looking for in that case?edit: based on your added input example:
