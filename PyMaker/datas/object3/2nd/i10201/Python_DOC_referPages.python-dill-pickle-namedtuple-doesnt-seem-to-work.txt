I have namedtuple inside a class. When pickling using dill, it complains the classic issue of not being able to find the namedtuple object at top module. This is default assignment for self.TM and others, and I dynamically assign namedtuple as I parse the log.But pickling :I am not sure if there is any way out. Else would have to route thru the path just to nit-pick the dataframes to pickle, which I hate to do.Any help is very appreciated.
The issue is the  . If you don't use the  as a class attribute, then your class should pickle.It should work like this:However, as soon as you try to use the  as a attribute, it fails with the error you are seeing.I'd suggest adding a  method (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#object.reduce) to tell  how to serialize the state of the class instance.
