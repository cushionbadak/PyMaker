Consider the following code:What I want is to format the JSON so that JSON objects that have only a single property  are rendered on a single line, as follows.I have played around with implementing a custom  and passing that in to  as the  argument, but the two methods on  each have a problem:The   method is called for each part of , but the return value is not a raw JSON string, so there doesn't appear to be any way to adjust its formatting.The   method does return a raw JSON string, but it is only called once for the  as a whole.Is there any way I can get  to do what I want?
The  module is not really designed to give you that much control over the output; indentation is mostly meant to aid readability while debugging.Instead of making  produce the output, you could transform the output using the standard library  module:This reformats your sample successfully:
I found the following regex-based solution to be simplest, albeit â€¦ regex-based.The output follows.
You can do it, but you'd basically have to copy/modify a lot of the code out of  because the encoding functions aren't really designed to be partially overridden.Basically, copy the entirety of  from  and make the changes so that your special dictionary gets printed without newline indents.  Then monkeypatch the json package to use your modified version, run the json dump, then undo the monkeypatch (if you want).The  function is pretty long, so I've only posted the portions that need to be changed.
