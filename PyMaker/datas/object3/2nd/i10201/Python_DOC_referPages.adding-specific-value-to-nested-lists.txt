Therefore, what you need is only one for-loop:Here's are some simpler ways to do it:Or
You can use  to match elements of the same index from different lists. From there on, you're a simple list concatenation away:
It seems like you want to go through both lists with a single iteration. You could achieve that using zip:
If you want to use for loop you can try  output:
Built-in function zip will match first item in first list with first item in second list etc.
One of the alternative to achieve it using  as:
