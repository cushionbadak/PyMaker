I'm trying to find all combinations of A,B repeated 3 times.Once I've done this I would like to count how many A's there are in a row, by splitting the string and returning the len.max value. However this is going crazy on me. I must have misunderstood the len(max(tmp.split="A")Can anyone explain what this really does (len returns the length of the string, and max returns the highest integer of that string, based on my split?) I expect it to return the number of A's in a row. "A,B,A" should return 1 even though there are two A's. Suggestions and clarifications would be sincerely welcome
You can use  to find groups of identical elements in an iterable.  generates a sequence of (key, group) tuples, where  is the value of the elements in the group, and  is an iterator of that group (which shares the underlying iterable with . To get the length of the group we need to convert it to a list. outputWe need to append  to the list comprehension to cover the situation where no "A"s are found, otherwise  complains that we're trying to find the maximum of an empty sequence. UpdatePadraic Cunningham reminded me that the Python 3 version of  accepts a default arg to handle the situation when you pass it an empty iterable. He also shows another way to calculate the length of an iterable that is a bit nicer since it avoids capturing the iterable into a list, so it's a bit faster and consumes less RAM, which can be handy when working with large iterables. So we can rewrite the above code as
