Hi the print statement above is in a loop so the output ends up being I need to get rid of the last plus in the statement but have no idea how to go about doing so.
If you separate the exponents, as you have probably done, you can use :That will work in both Python 2 & 3. You can also use the  function with the  argument:
It is pretty 'common' 'problem', and it is often solved by using ''.join method. I assume that you've a list of integers, so all you need to do is:
You can store the string to be printed in a variable in the loop and then after the loop ends, remove the extra plus by slicing using And then print to_print.Here to_print is the text you need to store in the loop Instead of printing it and then print it at the end after slicing it as I showed above.
Either check if you're at the last element and use a different print statement (without the final ), or construct your output in a list first and join the list before printing.
You could do the following, and adapting it to your loop length
join() helps a lot in this case:
