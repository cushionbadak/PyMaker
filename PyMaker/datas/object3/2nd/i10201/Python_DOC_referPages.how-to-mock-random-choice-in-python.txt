I want  to return the same value  every time in my unittest. The following code doesn't work.The error message is as follows:How should I modify it to make it work? I'm using python2.7
The problem here is that  is using an unpatched version of .Compare functions  and :It prints e.g.:Why?This line is the problem:It imported  and than stored  into a new variable named .Later,  patched the original , but not the local .Can I patch the local one? Yes:Now it prints e.g.(I used  because I put this code into the top-level file - it may be something else in your case)So what to do?Either patch everything, or take a different approach. For example, patch  instead of .Alternative SolutionIn this case, where you want to test behaviour of  functions, it may be better to use a seedYou can't know beforehand what random values will be generated for a certain seed, but you can be sure that they will always be the same. Which is exactly what you need in tests.In the last example above, I tested  after  once and it returned 1000, so I can be sure it will do so every time:
I don't know what is mockobj from tests but what you can do is.
