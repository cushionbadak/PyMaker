I have such a code:Basically I am trying to create a dictionary of dictionary of float. But I get the following error:UTF-8 string as key in dictionary causes KeyErrorI checked the case above, but it doesn't help.Basically I don't understand why unicoded string 'A' is not allowed in python to be a key value? Is there any way to fix it?  
Your  dict is empty.You can use tree for that:Or a simpler  case without :If you don't want to add anything like that, then just try to add dict to  on every iteration:Please note, that I've changed the order of  loops, because you need to know  first.Otherwise you need to check key existence too often:
You can just use :Replacewith
