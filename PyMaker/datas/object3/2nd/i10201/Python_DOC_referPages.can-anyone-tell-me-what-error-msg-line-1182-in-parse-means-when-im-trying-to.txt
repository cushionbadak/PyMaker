This is the code that results in an error message:The error:I'm new to python. I did read documentation and a couple of tutorials, but clearly I still have done something wrong.  I don't believe it is the xml file itself because it does this to two different xml files.  
Consider using ElementTree's :
 is a reference to the XML content as a string, but the  function expects a filename or file object as argument. That's why there is an an error. is a file object, so  should work for you. 
The error message indicates that your code is trying to open a file, who's name is stored in the variable source. It's failing to open that file (IOError) because the variable source contains a bunch of XML, not a file name.
