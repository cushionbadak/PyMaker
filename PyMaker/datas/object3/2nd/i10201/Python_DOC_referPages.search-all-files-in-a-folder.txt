I want to search "word" in many files in a folder. I have already : This does not work : I tried this :but I have an error :When I delete file.txt, next file , I receive the same error.
Something like this, although your question is not at all specific about whether you want to count, return where word was found, change word to something, etc. so feel free to edit it as you see fit(This code works for .csv as you can probably tell)
 only returns the file names, not the qualified paths. So to make this work, your  needs to be opening the qualified path (constructed with ), not just .
How about something along these lines?
You already have it down mostly:
