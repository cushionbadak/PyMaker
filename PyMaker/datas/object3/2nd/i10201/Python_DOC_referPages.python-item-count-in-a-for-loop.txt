This question already has an answer here:Loop through list with both content and index [duplicate]                    6 answers                I was experimenting with for loops and lists in Python earlier today, and I'm a bit stuck on this one thing that's probably very simple... Here's my code:The count variable doesn't work for whatever reason, I've tried to search for this problem but can't find anything. It says it's not defined, but if I put a normal number or a string it works perfectly fine. (I am also sick at the moment so I can't think properly, so this might be really simple and I just didn't catch it) Would I have to make a new for loop? Because when I did this:It just spits out each item in the list with the numbers 1-7, which is... better, but not what I want.
You need to define count first like:Another better way to achieve what you want is just:
You are trying to increment a value you never set:Python complains about  because the first time you use it in ,  has never been set!Set it to  before the loop:Now the first time the  expression is executed,  exists and  can be updated with the  result.As a more Pythonic alternative, you can use the  function to include a counter in the loop itself:See What does enumerate mean?
You need to initialize  before the loop.Otherwise Python does not know what  is, so it cannot evaluate .You should do something like
