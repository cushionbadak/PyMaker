Is it possible to append a  generator or, combine two s?With this attempt you'll get:
That's because  returns a , i.e an object that returns values when  is called which has absolutely no idea what ing is.You have two options here, if you require a list wrap the paths in a  call:(Even though  is probably what you're after here.)this of course defeats the purpose of the generator. So, I'd suggest using something like  and creating a generator that will combine them and yield from them one at a time:Then iterating over  as required while keeping the memory footprint down.
