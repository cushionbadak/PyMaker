I am trying to create a function, which will replace a list element with the value that occurs maximum number of times adjacent to it within a given frame of say x elements.Eg- A=[2,2,2,3,2,1,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,6,7,7,7,8,8,8,8]If x=5, the modified list should be- A=[2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,7,7,7,8,8,8,8]I have done the naive sliding window implementation. Is there any built in function or pythonic way to do this?
Here are three implementation of a naive sliding window 1D majority filter.The first one uses a "traditional"  loop, the second is virtually the same algorithm, but using a generator expression in a list comprehension. These both determine the majority element in a given window usingwhere  is the window. We first create a set to get the unique elements in  and then find which of those elements has the highest count in .The third version uses the , which is enhanced dictionary, to find the majority element.outputThe above code will also work on Python 2. The Counter class is not in the standard library on versions earlier than Python 2.7, however there is code available for Counter which will work on Python 2.5.
