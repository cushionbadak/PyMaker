I am trying to figure out how to calculate the score of two merged lists of names. I need to give one point for each character (including spaces between first and last name) plus one point for each vowel in the name. I am struggling to figure out what to do. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
So you first  first and last names, then make then  with  as separator. And then with  count how many times so called vowel characters occur,  them up, and add  of whole name. And that would be  object, then you can do whatever you like with it.Output:UPDATEIf you need all possible variations of first name and last name you can do that with Output:
It's easier to have them as a string, you can then loop over that string. One point per character is easy, that's just length of the string. If vowel is one extra letter, just loop over letters and if vowel add a point. Voila!
