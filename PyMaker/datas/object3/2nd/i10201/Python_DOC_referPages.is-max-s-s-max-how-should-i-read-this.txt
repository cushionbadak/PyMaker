While studying Pandas Style, I got to the following:How should I read ?
 will evaluate to a boolean (due to the  in between the variables). The next step is storing that value in .
In pandas  is very often  (column in ).So you compare all values in  with  value of  and get boolean mask. Output is in . And then set style  only to cell of table where is  value - where is max value.Sample:
The codeis evaluated asThe bit in parentheses is evaluated first, and that is either  or . The result is assigned to .
is_max is EQUAL TO comparison of s and s_max
According to the document, Evaluation order:Notice that while evaluating an assignment, the right-hand side is  evaluated before the left-hand side.This is quite reasonable, for you have to know the value of an expression before assigning it to a variable.So Python first evaluates , followed by checking if the calculated value is equal to , resulting in a boolean result, and then assign this boolean to a variable called .See also: Assignment statements
