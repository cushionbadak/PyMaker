I wrote some code that uses enumerate to loop through a list.the item in the list are just strings. Sometimes I do not want to enumerate for the whole list, sometimes I'll slice up the list do do different things.The part that I am having trouble with is python's enumerate function.The docs say you can do:the above code doesn't do what I expected. I though enumerate would start at the start position and stop at the end, but it doesn't.I wrote a small program and it does indeed act wonky.I would expect enumerate to start at index 4 and loop to the end. So it would get the range of 4-19 but it seems to just start the index but still iterates from 0-19..Question, is there a way to do a iteration loop starting at a specific index in python?My expected outcome would beinstead of starting the index at the start position provide.
Actually if you got  object it's not a big deal to make a slice from it, because  is still  object(as @MosesKoledoye mentioned it's Python 3 feature). But if you got a list, for the sake of not creating new list you can choose , it will return iterator.Output
The  parameter of  doesn't have anything to do with what elements of the iterable get selected. It just tells enumerate what number to start with.If you want to start at a specific index, you need to provide the start argument and a slice:
You can do:
