How to use begin() tag in python 3.5? I mean I'm trying to make a text-based RPG, but I don't know to use the begin()  tag because if you run it, it will spam the Py Shell. It'll keep on spewing "You ran into a Zombie! The Zombie has 100 HP, Do you attack?" and those things.
It will be hard to help you without writing the whole program for you, which users on this site are unlikely to do.However, I will offer you some advice that will hopefully get you in the right direction:Make sure that you define  (which we refer to as a function, not a tag) before you actually call it. This means before you do:you need to do:so that your program knows what  means.You assign  only once, to  or , but you do the follwoing check inside of :So choice will never be , since if the game actually runs, we know that  and will until the script is run again. When checking whether the player wants to attack, you are going to need to get the player's  again:or better yet:This way the player's response does not have to be the very specific string , and also, the test is case-insensitive, so if the player's response is  or , the test will pass. You correctly get new input from the user at the end of the  function with , but then you check the value of  not the value of .As for the program "spewing" out text, this will happen every time  runs.
