I would like to install both python 2.7 and python 3.5 on my Windows 10 PC. Both python executables use the same name .Is it a good idea to change  to  as a quick fix for co-existence? Are there any side-effects or other things that I need to be aware?
You don't need to rename anything for co-existence of different versions of Python.The different versions of python are installed on different folders automatically.When use the command prompt you can use the commands  or  to refer to the different versions of python. The next works too:andThis also works with  and  for install new packages.For more details, you can read this article: Python Launcher for Windows.
You'll need to run  instead of  if that's not obvious. This is definitely, as you described, a "quick fix" My suggested fix is to use virtualenv and pass in the Python executable you would like to use as so:
