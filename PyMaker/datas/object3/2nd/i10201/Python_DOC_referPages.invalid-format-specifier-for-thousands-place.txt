Natural Text
I am trying to make a simple chart like output. Here are strings that I want to display:a = "name", b = "10000.00", c = "code", d = "45.60", e = "30.00"I put "," to indicate thousands place in each format specifier in which I want them to be output as currency. It reports the error:What did I do wrong?
As per the docs, width has to go after comma. Moreover, your  variable has to be a number (and not a string, as in your MWE):
