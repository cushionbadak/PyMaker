When writing to my CSV my list item gets broken up into individual strings even though I am using the append function. I think the problem is in how I am using writerow, but I'm not quite sure.This is my code.An example of what is in the list before it's iterated for writerow is, '@etritabaugh gorgeous',After being passed through writer.writerow(li) it becomes@,e,t,r,i,t,a,b,a,u,g,h, ,g,o,r,g,e,o,u,s
 expects an iterable, and once it gets a string, each character in the string gets splitted as separate columns.To write the entire list as a single row in to the csv, you won't need the second for loop:If instead, you want to write each item in the list as a separate row, then use a list literal which will prevent the string from being used as the row:
