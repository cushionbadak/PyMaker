I'm trying to write multiple rows in to a CSV file using python and I've been working on this code for a while to piece together how to do this. My goal here is simply to use the oxford dictionary website, and web-scrape the year and words created for each year into a csv file. I want each row to start with the year I'm searching for and then list all the words across horizontally. Then, I want to be able to repeat this for multiple years.Here's my code so far:This outputs my string of words that were identified for the year 1550. Then I tried to make code write to a csv file on my computer, which it does, but I want to do two things that I'm messing up here:I want to be able to insert multiple rows into thisand I want to have the year show up in the first spotNext part of my code:I was using the  module's online documentation as a reference for the second part of the code. And just to clarify, I included the first part of the code in order to give perspective.
