Can I use  to read named command line arguments that do not need to be in a specific order? I browsed through the documentation but most of it focused on displaying content based on the arguments provided (such as ).Right now, my script reads ordered, unnamed arguments:myscript.py foo-val bar-valusing :But I would like to change the input so that it is order agnostic by naming arguments:myscript.py --bar=bar-val --foo=foo-val 
You can use the Optional Arguments like so:Then if you call it with  it prints:Or, if the user wants help argparse builds that too:
The answer is yes. A quick look at the argparse documentation would have answered as well.Here is a very simple example, argparse is able to handle far more specific needs.Off course, in a real script, you won't hard-code the command-line options and will call  (without argument) instead. It will make argparse take the  list as command-line arguments.You will be able to call this script this way:You will discover a lot of other features by reading the doc ;)
