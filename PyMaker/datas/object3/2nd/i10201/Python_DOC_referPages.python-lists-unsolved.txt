This question already has an answer here:Add SUM of values of two LISTS into new LIST                    17 answers                I'm pretty new to Python although I have learned most the basic's although I need to be able to read from a csv file (which so far works), then append the data from this csv into lists which is working, and the part I am unsure about is using two of these lists and / 120 and * 100for example the list1 first score is 55 and list2 is 51, I want to merge these together into a list to equal 106 and then add something which can divide then times each one as there is 7 different numbers in each list.OUTPUTEXPECTED OUTPUT (WANTED OUTPUT)which then needs to be divided by 120 and * 100 for each one.
