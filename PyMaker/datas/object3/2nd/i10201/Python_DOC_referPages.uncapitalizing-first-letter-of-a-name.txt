To code a name like DeAnna you type:and In this code  capitalizes a normally uncapitalized letter. What do you code to produce a name like  where I want to uncapitalize a normally capitalized letter?
The  does not capitalize a letter - it is the bell escape sequence.The  simply capitalizes the first letter of any group of letters. Since the bell is not a letter, it has the same meaning as a space. The following produces equivalent capitalization:Anyways, there are no capitalize/uncapitalize magic characters in python. Simply write the name properly. If you want both a proper and a lower-case version, create the later via :If you really want to go from  (I'm just pretending the discussion about  is over) to  - welcome to having-to-decide-about-the-semantics-of-the-language-you-are-emulating.A simple approach is to upper-case every word, but fix some known ones.You can do that with a -and-loop approach for less headache as well:If names are of the form , you can capitalize everything but the second-to-last word:Any words that are shorter than four letters (warning, not feasible for some names!!!)
Why not just roll your own function for it?The point to the  list is that allows you to further define parts you may not want to capitalize very easily.  For example, some names may have a "de" in it you may not want capitalized.This is what it looks like with an example:
What do you code to produce a name like  where I  want to uncapitalize a normally capitalized letter?Letters are not auto-capitalized in Python. In your case, (I think you should use  instead) is capitalised because you called  on it. If I didn't misunderstand your question, what you want is simply to disable such "auto-capitalizing".Just don't call :
