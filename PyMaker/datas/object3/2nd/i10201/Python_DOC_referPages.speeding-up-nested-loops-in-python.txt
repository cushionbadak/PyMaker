How can I speed up this code in python?Here, TT is a fixed 6x6 matrix, p is a fixed 1x6 matrix, and F is fixed 1x6 matrix. T_n is the nth power of TT. This while loop might be repeated for 10^4 times.
The way to do these things quickly is to use Numpy's built-in functions and operators to perform the operations. Numpy is implemented internally with optimized C code and if you set up your computation properly, it will run much faster.But leveraging Numpy effectively can sometimes be tricky. It's called "vectorizing" your code - you have to figure out how to express it in a way that acts on whole arrays, rather than with explicit loops.For example in your loop you have , which IMHO can be done with a vector-by-matrix multiplication: if v is 1x6 and m is 6x6 then  is 1x6 that computes dot products of  with the columns of . You can use transposes and reshapes to work in different dimensions, if necessary.
