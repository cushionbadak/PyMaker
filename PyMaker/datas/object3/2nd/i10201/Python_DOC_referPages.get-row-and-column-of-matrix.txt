I wonder where how to get row and column of this matrix. I want to loop through each element[row][column], but I have no idea how to get these.This throws an error. How can I get this to work?I know why I get this error, but I do not know how I can get the column right.
I think, that you can use smth like enumerate()Cause in your example your  is a list, but as i can see - you want the number of element in this list.I edit my answer:What do you want? Magic? There is no magic. You have matrix, like this:[[1, 2, 3]]There is a list inside list. You want to iterate by elements?Or you can zip your lists in ONE list and iterate by element in that list.If you want access by index - you should use it.You should have two loops, the number of your lists is the number of rows, the number of your elements in list - is number of columns.And you need smth lile:
