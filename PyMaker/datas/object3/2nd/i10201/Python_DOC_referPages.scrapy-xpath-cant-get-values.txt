You forgot  in your xpath . Furthermore the span you are looking for is not a 1st level child so you need to use  instead of . See:Source: http://www.w3schools.com/xsl/xpath_syntax.aspComplete and correct xpath would be:  + '/text()' if you want to select only the text, but the nodes in your example have no text so it wouldn't work here.
This will work for you    EDIT:
