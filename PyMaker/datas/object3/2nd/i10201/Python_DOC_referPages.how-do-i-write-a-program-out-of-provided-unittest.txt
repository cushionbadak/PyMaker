I have a unittests for a program. Being new to test driven development, how can I generate a program from the given testsFor example I have this test:Thanks in advance. Please also share resources for learning test driven development for a beginner like me.
Without giving you the answer to the code that would make these tests pass, your approach can be something like this:What are you testing? What does this function take, and what does it return?How do I make one test pass? Once I make one test pass, how do I make the other test pass, while ensuring the previous test still passes. And so on, until all tests pass with the code you have written in your function. So, to answer your questions at a high level. You are testing something that is called , which hints out at finding the minimum and maximum of something. This something is a function called  takes as input a , and returns a list with two values. These two values are in order, the  and the  of the  you are passing to your function.
