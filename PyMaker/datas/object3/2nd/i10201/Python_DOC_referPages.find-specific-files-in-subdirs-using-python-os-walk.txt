In Windows, if I ran:dir NP_???.LASI get 2 files:NP_123.LASNP_1234.LASUsing fmatch with NP_????.LAS mask I get only NP_1234.LAS, not NP_123.LAS.Below, the code I´m running:It´s possible to change this to get the same file list as dir command, using only one pattern?
You could use re to give you more flexibility by allowing actual regular expressions. The regular expression "[0-9]{3,4}" matches either 3 or 4 digit numbers.
