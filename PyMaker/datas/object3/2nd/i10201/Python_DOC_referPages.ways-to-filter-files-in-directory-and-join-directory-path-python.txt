Given a suffix and a directory path, I need to extract the full path of the files in the directory that ends with a given suffix.Currently, I'm doing it as such:I could also do it with :I understand that there's also  that can check for suffixes using  but I'm not sure what is the syntax for that.Are there other ways of achieving the same filtered list of full paths to the files?
You can use a  to build the result in one go:If  is always an absolute path, you can use  in place of the .For a large directory, it may be wise to use  which returns an iterator. This will be way faster.
