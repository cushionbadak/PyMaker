I have generated a very large dictionary after processing an XML file, and I am looking extract from this dictionary and to insert columns and values into my mySQL database table.I am using Python 3.The dictionary is nested; here's a simplistic example of what I have:Essentially I want to iterate over each primary Key in this dictionary (e.g. Test1,Test2,Test3) and extract the secondary keys as a column name tuple and the associated seconday key values as a values tuple, a bit like this:On iterating over each primary key I will add the two tuples to my mySQL table using this command:Then repeat the process on the next primary key ('Test2').I have made an initial attempt, but have hard coded the Primary key in this instance:
You can iterate over  and use the  and  methods on the nested dictionaries to get the columns and values:Note that in Python 3  and  return views of the dictionaryâ€™s keys and values (unlike lists in Python 2).
Iterating over a dictionary actually iterates over the keys.  is equivalent to . You are looking for the  or  methods, which will actually return the key and the value as a tuple:orI would recommend using  over  since that way you will have a reference to which primary key (test) you are processing. I am going to go out on a limb here and guess that you will need this for the non-trivial version of your program.From there, you use  as you are trying to use , since that is exactly what it is:Since  is a nested dictionary, you can get the number of elements in both  and  as just .
