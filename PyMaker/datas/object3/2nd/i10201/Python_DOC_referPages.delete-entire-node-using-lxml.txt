I have a an xml document like the following:how can I delete the entire node "dependencies"?I have looked at other questions and answers on stackoverflow and what is different about is the namespace aspect of this xml, and the other questions ask to delete a subelement like "dependency" while I want to delete the whole node "dependencies."  Is there an easy way using lxml to delete the entire node?The following gives a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'remove' error:
You can create a dict mapping for your namespace(s), find the node then call root.remove  passing the node, you don't call .remove on the node:Which would give you:
First, grab the root node. Since it is  (vs ) the "parent" element of  is . Example from the documentation:Once you have the root, check , it should be "project".Then do , where  is the  node.If it were  then it would be invalid XML since there must be a root element. I can see exactly where you are coming from, though.
