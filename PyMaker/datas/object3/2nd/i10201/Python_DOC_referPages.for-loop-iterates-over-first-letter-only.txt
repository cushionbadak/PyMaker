My loop seems to iterate over the first letter and then breaks though it's supposed to iterate through each letter in the secretWord, for example, the code bellow is supposed to print out "_pp_e" but instead it only prints "_". I don't understand, what's the problem with that code??
You  from the function in the first iteration.  ends a function, there and then, so the  loop won't continue either.You need to build up your return value in the function itself. Build up the resulting string one character at a time, by using a list to hold all the characters first then joining those together into one string at the end:If you are feeling adventurous, you could even make that a list comprehension and do all the work in one line:Either version produces the expected output:
The return keyword exits the calling function. This should do the trick: Here, you start with an empty string as the result and either append a letter (if it was included in the list) or an underscore (if it was not), then return the result string.
