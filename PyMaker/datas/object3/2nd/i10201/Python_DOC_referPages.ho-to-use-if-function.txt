Natural Text
I have been making a text-based RPG in python 3.5. I had it fine (or so i thought...) until i tried to say that no I did not want to play. And also when I wanted to make the option to run from Mobs, but instead it combines both if functions, and says the amount of damage AND that you 'Ran away.' I tried to switch around some code but that made it even worse! I need help.
This is a very poor question, but is a result of you not understanding boolean logic rather than if statements.is always true. That expands to you either need to do a case insensitive comparison (if choice.lower() = "y"), a list comparison (if choice in "Yy") or explicitly state both conditions on eiterh side of your or (if choice == "y" or choice == "Y"
You need to add choice_attack_3 == on the other side of your  statement.  by itself is technically true so it is entering both if statements. Edit: same with
