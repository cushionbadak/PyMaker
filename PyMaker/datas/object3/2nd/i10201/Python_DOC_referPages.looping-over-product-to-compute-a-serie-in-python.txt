I'm just gonna compute the result of below serie in python:The formulaSo, here is my function to compute:I know it is a silly question. But could you address the problem with this snippet?
As others have already mentioned,  is integer division. No matter whether you're dividing floats or integers, the result will always be an integer. Pi is not an integer, so you should use float division:  and tell Python explicitly that you really want a float by converting one of the numbers to float*. For example, you could do  ->  (notice the dot).You could do the same thing in a more clear way using  and  modules and a generator expression. * Python 3 does float division with  even without this, but Python 2.7 will need  to divide as freely as Python 3, otherwise the division will result in an integer in any way.
You have  and not , you wanted division, but made floor divisionOutput:
Change one of the 4s into a float by putting a . after it and change the // into /. It makes python interpret everything as floats:
