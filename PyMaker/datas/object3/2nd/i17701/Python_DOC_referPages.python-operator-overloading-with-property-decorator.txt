I am looking at this Python Doc page:http://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#propertyRight below it says:To me, c.x = value looks like assignment of a value to a function, since c.x is a function, unless the "=" operator is overloaded. Is it what is happening here?Same thing with del c.xThanks.
 is a descriptor, which changes the way Python handles attribute access. The Python docs have an article introducing descriptors.When Python accesses an attribute that points to an object with a  method, it will return what that method returns instead of the object itself. Similarly,  will delegate to  and  to . The special methods are described in the docs.
