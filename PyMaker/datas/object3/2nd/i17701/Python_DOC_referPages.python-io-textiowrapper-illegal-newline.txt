I'm trying to set the newline character for SiRF binary messages, but the IO wrapper doesn't seem to accept the newline chars.Code:Output:Note: It does accept '\x0d'
You can not just use any character as the newline. From the  documentation:newline controls how line endings are handled. It can be , , , , and .You'll have to handle those bytes manually instead of a newline, directly.
