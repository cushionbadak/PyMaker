I have a string in python. I want to split it with  on separator which is pretty close to end of the string.For e.g.Will  be better in terms of performance than ?
Below is a time test using  to compare the speeds of the two methods:As you can see, they are about equivalent.   is a few fractions of a second faster, but that is really unimportant.  So, you can pick whichever method you want.P.S.  Although, the  method is one less character to type. :)
Adding to the previous answers, using split vs rsplit should depend on where you want to search. Example:Here you are searching for 1, in which case using rsplit is faster than split, whereas for the examples in the previous answers, split is faster.
I'm super late to this party, but for anyone else stumbling across this,  is faster than :And you can ditch the  easily if you want by  or such.
I think there is a slight difference between  and :for example:You see,  is used if you want to split strings on first occurrences and  is used if you want to split strings on last occurrences.
Just to complement @iCodez answer, you can run a timing test from the command-line:So, indeed, it's an irrelevant difference.
