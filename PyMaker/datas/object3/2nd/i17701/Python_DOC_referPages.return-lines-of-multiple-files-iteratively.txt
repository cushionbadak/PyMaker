Natural Text
Let us say I have a dictionary containing the file names and fullnames of 3 text files, all of the same number of lines, N.What'd be the most efficient/pythonic way to iterate over all files, each line as follows: A general solution for any number of files in the dictionary and any number of total lines would be preferable.
Use  to iterate over the lines in triples:You could produce the open file handles with:where  is a tuple of strings, the next line of each of the input files.If the input files do not have the same number of lines, you can use  instead to provide a replacement value for those lines missing (use  in Python 3).
