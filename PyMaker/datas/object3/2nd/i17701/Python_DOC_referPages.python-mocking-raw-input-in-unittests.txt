Suppose I have this python code:How do I write a unittest for this ? I know i have to use 'Mock' but I don't understand how. Can anyone make some simple example ?
You can't patch input but you can wrap it to use mock.patch(). Here is a solution:Keep in mind that this snippet will only work in Python versions 3.3+
Okay, first off, I feel it's necessary to point out that in the original code in question, there are actually two things that need to be tackled: (an input side effect) needs to be mocked. (an output side effect) needs to be checked.In an ideal function for unit testing, there would be no side effects. A function would simply be tested by handing in arguments and its output would be checked. But often we want to test functions which aren't ideal, IE, in functions like yours.So what are we to do? Well, in Python 3.3, both of the issues I listed above became trivial because the  module gained the ability to mock and check for side effects. But, as of the start of 2014, only 30% of Python programmers had moved on to 3.x, so for the sake of the other 70% of Python programmers still using 2.x, I'll outline an answer. At the current rate, 3.x won't overtake 2.x until ~2019, and 2.x won't vanish until ~2027. So I figure this answer will be useful for several years to come. I want to address the issues listed above one at a time, so I'm going to initially change your function from using  as its output to using . No surprises, here's that code:So all we need to do is mock . Easy enough - Omid Raha's answer to this very question shows us how to do that by swizzling out the  implementation with our mock implementation. Except his answer wasn't properly organized into a  and functions, so I'll demonstrate that.Small note just on Python naming conventions - variables which are required by the parser  but not used are typically named , as in the case of the lambda's unused variable (which is normally the prompt shown to the user in the case of the , incase you're wondering why it's required at all in this case).Anyways, this is messy and redundant. So I'm going to do away with the repetition by adding in a , which will allow for simple  statements.I think that nicely answers the first part of this. On to the second part - checking . I found this much trickier - I'd love to hear if anyone has a better answer.Anyways, the  statement can't be overridden, but if you use  functions instead (as you should) and  you can use the following:The tricky bit here is that you need to  a response before the  block is entered. But you can't know what that response will be until the  inside the  block is called. This would be fine if strings were mutable, but they aren't. So instead a small promise or proxy class was made - . It only does two things - allow a string (or anything, really) to be set and let us know if it's equal to a different string. A  is ed and then set to the value that would normally be  within the  block.Hopefully you appreciate all this trickery I've written up since it took me around 90 minutes to put together this evening. I tested all of this code and verified it all worked with Python 2.7.
Just ran across the same problem, but I just mocked out .Only tested on Python 2.  if you don't already have the package installed.Alternatively, using the library genty, you can simplify the two tests:
I am using Python 3.4 and had to adapt answers above. My solution factors out common code into the custom  method and shows you how to patch both  and . Here's code that runs:    import unittest    from io import StringIO    from unittest.mock import patch
