I am trying to iterate over every possible combination of 0's and 1's in a list. For example, if I was working with 3 parameters, I would get:I thought the solution on Array combinations of 0s and 1s was inadequate due to the problems with storing binary numbers of the length I need. I would like to be able to iterate over lists like this for lengths of 20 or more, where the sheer size becomes hard to deal with in integers. I have been using code like this:Is there something more Pythonic or quick? A 20-deep nested loop, even a simple one like this, is still a monster. 
Use :output:
Another option, you can just count up in binary:And if you truly needed them to be lists: 
You are looking for the cartesian product.For the cartesian product of a few, you can use this type of list comprehension:For more than a few (say more than 4) you should use falsetru's method.
