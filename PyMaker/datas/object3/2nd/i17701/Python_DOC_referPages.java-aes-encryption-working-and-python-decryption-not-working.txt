I'm trying to encrypt a message in Java and decrypt it in Python. Unfortunately i'm just starting with python and am not able to get the decryption working. That's my Java Code:I was able to decrypt the message with java, but not with python. I hope someone can show me how to do this.i copied the part with padding from another answer and assume that's the problem.I get the message: ord() expected string of length 1, but int found.Python:Thanks for any hint.
You're calling  on an integer. Which is obviously illegal. The whole point of  is that you give it a Unicode character, as a string, and it gives you back the numerical value of the code point.So, why do you have a number? Well, I'm not sure what you expected to have, but let's look at what you actually have. If  is an integer, then  is some kind of sequence of integers. And  is the result of calling . As the documentation for that function says, it returns a byte string. This isn't a specific type, just a description of a type—you can find out what the actual return value is with some basic debugging, maybe like this:But I'm going to guess that it's a  object, which (quoting from http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bytes) …is an immutable sequence of integers in the range 0 <= x < 256. So,  is an integer in the range . Hence the error.So, what should you be doing instead? Well, why are you trying to call ? You have a byte. Presumably what you want is a byte. So… just don't call anything there.Meanwhile, there's at least one other serious error in your code:As pasted, this will raise an . And if you indent both the second and third lines, you'll get an error for reading from a closed file. So presumably you want to indent just the second one. In which case, what you're doing is going through all of the lines, stripping the trailing whitespace off each, and then doing nothing with them. At the end of the loop,  holds the last line of encoded text, and all of the other lines are long forgotten and unrecoverable.If you want to read all of the text into a list of lines, you will want something like this:Or, if you want to read it into one big string, with the newlines removed, you could do the above and then , or just do skip the whole loop and do .
