is it possible to zip a folder into multiple files at Python? I just found some examples how to zip a folder/file to a single zip container.Short: How can I zip one folder to multiple zip parts in Python?

For what it's worth, the standard  for both Python 2.7 and Python 3.3 explicitly says that it doesn't support multi-disk archives:This module does not currently handle multi-disk ZIP files.You may be forced to shell out to an operating system command if you wish to create a single logical multi-file archive.
You can zip files into a giant file first, then split it into pieces. tested, it works.
