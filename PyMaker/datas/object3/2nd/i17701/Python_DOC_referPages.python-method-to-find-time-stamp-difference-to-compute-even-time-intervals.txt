What would be a good way to determine the time stamp for a rounded time frame?  For example I pull a timestamp from a database of 1388898695 which translates to "2014-01-04 19:11:35".Now lets say I want to find an earlier record that is even minutes in the past. So start with 2014-01-04 19:10:00.  How would I find out the number of seconds from the timestamp (in this case 95) and subtract it from 13388898695 so that I can search the database for the 19:10:00 timestamp?I'm looking for a general method because I'll want to compute different time frames, like minutes by 5's or 15's.Ok this isn't very pretty, but let's ignore year/month/day roll overs and just try to find the past even interval of 2 minutes.  So 19:53:12 would trigger a search for 19:52:00 (to 19:50:00).Produces the search time of1388901120.0 or 2014-01-04 19:52:00It seems like this is not a very clean way to do this.Here's my generic solution using the method from Burhan Khalid:
Here is an example to get even minutes, it should get you started with your other cases:
