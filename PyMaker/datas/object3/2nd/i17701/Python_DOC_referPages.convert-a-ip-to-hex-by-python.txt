Since hex don't have leading leading zeros you can use We are taking the hex number only with  (remove '0x') and then we are adding 2 leading zeros only if needed.Example output:Example output:Edit1:by @volcano request you can replace with list comprehensions:

Since python v3.5 you can just do:https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typebytes
In above IP to hex conversion output, if the output start with '0' ex. 0aff0861 then I want to  delete the 0 and output should looks like as aff0861. Is there any direct method available in conversion.
