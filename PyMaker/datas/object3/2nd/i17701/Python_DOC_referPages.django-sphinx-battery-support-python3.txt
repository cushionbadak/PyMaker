One of the reasons you get syntax errors is that  /  syntax changed from Python 2 to Python 3.In Python 3 you should useinstead ofIt's not about import syntax only, reading the error messages we see there are other problems due to incompatibilities between the two versions. I guess django-sphinx has not been updated to work with Python 3.References: http://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html
