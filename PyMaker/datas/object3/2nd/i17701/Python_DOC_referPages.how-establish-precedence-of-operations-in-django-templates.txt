In my Django I have a model as such:In my views.py file, I have this:I have created the following template tag:In my Template, I loop through the keys with myKey. I have the following. It works:I can tell it works because it prints myDict[myKeys] on the webpage.However, when I want to access the attribute a of myDict["myKey"], it fails:It gives me the following error: The problem is that when I say myDict|get_item:myKey.a, I mean (myDict|get_item:myKey).a but it thinks I mean myDict|get_item:(myKey.a)How do I tell it that the the precedence of the : operator is higher . without using parenthesis (which Django templates don't allow)?
