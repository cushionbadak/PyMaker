I mainly want to know if this is possible, not if it is reasonable.I thought perhaps one of these would work (having previously imported ):But they just result in .I know I could replace all 's with 's, then replace all 's with 's, then replace all 's with 's, but this seems so long.gnibbler suggests this:But I doesn't seem to work in python 3.
Say I have something like s='abaabbab'. Is it possible to change this to s='babbaaba' using regex? I mainly want to know if this is possible, not if it is reasonable.Yes - but you should use the correct form of  as pointed out by falsetru for this task...How this is works is by looking for characters (those defined between the ) and upon a match, calls the replacement function (here defined by a lambda) which looks for the suitable replacement character using a dictionary.
In Python 3.x, you should pass a dictionary that map unicode ordinals to unicode characters. (  documentation)Why the re.sub code does not work?Because a argument passed to substitution function is not a string, but a match object; Comparing a match object with a string produce  (); the substitution returns the first item .Use  method to get a matched string.
