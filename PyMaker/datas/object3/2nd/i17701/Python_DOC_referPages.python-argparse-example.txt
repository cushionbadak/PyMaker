I'm trying to learn argparse in order to use it in my program, the syntax should be like this:I have this code:The question is, I read in the official doc, saw YouTube videos, etc, but I couldn't understand how can I determine the number of "sub-arguments" of the "main-argument"?Example: , how can I set that  must have two "sub-arguments", and how can I get the values,  and ?And another doubt, I know I can set an argument to be  or not, but I wanted to make my program only executes when at least one argument is passed, any of the four mentioned.Maybe it's a stupid question, but sorry, I can't understand it, and hopefully there is someone here with "teacher powers" to explain it.

The key to this is to define a required, mutually exclusive group.
