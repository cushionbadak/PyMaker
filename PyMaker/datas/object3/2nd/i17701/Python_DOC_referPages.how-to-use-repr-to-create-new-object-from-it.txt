This is something I don't really get. I am trying to use  to create a new object from its output.I have a class, OrderedSet, which contains a list and methods to organize it.The str method of this class is Now I am supposed to use  in a way to instanciate a new object from it.Like Can I just do it like this?
The idea behind "using  to create new objects" is that the output of  can be valid python code, which, when interpreted with , creates (a copy of) the original object. For example,  return  (including the ), or  returns . In your example you probably need something like this:as well as a corresponding constructor:This way,  returns the string , which, when uated, will invoke the contructor and create a new instance of the class.
No.  has to return a string or a lot of code would break.Try this approach:  should return valid Python code. That would allow you toThat said, the whole idea looks dubious. It feels like you try to come up with a clever way to serialize or clone objects.Use pickling for serialization or maybe the  module. To clone, use a copy constructor.
