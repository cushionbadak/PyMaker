p.s:- I am a beginner in python and unable to find out whats wrong. My assertion fails when I run the code.
 is not interpreted as but,becaue of comparison chaining.To get what you want, put parentheses explicitly.or more preferably use  / :
You have a problem with comparison chaining, the Python syntax that treats:as:In your case, that means the expression  is being treated as:both of which are false, hence causing the assertion. Details on comparison chaining for Python 3 can be found here.So the way to avoid this chianing is to make the expression explicit, with something like:or, even better, since comparing with  is rarely a good idea:
Contrary to the other answers, what is happening here is not operator precedence but comparison chaining.   means , just like  means .  However, in either case, the upshot is the same, which is that it's not what you meant to do.  As noted in the other answers and comments, it can be fixed by using parentheses, or, better, by not using an equality comparison at all and just doing .You can see that this is comparison chaining by a slightly different example:This would obviously be false no matter which way the precedence went, but it is true because  and  are both true.
Using parenthesis should solve this as in
You may use  in this case. There are better ways to do what you are trying.This is because of precedence. Read more about this on Python docs. are in the same precedence level. So Python will evaluatefrom left to right.
