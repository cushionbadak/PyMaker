I thought  returns a list of numbers . why does the  function return a false for this 
Your  contains 0, and the boolean value of 0 is :while for any other number it evaluates to . The function  only returns  when all of the elements of its argument evaluate to , see its manual (the  statement in the given example implicitly takes the boolean value of every item). See here the difference of including 0 or not:
Because the first number generated by  is 0.
