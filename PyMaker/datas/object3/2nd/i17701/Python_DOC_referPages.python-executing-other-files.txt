I am new to python, and I have these two python files. One of them is a terminal program, the other a hangman program. If I were to go on the terminal program and type "gm hangman.py" (I set up that command already) I want to switch to that python file. When the user is done with hangman (I programmed that too) I want it to go back to the terminal. I don't want to add the hangman file to the terminal because I want other people to be able to add their own games easily.How would I do this?Thanks!
Your question isn't entirely clear, but I think you're looking for the  module. In particular, something like this:As the docs explain,  will "Run command with arguments. Wait for command to complete." That's exactly what you want, right?But what's the command? That's where  comes in: the command is the same Python interpreter that's running your "terminal program", and its argument is the Hangman program.
