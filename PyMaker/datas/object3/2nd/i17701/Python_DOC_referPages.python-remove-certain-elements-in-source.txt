I have some source where I am trying to remove some tags, I do know that using regular expression for removing tags and such is not advised but figured this would be the easiest route to take.What I need to do is remove all  and  tags along with the contents of the  tags that are only inside a  tag but I am unsure how to do this using regular expression.For example when it comes across:The output should be the following where all  tags and content and  tags are removed.The problem is like I stated i'm not sure how to do this, and my regular expression removes all of the  and  tags in the source, not just the ones inside of a  tag.

If you have BS4, use  and
