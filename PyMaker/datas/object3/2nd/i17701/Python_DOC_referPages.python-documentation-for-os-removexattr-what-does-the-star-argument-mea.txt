My first question, please be gentle. I searched but could not find an answer here or elsewhere.Note that this question does not apply to unpacking of arguments like *args.In the python 3.3 documentation for os.removexattr the following is stated:Note that the third argument is a star: *I assumed that this means "specify one attribute or several attributes separated by comma",but when trying to do that, I get an exception:I also tried to supply a list of arguments, but that did not work either.What exactly does the star argument mean in this case?Thank you.
The single asterisk  just means that it is forcing you to use named arguments. In this case if you want to pass a value for , you have to pass the argument name. The idea is you don't having to read function calls like  and not know what those values are doing.
