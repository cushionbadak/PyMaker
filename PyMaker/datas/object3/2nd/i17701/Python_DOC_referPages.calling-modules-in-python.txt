So Im a beginner to python/programming and came upon this code in a tutorial, which Im having trouble understanding.What I did was , I went to the site-packages folder in my python directory (which holds all modules). There I could find the directory structure to be : -The file stack.py has a "class Stack" inside it.So am I correct in interpreting/relating the import command to this directory structure ? Also , whenever such a long chaining of modules happen in python, can it always be understood in such a manner.
Not all the time.It's probably better to not try and compare the directory structure with the module path, unless you have to debug modules or install them manually.Sometimes, your PYTHONPATH will be extended to include subdirectories in , and then there'll be an extra subdirectory.Other times, there can be an  file in the  directory (there likely is), that can containin which case the import path could be
Your understanding is right. This will make all the classes in the module accessible by your script. Whereas,will make only the Stack class accessible by your script.
In command line, you can do like this:Then this module can work.
