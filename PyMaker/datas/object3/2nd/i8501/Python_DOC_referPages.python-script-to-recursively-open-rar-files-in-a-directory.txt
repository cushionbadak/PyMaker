I'm writing this python script to recursively go through a directory and use the unrar utility on ubuntu to open all .rar files. For some reason it will enter the directory, list some contents, enter the first sub-directory, open one .rar file, then print all the other contents of the parent directory without going into them. Any ideas on why it would be doing this? I'm pretty new to python, so go easy.
There are a lot of problems and clumsy uses of python in your code, I may not be able to list them. Examples:using using output of  to read a directory (very wrong and not portable on windows!)recursivity can be avoided with computing extension of a file is easierchecking twice if it's a directory...my proposal:that loops through the files (and dirs, but we ignore them and we materialize it by putting the dir list into the  variable, just a convention, but an effective one), and calls the command using  which changes directory locally so  extracts the files in the directory where the archive is.(In that typical  loop,  is the directory and  is the filename (without path), just what we need to run a subprocess in the proper current dir, so no need for  to compute the full path)
