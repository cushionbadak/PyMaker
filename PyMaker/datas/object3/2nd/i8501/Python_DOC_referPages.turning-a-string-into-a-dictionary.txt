Having had a python class behind me, I was presented with this question in the next class and I seem to be having a mental block on how to even get started."Write a python program that asks the user for a string,  then create the following dictionary: The values are the letters in the string, with the corresponding key being the place in the string. For example if the user entered the string “ABC123” then the dictionary would be: D = {‘A’:0, ‘B’:1, ‘C’:2, ‘1’:3, ‘2’:4, ‘3’:5}I started with asking for the user input with something simple likehowever, I do not know how to proceed to the next step. Any help would be much appreciated.
Note however, that if there are repeated characters in the user's input,  will have the index of the last occurrence of each character:
this?
Are you sure you need this output: D = {‘A’:0, ‘B’:1, ‘C’:2, ‘1’:3, ‘2’:4, ‘3’:5} and not D = {0:'A', 1:'B', 2:'C'...}? You can flip the key:values, but they will be unordered then (e.g. you would get something like: D = {‘B’:1, ‘3’:5, ‘A’:0, ‘C’:2, ‘1’:3, ‘2’:4 } or any other random combination).It sounds like you are getting started with learning python. Welcome to a beautiful programming language. People are very helpful here, but you need to show some effort and initiative. This is not a place to get quick fix solutions. People may provide them to you, but you'll never learn. I assume this was a HW related question? Unless I'm mistaken (someone please feel free to correct me), the output you are seeking is difficult, if not impossible to create (e.g in that specific order you want). I encourage you to read about python dictionaries. Try and run this: Unless Im wrong, and someone more experienced can chime in, you cant get the "ordered" output in the format you want for your dictionary. I'm on a mobile device, so anyone please feel free to correct things.
