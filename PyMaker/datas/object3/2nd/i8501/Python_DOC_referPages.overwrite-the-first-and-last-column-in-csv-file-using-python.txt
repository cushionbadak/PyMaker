If you just want to eliminate the ':' at the first and last column, this should work. Keep in mind that your dataset should be  (or something other than comma) separated before you read it, because as I commented in your question, there are commas ',' in your dataset.UpdateSo after giving your code, I added a small change to do the whole process starting from the initial file. The idea is the same. You should just exclude the first and the last char of each line. So instead of  you should have .
