Natural Text
My code below has two for loops. First one will loop thru the directory pannam where there are some wav files. will produce these results:The code will print all the wav file namesThen there is another loop. That will read the lines of my text file corpus_textwill give these resultI am trying to combine these two results something like thisThis is my code, it runs an infinite loop. I guess its about embedded loop which I fail to understand.  
Now I understand what you want, but I'm not sure I understand why you want it.Regardless, based on your desired output, you don't need any embedded loops at all.You should be using either,or maybe.Below, I'm assuming you've already got functions or generators that provide the input strings --- filenames and lines of text.I've hard-coded them below, so I can focus on the interesting part.Output:The distinction between  and  should hint at why I can't figure out your goal...You're combining a list of filenames with the lines of a text file, either of which could outnumber the other. will stop as soon as any of its inputs runs out; will continue until all of them run out.To ensure sensible output, you must either ensure the two input lists are the same length, or decide what to do if they aren't.Worse,lists files by callingor,neither of which guarantees any particular order, meaning you can't predict which one will get paired with which line from your corpus file.Solving this problem requires either sorting the filenames into some predictable order(which must match the lines in your corpus file),or somehow working out which file goes with which line.
