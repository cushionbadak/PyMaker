This question already has an answer here:What is the best way to generate all possible three letter strings?                    7 answers                I am learning ethical hacking. I have the hash key of a password and the crypt algorithm (sha256/sha512). I want to parse all the strings from a file and to check if the hash of the password matches the hash of each of the string from the file.The generated String may contain small letters, big letters and numbers.Any ideas how to generate all the possible Strings of length n which may contain letters and numbers?
Here's a piece of code that uses [Python 3]: itertools.product(*iterables, repeat=1). Note that the number of generated strings is , so for testing purposes use small values for length:
You could use :Just add the remaining characters you need to the input string. You can use the constants from the  module for this.Be aware that this quickly grows. ;)
