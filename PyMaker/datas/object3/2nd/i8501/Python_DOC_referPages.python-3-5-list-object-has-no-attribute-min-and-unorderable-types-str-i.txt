I'm trying to follow this tutorial here using python 3.5, however I'm getting errors instead of the expected results. Also, I would appreciate if you explain what the indicated line below does. 
In python 3, comparison operations are stricter for the built in data types.  tries to compare  which was possible in python 2, but not in python 3.If you want to get the smallest member of a list, use , not .This should work, for instance:
The issue is probably that you need to pass the lists into min and max like this:Right now this will just plot a line between [1,1] and [5,5].If you want to plot x and y against each other you could do this:In the case of list1 you have a list with ints and strings so the strings will just be ignored by min and max.
Numpy arrays have min and max methods, Python lists don't. Python does have min and max functions, which are slower on numpy arrays in particular since they would iterate over all entries as Python objects. That tutorial erroneously refers to the functions as methods, and they operate on iterables, not necessarily lists.
