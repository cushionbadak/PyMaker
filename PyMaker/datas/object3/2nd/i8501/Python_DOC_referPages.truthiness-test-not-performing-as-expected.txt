I have a simple function that tests an item in a tuple to see if it is truthy or not. For some reason all tests come back True (), even though the value being tested is either a 1 (assumed True) or 0 (assumed false). I tested to see if 1 == True (output: True), 1 == False (False), connection is True (False) just to try to understand what is going on. User input: Function:Output:The  var is passing a 1 or 0 which  defines as an int. 
Your error is looking at . This is always going to be .  tests for identity, two expressions resulting in a reference to the same object in memory.If you want to print the truth value of an object, use the  function:That  works at all is because in Python, the  type is a subclass of :The integer value of  is 1, and  has an integer value of . Testing for equality won't work for other integer values:Note that your  test is otherwise meaningless; the only thing that is executed or not is the line , which is a no-op expression that just returns the reference to , but since there is nothing else there the reference is unused.If you wanted the  statement to be executed only when  is true, you need to indent it to be further to the right from  and make it part of the nested block:This then only prints something for player :
