Is there a nice simple method for extending a list n times, and doing so incrementally based on the existing values?Basically I'm extrapolating a gradient, but don't want to invoke numpy/scipy if I can really avoid it.I have some lists, lets say:Where I have already got a value for the average of the pairwise differences (the 'average gradient' of the list). I would now like to extend each list (let's say 20 times, to a total length of 25 each), where each subsequent value added is the previous value plus the computed average difference (if this was negative, obviously it would decrease).So,  would evaluate to .Thus, the  list would ultimately end up:Because the average difference in the original  = 1 (obviously this is just test data, in actuality I want to do this with more complicated floats in the  list.
Yes you can.
You could use  and a list comprehension:For integer values you can also pass a  directly to :
