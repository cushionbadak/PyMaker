It seems to be legal Python code to have a file consisting only of a single quote-enclosed string. The Python interpreter will not complain about the following:If I wanted to keep some one-off value (say an API key) isolated from other configuration settings, is it possible to import a file like this into another script as a module and use the string?The default string representation of the imported module will be something like . Can the string value contained within that module be somehow accessed?(To preemptively cut off tangents, I understand I could just read the file as text or assign the value to  and  in another script. There are more conventional ways to accomplish related goals. I am asking out of a desire to better understand the language's design and capabilities.)
That string actually ends up being the docstring for the module.So it is accessed by the  attribute of the module.Python picks up the first loose string it finds in a module, class, or function to determine its docstring.https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/#what-is-a-docstring
You can also retrieve your string by using . Which is almost the same as  except that it also got "cleaned up" by
