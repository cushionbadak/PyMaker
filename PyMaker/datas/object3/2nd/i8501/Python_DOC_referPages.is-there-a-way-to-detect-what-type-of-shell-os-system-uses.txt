How do you detect what shell  will call?I am not sure if  or  will work, since the system might be configured to use a non-standard shell, like cygwin's shell on windows.If my script is to run on windows and linux, I need to know the shell the system is using to know what syntax build commands with
The os.system(command) docs state (summarized & accentuated by me):Execute the command (a string) in a subshell. This is implemented by  calling the Standard C function system(), and has the same  limitations.WINDOWS:For windows, we can read this from the mentioned os.system() docs:On Windows, the return value is that returned by the system shell  after running command. The shell is given by the Windows environment  variable COMSPEC: it is usually cmd.exe, which returns the exit status  of the command run; on systems using a non-native shell, consult your  shell documentation.UNIX:For Unix, the mentioned os.system() docs read:On Unix, the return value is the exit status of the process encoded in  the format specified for wait(). Note that POSIX does not specify the  meaning of the return value of the C system() function.And the Linux docs appear to state that regarding the mentioned C function:system() executes a command specified in command by calling /bin/sh -c command, and returns after the command has been  completed.So, I guess it save to say that on most (though not necessarily all) Unix system a os.system() call from python will be executed via a Bourne shell command, c.q. .
