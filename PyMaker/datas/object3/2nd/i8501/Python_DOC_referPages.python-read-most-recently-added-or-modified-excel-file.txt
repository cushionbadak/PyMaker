When we deal with repetitive tasks, e.g. you have a weekly process that get an excel file in the same format, but different numbers. How do we ask Python to only read the most recently added or modified file in the folder (assuming the folder is used to keep all the historical files)? Of course we can assign a excel file name and use pandas or other libraries to read it. But since I do NOT need to import the previous file, and I do NOT want to open the .py file to update the excel file name, I hope to find a way to automate the process.
Read the modification time of a file using os.path.getmtime.A good response to a similar question here.
