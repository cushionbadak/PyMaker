I am using Python 3.6 and Pillow 4.0.0I am trying to make a PIL Image from an array of values, see the simplified code below and I am getting the following error:  when calling the  function.Why does this happen?When PIL documentation says:Creates an image memory from an object exporting the array interface (using the buffer protocol).and array.array documentations says:Array objects also implement the buffer interface, and may be used wherever bytes-like objects are supported...
The array interface is a NumPy concept: ref. Said differently,  can only operate on numpy arrays and not on Standard Python Library .
You must use   (using the buffer protocol), try this:You can read An Introduction to the Python Buffer Protocol
