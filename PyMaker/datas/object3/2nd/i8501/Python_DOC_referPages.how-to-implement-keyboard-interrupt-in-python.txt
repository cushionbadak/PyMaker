This question already has an answer here:python: how to terminate a thread when main program ends                    5 answers                I'm writing a port scanning program in python everything works fine but I wanted to implement crtl+c interrupt function to terminate the program it stops the main program but there are threads still running. How to terminate the program completely using the ctrl+c keys?
Threads share the same memory space as the main process. So technically doing ctrl-c on the main process should deallocate the thread memory. If the threads are in the middle of writing then it could be unsafe, but otherwise it should be ok. Otherwise you can use python's signal library and create a signal handler to trap a SIGINT.
