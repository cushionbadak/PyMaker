Natural Text
I am writing python code that handles a text file and, for each line of input, calculates the time involved with the action described in that line, then reports a "running time". Required output likeI came to some possible approaches but all looked awkward. Most of all I am confused about using either "time" or "strftime" or "datetime" or perhaps even something else. I am sure a simple elegant solution must exist. NB timezones and DST are of no concern, if I can get to show UTC that is sufficient, at least for a beginning. In a later stage the last column (UTC) might be augmented by a column "local time" but that is secondary.Edited, for apparent lack of clarity, to add example pseudo-code:My question is how to make the "TIME='12:00" into something that python can easily handle, and increment with a calculated integer number of seconds or minutes or whatever.
Use .Set the start time.The initial time is 12 hours.Let's say that  is 0.23 hours (pieces divided by pieces per hour yields hours).Now you can format the times like you want. The standard representation is hours, minutes and seconds:
