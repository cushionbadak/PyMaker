I need to produce, given an order and a max, a list of all 'order' length lists with each element in range(max). itertools.combinations_with_replacement() doesn't work because while it does give most, in an example where I wantthe following code shorts me a few elementsspecifically I need to know if there is an itertools, or other package that will give me the first list above. i.e. I need both (0,1) and (1,0). or in an order=3 case, (0, 0, 1) (0, 1, 0) and (1, 0, 0) will all need to be included
