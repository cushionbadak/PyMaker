Natural Text
I am actively learning Python(3.5) and really enjoying it.I want to get comfortable with string manipulation and thus decided to make a basic crypter/decrypter which shifts a string one forward in the alphabet.Here's the code: I know this is NOT how you should do it but I don't know how else.The problem I am experiencing is that if I try encrypt 'zaaz' it gives me 'bbbb' instead of 'abba'. I know where my fault is ('z' gets replaced with 'a' and 'a' with 'b') and what it is but not how to fix it. Can someone maybe suggest a better way to do this.P.S. I saw someone use the modulo operator to make the text wrap or string indexing with the alphabet as a string, but I don't know how to implement it here.Any suggestions?

As a suggestion,take a look at the chr / ord function of python (https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#chr, https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#ord), which basically takes a single char and converts it to a number, where you can add a constant and convert that back to a string using ord.Then you could loop through yourt code, using a for loop or a list comprehension.I show no code, since you want to learn, but I could easily provide some help :)
a simple and easy to understand way of doing this is by using dictionaries to map the old character to the new one, and them transform each character individually before joining them together, like this for example: with that the cipher function are as simple as show above, using the get method of dictionaries to transform the character or leave it unchanged if is not the the transformation tablenow you get the right result
