I am get an "ImportError: No module named netsnmp" message when I try to run a python script.  Can some please help me?  I do not have any python scripting experience.  This is a plugin script for Icinga that I would like to use.  I am unable to get it to run on my Icinga server though.  The Icinga server is Red Hat Linux and was configured before my time.  Any help would be much appreciated.  Below is a screen shot of the error.  Thanks in advance for your helpThanks for your help.
