Natural Text
I'm trying to record how many times the letter Y appears in the 6th column of a .txt file and assign that to a variable. How would I go about doing that? Thx in advance!.txt file:I've set the whole file to a variable and have created variables for each column in the file.
You should try using the  module:
Use  and :Your data is comma separated, and Python has the  module for working with delimited values (could be semicolon separated, etc, as well).The reader is iterable and yields a row at a time.I've used the  function which takes an iterable but I've used a generator expression to yield  or  for each  in the file.The expression  evaluates either  or . When you give a boolean value to  it converts to an integer and  becomes ,  becomes . We could have written it as:This however is slightly different. It filters out only the rows which have  in the 6th column and yields the value  for each of those rows. It's subtly different.
THIS should work as expected: This gives for the text provided above: and works even in case of malformed lines in the input text file.
