I have a form with a submit button that uploads 2 files, one python file(info.py) and a image file(eg "img1").In views.py, I used to import the files in info.py to use the methods etc. When I refresh the upload form page, I getIt seems that the server realizes that I do not have the info.py file yet, and hence the error found in views.py. is there any way to solve this? any help will be greatly appreciated. 
is media.info installed in the settings.py in Django?like:Without add the app in the settings.py Django is not able to import the app desired
Points to noteFirst of all you are thinking it wrong,  expecting python files or modules to import not files.  If you want a directory to act as a python module add  inside the directory  If you want to serve media files you don't need any extra view use this in your  file.    urlpatterns += patterns('', (r'^media/(?P.*)$',                        'django.views.static.serve',                        {'document_root': settings.MEDIA_ROOT}))
