I was trying thisBut it was showing an errorI used to do the same in C language but it works. So, how to this in python?
You haven't declared  yet. In Python, you don't have to perform separate declaration and initialization; nevertheless, you can't perform operations on names willy-nilly. Start off with something like this:
You can initialize matrix in nested loop like this:
You should know that  is not defined when you are trying to perform an assignment like , there are many ways to fix that.In C/C++In C/C++, I presume you would do such work like this:Before you get inputs by  in C/C++, you should allocate storage by calling  or , then you can perform your , or it will crash.How to do like that in PythonIt's very similar to what you had done in C/C++, according to your code, when you are trying to perform assignment to , Python has no idea what  it is! So you have to let it know first. A NOT-pythonic wayA NOT-Pythonic way is do something like you did in C/C++:You initialize the list by  like you did  in C/C++. For each row in the 2-d list, initialize the row by using  like you did  in C/C++. Then, get your data by using  and append it to .A pythonic wayThe way to perform such a job like above it's not very pythonic, instead, you can get it done by using a feature called List Comprehensions, then the code can be simplified into this:Note that the core  is a list comprehension that it creates a list which has  lists and for each list of these  lists it has  0s.
Actually, you don't need the column count. Just enter the number of rows and give your input space separated.
Since you haven't declared ar before, you cannot assign elements  at specific indexes. You can decalre a two dimensional list in this manner initialized to a certain .where  and  are desired number of rows and columns respectively
