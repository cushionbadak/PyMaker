How could I use data obtained(a variable) from a process in another process of the same project ? For example from the code below I want to use variable "b" in an interface for plotting and analysing that. Thanks!
To send the data from one process to another you can use multiprocessing queue, as mentioned in the docsHere is the working example as well of passing the variable for one process to another
