In this single line code, When call a method as parameter, but not release resource,  is called when method is finished ?It can be issued about 'improper resource release' ?
The  won't be called,  is triggered at the end of .In CPython  will get triggered eventually as there are no reference to this file object anymore and it will close the file.But it's recommended to use  to make sure the  call is explicit not implicit and in this way you're not relying on implementation details.
You can find a comprehensive explanations regard this in python data models documentation:Some objects contain references to “external” resources such as open files or windows. It is understood that these resources are freed when the object is garbage-collected, but since garbage collection is not guaranteed to happen, such objects also provide an explicit way to release the external resource, usually a  method. Programs are strongly recommended to explicitly close such objects. The  statement and the  statement provide convenient ways to do this.That said your opened object will not be closed since you're not calling the  attribute of the opened object. If you don't call the close explicitly you should wrap your code within a  statement:By doing the context manager will call  method automatically at the end of the block which it will call the close method of your file object consequently.
