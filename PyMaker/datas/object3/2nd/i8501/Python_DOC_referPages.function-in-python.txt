I am trying to write a Linear congruential generator in python and I find a little piece of code on Wikipedia but have some difficulty on understanding it. The code is as follows:My problem is that what is ""? I notice that the function is done, the value of  gets updated and stored. Is it declared as a member variable of function lcg() here or actually some kind of default set up for all function in python? Thanks a lot!
It is a "member variable" of the function, so that each time it is called (except when called with something for ) the sequence will pick of where it left off.
Python is recognizing the lcg.previous as a new variable declaration, and will add it as a member to lcg.
The  variable is a property on the  function. In this example it's being used as a static variable for the  function. Since Python doesn't require variables (or object members) to be declared before use you can create them at need. In this case, you've create a member  of the  function object.
