Can you give a more simplified explanation of these two methods  and  from ?I have searched the knowledge base and as well the python documentation but i got confused.I am new to python that's why I am asking a more simplified explanation regarding these.Thanks!
You can chain sequences to make a single sequence:If  and  are in another sequence, instead of having to unpack them and pass them to  you can pass the whole sequence to :It creates a sequence by iterating over the sub-sequences of your main sequence. This is sometimes called flattening a list. If you want to flatten lists of lists of lists, you'll have to code that yourself. There are plenty of questions and answers about that on Stack Overflow.
We can learn about the difference between these two tools by looking at the docs.  The key difference is in the signatures and how they handle an iterable, which is something that can be iterated or looped over. accepts iterables, such as  or . accepts one iterable, often a nested iterable, e.g.  or .  This is helpful for a flattening nested iterables.  See its direct implementation in the  tool found in the itertools recipes.
