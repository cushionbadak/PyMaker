Natural Text
In the python documentation, it seems like signal sent from python side could not kill long-running C/C++ process:A long-running calculation implemented purely in C (such as regular expression matching on a large body of text) may run uninterrupted for an arbitrary amount of time, regardless of any signals received. The Python signal handlers will be called when the calculation finishes.Is there a workaround for this? Could I implement something in C/C++ side(i.e, a callback function?) to capture keyboard interruption?Thanks a lot for help!
Found a workaround here, it seems like making the long running CPython program a daemon thread is one way to handle it.
