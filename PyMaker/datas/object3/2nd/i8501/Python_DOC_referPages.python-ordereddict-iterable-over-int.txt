This question already has an answer here:How to create a tuple with only one element                    3 answers                I'm learning about dictionaries and I wrote a small bit of code and built it.I get the following error:I don't understand why it isn't iterable? And what has  got to do with the problem?Thanks
As documented here you need to provide  pairs to .At its core,  is a  and thus needs a  to store at a .Passing it (1) is wrong because:So, (1) is not a tuple but an  object.
s (or any sub-class of  for that matter) are a set of key-value pairs.The following statement does not provide any such pairs.Also note that is an . is a .
The list elements should be a tuple of 2 items (one key and another value). becomes  an . So what python is doing is it is trying to split it into key-value pair. So you get that error.
