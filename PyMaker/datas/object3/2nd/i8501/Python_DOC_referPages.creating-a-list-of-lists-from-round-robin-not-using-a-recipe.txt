I am new to python and trying to learn how to round robin of a list into a list of lists. I saw posts with answers pointing to a standard round robin recipe, but I don't understand some of the concepts in it and would prefer a simpler solution. I want to achieve something like this using a function, but I haven't been able to come close:I'm very confused after attempting to solve this problem using a combination of for loops, while loops and if statements. Nothing I did worked.I don't have any code that works or comes close to working. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.
Solution: This behavior is implemented in  see documentation for details.  Simply  and code the following:Explanation: The latter redistributes an iterable across  containers.  Note, this is not what the  recipe does, which yields interleaved elements from  iterables, e.g. .  This creates a single stream of elements that are not divided among separate containers, as you require.
Try below code I don't know much about round robin algorithm but,
@Abhishek gurjar your code is giving a traceback with a TypeError. I think it is because of true division which outputs in float. It works if the expression len(l)/2 is inside an int() function. :) 
since  you're new to python and you said that "Nothing I did worked." I guess you might not know that you can't pass some parameters to a function and make global effects inside the function.  here's a sample of what I'm sayinghow ever working with items of a list is ok  also another solution is to return the result
