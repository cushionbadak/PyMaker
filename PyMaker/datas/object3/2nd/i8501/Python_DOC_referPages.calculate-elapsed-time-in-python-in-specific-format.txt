I am trying to write a program to determine the time and date corresponding to a elapsed number of seconds since 00: 00: 00 on 1 January 2016.But i wanted my result in specific format.i.e should be the corresponding hour (in military time), minute, second, day of the month, month name, year, and day of the week name (Sunday â€“ Saturday). for example,output should look like the followingi tried to code thisBut i could only get the hours, minutes and seconds part,Is there any way i can get the month,year,and week name too ?Also i'm trying to handle leap years too.since a leap year has 366 days with 29 days in February. Leap years are years that are evenly divisible by 4, with the exception of those evenly divisible by 100 but not 400.
To format a datetime you can use strftime().If you want to change the format use this table for reference
You want to use the Datetime Module. Handling dates and times is trickier than it appears! That's why it's good that Python has datetime handling built-in. Datetime and timedelta objects account for leap years and leap seconds, and they handle operations like addition and subtraction 'intuitively'.Getting the weekday is simply a matter of string formatting. Remember that weekdays are modulo 7!
