I wrote a code where in I have a base class for  and derived two classes :  & . Please refer the code below:Output :Now , my question is : how to get the age in output?
You want to read up on the  function documentation; you are not using it the way it was designed to; the function formats a value according to a specification (the optional second argument).In fact, you do not need to use it at all.Use  instead, a method on strings:Here the  placeholders are replaced with the values you pass to the method.Note that I didn't use  as a function; in Python 2 it is a statement; this is why you see  when you execute ; that's just , really. You could use  at the top of your modules, but I'll stick with the old statement for now; it'd be better to just switch to Python 3 entirely.Next, you want to execute the overridden  method directly from your subclasses:Because you access the method unbound on the class, you need to manually pass in .In new-style classes (inheriting from , the default base class in Python 3), you could also use the  function; if your tutorial is using  already but you could not get it to work, you are most likely following a Python 3 tutorial and you want to upgrade, rather than stick with a legacy version of the language.
