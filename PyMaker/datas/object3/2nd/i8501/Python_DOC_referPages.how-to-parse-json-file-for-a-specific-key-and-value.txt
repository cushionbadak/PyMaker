Currently, have multiple JSON files to parse. In each file, I would look for :and if it is, copy and paste the whole JSON content (which is just 1 line), and paste it onto the result file.In Python, what would be the right approach to look for a specific key/value in a JSON file to copy to a new file?
Step 1 : Load your JSON as a The  library parses your JSON string to a Python dictionary.Step 2 : Access the value using keyThe first statement will throw an exception if  is not available in the JSON string.The second statement is safer, as a fallback value can be given. Step 3 : Apply your business logicIf you must use the first line, or if dealing with unknowns that could throw errors anyway, test for the error you are getting and add exception handling around in it as in:You can add as many except statements as there are error types you are attempting to process.  A generic "Exception" can be used in place of NameOfError as a catch-all for unknown errors, but best practice is to handle the true Exceptions first by type.  A little testing as code breaks initially can reveal what should go in place of "NameOfError".
