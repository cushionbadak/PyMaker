I wrote a python module to generate a random topology using Mininet and connected OpenDayLight as the remote controller.I would like to pass a command to the mininet CLI, but from inside the python module. After generating the hosts and switches as well as connecting them to the remote controller, the module randomly chooses 2 hosts to act as Server and Client. I am having trouble doing something similar to this, but from in-line inside the python module: is another module that takes arguments  and This is the part of the main module that elects 2 random hosts and gets their IPs. I would like the  to run in the host corresponding to From the mininet API documentation (See section 'Customizing a Network'), something like that is possible but I am having so much trouble doing it. Also, I would like for this command to run in the background while the main program runs. Any feedback is appreciated.
I recommend you take a look at the documentation for the Python module , which acts as an platform-agnostic API for running other programs from your program. For example, you can call  by adding the following line to your code:The first argument of  takes an array of strings where each string is a part of the command you are executing.
