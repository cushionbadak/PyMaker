I have a  that holds some result of an operation. The data is displayed in a  (like a table). How do I parse this data so that I can form a data structure such as  with this data? An example of the  is shown below.The data displayed in the above example is not  or . It always has a  and correspondingly may/may not have values along the  appearance. I have tried using basic parsing techniques such as  and , but I need a more robust way to parse this data as the above shown example is not the only format the data gets rendered. Update 1: There are many cases apart from the shown example such as addition of more columns, single cell having more than one instance (but shown visually in next row, whereas it belongs to the previous row). Is there any  library to solve this problem?Can  techniques help in this problem without parsing? If yes, what type of problem would it be (Classification, Regression, Clustering)?Update 2: Another example of what it might look like which involves a single cell having more than one instance (but shown visually in next row, whereas it belongs to the previous row).  
Say your example is 'sample.txt'.You can change the data types of course. Please check tons of params of . Also, there are method for xlsx, csv, html, sql, json, hdf, even clipboard, etc.welcome to pandas...
Try this, it should fully handle multi-row cells:ExplanationWe use the  module in order to find the appearances og "Header" in the 4th column.The  auxiliar function returns an array of the line splitted by columns as defined by the delimiters parameter. This parameter is a list of 2-items tuples, where the first item represents the starting position and the second one the ending position.
i dont know what you want to do with the title so i will go ahead and skip all 6 lines...the space is not consistent so you need first to make the space consistent between records otherwise it will be hard to read it line by line.you can do some thing like this which will give you something like this
