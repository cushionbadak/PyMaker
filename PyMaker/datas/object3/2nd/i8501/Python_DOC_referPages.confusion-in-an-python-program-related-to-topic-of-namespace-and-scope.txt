I just stepped in python recently and now I reached to the topic of Namespace and Scope. With the intention of further understanding of this subject,  I found this which contains a program resulting in my confusion.And, here's the program:And here's the result which you must be quite sure but I am notbut the output in my mind should beEven I modified the original code to be like this in order to make it clearer:But it still like this:So, the reason why I thought that there's supposed to a double  is because I believed that  in the code was executed twice as,firstly, it runs when the  is called at  which goes from  to  and  is called with the  output secondly, the  is called which triggered the  again with the same output as above, finally the function  ends when  is done, that's when  show up.Then go back to "main thread" (I just call it as this not actually mean it, or it is?)  and print So, as what I got is not what I thought, what's wrong with my understanding of this program? Thanks for spending time on reading my problem, it will be of great help to me if you can give me a hand on this :) Thanks in advanceEdit:I just found out where my confusion was! Great appreciation to those who give me a hand. Turns out the main problem of my confusion is my unstable foundation of the programming knowledge. So, I incorrectly thought the  will run when the  was declared. Hahaha, how could this happen?? This so basic mistakes just happened -- the declaration of the function will never run until it is called in the program! That's why there's only one !Anyway, I will keep in mind that do not make the same mistakes again. I'm appreciated to those who give a hand on this minor basic syntactic mistake!Cheers!
The  was declared on line 3, but it is only ever called once, and that's on line 7. If you took out line 7,  would never print.
