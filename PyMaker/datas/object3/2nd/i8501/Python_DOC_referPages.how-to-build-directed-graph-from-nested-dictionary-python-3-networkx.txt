I am trying to build a hierarchical directed network where some nodes can branch into others, while others do not.  The values in the inner dictionary (i.e. the integers) are to keep track of leaves in the tree-like structure.  I've created a naive way to turn this particular nested dictionary  into a directed graph but it is only specific to 3 layers.  Below shows the hierarchy: How can I create a nested function that adds edges to the directed graph for any number of levels?  For example, if there was a  or a  this would not work and I would have to expand it out each time. Do I need to use a  loop? 
Use a queue to hold the details, e.g.:
