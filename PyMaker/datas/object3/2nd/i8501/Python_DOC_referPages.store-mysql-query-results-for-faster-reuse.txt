I'm doing analysis on data from a MySql database in python.  I query the database for about 200,000 rows of data, then analyze in python using Pandas.  I will often do many iterations over the same data, changing different variables, parameters, and such.  Each time I run the program, I query the remote database (about 10 second query), then discard the query results when the program finishes.  I'd like to save the results of the last query in a local file, then check each time I run the program to see if the query is the same, then just use the saved results.  I guess I could just write the Pandas dataframe to a csv, but is there a better/easier/faster way to do this?  
If for any reason MySQL Query Cache doesn't help, then I'd recommend to save the latest result set either in HDF5 format or in Feather format. Both formats are pretty fast.

Just use pickle to write the dataframe to a file, and to read it back out ("unpickle").https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.htmlThis would be the "easy way".
