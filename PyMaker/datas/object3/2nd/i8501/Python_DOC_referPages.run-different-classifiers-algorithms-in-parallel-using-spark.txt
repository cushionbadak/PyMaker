I have a dataset and I wanted to test different classifiers in parallel using Spark with Python.For example, if I want to test a Decision Tree and a Random Forest, how could I run them in parallel?I have tried a few approaches but I keep getting:I was trying to do this (which had worked well using scikit-learn's classifiers instead of Spark's:Any suggestions on how I can manage to do this?Thanks!
@larissa-leiteTo overcome this, I'm using  like explained in that thread.This is the code of the thread:Just explain why I'm using this: I trained several text classifier models (more than 200) using OneVsRestClassifier and I need to span out every model the text that I receive. The latency here it's less than 200ms to get all predictions to me (the baseline time reaction for the human being can be something between 100ms to 420ms) so this 'latency' it's not a big deal for me.
