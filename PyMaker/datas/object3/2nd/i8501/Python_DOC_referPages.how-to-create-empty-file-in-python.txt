This question already has an answer here:Create empty file using python [duplicate]                    2 answers                I would like to create an empty file in Python. But I have difficulty creating one..Below is the Python code I used to create but it gives me error:Error I got: File "/home/hha/bin/test.py", line 29    os.system(touch gdsfile)                          ^SyntaxError: invalid syntaxBut from the command line, I am able to create new file using: touch Thank you very much for your helpHoward
First you have a syntax error because  expects a string argument and you have not provided one. This will fix your code:which constructs a string and passes it to .But a better way (in Python >= 3.3) is to simply open the file using the  builtin:This specifies mode  which means exclusive creation - the operation will fail if the file already exists, but create it if it does not.This is safer than using  followed by  because it avoids the potential race condition where the file might be created by another process in between the check and the create.If you are using Python 2, or an earlier version of Python 3, you can use  to open the file with the exclusive flag.
