I know it is possible to create session object using session_transaction() method. However, is there a way to access the current session object which gets created when for example "/" route gets hit? I did  to access the session but it's empty. Let me know if it is possible. Thanks.
This is what you're looking for. As it says however, you'd have to use the instantiation you create in your  statement.Note that this won't work if you run your test within the scope of the  statement.
If you want to read the session data written in your view from the test, one way is to mock the session view as a dict and verify the session in your test. Here's an example using Python's unittest.mock:app.pytest_index.pyYou can use any mocking solution you prefer, of course.
