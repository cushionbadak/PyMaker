Natural Text
I want to store the numbers that are  or  or  or  or  only. I am trying as ;But it is validating  also. Is anything wrong here?
Try with This way you tell that the string Starts (^) and Ends ($) with a number between 1 and 5.Hope it helps
This is happening because  matches the start of the string, so as long as it starts with  it can end with any other characters (in this case just ). You'll need to add a  at the end of the regex to force it to match the end of the string:Alternatively you could use  to test whether it's digits and then use  to extract the number and test the range:
If you just want one of those numbers from a line of text try . means word boundary so 2 matches but 22 won't.
