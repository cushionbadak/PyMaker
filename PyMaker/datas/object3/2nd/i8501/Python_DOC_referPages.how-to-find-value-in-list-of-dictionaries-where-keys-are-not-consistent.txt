here, I have a list of dictionaries, I need to find the object using value.I would like to find by 'age' key where value is 30. I can do this by following wayis there any better way to do this without lots of if else?
If you want to avoid if..else you can use lambda function.or also use list comprehension to get names in a list.
You can just use  one time without , it allows you to provide a default value if the key is missing, so you can try this:dict.getReturn the value for key if key is in the dictionary, else default. If  default is not given, it defaults to None, so that this method never  raises a KeyError
