This question already has an answer here:see if two files have the same content in python [duplicate]                    2 answers                IMAP filtering and searching dictates that my script works as follows: Each night I receive an email with a relevant  file attached to it. My Python script always selects the last (most recent) email, and does certain operations on that  file.All  files sent daily are named exactly the same.Issue is: Sometimes the sender neglects to send a new file. The result is that my script does the operation on the wrong file (the one from the day before). If I can somehow check that two files are actually (copies) of the same file, then I can avoid doing the operation.How is this most easily/effectively achievable in Python?
To compare files binary-wise, the best/quickest way is to use the  module:returns  if both files share the exact file contents.  is set to  so the file contents are analysed regardless of a difference of date (which you'll have when you extract both files)
