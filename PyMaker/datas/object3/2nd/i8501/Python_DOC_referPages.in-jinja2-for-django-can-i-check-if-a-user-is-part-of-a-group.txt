I want to display certain header links to students and other header links to faculty. I could do what I want by checking user group in every single view, but I'd rather do it all at once in my header.html template in jinja2. Is this possible?
You should be able to accomplish this by doing the test in the header template, as you say, and assigning the result to a variable there; then you can read that variable in other templates. http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.9/templates/#assignmentsAs an alternative, you could use https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache or http://docs.repoze.org/lru/api.html#repoze.lru.lru_cache , which would let you avoid repeated lookups without affecting the logic flow in the rest of your code.
