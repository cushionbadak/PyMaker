Natural Text
How can I get a Python list from a text file with the following contents?For example:with the types:Means, every string which python understands as  should be from type .I tried to use  but it has difficulties with  and . The user input (list of strings to convert) is assumed to be safe.
WARNING : Using  is dangerous. Be very careful with it, or, better yet, find an alternative without.That being said, you could define a regex to check if the string looks like something you'd like to . For example, anything with only numbers, spaces and mathematical operators could be deemed safe:With Python3, you might use , which might be a little less dangerous than a plain  :Yet another alternative would be to use @poke's "expression evaluation algorithm", since  doesn't understand .Finally, even a "safe" expression like  could bring your server down.
how about:output:
Let's get serious about avoiding dangerous eval here >:)Yes, I took a couple of assumptions here, but you can modify them to suit your needs as strictly as you really need. The AST is pretty easy to understand. When you do a , you get a Module. Inside the Module is a Statement. Inside that is (most likely) discard code (that just means it isn't being used anywhere).If it isn't discard code, we assume it's a string. For one thing, this is likely to prevent any dangerous side effects from eval. (Someone prove me wrong here – wrap a dangerous expression in discard code.)Inside that is the meat of your expression – from there I assume that anything that is a plain string will appear to be a name in the AST. Anything that isn't a name is probably a number or a math operation.I think eval should be safe at this point, which is necessary if the expression is really math.
