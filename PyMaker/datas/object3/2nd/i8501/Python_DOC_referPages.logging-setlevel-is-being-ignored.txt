The below code is copied from the documentation. I am supposed to be able to see all the info logs. But I don't. I am only able to see the warn and above even though I've set setLevel to INFO.Why is this happening? :Output:Where did the info and debug messages go??
Replace the linewithand it should work as expected. If you don't configure logging with any handlers (as in your post - you only configure a level for your logger, but no handlers anywhere), you'll get an internal handler "of last resort" which is set to output just the message (with no other formatting) at the  level.
Try running  in there.  Of note, I see you mention INFO, but use DEBUG.  As written, it should show all five messages.  Swap out DEBUG with INFO, and you should see four messages.edit:  Do you have logging set up elsewhere in your code already?  Can't reproduce the exact behavior you note with the specific code provided.
