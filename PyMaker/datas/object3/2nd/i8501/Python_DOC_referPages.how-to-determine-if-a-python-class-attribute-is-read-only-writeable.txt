I'm trying to use  to list all the writeable attributes of a class. Is there a way to query if a class attribute is readonly or writeable?Edit: I'm using the first solution from https://stackoverflow.com/a/3818861/2746401 and get an error when trying to copy read-only attributes (e.g. ). I want to filter our these read-only properties and only copy the writeable ones
Most names will be settable by default. The exceptions are the data descriptor objects and classes that define the  hook.A data descriptor is any attribute of the class that has a  method and at least either a  or a  method. These methods are used when you try to set or delete the attribute on an instance of the class.Data descriptors with a  method may not be writeable, and it'll depend on the exact descriptor implementation what they'll allow. A  object is such a data descriptor; if the  has a  attribute set to  it won't be writeable. If  is not set to  but to a callable, then that callable determines if the attribute is writeable.In addition, any data descriptor with only a  method can't be written either, the lack of a  method results in a  when you try to set the attribute name on the instance.A  hook intercepts all attribute setting, and can prevent any such action to fail. There is a corresponding  hook too, which matters if you want to count deleting attributes as writing.In other words, this is really hard to determine, not in a generic way, once descriptors or a  hook are involved.
