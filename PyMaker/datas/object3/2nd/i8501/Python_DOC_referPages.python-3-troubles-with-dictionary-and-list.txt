Natural Text
I need to get index (number) of item in list, which contains a string . Then get information from this index. But I got numbers of all items in list. No errorsFor example I have 7 track titles in result of code:Track titles:But output is emptyThe  object:
 returns  when the text is found at the start:That is considered a false value in a boolean context:If the text is not there,  returns  instead. From the  documentation:Return the lowest index in the string where substring sub is found [...]. Return -1 if sub is not found.This means that only if the text is at the start will your code not print anything. In all other cases (including not finding the title), the tracks will be printed.Don't use . Use  to get  if the text is there,  if it is not:Demo using your  data:
