I've searched thoroughly for an answer before asking, but all I've been able to find was how to convert one column of my csv file into a datetime object.My problem is, my file has a separate column for year, month, day, hour, minute, and I've been struggling for a while to convert and combine them.Any help would be much appreciated.head of file content:viewed in excel

I'll write a simple way.Suppose there is a CSV file like the one below.You can parse csv and create a datetime object.The result is like this.thx:)
this might be a little manual but you could:read each line, split it into your various items (year, month etc) as string.then recompose into a datetime object with datetime.datetime.strptime (which will convert a string with a given format to a datetime).
