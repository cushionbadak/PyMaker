I would like to convert Unicode characters encoded by 'utf-8' to hex string of which character starts with '%' because the API server only recognize this form.For example, if I need to input unicode character 'â€»' to the server, I should convert this character to string '%E2%80%BB'. (It does not matter whether a character is upper or lower.)I found the way to convert unicode character to bytes and convert bytes to hex string in https://stackoverflow.com/a/35599781.But I need the form of starting with '%' like '%E2%80%BB' or %e2%80%bb'Are there any concise way to implement this? Or do I need to make the function to add '%' to each hex character?
