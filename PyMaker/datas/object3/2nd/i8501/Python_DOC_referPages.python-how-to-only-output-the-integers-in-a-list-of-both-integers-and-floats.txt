Natural Text
I have a problem. I was wondering if there was a way to only output the integers in a list of both integers and floats. this is what I have written so far: (sory about how it's formatted)Is this even possible?here is a sample output for those who were asking:I do not want it to display the long decimals, only the whole numbers
I think what you are trying to ask is, "How do I determine if one number is evenly divisible by another?"The answer to that question is the The modulo operation basically returns the integer remainder after division of two numbers. So the result of  will be 1,  will be 2, etc.You can check if  in order to determine that yes, a is divisible by b.
