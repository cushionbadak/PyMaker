I'm trying to recreate the n-queens problem and solve it with simulated annealing, although the board object from my Object class is throwing an error when I try to add the temperature using len(board)**2. Any help would be very appreciated!! I have included the source code and the output. Thanks!
You need to define a  method for your Board class, otherwise the call to  will not be defined. This and many other special double-underscore methods are mentioned in the Python 3 documentation (or, if you prefer, the Python 2 documentation). Presuming that the length of queens is the quantity you want:
