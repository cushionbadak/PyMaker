I have the following list of tuples: I would like to know if I can utilize python's  function to aggregate them and produce the following output : Or if there are other ways, I would like to know as well (loop is fine)
It seems difficult to achieve using , because if both tuples that you "reduce" don't bear the same letter, you cannot compute the result. How to reduce  and  to some viable result?Best I could do was it got me . So it kind of worked for the first element, but would need more than one pass to do the other ones (recreating tuples and make another similar , well, not very efficient to say the least!).Anyway, here are 2 working ways of doing itFirst, using  counting elements of the same kind:We cannot use listcomp because each element has a weight (even if here it is 1)Result: a dictionary: Second option: use  on the sorted list, grouping by name/letter, and performing the sum on the integers bearing the same letter:result:
The alternative approach using defaultdict subclass and sum function:The output:
