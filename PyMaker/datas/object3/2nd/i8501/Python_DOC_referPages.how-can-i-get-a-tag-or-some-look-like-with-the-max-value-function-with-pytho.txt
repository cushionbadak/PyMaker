I'm learning Python right now and I'm trying to get a diferent result from the max() function.The trouble I want to resolve it's the following:When I execute this sample of code I get the maximum value of the three included in the parameters of the max func, but instead I would want to obtain the name of the largest variable or maybe a tag associated with each var.Thanks for your help!
Use a dictionary instead.
The fastest way of doing this:This, oddly varies based on the version of Python you're using.Python 2.7Max, zip methodClocked at:20,000 Values : [Fastest] Max with tag.getClocked at:20,000 Values : Max with lambdaClocked at:20,000 Values : Python 3.6[Fastest] Max, zip methodClocked at:20,000 Values : Max with tag.getClocked at:20,000 Values : Max with lambdaClocked at:20,000 Values : 
Build a dictionary of name or tag -> variable pairs. Then  the dictionary, using the  parameter of .
