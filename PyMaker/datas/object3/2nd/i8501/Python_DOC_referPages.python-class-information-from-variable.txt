In the following code:EDIT: animal is a stringcan i retrieve "africa" from var "animal"?
Yes. Both  and  are references to the same underlying object. Very much like "Jala015" and "Jala Smith" and "mom" (or dad?) might all be references to the same person. Similarly, if you change the  of the object via one of the references, that change will be visible through the other reference, since they both point to the same place.UpdateNow you say that animal is not a reference to an object, but a string. There are a couple of ways to do that, all of them somewhat complex.First, if  is a global (as shown in your code, it is) then it will be in the  dictionary. You can do this:If giraffe is not global, but rather a local variable in a function, that won't work. You might be able to get it with  but even that is iffy. In that case, and in general, you should probably put this stuff in your own dictionary for lookups:You can make this simpler by storing the species name in the  class, thus:Then you could put your objects into a deque, dict, list, set, tuple, or whatever other thing you like, and still match them by brute force:
