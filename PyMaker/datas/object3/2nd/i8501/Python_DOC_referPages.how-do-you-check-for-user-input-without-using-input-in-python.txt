I am trying to make it so that the while loop stops when you press c without stopping it using input.The code I have at the moment is this:FYI I am on windows.Any ideas on how to do it besides the attempt I have already done?
The problem is in the line .You don't use  but  or but .Why? Because it's what  returns. It returns an integer representing the Unicode code point of the only character in the string, in this case c.By the way, Python already has  that allows using Ctrl+C for interrupting code. You can also  it.Note: You may also want to use 67 for if Caps Lock is on.
