Simple question â€“ can I print the source code of this ?Please don't ask me why I need it, nor give me advice on how to write user help. I want to know it because I'm curious.
Yeah, that's doable. Here's a quick sketch of how you could do it and what tools would be involved:Retrieve the stack frame of 's caller with .Determine the caller's source file and line number within that source file with .Open the source file.EitherUse  to parse the file, orUse  to tokenize it.Using either the abstract syntax tree or the token stream, determine where the requested source block begins and ends.Print the block.
Might want to look at the  module (https://docs.python.org/2/library/inspect.html).  Specifically, the  method.
