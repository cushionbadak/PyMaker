I am writing a program to transform a collection of XML documents into HTML. The documents require similar but not identical transformations, so I am hoping to abstract most of the details into a generic  class and then write an single subclass for each document that encapsulates the document-specific transformations. I am using the Python standard library  package for event-based parsing.I would like to be able to write code like this, where the logic of the function is bundled together with when it should be called.For this to work, the decorator needs register the  function in a class variable (or an instance variable, though it would be redundant for each instance to have its own copy), so that the control flow can be separated in the  class.My current solution, shown below, is to use a metaclass to create a  dictionary on the class.Unfortunately it doesn't look like the metaclass is inherited the way I had hoped: it seems that the metaclass is used to construct a modified  class, from which  just inherits normally.Can this construction be implemented, with or without metaclasses, in Python?
Your metaclass isn't constructing the class correctly.  As described in the docs, you actually need to call .  By just calling , you are constructing an ordinary class that is not an instance of your custom metaclass.Once you fix that, you'll have another problem, which is that you're trying to use  as a dictionary key, but  contains a dictionary, and dictionaries aren't hashable.  That's somewhat tangential to your main question, but you'll have to figure out some way to handle it (perhaps by making the user do  instead of ).
