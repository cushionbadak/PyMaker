So I installed jupyter notebook through anaconda and I am working on python 3 kernel.I am trying to do Time profiling using  magic command as show hereThe problem is that it only prints the Wall Time not the CPU Timeusing  or  does not help prints the wall time for the first line only prints the wall time for the whole cell I am not sure if there any specif config to print the CPU timeEDIT To clarify using  should print two metrics for the whole cellMetric 1: CPU TimesMetric 2: wall timemy problem is that I only get wall time not CPU time.You may check this link on what is the expected output for 
So it seems that my issue was in the environment itself. Switching from Windows to Ubuntu actually helped me print the CPU times.
