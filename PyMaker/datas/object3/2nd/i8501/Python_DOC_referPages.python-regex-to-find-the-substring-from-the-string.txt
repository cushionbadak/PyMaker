Natural Text
I have a string:I want to get the value of "generated", but with below code, it doesn't workthe value of match is none. can anyone help?
 matches only at the beginning of the string. Use  instead which matches not only at the beginning, but matches anywhere.See search() vs. match() from re module documentation
You don't necessarily need regular expressions in this case. Here is an alternative idea that uses  XML/HTML parser with  datetime parser:I find this approach beautiful, easy and straightforward.
