list1=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]list2=[6,4,5]I want to compute multiplication of ith maximum element pair from the two list, and then summation of the results, like 6*7+5*6+4*5.Is there any python trick with short coding.
orThere are no special tricks, get familiar with some common functions in python, such as , , , , or more on itertools and functools. And learn some haskell...

you may try this way...
There are already some descent answers posted, but I wanted to expand on some additional capability with functools and itertools that @delta referred to.Python 2.x solution:Note the execution of sum() using generator expression instead of list comprehension using sum([...]).There's the numpy/pandas route for more math intensive operations; it is slower for small lists, but efficient for large numpy ndarray type. Of course all of the speed/memory benefits make sense only for larger data sets otherwise any of the other solutions work just as well.
