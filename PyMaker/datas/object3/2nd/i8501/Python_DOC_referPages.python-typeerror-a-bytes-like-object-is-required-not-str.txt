I am using the below script to make request to google. However, when I execute it, I get the error stating:  client.send("GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: google.com\r\n\r\n")TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'On browsing for similar issues in stackoverflow, client.sendto has been recommended to use along with encoding the message. However, in my case there is no message that is passed. The below is the script I use:  Any pointers on correcting the issue will be appreciated. 
You need to choose an encoding, example:See also: Python Socket Send Buffer Vs. Str and TypeError: 'str' does not support the buffer interface
