I would like a way to find which element in a list is not For example, for this:It should return  because the index of  is 
The following uses  to tie each element to a numeric index, then we filter the array for non-empty strings.If you want all instances:ReturnsIf you only want the first instance:If you want a list of all instances:
A nice, fast way can use  with  and a generator expression:That is very efficient; it stops checking as soon as it finds a match. If everything in the list is , it will throw a StopIteration exception. If you want to have a default value, say -1:
You can use a simple for loop and check if the value is not '' then save the index of the value within a list comprehension to solve your problem 
All the other answers looks concise , but it will iterate over the entire list even if the first element is not . If you just need the first element which is not , I think you should use a simple for loop.
