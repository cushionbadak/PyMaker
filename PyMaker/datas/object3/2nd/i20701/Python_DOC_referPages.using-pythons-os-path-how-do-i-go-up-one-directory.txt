I recently upgrade Django from v1.3.1 to v1.4.In my old  I have This will point to , but because Django v1.4 moved the project folder to the same level as the app folders, my  file is now in  instead of .So actually my question is now twofold:How do I use  to look at a directory one level above from . In other words, I want  to find  using relative paths.Should I be keeping the  folder (which has cross-app templates, like , , etc.) at the project  level or at ?
As far as where the templates folder should go, I don't know since Django 1.4 just came out and I haven't looked at it yet. You should probably ask another question on SE to solve that issue.You can also use  to clean up the path, rather than . However, in this situation, Django expects an absolute path rather than a relative path.For cross platform compatability, use  instead of .
To get the folder of a file just use:To get a folder up just use  againYou might want to check if  is a symlink: 
You want exactly this:
Personally, I'd go for the function approach
Update:If you happen to "copy"  through symlinking, @forivall's answer is better:The method above will 'see'  while @forivall's method will see In the absense of symlinks the two answers are identical.
If you are using Python 3.4 or newer, a convenient way to move up multiple directories is :
I think the easiest thing to do is just to reuse dirname()So you can call if you file is at /Users/hobbes3/Sites/mysite/templates/method.py This will return "/Users/hobbes3/Sites/mysite"
This might be useful for other cases where you want to go x folders up. Just run  to go up 6 folders. 
For a paranoid like me, I'd prefer this one
