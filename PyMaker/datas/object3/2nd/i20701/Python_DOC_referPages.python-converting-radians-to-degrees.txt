In the python.org math library, I could only find , with cos/sin/tan/acos/asin/atan. This returns the answer in radians. How can I get the answer in degrees?Here's my code:My calculator, on deg, gives me:
Python includes two functions in the  package;  converts degrees to radians, and  converts radians to degrees.To match the output of your calculator you need:Note that all of the trig functions convert between an angle and the ratio of two sides of a triangle. cos, sin, and tan take an angle in radians as input and return the ratio; acos, asin, and atan take a ratio as input and return an angle in radians. You only convert the angles, never the ratios.
Python convert radians to degrees or degrees to radians:What are Radians and what problem does it solve?:Radians and degrees are two separate units of measure that help people express and communicate precise changes in direction.  Wikipedia has some great intuition with their infographics on how one Radian is defined relative to degrees:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RadianPython examples using libraries calculating degrees from radians:Python examples using libraries calculating radians from degrees:Source: https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#angular-conversionThe mathematical notation:You can do degree/radian conversion without libraries:If you roll your own degree/radian converter, you have to write your own code to handle edge cases.  Mistakes here are easy to make, and will hurt just like it hurt the developers of the 1999 mars orbiter who sunk $125m dollars crashing it into Mars because of non intuitive edge cases here.  Lets crash that orbiter and Roll our own Radians to Degrees:Invalid radians as input return garbage output.Degrees to radians:Expressing multiple rotations with degrees and radiansSingle rotation valid radian values are between 0 and 2*pi.  Single rotation degree values are between 0 and 360.  However if you want to express multiple rotations, valid radian and degree values are between 0 and infinity.Collapsing multiple rotations:You can collapse multiple degree/radian rotations into a single rotation by modding against the value of one rotation.  For degrees you mod by 360, for radians you modulus by 2*pi.

You can simply convert your radian result to degree by usingmath.degrees and rounding appropriately to the required decimal placesfor example
I also like to define my own functions that take and return arguments in degrees rather than radians.  I am sure there some capitalization purest who don't like my names, but I just use a capital first letter for my custom functions.  The definitions and testing code are below.Note that I have imported math (or numpy) into the namespace withAlso note, that my functions are in the namespace in which they were defined.  For instance,does not exist.
-fix-because you want to change from radians to degrees, it is actually rad=deg * math.pi /180and not deg*180/math.piin 1 line it can be like this
radian can also be converted to degree by using numpyif needed to roundoff ( I did with 6 digits after decimal below), then
