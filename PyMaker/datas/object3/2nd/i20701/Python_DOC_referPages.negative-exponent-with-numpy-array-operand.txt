standard power operation () in Python does not work for negative power! Sure I could write the formula otherwise, with divide and positive power. However, I am checking optimization routine result, and sometimes power is negative, sometimes it is positive. Here again a if statement could do, but I am wondering if there is a workarouns and a Python library where negative exposant is allowed. Thanks and Regards.
Which version of python are you using? Perfectly works for me in Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.2:and with numpy 1.6.1:
It may be a Python 3 thing as I'm using 3.5.1 and I believe this is the error you have...Just change it to a float and it'll should work.oddly enough, it works in base python 3:it seemed to work just fine for Python 2.7.12:
Perhaps use the NumPy/SciPy built-in, power
I thought I encountered the same thing, but I realized I hadn't forced the array to be a float. Once, I did, it behaved as I expected. Is it possible you did something similar?
I had the same problem with Python 2.7 and ended up with mapping exponents to float. Can't say this is the best solution though.
