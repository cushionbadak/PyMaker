I am creating a module in python, in which I am receiving the date in integer format like , which signifies the 13th of Feb, 2012. Now, I want to convert this integer formatted date into a python date object.Also, if there is any means by which I can subtract/add the number of days in such integer formatted date to receive the date value in same format? like subtracting 30 days from  and receive answer as ?
I would suggest the following simple approach for conversion:For adding/subtracting an arbitary amount of days (seconds work too btw.), you could do the following:And convert back using:To convert the integer to a string safely, use:This ensures that your string is eight charecters long and left-padded with zeroes, even if the year is smaller than 1000 (negative years could become funny though).Further reference: datetime objects, timedelta objects
This question is already answered, but for the benefit of others looking at this question I'd like to add the following suggestion: Instead of doing the slicing yourself as suggested above you might also use  which is (IMHO) easier to read and perhaps the preferred way to do this conversion.
Here is what I believe answers the question (Python 3, with type hints):The code above produces the expected .
