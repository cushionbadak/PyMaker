How do I make a:condition? (or something, because I am pretty sure that what I just wrote is completely wrong)I am sort of trying to check if a  from my list is  (blank) or contains .
You could just compare your string to the empty string:But you can abbreviate that as follows:Explanation: An  actually works by computing a value for the logical expression you give it:  or . If you simply use a variable name (or a literal string like "hello") instead of a logical test, the rule is: An empty string counts as False, all other strings count as True. Empty lists and the number zero also count as false, and most other things count as true.
The "Pythonic" way to check if a string is empty is:
Empty strings are False by default:
Just say  or . As inSo in your specific example, if I understand it correctly...

For python 3, you can use bool()
How do i make an:  condition?Perhaps the most direct way is:Note that the  solutions test the opposite condition.
Some time we have more spaces in between quotes, then use this approach
if the variable contains text then:of it does not
