BackgroundI have been debugging my python scripts for ~2 years with plain , and it has been working really fine. I just place the command on the line I want to examine, and when running the script I will have full IPython shell with capability for examining variables, defining functions, etc. On top of that, IPython shell comes with variable name tab completion.Now, instead of always defining the "line of pause" with , I would like my python scripts pause the execution while running tests, when they encounter an exception.QuestionHow do you run  in such way, that When an exception is raised, it launches python debuggerThis debugger has tab completion for variable names?SetupWindows 10Python 3.6Simple failing test(No, you do not write tests for pytest like this, but for this exemplary purpose this is just fine.)Solutions that do not work1.  (with no  installed)This opens the basic  shell when it runs to the error. But it has no tab completion.2.  (with  installed)This opens the basic  shell when it runs to the error. But no tab completion.3. This opens the basic  shell when it runs to the error. But no tab completion.4. Tried  as suggested here, no luck (with ,  and ,  and even this patched version.).5. As Sergey Voronezhskiy commented, there is  flag available for . However, the tab completion works only partially: If there are multiple options for the same starting character(s), it will print out list of possible variables. This lacks the ability of quickly selecting one of the matching variables (which is available in IPython shell, for example):Is there a way to make the variable name tab completion work? I would prefer  or  over the vanilla , but even a working solution with  is just fine. 
This is not the optimal solution, but it's better than nothing. Maybe somebody comes with a better answer. Here is what I didInstalled  ()Made  file () with following contentsMade  file () with following contents  Usage ExampleRun  (same .py file as in the question). As you can see from the figure, tab completion for the variable  works.
