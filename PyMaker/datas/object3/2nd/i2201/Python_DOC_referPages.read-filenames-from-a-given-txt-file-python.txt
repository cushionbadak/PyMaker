I am new to python.I was trying to write a program that will read files from a .txt file.(that means I have a 'filenames.txt' file and have filenames with their paths in that file)How can I read those file names from that .txt file and get the date the file was created?Heres the code I came up with:Thanks in advance.
by this you can open a file:assuming data is written one file name per line you can read from your file like this:then for knowing the time of creation you can  and use  function. this function will tell you  which is last accessed time,  as last modified time and  as creation time. take a look at here :for ommiting whitespaces at the end of the filenames you can use rstip. So, altogether it will look like this:
If they are in this format: [filename] [path] on each line i suggest the following:This will read from the file and then split it into linesIt is a shorten way of iterating over f which is a list of string and then split each string at the space so it will be [filename, path]Here things get a little bit complicated:All the modules used are builtinGood Luck
You can check file creation time by using:
