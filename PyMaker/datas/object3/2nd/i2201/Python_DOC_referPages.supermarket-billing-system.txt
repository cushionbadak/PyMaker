I'm a newbie at Python and was working on a Supermarket Billing system.So far, I got this:It works all fine. But I wanna omit the price. Like if the user types in 'Mango' it should automatically get the price from the code and multiple the amount with the price to get a total.i tried before with:So for every item i would have to give the price of the item in different block of code making the code lengthy. Is there no generic way?Say, putting the prices in a list And so automatically it'll be like Mango's price is 23.0, Flour is 43.02 and calculate accordingly?Thanks in advance!
make an array of prices.Declare the prices. So your output will be:enter the fruit name. As soon as you enter the fruit name, it will take the address of it and multiply it by the fixed price. declaration codeDeclare the prices and then call it by a function.
