Natural Text
Im trying to get this code to find say 30 words before a specific word and 30 words after. then i want it to writ'e my output to a new file. i cant seem to figure out what i'm doing wrong as im pretty new to python. any suggestions are more than welcome.
For text parsing, I would recommend using regex:From there, all 30 words before are in a group called 'before' and all 30 words after are in a group called 'after' the target word -- in this example 'target'. RegEx can be really specific or really generic, depending on the pattern used. For example, the code above only allows for one space after a word and no punctuation.
