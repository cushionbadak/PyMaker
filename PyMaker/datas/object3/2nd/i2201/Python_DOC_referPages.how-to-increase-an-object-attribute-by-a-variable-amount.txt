I have a class in python for a figure with attributes name, health, strength, stealth, agility, weapons and money. There is a shop in the game I'm making to increase the value of any of the integer properties with a specific item. Each integer property can be increased by one of two different items with a different cost and buff strength. The issue I'm having is actually incrementing the attribute by the amount and saving the object.Here's the code for the object:I might put  to increase friend's value of stealth by 10 where friend is a variable that contains one of these Figure objects but this error is thrown:And I can't work out why. 
Assignment is a statement and cannot be used inside an , which accepts only expressions. You should use  instead:But instead of , it's better to use the  function:
Don't use  and . Use  and :Alternatively it is possible to use  to modify the attribute directly (which personally I tend to like less):
Just to be clear: you know you could just typeIf yes, but you need the other method:Python already has internal functions that does exactly what you're trying to achieve.The methods are called  and . Read more about them here. For now, here's how you can use them:So you could implement a method that increments an attribute like this:Or, even more convenient:So you can type
