Got a set of tags called tags_json in the form of and would like to get only the ones that point at a version i.e. v0.2.1 . That's why I created a regex and used the regex_search filterbut while listing that I'm getting just empty strings with no match. Suppose the regex itself is fine but can't get proper result (list of tags starting with a "v" and x.y.z).
You need to remove any escaping symbol before  and useOr, to match the whole string,Note that  matches a  symbol.Basically, watch out what you escape, some literal chars when escaped form a regex escape sequence and stop matching those chars literally. See Python  docs:Most of the standard escapes supported by Python string literals are also accepted by the regular expression parser:
