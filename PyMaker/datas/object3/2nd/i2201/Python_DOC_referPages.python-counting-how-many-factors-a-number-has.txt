I have been trying to make a 'Prime Number Checker' that looks like this:Please enter a number: 7The factors are:177 is a prime numberTry again? YEnter a number: 6The factors are:12366 is not a prime numberIt has 6 factorsI am stuck on the very last portion, which counts how many factors a non-prime number has (listed as 'num_factors' in the code below). Thank you! *Edited for clarity.
I suggest you build a list of factors first, instead of iterating at each step.Now you can define your other functions in terms of the list of factors:If you want to make your implementation more efficient, I suggest you read up on prime factorization.

ChangeforYour number is called , not . Then you should create the factor list outside the for loop and append each factor to the list.As somebody recommended in the comments, you should print outside of the functions. Also you don't need to check for factors bigger than . So I would recommend something like this:
You were very close, the only adjustment would be that you would want to append those values that pass  which can also be stated  and you would want to move the empty list outside of your loop. then just return the length of that list.   Future References:Just to open you to why it would be important to explore built in functions, you could accomplish this using  in one expressionAs well as with list comprehension You can find information on both at https://docs.python.org/3/

If you would like to capture all the factors, you could use the sub below. If you give it a number like 1024, it returns a list of ten 2's (all the factors)
