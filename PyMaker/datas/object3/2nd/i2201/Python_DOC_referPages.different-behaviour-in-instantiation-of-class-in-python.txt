Recently I have been experimenting with classes and objects & got stuck in one doubt. I tried googling but I didn't understand what to search of this. Below is the code snippet.Now after completing the above program I tried the following few commands as below :My Questions in this case are :1) What is the difference between  and  while creating objects?2) Why  didn't work in the first case but  is working fine?3) In this case  will work to give output as  which doesn't work in case of . Why is it like this? NOTE :: I am using Python 3.6 for this
 doesn't create any objects, it merely assigns the  class object to the variable .You actually show this yourself:In Python, classes are also objects that have the type .Compare what happens when you use  by replacing  with .Note, classes are first class objects, you can treat them like any other object, like a  or an .  is actually just a constructor, like  and :The type constructor takes three arguments the name of the class as a string (note, you don't have to assign it to the same variable name), a tuple of bases, here's it's empty so it is implicitely , like if you did , and the namespace, so a mapping from attribute names to attributes. Methods are just function objects that belong to the namespace of the classHere's a slightly less trivial example of a class created with the  constructor that also has methods:Read more in the docs
