I'm trying to convert map to list, but it's returned .. can someone explain to me?Error:
The map function in Python accepts the first argument as a callable function and the second as an iterable. Each item in the iterable is then passed through the function into an output  object.In your example,  is defined as an  pulled from the Stdin (input) due to the line . Therefore, the code above is equivalent to the following:This code won't run because  (as an ) cannot be called as a function.If what you are trying to do is convert input like  to a list of integers, you can pass the first argument of  as , and  will be called on every element of the input provided.
