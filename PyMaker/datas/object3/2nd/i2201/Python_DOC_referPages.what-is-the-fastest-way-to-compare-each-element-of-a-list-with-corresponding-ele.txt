I want to compare each element of a list with corresponding element of another list to see if it is greater or lesser.So compare  with ,  with ,  with .Are there other fast ways to do that other than using a for loop?
You can use  library  for this. And its significantly faster The time taken  to run the function Well the fact that numpy is basically written in C,C++ makes it considerable faster, if you look into the implementation of it .
You can map the two lists to an operator such as  (the "less than" operator):With your sample input, this returns:
You can do like this,Use of lambda:With  and for loop:Execution timings for lambda and for loop:
You can use  to join the list elements and a list comprehension to create the resulting list:Output:This does the same work as a normal loop - but looks more pythonic.
Just for the sake of better comparison, if all approaches are timed in the same way:Code used for timing:
actually, I should say that there is no faster way of doing your desired action other that loop because if you look closer to the problem you can see that by use of algorithm this action takes at least  to be done. so all answers are right and will do as you want with  or  or ... but these solutions just make your implementing more beautiful and pythonic. not faster, in some cases, like blhsing answer, it is a little bit faster because of less line of code, not the time complexity.
Using enumerate eliminates the need for any  or  here
