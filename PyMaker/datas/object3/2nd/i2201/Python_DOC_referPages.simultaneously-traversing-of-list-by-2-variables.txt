I am working on a code in which I am traversing a list, for example:There are 8 elements(assuming that 'a' will always have even numbers) and I want to access 2 at a time, means the loop will execute 4 times. Every time the variable will increase by 2, like the odd and even numbersthe output will be an error because list index starts from 0 and ends on 3 and the list index will be out of range. this will not print 1 and 8 what do I have to do?
For the most recent version of your code the minimal fix (most close to the original solution)A better solution isTo handle even length use range((len(a) + 1) /2)
I think changing  to . That's a simple question.
You can iterate two-by-two without having to worry about indexing by creating a single iterator with  and then  it with itself.This is similar to the  function from itertools' recipes and has the advantage of being able to treat any iterarable, including non-indexed ones such as generators.Output
