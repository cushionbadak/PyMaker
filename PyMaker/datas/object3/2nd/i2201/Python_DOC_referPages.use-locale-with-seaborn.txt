Currently I'm trying to visualize some data I am working on with seaborn. I need to use a comma as decimal separator, so I was thinking about simply changing the locale. I found this answer to a similar question, which sets the locale and uses matplotlib to plot some data.This also works for me, but when using seaborn instead of matplotlib directly, it doesn't use the locale anymore. Unfortunately, I can't find any setting to change in seaborn or any other workaround. Is there a way?Here some exemplary data. Note that I had to use  instead of . The xlabels all use the standard point as decimal separator.
The "numbers" shown on the x axis for such boxplots are determined via a  (find out via ).This fixed formatter just puts labels on ticks one by one from a list of labels. This makes sense because your boxes are positionned at  and , yet you want them to be labeled as , . I suppose this concept becomes clearer when thinking about what should happen for a dataframe with .So the  ignores the locale, because it just takes the labels as they are. The solution I would propose here (although some of those in the comments are equally valid) would be to format the labels yourself.The  format here is just the same as the usual , but takes into account the locale. (See python format mini language). Of course using any other format of choice is equally possible. Also note that setting the labels here via  only works because of the fixed locations used by boxplot. For other types of plots with continuous axes, this would not be recommended, and instead the concepts from the linked answers should be used.Complete code:
