In an online course, part of the exercise is to create a matrix.We were given the data below:in order to create a matrix, this would be the code:I was wondering if there's a way to use a 'for' loop to emulate the output of the above code without having to manually type in KobeBryant_FT, JoeJohnson_FT, LeBronJames_FT, etc,etc. 
It depends how you would receive this data. If it's in the *.txt file, than you can read it line by line(if you want to assign at the same time name with the list) or just read everything at once, and by using regular expression look for anything inside square brackets.Output from program:You should get strings of of anything inside []. Now by using .split(",") you can convert them into lists.Hopefully it will help you out :)
Try this,
When you create the lists, you can put them in a dictionary, so that you can reference them in an easier way:If you want the array in some particular order, you could use an Ordereddict:
