I am trying to figure out how to do this in Python:Print out all subsets of any given set.For example: So the answer is by hand the following:I realized that the total number of solutions would be , where  is the number of elements in the list.So for example, if the list is , then the total number of subsets would be .I also realized that if I got the binary bit representation of the list above, the following appears:So for example: Each position of the bit that contains a , that is the position of the subset when indexing it to the original set .  eg binary 01 = get index at position 1 of the original set  which would be .Binary 11, means get index positions 0 and 1 from the original set  which gives an answer of , etc.How can I code this, the code I have is so messy, is there a easy way to map this?
You can use a loop that iterates through all the binary combinations and a nested loop that tests each bit of the counter to decide whether or not to add the list element of the corresponding index to the output list:or with list comprehension:so that:would return:and:would return:
