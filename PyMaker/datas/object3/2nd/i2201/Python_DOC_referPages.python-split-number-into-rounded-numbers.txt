Is there a library that can split a number into multiple parts, but makes sure all the parts are rounded numbers?For example, splitting 100 into 3 would be , but I would like it to be rounded and make sure the total sum stays as 100 also:
You can use the builtin function  for this. Since all this function does is simple arithmetic, I'm using single letter variable names.The return value is a list with the larger parts first.
Well I think this is what you wanted  Output
Assuming that your inputs are integers, another approach could be the following:Edit: as suggested there's no need to check if the remainder is zero or not, so my code could be simplified as:
I think you can implement it without libraries.1) If the number  is divided by 3, then the output would be 2) If the number , then the output would be 3) Otherwise, the output would be
