From my standard input I take two words and I want to process them if they occur in a dictionary. This means that I can have both, one or none of the words match (in which case I will wrap up the code with an error message). This is very similar to a boolean OR gate. I can write my script like this:However, this seems rather redundant. Is there a simple alternative to this? I have a separate function that processes one of these words at a time.
Now that it's clear that processing of both words is nothing special, i.e. just sequential processing of the individual words, you can reduce your code by moving up the error check to the top:Readable and no extra state variables needed. 
If processing word1 and word2 is independent of each other, then you can modify your code as follows:
You can leverage  to check if multiple keys are in your dictionary - this will test all things until a False one is found or all are True:Output:You could also use -intersection operation:or (cudos to @jpp) the use -issubset operation:(Output in both  cases identical to the one above)The intersection returns only things that are in both sets - if the  result afterwards is euqal to  all elements were in your dict.
