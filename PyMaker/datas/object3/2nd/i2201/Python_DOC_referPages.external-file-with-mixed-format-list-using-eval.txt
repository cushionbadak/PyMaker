I'm reading, updating and writing the following single line of data to a separate  file, in this specific structure and format:When I do this at the start of the Python file It correctly assigns the data in  to the  var. When I , it even looks like the intended nested list.However, when I come to query  var e.g. dynamically changing the 's via other functions, or when I try to sort the nested list, or do anything to alter the data, it always returns various errors. It's as though when it sets the  var to the data from the file, it doesn't recognise it as a nested list, but more a string. So therefore I can't operate on that list.If however I do:Then the  var behaves fine - values update and it writes back to the file ready for further use etc.I understand  is theoretically evil (or at least should be avoided under most circumstances) unless you trust the data source (which I do in this instance). But I'm just wondering if there's a different solution?Ideally I don't want to use any additional modules e.g. 
It may not be ideal, but here's how to do it with the  module (even though you don't want to use an additional module):Output:Note that the data read back does indeed have the proper data-types in it.
