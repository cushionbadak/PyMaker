I have the following code that I want to write as list comprehension:How do I treat the multiple lines in the body?Basically, I want to transform my  into the following:
You have a varitey options with this one, and more that arent listed
How do I treat the multiple lines in the bodyBy simplifying the expression down; you don't need multiple statements to build the nested list:gives you the same result as declaring  and appending two the results of two expressions.That would make the list comprehensionNext, you don't need to call  to get the length of a string or to address individual characters. Strings are already sequences, so  and  also work:Next, if you used the  function, you can generate both a running index to replace the  loop, and get access to the individual characters of  without having to index; you can start the running index at  with a second argument to  (the default is to start at ):If you don't have to have a list for each pair, just use  directly in loops and get tuples:Demo:
Please try this line:Or with lists: or a version from the comments (by @tobias_k): 
I would do as such;this gives;EDIT: I see @Chris_Rands beat me to the punch, put it as an answer good sir!
