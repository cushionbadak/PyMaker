Really sorry for my novice question.I am trying to install a module in python for neo4j but I got an error.here is the import : Here is the error:I have tried "pip install scripts"Thanks in advance
 simply means the Python interpreter couldn't find the module. I suggest that you read about python modules and packaging here.I have looked at the source code you pointed to and it works perfectly fine. I suspect your paths are not well set up.Make sure that in you are running importing  in , the directory structure looks like this:Here's what it looks on my system: is successfully able to make the import from  sub-module. You can use a IPython notebook, that should work fine too.
