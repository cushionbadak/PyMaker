So here's my question:I want my program to accept only one specific value, without which it wouldn't go ahead.I know the 'choices' keyword can be used as answered here: Allowing specific values for an Argparse argumentBut I wanted to ask if there is another way, because if I tell it the choice, it will give it up in help.I could give my function as if condition to process it but was hoping to use argparse.Also if someone could suggest suggestions to this: my argument is basically a path directory, is there a  specific option for that which I might use?Or do you guys think that going with 'choices' is my best option.Beginner level programmer here.
ArgeParse: You can pass argument with "-year" followed by argument value. Only in this format an argument will be accepted.
You don't need  for this.
