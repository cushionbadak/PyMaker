This question already has an answer here:Where to call join() when multiprocessing                    1 answer                I want to know which way is better performance, the code1 is as below, join them after all threads started.The code2 as below, join it after thread started.
They do different things. blocks until the  thread terminates. So your 1st version runs the threads in parallel, then waits for them all to finish. The 2nd version runs the threads one after the other, a new thread isn't created or started until the previous one terminates.
