How can I change a class object with some rules when it assigned?for example:So when I print p.x I expect 1 to be printed. but 1234 is printed. What should I do?
You have to make  a , with a setter function:This makes it so the function decorated with  is executed whenever an assignment to the  attribute is performed:
The first  you declare is a class attribute. It is the same for all objects of the class.When you write , you create an instance attribute, a value of  that belongs to that specific object. That hides the  in that particular object (that's how the python attribute lookup works). However, that value remains the default for other objects of the class, eg, if you create a new object
