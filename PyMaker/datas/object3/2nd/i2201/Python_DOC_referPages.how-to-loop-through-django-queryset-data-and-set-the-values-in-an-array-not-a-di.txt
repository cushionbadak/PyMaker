I Have to loop through data of the query set in django and put the data into an array without specifying the model name.My Django view:This is giving me error:
If I understand your question correctly, you could try this:This uses the method  to have each  instance be represented by a  instead of an actual model instance.If you leave  as an empty list, then you will get all fields for that model, but you can also add the names of the fields you want.Then, you can use  to just get the values (the column values for that row) without the keys (which would be the column names).
