Given a list of positive integers, associate the largest duplicated element with the variable . If the list contains no duplicates, associate -1 with .
There's more than one way to do it, depending on your time/space complexity requirements. Here're some ideas:Using a setUsing Using In my tests (for rather small lists) using a set appears to be the fastest method, but your mileage may vary.
You can do this without counters too:
This could be done with itertools.groupby we would first have to sort our list, and then we could take only  if its corresponding  has a  into a new list. We could then use  on that list    Expanded:
Sort the list, iterate through the list in pairs, exit on first matching pair.
