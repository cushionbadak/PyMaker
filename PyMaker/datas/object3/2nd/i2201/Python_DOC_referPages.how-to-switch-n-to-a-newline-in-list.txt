Natural Text
I have a file name data1.txt inside folder test, when my program reads from the file it reads the whole content from the file and prints only the last 10 lines from the file.['this is line number 21\n', 'this is line number 22\n', 'this is line  number 23\n', 'this is line number 24\n', 'this is line number 25\n',  'this is line number 26\n', 'this is line number 27\n', 'this is line  number 28\n', 'this is line number 29\n', 'this is line number 30\n']I want to print the last 10 lines from the file with line breaks but cant figure how I can put inside a line break inside a list data structure.for example : To print txt file (data1.txt) like that :this is line number 21this is line number 22this is line number 23this is line number 24without the \n and the list deceleration ([' '])
There are many answers already, but no one explained the problem.Problem is the newline character!ExplanationIn order to be able show the newline within a string literal, the escape sequence  is used, e.g.: function prints the string, if a string argument is passed to it, but if some other object is passed to it, it first has to be converted to a string, so  is the same as .When a  of strings is converted to string, that is done by calling  on each of its items:SolutionNow, if you want to print the last 10 lines, it means you should print each string in the list, not the list object itself, e.g.:Now, since the  already contains a newline and  adds a newline itself, you should remove one of the newlines to make the solution complete:or:or create one string by concatenating items of the list and print that:
Best is a join (works on any version):
Just  tail like this:The  argument stops the automatic space that is normally used as a separator between printed items.
Maybe this will help:this way you will get last 10 lines.Or just:
