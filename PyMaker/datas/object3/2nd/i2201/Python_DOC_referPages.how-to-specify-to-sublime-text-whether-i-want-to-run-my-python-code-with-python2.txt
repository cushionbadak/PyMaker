I am using the script package to run my python code in sublime text but it has no way to specify whether to run it with python3 or 2, and since all of my libraries are in python3 I need it to run with it too, is there a way to do this or do I just have to uninstall python2.7 all together to coerce it to run with python3. Thanks
