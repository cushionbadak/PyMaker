Disclaimer: I am a total beginner in aiohttpI was experimenting with aiohttp to handle get requests asynchronously but It turned out to be horribly slower than the pool version of gevent.GEVENT VERSIONOUTPUT - POOL TIME 6.299163818359375Following is the aiohttp versionOUTPUT - Time taken 15.399710178375244I really don't understand why aiohttp is so much slower. As for gevent version requests.get is still a blocking call , but not for aiohttp.I expected aiohttp version to be faster.
 here means that you don't start downloading next url before previous done. To make all downloadings concurrent you should use something like asyncio.gather.Modify your code like this:You'll see huge speedup.
