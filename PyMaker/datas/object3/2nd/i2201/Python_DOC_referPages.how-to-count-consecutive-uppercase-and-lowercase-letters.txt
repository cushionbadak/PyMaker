I would say the accepted answer is certainly the right way to go.  But since it was requested to do it without importing anything, I figured I'd try one.  Here is what I came up with:It's looking at the current character in the string in comparing it to the next one.  If the current and next character are the same case add to  if they are not add the  to  and reset total.  The first  is a special case for the last character in the string.
you could solve that using : emits all the elements for which the  is the same as a . in this example the  function changes from  to  (or vice versa) every time the case of the letter in question changes.you could pack this into a list-comprehension: (it is probably more efficient and more elegant to use  instead of . and  instead of the  expression i used above).
here are two ways in which you can structure the code. pay attention on how  is being incremented.1)2)  output
