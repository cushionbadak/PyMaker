I am relatively new to python and still figuring out stuff. I wanted to check if there is an equivalent of r's rep command in python to replicate entire vector and not each element. I used numpy.repeat but it only repeats each element given times, is there a way to tweak it to repeat the entire vector?example:expected output using r's rep
I'm no expert in R by any means but as far as I can tell, this is what you are looking for:
your expected output is not in python (even though that's what you want) but if i try to translate it basically you want something that transforms lets say to  with any number of repetitionsin python you can simply multiply a list with a number to get that:this will print 
Straight from the docs. np.repeat simply repeat the element present in the iterable to the number of times specified in the argument.Other than what has already been posted is use of repeat and chain of itertools
