I'm trying to write a function that multiplies two polynomials given as input, and I'm facing an issue with ordering the coefficient list.Suppose, a polynomial can be expressed with two elements: idx (exponents) and coef (coefficient). Key thing to note is that the idx list is ordered by exponential degree and the coefficients are ordered in corresponding order to the respective exponents.Take a look at the example below.idx1 = [5, 4, 0], coef1 = [1, 2, 3] would represent polynomial1 = x^5+2x^4+3x^0idx2 = [5, 3], coef2 = [1, 5] would represent polynomial2 = x^5+5x^3I want my function mult_coef(idx1, coef1, idx2, coef2) to return two lists: idx_mult and coef_mult, like this: ideal output:idx_mult = [10, 9, 8, 7, 5, 3]coef_mult = [1, 2, 5, 10, 3, 15]I wrote a function to get the idx part:Any idea how to tackle this problem? Been stuck for too long, and I don't think Scipy or Numpy's poloynomial implementations can handle this case specifically, if not please feel free to use either.
you could easily solve that with a  (a dict may be a better representation for your polynomials... )for your input this givesthen you can arrange that into the lists you are interested in:none of this is thoroughly tested!it may be a bit more elegant to reduce the indentation of the  loops:
