Let's say I have a simple library which uses setuptools for packaging and distributing. The library in this case also requires a minimum version of Python 3.6, meaning my setup.py would be something like as follows:Now, when I run , I get a file named . As evident here, wheel is ignoring the  option in  when determining the Python tag for my wheel (it should be  but is the default ). Obviously, I realize that I can just pass in  from the command line, which will do the job, but the continuous deployment service I am using for deploying my library only takes in the name of the distribution I am using (). As such, I cannot pass any command line parameters.After doing a bit of research, I found that I could inherit from the  class and override the  member variable, but according to the wheel README:It should be noted that wheel is not intended to be used as a library, and as such there is no stable, public API.Because of this, I want to avoid inheriting from the  class which might force me to rewrite my class every time some breaking change occurs.Is there any alternative way through setuptools which allows me to pass in the Python tag for a wheel?
Every command line argument for every  command can be persisted in setup config file. Create a file named  in the same directory your  resides in and store the custom  configuration in there:Now running  will be essentially the same as running .Relevant article in the  docs: Writing the Setup Configuration File.
You could hack in something likebut it's arguably just as brittle...
