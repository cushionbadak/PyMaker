My project has a subpackage nested under the root package like so:My goal is to get logging records formatted like:so that the paths become clickable in my terminal.I've tried the following formats. isn't clickable (the dots need to be slashes): doesn't work for subpackages: produces clickable paths, but they're so long that they cut off the rest of my logging :Is there a logging pattern I can pass to  that wil produce the logging records I desire?
You'd have to do additional processing to get the path that you want here.You can do such processing and add additional information to log records, including the 'local' path for your own package, by creating a custom filter.Filters don't actually have to do filtering, but they do get access to all log records, so they are a great way of updating records with missing information. Just make sure you return  when done:This finds the  entry that's the parent dir for the  on the logrecord and adds a new  entry on the log record. You can then use  to include it in your log.Add the filter to any handler that you have configured with your custom formatter:and together with  as the format your log messages will come out like:(actual output, except I altered the line numbers on that).
