What is the computational complexity of "freezing" a set in Python?For example, does the second line inrequire O(n) time? Or is it simply a "view" created in constant time?
 is not a view of . You can check this via :Hence a change in  will not be reflected in . You can, of course, test this yourself. Since  takes an iterable as an argument, it must iterate over each argument. This is an O(n) process.As an aside, there's nothing special about , even creating a  from a  has O(n) time complexity:
