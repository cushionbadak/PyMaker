Right at the beginning of 's documentation it says:Make an iterator that returns consecutive keys and groups from the  iterable. The key is a function computing a key value for each  element. If not specified or is None, key defaults to an identity  function and returns the element unchanged. Generally, the iterable  needs to already be sorted on the same key function.Your list is not sorted. So sort it before . Define a key function to be used by  and :And then:
