In Python, order of function definitions matters.  Under the hood,  is just an assignment, which assigns to the function name when executed.  This means that the function definitions must come before their use:Or more precisely, the definitions do not always have to come first in the source code, they just have to be executed first, so that the name is defined when it used.
You could use the ternary operator ():Of course, making a function is never a bad idea.
