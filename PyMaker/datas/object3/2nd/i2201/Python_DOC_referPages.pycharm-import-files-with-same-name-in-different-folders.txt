I'm doing my python assignments using PyCharm. I have created folders like "Assignment 01", "Assignment 02" and so on. In each of the assignment folders, I have 2 python files. "Helper.py" and "Demo.py". In "Demo.py", I have to import the  file. I do that using But PyCharm doesn't recognize this unless I mark the directory containing the  files as . So, I marked my directory "Assignment 01" as . All is fine. Now, I started with "Assignment 02". In "Demo.py" of "Assignment 02", I imported . This imports  from "Assignment 01" and not "Assignment 02". Even if I mark "Assignment 02" as , PyCharm still refers to "Helper.py" from "Assignment 01". How to make PyCharm refer to "Helper.py" in the same folder?Note: I don't want to open different Assignments as different projects. I would like to have everything as a single project.Any other suggestions, conventions, best practices are also welcome. Thanks!
You can set the root project folder as the . After that, to import Helper from Assignment01, simply do , and  for Assignment02.
