I want to control the input of the class . Meaning, I want to be sure that the webpage's link is appropriately provided, e.g. . However, when I try code: I do not get , as I would expect. Call of methods:result in which indicates that try/except worked partially -  did not execute , however  statement wasn't executed.An example:works fine with  and  methods of that class.Will appreciate any hint.
Raising an expection as in your case ValueError is done in the try block and handling of the expection it is done in the except blockFor more information please visit Raising Expections in python OutputHope this helps
You can use  and  and create the  in else. Demo:
If you pass link , if statement fails since it does not contain any pre mentioned prefix. Since its logically correct, it will never go down to  block. You may probably want to check if  exists inside  function
