I want to iterate through a list and sum all the elements. Except, if the number is a 5, I want to skip the number following that 5. So for example:. I'm just not sure how I can access the index of a tuple, when I use enumerate. What I want to do, is use an if statement, that if the number at the previous index == 5, continue the loop.Thanks you
Not a fan of bug-ridden one-liners that get upvoted. So here's the answer with a for-loop. 
The  documentation has a recipe for this called . You can either copy-paste the function or import it from  (which needs to be installed).Demo:edit: But what if my datastructure is iterable, but does not support indexing?In this case, the above solution needs a minor modification.
Using  with Ex:Output:
Simple, verbose way:Compact, maybe less clear way:
If you are happy to use a 3rd party library, you can use NumPy with integer indexing:See also What are the advantages of NumPy over regular Python lists?
You can pair the list with a shifted version of itself.  This should work:
The longest code so far. Anyway, it does not need enumerate, it is a simple FSM.
