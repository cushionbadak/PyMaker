This question already has an answer here:Why does the expression 0 < 0 == 0 return False in Python?                    9 answers                I recently started to learn Python.And my friend asked me which value  evaluates to.As I have prior experience to javascript and c++, I answered . (I was able to see false in both languages)Because, operators with same precedence () works left to right.So that  is evaluated first, which becomes  and  is .I believed it was right answer.But it turned out it wasn't.I ran this expression on my computer and it said it's .Am I missing something? or Python evaluates operators with same precedence in different way?
The expression  is evaluated as:Since , this equates to:Of course, both parts evaluate to  and therefore your result is .Chained comparisons are described in the docs:Comparisons can be chained arbitrarily, e.g.,  is equivalent  to , except that  is evaluated only once (but in both  cases  is not evaluated at all when  is found to be false).
