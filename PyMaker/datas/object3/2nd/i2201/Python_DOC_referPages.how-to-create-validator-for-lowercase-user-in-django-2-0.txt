my site is up and running. However, silly me I didnt put in a validator to check if users and username can only be in lower-case (I only realised that DJANGO allowed capitalized Users and usernames). Although, I have put up a warning but users usually ignore that still write upper case letters or alteast capitalized letters in their signup forms. I then encounter the problem of slugs not working, thereafter I have to manually change their usernames. I do not want to change the behavior of slugs and instead can I please ask for help from someone in changing my views? I have tried .lower() .format() as well and it didnt work. I am very weak on validators.forms.pyViews.py
You can add a validation in the :So in case the  check fails (the  contains uppercase characters), it will raise a , and thus the form is not valid.Note that  only checks case-based characters, so if the string contains digits, it will still succeed. You thus might want to finetune the check. Or as specified in the documentation of :Return  if all cased characters in the string are lowercase and  there is at least one cased character,  otherwise.An alternative might be to convert the data to lowercase, such that a user that enters  gets as username , although this can result in the fact that users get confused that the username they picked is not the username they get.
