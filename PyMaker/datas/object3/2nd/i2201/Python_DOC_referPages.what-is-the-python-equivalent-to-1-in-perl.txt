Hi I'm very new to Perl and CGI.I'm trying to convert a perl script to python.It is mentioned $|=1 in the script. What I understood is it clears the buffer.I am searching if there is any python equivalent to do the exact thing.Any suggestions??
I'd consider not worrying about porting this line for the time being, as flushing stdout after every  will likely be the least of your porting worries.But if it is, you have many options:Simply add the  keyword argument to your  function call.Run Python in "unbuffered" mode with the  switch.Re-open stdout in unbuffered mode (e.g. the final  in):Write a  wrapper function that shadows the builtin  and flushes stdoutWrite a  object that wraps  and flushesI'll try to find some links for the rest of the points and edit them in.
