I am trying to move a folder into another folder but am getting Permission Denied error when I try to perform this operation in a Python script vs. the move working successfully when I run it in bash or even in Python interactive mode.I also tried adding shell=True.In both cases, I am getting the following error: I invoke my script in the following manner:I tried executing each command in shell as well as Python interactive mode and I don't get any errors. Any idea what is going on over here?
After wasting hours of time debugging as to what was going wrong, I finally figured out what was happening. I was creating  and  using tempfile. Here is a snippet of the code:Like zwer said in the comments, if I am running this script using sudo, I don't need to add sudo in my mv command. Because I kept getting permission denied errors, I kept thinking that sudo would fix my problem. The actual issue over here was when tempfile.mkstemp() is called, it returns an open file descriptor along with the file path. I didn't pay much attention to the first argument, so when I modified my createTestFiles() to below, everything started working.
