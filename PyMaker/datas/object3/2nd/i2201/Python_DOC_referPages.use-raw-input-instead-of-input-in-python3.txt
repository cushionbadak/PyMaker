I am in the habit of using  for certain debugging. However, in python3 this has changed to . Is there a way to define an alias at the top of my project, such as:I tried the above, but it only worked in the file I added it to, and not any other files in that directory. I'd like this to work basically in every file within my python repository.
You can define all aliases in a separate file (e.g. ) then import said file where needed (i.e. ).The con with this method that you'll be referencing the alias through  unless you make the import stricter (i.e. ) or if you don't care about avoiding a wildcard import (i.e. ).Additionally, if you don't mind another import in the aliases file you can use the builtins namespace:You still have to define all aliases separate file (e.g. ) then import said file where needed (i.e. ) but the advantage of using the builtins namespace is that you can use that import exactly as given.
You can do it by creating a module for creating the renaming function and then importing it to every file you want to like this:First the module function declaration in alias.pySecondly, import to another file:Sadly, you will have to make the import of the module to every file you want to use the renamed function.Hope it works for you!
Put this at the top, and you will get exactly what you want.It is guaranteed to work, but generally considered a bad practice (everybody will be confused with where is that raw_input defined)
