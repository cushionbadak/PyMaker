Natural Text
I have two separate lists of users (a person's name) and email addresses.  How do I modify thismessage = """To: Hey,How is the weather?"""to print without changingprint(message)Basically I'm looking for it to print out something similar to this without modifying the print(message). To: bob@gmail.comHey, BobHow is the weather?I'm sorry if this sounds dumb, but I feel like I'm just beating my head against a wall here and cannot figure it out.
You can use  as a means of string interpolation.The above code will output:To: bob@gmail.comFrom: BobHow's the weather
Here is one way of achieving the desired resultBut I think you may be interested in the  function that creates a text box and you fill it. Here is how it works.Here are the answers that I put in ['Yes', 'John', 'Hi John, this is Samuel Nde.']. The output is below.
