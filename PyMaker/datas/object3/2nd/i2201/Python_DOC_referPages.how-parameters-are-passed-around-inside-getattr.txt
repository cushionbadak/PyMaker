I understand the basic function and use case of  method. But I'm having trouble how parameters are passed around inside . I have code And it prints Forgive me if my assumption below is incorrect. I assume that the parameter  in  is somehow passed from the initial call to  and then to the call to  method and then to the  method of  class. But I'm not sure what exactly is happening. Could someone please clarify the details. 
Here is how I understand it:So,  is a , that is .Now, when you do , you call   of , with argument . So when python resolves:it gets the method  of your inner list, which is then returned. So, you could imagine that your code is interpreted as:Hope it helps.
 never comes in contact with that .  simply returns a bound method, which is then called with the argument . Obtaining the bound method and calling the bound method are two unrelated steps, and  is only responsible for the first one.It might be easier to follow along if you mentally split this line:into two:Clearly,  is called in the first line and has nothing to do with the 2nd line.  simply returns a reference to the  method of the wrapped list, as you can easily verify for yourself:This is a bound method. A bound method is simply a method that has a reference to the object that will take the place of the  when the method is called (in this case, the list ). Bound methods are the reason why we can call methods without explicitly passing an argument for .For more details about bound methods, see What is the difference between a function, an unbound method and a bound method?.
