I am using powershell and scoop, windows. I already installed speech_recognition bucket but still showing the error.
The python interpreter shows a ModuleNotFoundError when it can't find the module being imported. For more information on how  works, click here.Since you have installed latest python 3.7, and are working on a code snippet that was built 2 years ago, there is likely a case that the speech_recognition module might not be installed for your current python.Before you try anything, executeand see all the modules currently installed for your current python interpreter. If the speech_recognition module is not available in the list, then install it:Also, if you are having multiple python versions installed on your system then make sure you use the pip installer of the python interpreter that you are using for your application. If you are using or like having multiple python versions, then I suggest you use a tool like pyenv.
