I am attempting to utilize the Python module  to automate a terminal command on Mac. Specifically, I am running a certain command to create port mappings on my machine. However, the command in question requires both root privileges and piping:In order to pass my root password to the shell command with , I followed the code example found here to create a script below:Note that to implement the piping of the  output to the command  I have created two  objects and have passed the  of the first object to the  parameter of second, as recommended in the  docs, and am using  to write the root password to the stdin. However, my script above is not working, as I am still prompted in the terminal to enter my root password. Strangely, I am able to successfully write my root password to stdin when using a command without piping, for instance, when running  (to display my current port mapping settings):The above code works, as the mapping configuration is displayed without any password prompt. How can my first Python script be changed so that I am not prompted to enter my root password, having already utilized  to write the password to stdin? I am running this code on macOS Sierra 10.12.5
I think this is just a simple case of the pipes not being connected up properly. You don't specify a pipe for the  of the first process so by the looks of things the output just gets printed to the terminal then the process finishes.When second process starts, it will prompt for the password and as far as I can see receive it correctly. However the  method then closes the input and waits for the process to finish. As far as I can see the output of the first process never reaches the second, which is why your script isn't working. Instead of creating a separate  process, why not just send all the text data you need with ?The other problem it looks like you have (I don't have a MAC to check) is that  is printing the prompt directly to the terminal (ie via  rather than ). On my version of  (on Debian) adding the  option causes it to print the prompt to . However it looks like the  option doesn't do this on a MAC. Instead try disabling the prompt with .Putting everything together, this should work:Security NoteThis answer was updated to not use a plain text password. See the comments below for a good example of why this is a bad idea! Note also that storing passwords in memory with Python isn't completely secure as if the memory is swapped to disk, this will include the password in plain text. With a lower level language, the  system call would be used to prevent any memory containing the password from being swapped.
