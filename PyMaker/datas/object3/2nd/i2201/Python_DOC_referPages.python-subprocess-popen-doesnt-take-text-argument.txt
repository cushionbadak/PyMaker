Natural Text
According to the Python 3 documentation for subprocess.Popen, the class constructor takes an optional argument  (which is supposed to control whether the file objects stdin, stdout and stderr are opened in text mode).However, when I try setting  upon construction of a  object, I get the errorand when I look in the source code (I'm using Python 3.6.4), the constructor takes no argument . What is going on here? Why does the documentation say the constructor takes an optional argument  when it doesn't in the version of  that I have?
I have the feeling the text parameter has been added in 3.7, not 3.6.Relevant part of the doc:Changed in version 3.7: Added the text parameter, as a more understandable alias of universal_newlines. Added the capture_output parameter.
