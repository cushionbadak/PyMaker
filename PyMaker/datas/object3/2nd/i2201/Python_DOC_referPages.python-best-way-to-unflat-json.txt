I have a function that makes JSON flat:But I have not yet figured out how to convert the flat JSON back
Unflattening back to arbitrarily nested dictionaries requires that you create new dictionaries for arbitrary paths;  means that there must be a nested dictionary associated with the  key, so you can set  in there.  means  is a dictionary with a  key pointing to another dictionary, were  is set, etc. Essentially, everything but the last element in  is a key in a dictionary pointing to another dictionary, and you need to create those dictionaries if they have not yet been created, in a loop.You can use  to do this, see this previous answer of mine for an explanation of the  and  functions: takes care of creating those nested dictionaries if they don't yet exist, for any number of keys.  takes care of separating out the last key in a path from the remainder, and setting the value in the innermost dictionary.This assumes that the input never used  in keys originally, of course. But as long as you pick a path separator that's not used as a substring of any of the keys in the input dictionary, you can un-flatten back to the original form.Demo on your example:and a more complex one using a different separator:
