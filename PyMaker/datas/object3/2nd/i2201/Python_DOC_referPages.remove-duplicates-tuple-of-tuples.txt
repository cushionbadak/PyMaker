input data:converted into dict(key, value):did some more filter just for understanding the data model:Now i want to eliminate duplicate and then revert back to tuple like below:duplicate matching conditions:1) eliminate duplicate if len(value) > 12) value should exact match not partial.Note:key 2 and 3 value is not duplicate because len(value) is not -gt 1key 4 value has gone because its exact duplicatesince we are doing exact matching, hence in key 5 value ['Noah', Liam] will not go.code which i tried:
