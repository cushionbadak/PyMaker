i am using python 3, GUI, tkinter.i use grid method (row and column) to create a table containing info, a button is placed in the end of each row. if someone press that button, the whole row will disappear/destroy and next row will replace it, which function should i use to achieve that?
The grid_forget() method will cause the grid geometry manager to stop managing a widget. So if you put your widgets for a row into a frame and grid that, you can grid_forget the frame to have all the widgets in the frame removed from display together. However, you might want to investigate the Ttk treeview which can display tabular information or the tktable package (see this answer).
