I have a ML model which is trained as saved as pickle file, Randomforestclassifier.pkl. I want to load this one time using java and then execute my "prediction" part code which is written python. So my workflow is like:Read Randomforestclassifier.pkl file (one time)Send this model as input to function defined in "python_file.py" which is executed from java for each requestpython_file.py has prediction code and predictions returned should be captured by java codePlease provide suggestions for this workflow requirementI have used processbuilder in java to execute python_file.py and everything works fine except for model loading as one time activity
