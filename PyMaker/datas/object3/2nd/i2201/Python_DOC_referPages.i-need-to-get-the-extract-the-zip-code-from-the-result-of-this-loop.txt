What can I do to only get the zipcode, and not the whole address? right now it shows a whole address which contains a zipcode, is there a way of extracting the zipcode? 
Since zip codes are always the last 5 digits or 5 plus 4 digits in an address, you can use the following regex to extract the zip code from the address stored in your  variable:
If you don't know regex I think you can do something like this but you should learn about them they will give you more robust behavior.
