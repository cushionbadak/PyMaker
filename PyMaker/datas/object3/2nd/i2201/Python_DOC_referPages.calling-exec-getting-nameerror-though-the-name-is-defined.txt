I have a file named  containing the following script:And I have another file named , which contains this script:When I run it, I get the expected output:However, if I change  to this:I get the following error:How is function  getting lost?  It looks to me like I'm not violating any scope rules.  I need to make something similar to the second version of  work.
 executes  in the current scope, but modifying that scope (as  does via the implied assignment) is undefined.The fix is simple:This causes  to run in an empty global scope (augmented with the default  object), the same way as in a regular Python file.For details, see the  documentation.  It also warns that modifying the default local scope (which is implied when not specifying any arguments besides ) is unsound:The default locals act as described for function  below: modifications to the default locals dictionary should not be attempted. Pass an explicit locals dictionary if you need to see effects of the code on locals after function  returns.
Would it work for you if you imported and called the function instead?myfile.pycaller.py
