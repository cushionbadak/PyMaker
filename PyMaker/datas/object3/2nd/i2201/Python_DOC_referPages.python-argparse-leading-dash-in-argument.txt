Natural Text
I'm using Python's  module to parse command line arguments. Consider the following simplified example,which can successfully be called likeA single argument is required after  and after each , which may contain spaces if we use quotation. If however an argument starts with a dash () and does not contain any spaces, the code crashes:error: argument -s: expected one argumentI get that it interprets  as the beginning of a new option, which is illegal as  has not yet received its required argument. It's also pretty clear though that no option with the name  has been defined, and so it should not interpret it as an option in the first place. How can I make  accept arguments with one or more leading dashes?
You can force argparse to interpret an argument as a value by including an equals sign:
If you are instead trying to provide multiple values to one argument:will grab everything after  on the command line and shove it in .Note that even though  is a recognized argument,  adds it to the list of args found by  since it is after  on the command line
