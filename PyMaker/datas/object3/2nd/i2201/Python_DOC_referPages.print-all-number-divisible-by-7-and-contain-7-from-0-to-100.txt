I am trying to make a for loop that will print all the numbers divisible by 7 from 0 to 100 and also numbers that contain 7, like this example:71417212728and so onI tried to do this:but it prints this:71421 and so onwhat should I do?
As pointed out elsewhere,  doesn't really make sense, as you can't compare an integer to a range object. What you're actually trying to do is a membership test, which in python uses the  keyword: The next issue you'll find is that you're missing a class of numbers that contain the digit 7. Namely, the 70-79 range (although you'll get 70 and 77 from the other rules). Following your current strategy, your final answer might look like this:This is perfectly valid. You can also approach it mathematically, by noting that the numbers with a 7 ones digit will have a remainder of 7 when divided by 10 (known as the modulo operator, ), and numbers with a 7 tens digit will have a quotient of 7 when divided by 10 (using integer division, ).Finally, there's a neat trick you can do since you're checking both division and mod by the same number; these two results will be given at the same time by the built-in  function. You just need to check if either of them are 7. (Note that this won't work if you expand beyond 2 digit numbers.)(Note: I left the range of the  loop the same as your sample code. This will include  in the output, since it is divisible by 7. If you don't want , just change the range to .)
well actually when you do:you are comparing an integer with a iterable. So this condition always evaluates to .What you want to do is to check whether the string representation of you number contains . You can do:So globally, you could write the following:
if you don't want to do  and mathematically do it here is how you canOutput
Using list comprehension and using  along with the checking  contents for a
