I've slightly changed the way I use  as I've got a little more familiar with it, and each time I've found an issue. I'm still having to use Python 2.7 so the old syntax is necessary.Two of the alternate ways I've tried and stopped using are  and .I realised that  basically returns an object, so instead of constantly creating the object, it could be assigned to a class attribute instead. It seems a little neater as the instance is only needed to be read once, but would there be any potential issues arising over this.I've been setting it to  so nothing can really interfere with it, I'd just like an opinion before I do too much and have to rewrite a whole load of code.
The problem with assigning a  object to an instance attribute is that it creates a reference cycle:Of course the garbage collector will detect and clean up this reference cycle eventually, but if you get into a habit of using  like this, you will be wasting a significant amount of memory.A better solution is to implement a  that returns a  object:This way, no reference cycles are created.
