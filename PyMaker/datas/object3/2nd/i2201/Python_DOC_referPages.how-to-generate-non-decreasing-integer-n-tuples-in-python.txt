This question already has an answer here:Number list with no repeats and ordered                    6 answers                Consider the tuple  with each satisfying . I know that in Python, I can generate all the  satisfying the bound  using the following: but this will return a list of tuples that do not satisfy the non-decreasing property of the tuple. How do I generate such sequences? As an example, say that  thenHowever, we notice that  do not obey the non-decreasing property. For instance in  we see that  is not less than or equal to . 
 does the job:
You can try this:For n=3 and m=2, it results in:This is not very efficient, though, but perhaps this does not matter.
Not sure that I got exactly what you're looking for, but perhaps this code snippet might work:Using the  operation you keep a single copy of each duplicate, and you're done.
This code could be done pretty easily with recursion, without using .Example:
