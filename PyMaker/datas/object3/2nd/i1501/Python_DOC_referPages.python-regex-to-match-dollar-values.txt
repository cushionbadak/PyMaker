This question already has an answer here:re.findall behaves weird                    2 answers                I'm trying to come up with a regex for dollar value search in Python. I have looked and tried lots of solutions on SO posts, but none of them is quite working.The regex I came up with is:I have tried this on the following example:And I got:Regex doc says that:If one or more groups are present in the pattern, return a list of  groups; this will be a list of tuples if the pattern has more than one  group. Empty matches are included in the result.But it is not even getting the whole number part.My question is: I really want to find  as a single piece. Is there a solution? 
Remove capture groups to allow  to return full matched string:Also note that dot needs to be escaped in your regex
Use finditer:OutputThe function  returns an iterator yielding match objects. The method group of a match object without arguments returns the whole match.
Use a capturing group for the whole pattern, and non-capturing for subpatterns:Return all non-overlapping matches of pattern in string, as a list of strings. The string is scanned left-to-right, and matches are returned in the order found. If one or more groups are present in the pattern, return a list of groups; this will be a list of tuples if the pattern has more than one group. Empty matches are included in the result.https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#re.findall
