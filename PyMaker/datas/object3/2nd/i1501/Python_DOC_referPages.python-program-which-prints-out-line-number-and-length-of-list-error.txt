Now I'm using while loops to try and do this because I'm not too good at using for loops. As the title reads, I'm trying to print out a table which has the line number next to the length of each line.Error: When I hit run all I get is the above print out (line and number of words with dashes below). I do not get a series of printouts of y and zNote: I'm probably making this way harder than it needs to beCode:what I want the print out to look like:Thanks.
Yes, you might have overcomplicated the solution as there are out of the box Python methods that help you easily solve problems like this. For iteration with indexes, use , in the example below we set the index to start at 1. We can also use some simple string formatting defined in  to ensure consistent spacings.Then simple use  to split the whitespaces and get the total number of words and let  manage the whole thing for you.
Check out python docs for range and for details.
