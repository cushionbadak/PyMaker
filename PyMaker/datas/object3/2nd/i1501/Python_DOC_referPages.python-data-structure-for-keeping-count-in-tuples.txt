I have a list of people objects like this...And I'm comparing to a list of tasks to count and keep track of how many tasks they performed a month...I'm stuck because I can't visualise an appropriate way to keep track of month-by-month data and end up with something like this for p.amy.monthlyTaskCount...(showing 23 tasks completed for Nov 2018 etc)I'm just lost in terms of finding an elegant way to store data in this format - e.g. simply appending values to a list would result in duplicate entries per month which I'd then have to clean-up afterwards so I'm hoping there's a data structure someone could recommend that would solve the problem.
I suspect this problem would be a lot easier to solve if you were using dictionaries to store more of your data. For instance, rather than putting the  in a list, but them in a dictionary keyed by their name, and you can immediately look up the appropriate  instance rather than needing to iterate through the list each time.Similarly, the per-month count should probably be another dictionary, or maybe a dictionary subtype like  (which is specifically designed for counting things).There's another issue with how you're setting  in your class: All the instances will share the same list, since it's being created as a class variable. You should probably move its creation into the  method so each  gets their own copy.Anyway, here's my suggestion:With the improved data structures, your bookkeeping becomes easy:
