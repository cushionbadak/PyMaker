I need to check for missing items between two lists. Show me what accounts are in the check, but not in account_codes list. I think i need regex here. in this example, only two items are not a match. 12e56 & 123aMy difficulty, as you can see, is the data on both sides are not identical. Padding appears to have occured at some point and then stopped. Some data is padded with zeros, others isn't. The actual data set is large so I need to keep that in mind with any solution. My immediate thought is to strip all leading zeros from both sides like so:Is there a better solution to this problem or do you see any inefficiencies in my existing code? 
Sets are the most efficient for such operations:more on python sets here
Try these:
I will remove all '0' in front of main string by using regex, then use difference set to figure out what i missed.
