Natural Text
I am trying to iterate and over a g-zipped text file. The format is that the data is in blocks of four lines. I need to take a percentage of these blocks and copy them to another file. My code takes in each block and then determines if it should be copied using random.random(). My problem is the code stops after the first block is selected and stops iterating over the g-zip file. Anyone have any ideas what I might be doing wrong?Thanks!ChrisLink to file: Download
After you gather a group of four and decide to save it or not; reset your counter and buffer.Refactored to make use of enumerate and list.extendThis test works,...Result:Maybe your conditional is not working
