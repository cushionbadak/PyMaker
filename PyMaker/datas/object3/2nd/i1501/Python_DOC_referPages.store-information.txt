im total newbie in python and programing and i dont know where i can get answer (or what i should learn). I have raspberry pi with FM transmiter to wirless turn on and turn off AC power. For example sending sginal 123 turns on AC and signal 124 turns off. I wrote script that check text file ("check.txt"). If check.txt is 1 then send signal to turn off and write file check.txt to 0, else send signal to turn on and write 1 in text file. So i have script to turn on and off AC power by FM transmiter. I know its very nooby way to do that. SO what is propper and better way to store information that script can use?
You need to read and store the temperature as some dictionary values into some log filesif the temp gets the range pass the signal make that switch on and off.in the other way make it by timeUse some cron jobs to automate the AC to power On and Off
You can use:- Using os.environ dictionary. Pass it using environment variables PARAM1=yes script.py- Message Broker as Redis or/and other systems- Files (be careful here with access and security parameters)  Each way can be used so it's only your choice here)
