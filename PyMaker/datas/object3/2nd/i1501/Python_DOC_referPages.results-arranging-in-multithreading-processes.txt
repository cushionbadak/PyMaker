Assuming I have a code that using multiprocessing returns me a list of 200000 items that are a list of their own (in the code marked as point 1). In case i need one list with the internal items only, I iterate the received list again (in the code marked as point 2).Problem: the line marked as point 2 does not work in parallel and therefore takes valuable time. Is there a way to write all the data in directly from the function cu to the doc?I suspect that replacing multithreading by multiprocessing will solve this problem but I am afraid that it will not saves time.Note: this is a minimal example.
The problem is that you are running a pool for only one operation but 200k times, but you want the pool to run over 200k operations. You need to use, , with generators and :This solution is lazy, that means that you need to consume the iterator for taking the values (iterating over it), you can easyly use:or if you dont want the results stored:
