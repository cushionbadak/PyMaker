I've searched a lot about how to reuse a method from a class in the main.py file. i got some similar and basic solutions but in my case is a bit different./lib/module.py/main.pyerrortesting:if i don't use the def init(), everything will be fine. but the problem is i need to keep it
This line in main.py:Calls this function:Every time you create an instance of Myclass it will call the  function. You declared it to take 2 arguments:  and .  is always passed implicitly because it's a class, but you need to give it an argument 'x'.So you can change main.py to this for example:Please read this for more informationAlso, in general, class names are written in CapWords style so it's a good idea to call your class  instead of Edit:Since you don't want to pass  to  and you want to set  from main.py you can try something like this:from main.py you can do:Output:
I think @richflow 's answer hit the point. If some variable is to be shared by all instances of a class, it's logical to assign its value using . Then all instances of this class will know the change. If you really want to optionally change x in the   method of an instance, you can still do it. Combining with @richflow's codes, it can look like the following.I tried not to change too much from your codes. Your  should work correctly with this class definition. However, the design looks a bit weird to me. Probably that's because I didn't understand clearly what the  and  methods are really doing, and what the argument  is really doing in  methods. If you provides more insights, probably people can help you with a better design.
