Is there a way to trigger a function automatically if any of a list of functions is called in python? Like say function a is attached to a list of functions [b, c, d, e] and if either of [b, c, d, e] is called (for example say b()) then a() is called automatically before it? I want to use function a to set up some values before b is called so that b can use it.Like for example:I have some global variables and some class methods, The global variables are somethings like CLASSIFIER(e.g. LogisticRegression or XGBClassifier), CLASSIFIER_TYPE(e.g. 'linear' or Tree) which I need to change everytime I call fit and predict methods on their respective pipelines (e.g. pipeline_linear or pipeline_tree).fit/predict. This is because I have written code like:So based on the pipeline I am using, the global variables need to be modified accordingly in order for the fit and predict methods to work on the pipelines(pipeline_linear and pipeline_tree).Any other good approach to take care of these situations will be really helpful!
I think you can still use something like a decorator/wrapper. See if something like this could work for you:Output:You can add  if that is important for you.
Use a wrapper.If your function is  and your list is :
Surely it would be easier to just call the function at the top of each other function?
