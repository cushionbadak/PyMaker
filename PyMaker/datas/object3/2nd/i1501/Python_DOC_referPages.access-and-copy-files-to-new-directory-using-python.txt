Natural Text
I have a textfile containing a list of file paths, which I want to access with Python, copy and paste into a new folder.All files should be copied and pasted into a new folder (output_folder). How can I achieve this?My code so far:
I think you can use the shutil.copy function to achieve your goal. It would be something like this:If it raises PermissionDenied error, comment the line that creates the output folder and create it manually in the working directory.
