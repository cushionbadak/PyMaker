I'm trying to create a table in the console from a csv file. To make the output look more like a table, I want to add a row of dashes on the second line to split the headings and the main table content.This is my code so far:This is the output:And this is the output I'd like to achieve:
You can make your code far easier using the string format mini language:Output:Alternate solutions for the header extraction if you want to omit row times if and use adaptive widths without hardcoding lengths:Demofile:Code:    Output:
I believe what you're trying to achieve is that the header of your table(i.e. the column names) should come off separately. If I am understanding you right, then I'll suggest why not use pandas.read_csv to import your csv file. It identifies the header by itself and if not then it does have this as an argument that how to select a row as the header.Check out the documentation:Pandas- read_csvAlso, if in case you want dashes only or the way you mentioned it, then I believe you will have to add print statement after printing your first row which has the column names and then another print statement for dashes and then a loop for other info and then a final print for more dashes. So yeah that's one manual way to do it.Edit:Since  you asked for the manual way of doing it, here's the code:Output:
