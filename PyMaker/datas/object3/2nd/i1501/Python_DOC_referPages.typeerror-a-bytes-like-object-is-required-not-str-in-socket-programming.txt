The following is the code that tries to modify the input supplied by a user by using sockets:When I execute it and supply input the following error occurs:What can I do to solve this?
This code is probably good for Python 2. But in Python 3, this will cause an issue, something related to bit encoding. I was trying to make a simple TCP server and encountered the same problem. Encoding worked for me. Try this with  command.Similarly you would use  to receive the data on the UDP server side, if you want to print it exactly as it was sent.
encoding and decoding can solve this in python 3:Client Side:Server Side:
A bit of encoding can solve this:Client Side:Server Side:
Simply replace message parameter passed  in  to . Then you would successfully run in in python3
Whenever you encounter an error with this message use .(where  is the string you're passing to a function/method).The  method of  objects returns the encoded version of the string as a  object which you can then use. In this specific instance, socket methods such as  expect a bytes object as the data to be sent, not a string object.Since you have an object of type  and you're passing it to a function/method that expects an object of type , an error is raised  that clearly explains that:So the  method of strings is needed, applied on a  value and returning a  value:Here the prefix  in  denotes that this is indeed a bytes object. You can then pass it to whatever function is expecting it in order for it to run smoothly.
