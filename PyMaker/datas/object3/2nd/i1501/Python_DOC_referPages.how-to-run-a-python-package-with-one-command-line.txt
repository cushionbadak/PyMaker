I'm a newbie in Python. And I don't know how to run a python package with only one command line. I have been searched it on GG but I have no key-word. There is my folder:And config.json contains 3 parameters and able change by the user. So, I want to run this my_source package with one command line like this:my_source -c config.jsonCould I able to run my code in this way? If it's possible. Could anyone give me a key-word or a way to do it? If you need more info, please leave a comment. Thank you.
