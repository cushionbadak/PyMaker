Trying to write a small script in Python to delete files, but the os.remove function is having issues with the file path. Note if I comment out  it runs fine and will print 'gone'. I don't understand why when assigning the path to the variable it works but os.remove doesn't like the same thing. Here's the error message:OSError: [WinError 123] The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect: 'C:\Users\The User\Downloads\test.txt'
I think you should just return the full path of the file to delete, and if the path is not , then call . In your code, you check that  exists in , but  is a list, and you need to go through and get the matching file to determine its current directory. Then you can get the full path using , and use that later for deletion. Demo:You can can also use  here to make  shorter:Note: You can use  instead of hardcoding .
