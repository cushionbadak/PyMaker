I am looking for a way to convert a waveform that is composed of time on the x axis and amplitude on the y axis into a wav or any other audio file.  Code or a python library is much appreciated  Here is the waveform that I want to convert
You can use the standard  library. Here is a function that I use. You can modify it further if you need more channels or a different sample width.Some links to the documentation:https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.htmlhttps://docs.python.org/2/library/wave.html
