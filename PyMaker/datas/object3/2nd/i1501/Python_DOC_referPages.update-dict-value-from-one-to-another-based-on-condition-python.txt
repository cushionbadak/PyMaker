Is there any better way to write following code? I have two dict with same set of data as key, I want to iterate dict_a and check if any key with only one value, then update the value to dict_b. I have following working code but it seem there should be a better way to do it
You are, possibly unnecessarily, modifying  when you use  on  values in . You can, instead, use  +  to extract the only value of a :
You can make it a one-liner using  and a generator:Algorithmically, this doesn't gain anything, but will utilize some optimzations that come with the used syntactic means.
