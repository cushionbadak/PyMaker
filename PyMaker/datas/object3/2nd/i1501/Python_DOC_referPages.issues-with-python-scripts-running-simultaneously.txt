I have two python scripts that use two different cameras for a project I am working on and I am trying to run them both inside a different script or within each other, either way is fine.My problem however is that they don't run at the same time, I have to quit the first one for the next to open. I also tried doing it with bash as well with the & shell operator And this does in fact make them both run however the issue is that they both run endlessly in the background and I need to close them rather easily. Any suggestion what I can do to avoid the issues with these implementations
You could do it with multiprocessing
One possible method is to use  to control your process (i.e. treat them as daemons).This is how I control my Python servers since they need to run in the background and be completely detached from the current  so I can exit my connection to the machine and the continue processes continue. You can then also stop the server later using , as explained below.Instructions:Create a  file and save it in , with contents along the lines of:and repeat with one going to .Then you can use  to control your daemons.First reload all config files with:then start either of your daemons (where  is one of your unit files):it should now be running and you should find it in:You can also check its status with:and / them with:
Use subprocess.Popen. This will create a child process and return its pid.And then check out these functions for communicating with the child process and checking if it is still running.
