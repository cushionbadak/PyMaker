You're looking for a way to chain together conditional statements. Unfortunately you cannot do it the way you're trying to do. However, you can use  and  to chain them together, which is how it's normally done. For example:But an even better approach is to find how to logically turn this into a single conditional, in this case using  on the user input:Finally, you can use  to provide a random element from your answers array.
Change your problematic line to:This way, you convert the input string to lowercase () while also stripping any space the user might have typed in ()Then, if user types: "No",  will convert it to all lowercase, "no" and then check it towards your .Anything typed into  is a string, so can omit the .
