I need to decode a string 'a3b2' into 'aaabb'. The problem is when the numbers are double,triple digits. E.g. 'a10b3' should detect that the number is not 1 but 10.I need to start accumulating digits.If I change the while loop to this:it does work but omits the last letter.I should not use regex, only loops.
Your  loop and  loop use different indices for obtaining tokens, which is why the characters consumed by the  loop are processed once again by the  loop. You should instead use a  loop with a single index to parse the tokens:This outputs:
Regex is a good fit here.Since you can't use regex for some unbeknownst reason, I recommend a recursive function to split the string into parts.or, using a more generic (and Functional-derived) pattern:
You could use groupby:Output
One of possible variant
Here's a functional solution using the  module. You can use the  recipe from the  docs or import via 3rd party :For reference, the  recipe:
This is kind of lengthy, but it works and uses loops as you requested:
