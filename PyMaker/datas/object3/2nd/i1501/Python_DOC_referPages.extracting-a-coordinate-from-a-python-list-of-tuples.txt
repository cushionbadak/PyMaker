I have a python listand I wish to extract a list of  valuesI have triedandbut neither worked. How can I do this?
I prefer a list comprehension with a self-documenting tuple unpacking:Complete program:
A comprehension would do:
Looks like you just have a list of tuples.  I'm still a bit new to python,  but I would try : training_data_x =[]for i in training_data:     training_data_x.append(i[0])another way you could do is create a function that takes tuple and returns the x.  Then map the function to your training_data_x variable.
