In Ubuntu you can install package python3-mock. mock library has been added to Python 3.3 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0417/).What is a difference between these libraries? Which one is recommended to use?
 is recommended if you are using python 3.3 or newer.I think  is the same as the version on pypi:https://pypi.org/project/mock/#descriptionmock is now part of the Python standard library, available as unittest.mock in Python 3.3 onwards.This package contains a rolling backport of the standard library mock code compatible with Python 2.6 and up, and 3.3 and up.So it's actually a backport for old Python.
Depends on which python version you are using in your project.For Python versions < 3.3 you should install mock lib.For others else, including 3.3, you don't need because it were incorporated to standard lib.
