I am using anaconda on mac and I am wondering whether there is a way to clear my python command history. Specifically, upon calling  in terminal, I wanted to clear anything I typed before here.
Assuming you want to clear the command history Python goes through when you hit the up and down arrow keys, that history is managed by either the GNU readline library or libedit, depending on your system. The Python  module is the Python-level interface to the underlying library (even if that library is libedit), and on systems where the underlying library supports it, you can clear the history with :I do not know if the library on your Mac supports it.
Escape sequence?Alternatively
You could use subprocess.call() from the standard library subprocess module to send the reset command to the terminal which will reinitialize the terminal and in effect do something similar to clear but also clear the scrollback history.
