I want to create a square map that contains cells with a function. Function should take one variable that represents range of the map (range of 3 means that map is 3x3 = 9 cells and so on). Each cell should have coordinates that looks like this:A1,A2,A3...B1,B2,B3...C1,C2,C3... and so on. Ofc, maximum range should be 26 (26x26). I want to append those cells in the in the list. I wrote a code that does that but only with numbers, I do not now how to create coordinates with letters.This is the code:
Just replace str(x) code with chr(64 + x)
You can also use  to get the letters and use a slice of length  for your coordinates:Output
