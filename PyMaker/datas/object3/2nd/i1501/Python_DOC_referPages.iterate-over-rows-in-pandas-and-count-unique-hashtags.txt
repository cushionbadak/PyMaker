Sounds like you want something like , which you might use like this...which gives you,Edit:  I think jpp's answer will be quite a bit faster.  If time really is a constraint, I would avoid reading the data into a  in the first place.  I don't know what the raw  file looks like, but reading it as a text file by lines, ignoring the first token, and feeding the rest into a  may end up being quite a bit faster.  
So all the answers above were helpful, but didn't actually work! The problem with my data is: 1)the value of  filed for some tweets are  or . 2)The value of  field in the dataframe is one string! the answers above assumed that the values of the hashtags are lists of hashtag, e.g. , while it actually is only an : . So I added some lines to @jpp 's answer:
