Natural Text
I'm working with Python 3.6.5 on a Winows 10.I can not verify if a file exists in a directory or not.The problem seems to come from the special character "^".When I run the code below, the "WITHOUT_CIRCUMFLEX" and "^WITH_CIRCUMFLEX" files are well listed by the os.listdir () function.However, the file "^ WITH_CIRCUMFLEX" is not recognized by the function pattern.match (file) ... while it exists!Would anyone have an idea to solve this problem?Thanks for your helpimport pandas as pdimport os.pathimport regexpath = "C:\Users\David\test"list_name = ['WITHOUT_CIRCUMFLEX', '^WITH_CIRCUMFLEX']df_empty = pd.DataFrame()for name in list_name:    df_empty.to_pickle('{path}\{name}.pkl'.format(**locals()))    pattern = regex.compile('{name}.pkl'.format(**locals()))
 is a regex meta character, so it'll not match a literal  character in text. You'd need to escape such characters:If your inputs are generated or taken from another source, use the  function to escape meta characters for you:However, if you are looking to match files, you currently are not using any of the reasons you'd use a regular expression. Your pattern will at best match any filename that ends with . You'd be much better off using the glob module:
 is a regex metacharacter, so you have to escape it. The easiest way to do this is to use the  function, which automatically escapes metacharacters in an arbitrary string.So instead of use
