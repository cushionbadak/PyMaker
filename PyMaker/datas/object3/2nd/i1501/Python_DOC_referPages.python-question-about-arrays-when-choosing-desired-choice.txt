I need help for my code which I am currently making. This is one line of my code:this is my code for choosing your desired choice. Which o stands for orange, r is radish, w is wasabi, c is chips and cho stands for chocolate. I want to allow the user to choose their desired choice and when they type in for example o, the orange counter should go up by 1. I'm just unsure how it should work.Thanks.
The list-based data structure you are using is called a property list (or "plist"). It associates a key with a value. These are common in Lisp, but Python usually uses a dict for that. Dicts are based on hashtables, which are faster than scanning a list, especially if it is long. Plists do have certain advantages, but they mostly don't apply to Python. It's still worth knowing how they work though.Here's some examples of how to increment the value given a key in a plist.The  method finds the index of the first element in the list equal to its argument. The value follows that, so . You use just that part to look the value up.
Consider using a dictionary. The basic layout would follow a similar structure to below, where you could iterate through multiple user choices and do the same 
Dictionary is well suited.
Consider using  for counting objects.
