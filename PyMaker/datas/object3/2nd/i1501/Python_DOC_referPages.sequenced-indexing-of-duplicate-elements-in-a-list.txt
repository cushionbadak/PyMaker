I have a list that is:a = [100, 200, 200, 400, 500, 600, 600, 700, 900, 1000, 400, 200, 500]if I try to find indices of the values in 'a' using:it gives mexlist = [0, 1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 5, 7, 8, 9, 3, 1, 4]Instead I want a list that gives me unique indices for every repeated value as well. Something like this:xlist = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]Something that jumps the index if it's already used and moves on to index the next duplicate value and does it further.Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.
Something like this could work:OR use  for a 1-line command:Works for both python2 and python3.
If I understand correctly, you are overthinking this. Duplicates or not, you seem to just want a list going from  to the last index of .If that's the case, simply issueor
