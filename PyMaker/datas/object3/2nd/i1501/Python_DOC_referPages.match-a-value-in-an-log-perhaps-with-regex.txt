I would like to match the 'ReturnValue' of 'ElemNum':13 (as this changes everytime I open this string)What I'm guessing is that I need to split the string, then with some Regex BlackMagic extract it? Here's a log of what it looks, essentially on the last line you can see I'm after 19695 but those figures will change.And so forth,{'ElemNum': 13, 'Page': 0, 'PageID': 0, 'PressedID': 9705, 'Quit': 1, 'ReleasedID': 9704, 'ReturnValue': 19695, 'X': 100, 'Y': 7},
I don't think any regex magic is needed here since we can simply extract that value by iterating over  and looking for dict whose  is equal to 13 and then print its .Or if your data is stored in file you could load it using  like so:
