This is a game for two users who roll 2 dice 5 times. If the total of dice is even the player gains 10 points if it is odd, they lose 5.If there it is a draw after five rounds then the both users will have to roll one die to determine the winner.    This was a project that i have been doing in computer science which I have now finished if anyone has any suggestions on how I could make it better they will appreciated alot so please suggest how I can improve it. Also It would be very helpful to me if you could rewrite the parts of my code that need improving or are wrong step by step so I can understand it betterThanks
