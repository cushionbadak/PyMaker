curr_time = 'Thursday 1:03:00'time_range = ['Wednesday 6:12:00', 'Thursday 6:12:00']Is something wrong in this. Return value is not correct all the time.
The problem is that you are comparing two strings. The days of the week are input as strings so the code compares the characters of the strings instead of the days of the week. I'd suggest using datetime objects from the datetime module for python:Python3: https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#module-datetimePython2: https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#module-datetimeIf you have the user input the days and times within datetime objects they should be more easily comparable within your current code.
