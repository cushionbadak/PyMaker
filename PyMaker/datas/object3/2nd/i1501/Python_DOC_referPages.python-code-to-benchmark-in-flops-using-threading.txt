I'm having trouble writing a benchmark code in python using threading. I was able to get my threading to work, but I can't get my object to return a value. I want to take the values and add them to a list so I can calculate the flops. create class to carry out threadingfunction to create threads
Two ways to do this:1. Using static variables (hacky, but efficient and quick)Define some global variable that you then manipulate in the thread. I.e.:2. The proper way to do this is with ProcessesProcesses are designed for passing information back and forth, versus threads which are commonly used for async work. See explanation here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.htmlSee this answer: How can I recover the return value of a function passed to multiprocessing.Process?
