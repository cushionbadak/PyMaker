You can mix types inside tuples or lists. Why can't you specify that in typing hints?
In type theory, a list is a homogenous structure containing values of one type. As such,  only takes a single type, and every element of that list has to have that type.However, type theory also provides sum types, which you can think of as a wrapper around exactly one value selected from some fixed set of types. A sum type is supported by . To specify that a list is a mix of  and  values, useas the type hint.By contrast, a tuple is an example of a product type, a type consisting of a fixed set of types, and whose values are a collection of values, one from each type in the product type. ,  and  are all distinct types, distinguished both by the number of types in the product and the order in which they appear.
You could use a , but generally, if you can avoid it, lists should be homogenous instead of heterogeneous:, at least, will accept this just fine. This means though that your list accessors will return a Union type, often necessitating handling different possible types in any downstream functions. Accepting unions is generally less problematic.
