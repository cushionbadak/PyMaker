Natural Text
I want to convert each letter of the list word to a number depending on the lists character and number. So a = 0, b = 02300, c = 2.I want this output:ps: It's not import if there's no space between each number.I don't no what to do because the numbers of the list number are not equal to the index of the letters in the list character. PS: I hope there's not another topic like this because I didn't find it
You can create a dictionary using  and  to match the corresponding letter with the encryption number.Output:
Your post contains quite a few irregularities, such as missing characters, illegal integers, missing mappings and that peculiar translation for the empty string - so I'm going to answer in general.What you want (what I gathered from "It's not import if there's no space between each number") is a translation table that maps characters to their translation. You can get it by passing a mapping of characters to strings to .If you actually do want a list, use
You can use zip() to create a lookup dictionary.I opted to lowercase your input (and moved it to a normal string, not a list of strings with one string in it).If a character is not mapped, it will use it instead of a number (f.e. for the space).You can create a space seperated string fom it with:Output:See Why dict.get(key) instead of dict[key]? for 
You can do it like this:Note:I'm treating  as a string() rather than an array of strings().I've replaced the last item () in the character array with a space (). We need this to replace the space between  and .
