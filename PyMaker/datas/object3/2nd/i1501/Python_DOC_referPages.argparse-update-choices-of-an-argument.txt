Using argparse, is there any way to update the "choices" option of an argument  after it was added to the parser ? Argparse documentation doesn't yield much about updating the choicesI tried using 'parser.add_argument' with the new 'choices_list', but it creates duplicate arguments. Using Python 3.7
The argument itself has a  attribute, but it's easiest if you save a reference to the argument instead of trying to retrieve it from the parser itself. (Otherwise, you have to scan through the private attribute  and try to identify which one you need.)
Looking at https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/stdlib/2and3/argparse.pyiI don't use , but I'm puzzled as to why it would complain about , but not about .The argparse docs doesn't mention the returned  object, but that's because users don't usually need to access it.  But when tested interactively it's pretty obvious:Previous SO answers have pointed out that the  are also available in 'hidden'  list.  But in Python, that '_' is just an informal convention; the interpreter doesn't enforce privacy.What's displayed is the string representation of the  object.  Those are the most commonly used attributes. The documentation for  is not a formal API reference; it's too incomplete for that.  It's more of a advanced how-to document, more involved than a tutorial, but not as complete as a formal specification.
