I can't vouch for the performance of doing it this way but you can get a bytes object from a string of hex like so:From there you can decode it as usual:Here's the reference for fromhex: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes.fromhex (there's a fromhex class method for a number of the basic data types actually).
