Is there a way in Python 3 to recursively call private member variables unique  functions programmatically? Something like:When calling the individual private members, it works fine. Would like a method to do it dynamically however.Thanks so much.
The  function returns a dictionary where the keys are the variable names (as strings) and the values are the values of the variable. So iterating over the values should work.You can add some kind of separator (like a ) between the values if you want. Just replace  with .
You can also use the dictionary keys;  is : is effectively .  In turn,  is a  used to store an objectâ€™s (writable) attributes.The signature is , and when you iterate over a dictionary, you iterate over its keys, which suffices in this case.Note on DataclassesI'm not totally sure if (Python 3.7+) dataclasses are an easier solution here.  That's because they automatically implement a  but not a  as far as I can tell:In other words, you'd need to replace  with  (same for , which is maybe not something you want to do in the first place with regards to those two classes.)
Are you sure you shouldn't be using ?Anyway, here's an example using , beacuse I'm stuck on Python 3.5. With  it will work in a similar manner.
