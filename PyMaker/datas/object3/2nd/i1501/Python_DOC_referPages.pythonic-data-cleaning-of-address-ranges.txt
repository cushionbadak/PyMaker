I need to know if the following task is possible via Python.I have a list of 4,300 addresses, each that covers a range of addresses, like this:8519-21 S Broadway8700-6 Riverview Blvd822-4 Angelica St8442-6 N BroadwayI want to isolate the first address and the last in the range. So, using 1 as an example, I would need the output to give me 8519 S Broadway and 8521 S Broadway, each in its own row. In some instances, like 1 and 3, I only need the first two digits of the first number to complete the second address. I tried in Excel using text to columns (-), then CONCATENATE and LEFT(cell,2) but then I don't get the address correct for instances like 2 and 4, where I need the first three digits of the address. Is there any way to write a python script to solve this?   
Try this code:Where  is a list of the address ranges in the format you've given, and  is the data you want.
Let's say your input  file looks like this:and you want it to look something like this:You can accomplish this by using the  module:Which will output your results into output.csv. 
Thanks for the help and suggestions, all. This is how I ended up tackling it:
