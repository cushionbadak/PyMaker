I have created a client server app, where when i am in need to update the Client code, i am pushing an update using a string match and whenever that string matches the infinitely running client code process that.The update is nothing but a string that contains python code in it, let's say this:And in my client main code, i have something like this:From the server, i am sending something like this:Problem :CLI doesn't like new line, therefore i have to use one-liner python code to achieve thisBecause, it's a one-liner and while and if loop are compound statements, i can't use them the way i put in, so i need to know how can i achieve it in one-line codeIs this really a good hack to send updates? This is bonus question for me, if you don't answer it, that's fine
You can use exec() function in Python and convert that multiline code into a single line string to be used as  argument. Make sure you use  to indicate newline and still keep the proper spacing to indicate indentation.
