To use bs4's  function on a  tag I would just do:I want to throw this in a for loop for all tags available in the webpage:However when it comes time use it in a bs4 object:I know that there is no tag 'x' that exists, which is why I get the attribute error, is there anything I can do to make the 'x' in the loop symbolize the tag it's supposed to be representing as if I print it to console?
document states here:getattr(x, 'foobar') is equivalent to x.foobarSo when I tried it, I just looped through:as the document says is equivalent to  with x as the variableI'm not sure what you want to do with it from there.Not all the items in your set will work, so I just looped, threw them into a list, and then threw the exceptions into a list too just to see which didn't work. And 'select' will give a so basically, here's what I did in that last section. Again, do what you want, but you'll loop through
