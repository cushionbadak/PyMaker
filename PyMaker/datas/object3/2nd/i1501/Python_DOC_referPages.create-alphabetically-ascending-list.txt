I want to create alphabetically ascending names like the column names in excel. That is I want to have smth. like a,b,c,...,z,aa,ab,...az,...zz,aaa,aab,....I have tried:Which works until zz but than fails because it runs out of indexIndexError
You could make use of :First, you want all letters, then all pairs, then all triplets, etc. This is why we first need to iterate through all the string lengths you want ().Then, we need all possible associations with the  letters, so we can use  which is equivalent to a nested  loop repeated  times.This will generate the tuples of size  required, finally just  them to obtain a string.To continuously generate names without limit, replace the  loop with :
For a general solution we can use a generator and  from itertools:And the output:And you can use  to take as many strings as you need.
Try:When your index in below line exceed 26 it raise exception, becouse of ascii_lowercase length:But you can:EDIT:or you can use:
You can use:
There's an answer to this question provided on Code Review SEA slight modification to the answer in the link gives the following which works for an arbitrary number of iterations.
