Natural Text
I would like to retrieve an index of the element that matches a particular valueFor e.g. I have an array of the format:I'm using below to find whether an type exists:If type exists, I'm checking whether a specific 'text' exists using the below:then writing another generator (similar to above) to check whether matching 'text' exists.Is there any way I retrieve the matching  as well when checking whether a matching value exists?I would be using the index to update the value in the array.Sorry in case the post is not as legible as expected by the community.thanks
