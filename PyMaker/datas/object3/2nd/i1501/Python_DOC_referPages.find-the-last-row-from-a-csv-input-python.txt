I didn't really find an example related to my question as I don't know Pandas so I post it here. Let me know if this is not clear or already have been responded.I have a CSV input which I import like this I index rows with input_rows (there is probably a better way for this?)Input example :I'm looking to get the last row of this insput list. Is there a simple way to do that without iterating over all the rows ?Thank you !
You can get the last element in an array like so:In fact, you can do much more with this syntax. The  syntax gets the nth-to-last element. So  gets the last element,  gets the second to last, etcSo in your case, it would be:
Python supports negative indexing.Without knowing your use case and more about the data and how you typically access the data, it's hard to say what data structure would be better for you.
It's worth noting that  is an Iterator and doesn't contain your data until iterated through.  Same is true for the  opened I/O Stream object which is also an iterator.  The question to "Can I get the last row without iterating through the file/data" is unfortunately no, unless there is a specific stream point that you know can jump to (using ), then you will not be able to get the very last row until all the data have been iterated through.Once you have consumed all the data however, you can retrieve in your code with  by means of negative indexing, i.e. returning the last row of the .Here is a related question that might be of interest to you, but again, the answers all consume the data (reading the entirety as a list) prior to allowing the  operation, hence, all the data must be read through once at least.
