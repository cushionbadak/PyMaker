Is there any way to assign multiple values to a variable?I am coding a solitaire game and using the values of ACE through KING for the cards. Is there any way to assign a variable the value of "ACE" and the value of "1" and so on, KING being "13"? This is not necessary, but would make the code a lot simpler and easier to create.Thank you all, I currently have this:When I do:   I end up with: and when I do ace.name or ace.value, I get the right outcome as well.Is there any way to have the "ace" value in a list, and withdraw just the name?
You could use a class or  to wrap both pieces of dataA custom class might be better because then you can implement logic like could I make the statement stackA + 1 == stackB true?Yes, if you implement an  and  methods on the Card type that accept adding other Cards to int types and comparing the results to other Card types 
Use a dictionary.
You can use a custom class:Output:Providing  allows you to sort:Output:
