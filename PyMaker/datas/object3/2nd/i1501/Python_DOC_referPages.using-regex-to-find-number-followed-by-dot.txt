I am trying to find the index of the reference in a list of references. Let me illustrate:This is a list of references I scraped off a website:I thought I could get the index of reference (i.e. "1." and "2.") by using this:But I'm getting all numbers: How do I only get the list of reference index, i.e.  One way I guess is to find numbers followed by a dot, but I don't know how.
You may useSee Python demo:Details - a negative lookbehind that fails the match if, immediately to the left of the current location, there is a char other than whitespace and  - Group 1: one or more digits (it will be the output value from ) - a  and a space (replace the regular space with  to match any whitespace).See the regex demo.
You can try this:Will output:You might need to define a bit more structure, because just number (digit captured by \d) and dot will also capture '8.' at the end of the ISBN number: ISBN:0729537528. Here I used a few characters that (in this example) help distinguishing the two cases. One reference is preceded by a '>' the other one by a space (\s).
You have to "escape" the period so something like "[0-9]*\." should work. That's off the top of my head so it may be slightly wrong; I'll also leave it up to you to figure out why * is there.Be aware that Regex expressions in Python are slightly different from other implementations.  For definitive info see:See : https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.htmlwhich suggests that you should start here:https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html#regex-howtoHere's the relevant section of the library page (about 1/ 3 the way down): The special sequences consist of '\' and a character from the list below. If the ordinary character is not an ASCII digit or an ASCII letter, then the resulting RE will match the second character. For example, \$ matches the character '$'.For the eqivalent python 2.x page change the version selector found at the top left corner of the page.
