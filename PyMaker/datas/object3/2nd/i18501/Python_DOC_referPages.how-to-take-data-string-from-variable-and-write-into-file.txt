data receive=89435, how i can take the string data, if for example i want to take string data [2]=9 and write into file ...If the string is  then the character at  is not , it's . The first character of the string is at , the second at , and so on - count your indexes starting at 0 when you code in Python.Also:Unless I'm missing something, reassigning  to  has no utility here. You're not changing its type with those parentheses, and there's no reason you have to use three lines to read those 5 bytes as a ; just do .In fact, you may not even need  here. Depends what information you expect from the serial port - Integers? ASCII characters? Letters only, or whitespace characters? And so on.Try this and see if it does what you want:You can replace  with whatever logic you want to use to handle when 0 bytes are read from the port before it times out. You should probably also move  and  outside of the  block, unless you have some reason to open and close and open and close the file forever, but without some logic to exit the loop it wouldn't make sense so I'll leave you to deal with that on your own.
