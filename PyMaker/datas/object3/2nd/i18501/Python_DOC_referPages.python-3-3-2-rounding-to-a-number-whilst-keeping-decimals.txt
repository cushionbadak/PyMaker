I know the question sounds it a bit weird, I can't think of a way to explain it.Basically, I need to round numbers without cutting off extra zeros and such. For example, my current  will round something like  to , when I want it to round to . I know the practicality of this is stupid, but I need to do this so as to not confuse people when the numbers they get aren't the same length.Help, please?
The number of digits displayed after the decimal point isn't a property of the  representing the number - it's a property of how you display it. The  built-in or the string  method can use a format spec to control how numbers are displayed:See the links for how to use format specs - there are a lot of options, and they can get kind of confusing.
