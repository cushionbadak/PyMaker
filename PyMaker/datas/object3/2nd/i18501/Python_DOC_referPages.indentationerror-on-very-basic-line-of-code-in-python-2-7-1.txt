File "", line 3    else:        ^This is the error that comes up ---> IndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation levelas soon as I press enter it comes up with that and I'm not sure how to fix it, sorry I know this is probably a very silly question but I have only just started, hence the very basic code and error.
For a start, you should use:or:Once you've fixed that, make sure you're following the Python guidelines for indenting. That indentation error can often occur when you don't (such as mixing tabs/spaces, using too few or too many spaces and so on).From what you've posted, the indentation looks okay but it's sometimes hard to tell. The following Python 2.7.3 session, using four spaces for the indents, works fine:But when I (foolishly) put a space immediately before the , I see, similar to you:
you need to mach youre indentation:the if is a condition and the next lines (that are done if the if statement is True)should be indenteted then the  should be lined up with the if statement
First of all, your if statement needs to be fixed and you need to indent your lines like so:
Python uses colons (:) and indentation to group statements, whereas other languages use curly braces ({}) or parentheses. Therefore you need to indent the blocks of Python statements within if/else statements and for, while, and foreach statements. So your code should be:Note that Python lets you chain inequalities (e.g.  instead of ), though many other languages do not.
