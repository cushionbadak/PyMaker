I have the following code and for the sake of learning would like to see a more pythonic way of achieving this:
If you're looking for a different way, you can use this:The portion within  is a generator expression that yields each  in  for each  in  if the condition  is satisfied. The first element of this generator is what we return (see ).Although, in practice, I would generally go with what you already have. It's the simplest and clearest way to do what you are trying to do, and is by no means unpythonic.
Assuming that you actually intend to return only the first match you find (which is what your code does), there's nothing unpythonic about your code except the unnecessary parentheses in the last line, which you can replace with:Pythonic does not mean 'write a one-liner' or 'use a particular feature of Python for the sake of it'. It means, among other things, 'write your code in the most easily-understood and expressive way that you can'.See also: the Zen of Python
Your code will only return the first matching instance, but you could still use a list comprehension or better, a generator expression.
Are you OK with outputting it as a list? A list comprehension would make it more Pythonic.
Just to offer another approach using a Cartesian product.  I like this because it matches the way I would think: "check every pair of values."
