I'm trying to learn how to do python regular expressions. I want the following program to search for the string 'N\S\A' in the input string.  I read (here) that you have to make strings raw strings if you want to deal with '\' characters. But I put the r in front of the match string and it's still not working. (Whether inword is 'NSA' or 'N\S\A'...)Why isn't this working? What can I do to fix it?
You don't need regular expression.Use  operator:If you really need regular expression, you need to escape  itself, because  match non-space character ( also has special meaning):\SWhen the UNICODE flags is not specified, matches any non-whitespace  character; this is equivalent to the set [^ \t\n\r\f\v] The LOCALE  flag has no extra effect on non-whitespace match. If UNICODE is set,  then any character not marked as space in the Unicode character  properties database is matched.\AMatches only at the start of the string.from Regular expression syntax
To include a backslash as a character without any special meaning in a regular expression, you have to escape it with another backslash.In your case, you should use:Raw strings make python treat backslash as an ordinary character, but it still has a special meaning in regular expression.
