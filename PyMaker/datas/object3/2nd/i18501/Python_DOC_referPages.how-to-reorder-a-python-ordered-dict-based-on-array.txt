That's the advantage of : when iterating over it, it'll preserve the insertion order.There's no way to sort the existing dictionary in-place (well, you could extract all the key-value pairs, eliminate them and add them again in the correct order, but that's not the idea, is it?), it's necessary to create a new one ... or simply iterate over the existing dictionary in the specified order:
If you would like to use them in that order, you can do this, for example.Outputs:
