How would I create a list with values between two values I put in? For example, the following list is generated for values from 11 to 16:
Use . In Python 2.x it returns a list so all you need is:In Python 3.x  is a iterator. So, you need to convert it to a list:Note: The second number is exclusive. So, here it needs to be  = EDIT:To respond to the question about incrementing by , the easiest option would probably be to use 's ,
You seem to be looking for :For incrementing by  instead of , say:
Try:That is a list in Python 2.x and behaves mostly like a list in Python 3.x.  If you are running Python 3 and need a list that you can modify, then use: 
If you are looking for range like function which works for float type, then here is a very good article.Output:
Use list comprehension in python. Since you want 16 in the list too.. Use x2+1. Range function excludes the higher limit in the function.list=[x for x in range(x1,x2+1)]
assuming you want to have a range between x to yuse list for 3.x support
Every answer above assumes range is of positive numbers only. Here is the solution to return list of consecutive numbers where arguments can be any (positive or negative), with the possibility to set optional step value (default = 1).For instance, standard command  returns empty list , while this function will return Updated: now step may be negative. Thanks @Michael for his comment.
The most elegant way to do this is by using the  function however if you want to re-create this logic you can do something like this :This produces the output:As expressed before by @Jared, the best way is to use the  or  however I find the code interesting to be shared.
