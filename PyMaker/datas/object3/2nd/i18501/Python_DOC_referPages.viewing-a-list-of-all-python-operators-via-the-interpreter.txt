Is there a quick way to find this out via the interpreter? I tried simple things like  but no success.There's plenty of online resources to give the definitive list of available operators, but I'm looking for a quick offline method.For common operators one quickly memorizes them, but some lesser used ones often need looking up.
All standard operatorsOnly basic onesOnly numeric onesOther help subsections

Here's a start.
Use  (or  for python 3).It's like the normal python repl, but with tab complete goodness.So for example, I make the code:I'll get a menu with all of the built in functions.You can get it via the bpython websiteOr via doing a  in ubuntu. (or  for python3.Additionally, ipython has tab complete features, and is more widespread.One nice trick is to use tab completion to make guesses. You can't remember whether it's , , , or something else, right? So, first type  and hit tab:There's no  there, so backspace, type , and tab again:And there it is.
