I'm interested in testing some code that uses the 'random' module, and I'd like to be able to patch/insert my own fake version of random when my tests are running, that returns a known value, and put it back to the normal random module afterwards. From the documentation I can only see that I can patch classes. Is there a way to patch functions? Something like this:That code doesn't work, what do I need instead?
 doesn't seem to exist. You can use  itself instead:
