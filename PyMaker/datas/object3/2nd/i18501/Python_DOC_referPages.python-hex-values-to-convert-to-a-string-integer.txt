I'm looking how I can take hex values, and turn them into a string or an integer.Examples:Desired results for a and b:Thank you.
Note, that it's not nice to use  - here's an explanation why:The way you use the hex codec worked in Python 2 because you can call  encode() on 8-bit strings in Python 2, ie you can encode something  that is already encoded. That doesn't make sense. encode() is for  encoding Unicode strings into 8-bit strings, not for encoding 8-bit  strings as 8-bit strings.In Python 3 you can't call encode() on 8-bit strings anymore, so the  hex codec became pointless and was removed.Using binascii is easier and nicer, it is designed for conversions between binary and ascii, it'll work for both python 2 and 3:
Use :If you want  instead of bytes:
Using binascii.hexlify:
