Currently I do something like this:It works great, however when I leave the function I notice that both Globals and Locals don't have the  "some_function" function anymore. (I expect its the Garbage Collection)My question is, how can I append my code read from some python file to my other code?I know this is bad practice and insecure etc etc. But I want to make it in a way that I "py2exe" my main part and that my user can append Python code. He can destroy the entire app by overwriting functions and what not but I can 100% trust the user.Thanks, Stolas
... when I leave the function ...If you wrap an  call in a function, then it's executed in the functions scope. If you want it executed in a different scope, just supply the corresponding dict as argument to exec*:*edit:actually in python2 it's not an argument, it's the second element of a tuple, only in python3 it's an argument as exec has become a function instead of a statement, but for compatibility the tuple form has been introduced in python2.
