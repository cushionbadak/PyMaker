I have a System under test B that uses some A with some expensive function that I want to mock but B relies on getting multiple instances of A.http://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.patch says: "If the class is instantiated multiple times you could use side_effect to return a new mock each time." but I don't understand, how :(How would I have to change this example:which produces this output:(Without mocking the assertion succeeds but it takes 10s.)
You're mocking the wrong thing then. If say_hi is the expensive portion you want to mock away, then mock that.  Then you don't have to mess with side_effects.To explicitly answer your question of 'creating separate mock instances with side_effects', you would specify Mock as the object to be returned.
