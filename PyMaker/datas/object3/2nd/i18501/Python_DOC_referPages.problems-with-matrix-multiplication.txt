I'm having some troubles when it comes to multiplying two matrices. An AttributeError appears when I'm trying to perform the addition partI tried saving the new matrix in another instance called for example m3 but the I thought it would be better to use self instead.Here's my code:I created the instance of self in main(), before calling multiplyMatrices()
According to the , you never defined the  method in your class. This is how you can control object[key] access. I would suggest reading up on the python data model in general if you are deciding to make a more advanced class (like this one) in python. Although it is a bit strange to have the multiplication of two other matrices being stored in self. I'd probably just create a new matrix in the method and return that.
