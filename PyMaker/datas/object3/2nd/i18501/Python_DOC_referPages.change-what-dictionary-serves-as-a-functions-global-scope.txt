I want to make an  decorator for Python, part of this is being able to selectively disallow access to the global scope of the function.Is there a way to programmatically change which dictionary thing serves as a function's global/external scope?So for instance in the following I want to be able to intercept the access to  in  and throw an error, but I want to allow access to  because it's a pure function.
