I have a list of bytes as integers, which is something likeHow can I write this list to a file as binary?Would this work?
This is exactly what  is for:If you're using Python 3.x, you can use  instead (and probably ought to, as it signals your intention better). But in Python 2.x, that won't work, because  is just an alias for . As usual, showing with the interactive interpreter is easier than explaining with text, so let me just do that.Python 3.x:Python 2.x:
Use  to convert the integer values into binary bytes, then write the bytes. E.g.However I would never give a binary file a  extension.The benefit of this method is that it works for other types as well, for example if any of the values were greater than 255 you could use  for the format instead to get full 32-bit integers.
To convert from integers < 256 to binary, use the  function.  So you're looking at doing the following.
As of Python 3.2+, you can also accomplish this using the  native int method:I.e., each single call to  in this case creates a string of length 1, with its characters arranged in big-endian order (which is trivial for length-1 strings), which represents the integer value . You can also shorten the last two lines into a single one:
You can use the following code example using Python 3 syntax:Here is shell one-liner:
Use pickle, like this: import pickleYour code would look like this:To read the data back, use the pickle.load method
