I've been trying to use the tldextract library available here.After many attempts, I was able to get it installed. However, now when it comes to run the main file, the compiler says that it can't find any reference to my library. Below the code I used and that raise the exception.I appreciate this is a very basilar question and it is not totally connected with the library I'm trying to use, but I wonder if you can point me in the direction on how to "link" or make sure the compiler know that I have that library.As far as I can understand as long a library is avaialble in the site-packages folder, this should sort the problem.In my circumstance the file is at/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tldextractSo in theory this should be ok, but I get the following error when I try to use it.I hope this question doesn't make you upset for it's simplicity. I'm here to learn after all.Thanks
Based on the error code, file test.py is calling a module named 'tldexport'If that's a dependency, install it.If it's a typo intended to be tldextract, then change it :)
The docs on the Python import system are nice. You should check them out. I recommend reading the entire thing. You'll be happy you did and most of your frustration regarding imports will be resolved. Like @Dreadful_Code says either correct the typo or change it. If  is  then things should go swimmingly; same goes for  or really any Python module that you'd like to use from inside the interpreter.
