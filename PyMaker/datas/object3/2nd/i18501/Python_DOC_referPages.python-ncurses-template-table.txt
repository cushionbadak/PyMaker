I'm writing a state machine based python program that currently prints to the console the state of the machines. This is useful as a log, but not the most user friendly interface.I'm interested to know if there are good examples of using ncurses in Python, preferably something in OOP that presents changing information (eg: state information) in a table.The have already tried the  package in python, however it is not as OO as I want.This is what the stream currently looks like:Whereas a ncurses "table" rendered at the last point of the above stream would look something like:I'm seeking to do this on Python 2.7 64bit, Windows 7 64bit.
You can use the standard  module.  You can find its documentation here.
If  is not enough (for some undescribed reason), pycdk or urwid could be better suited to your needs.
.The ncurses package is not very OO but, you will definitely benefit from using an OO approach to using it. If you keep all your accesses to the ncurses package in these few classes you'll be farther along than if you pepper ncurses calls all over your existing app.If you haven't made all your fields private for some reason, you can access all the required program data right from the screen class.
