Natural Text
For a project, I need a method of creating thousands of random strings while keeping collisions low. I'm looking for them to be only 12 characters long and uppercase only. Any suggestions?
CODE:OUTPUT:5 examples:EDIT:If you need only digits, use the  constant instead of the  one from the  module.3 examples:
By , you can use  function in  module.Example:But if you don't want to have , here is independent code of it:Code:
Could make a generator:Then just pull from the generator when they're needed... Either using  when you need them, or use  for instance...
This function generates random string of UPPERCASE letters with the specified length,eg: length = 6, will generate the following random sequence patternYLNYVQ
For cryptographically strong pseudo-random bytes you might use the pyOpenSSL wrapper around OpenSSL.It provides the  function to gather a pseudo-random sequences of bytes.BTW, 12 uppercase letters is a little bit more that 56 bits of entropy. You will only to have to read 7 bytes.
