I am currently making a game, and it would make my script much more organized!An example of my current script:Then I got this error message:I am not quite sure what's wrong. I really hoped this worked, as it would make the work much easier for me. For all I know, it could just be a small typo that caused the problem.I really hope someone here can see the error!Thanks!      
Yes, but you have to define the function before you use it.
as @mipadi points out, it's easy to embed defs inside other defs:This is helpful for cleaning up the organization of long code sections. You can't call a function until after it's defined - while the above example works, this won't:To make effective use of this strategy, read up on closures as @Basile points out - they are a powerful tool in this context and also potentially a source of bugs (since you can accidentally get information from a scope you didn't intend - especially in long blocks of if-else conditions which tend to be build up by cutting and pasting :)You should definitely look into using dictionaries instead of if statements for these kinds of long if/else blocks. It's easier to build them up in code, and gets rid of a lot of repetition.
