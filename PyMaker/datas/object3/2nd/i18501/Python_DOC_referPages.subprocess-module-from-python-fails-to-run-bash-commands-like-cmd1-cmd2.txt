The following python script:it runs ok (the output is ). But when I use  module this one:is not ok. The output is  and I expect to be only . How can I correct it?I saw that in general subprocess module will fail when I'm using a bash command like:
This:… is not actually a command, it's a fragment of shell script. So you need to have the shell execute it.You can do this just by adding  to the  constructor.The documentation explains how this works. It also explains better ways to do the same thing without the shell. For example:Meanwhile, you almost never want to use  on a command line—and in fact, your example shows exactly why you don't want to:Notice that it split  into two arguments,  and .If you're using , don't try to split the arguments at all; just pass a string as your :If you're not using the shell, the right way to do this is with the  module:Notice that the  turned into  this time. That may seem odd at first glance, but it's in fact exactly what the shell would do, and what you want; the  program will get a space as its  option. (In other words, the quotes are for the shell, not for the program the shell runs.)(The  module also has a handle  function that you can use for the exact opposite purpose: building a command line from a list of arguments for .)However, it's usually better to just create an list of arguments in the first place, instead of trying to figure out how to create a string that, when run through , will give you the list you wanted.
