What is  and how to override this in a method (the way is overridden)?
 is a dictionary view object; such objects are iterators.You can return your own implementation of such an object from a  method. The specific type returned by  is not available for re-use, you'll have to implement your own from scratch.I covered creating your own in a previous answer; there are a fair number of methods to cover.
