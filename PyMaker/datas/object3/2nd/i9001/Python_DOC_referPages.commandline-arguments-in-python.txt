I'm expecting arguments in this formatcurrently, I'm parsing command line parameters by this codeis there any better way to read command line arguments. I tried using OptionParser but OptionParser requires key value pairs to be separated by space.
Here's a specific example of accumulating a list via , which I mentioned in a comment above.This is not quite as ideal, since this requires the argument name  to be given with each item you want to add to its list.An alternative would be to read in a string with commas and split them:I suppose this may be an XY problem. What is it exactly that you are attempting to accomplish by having an argument with parameters like this?After receiving further information (OP's comments), it appears that the key-value reading is vital.The Tornado project has a custom option-parsing module  which assumes values to be given on the command line as key-value pairs like you want.I would not advise you to import Tornado into your project just to get this to work. However, you can read through the  object's definition in that file I linked to see how you might implement such functionality. To simulate  using this new argument parser:Notice that  requires an extra throwaway argument at the beginning. This is because if you don't supply a value, it uses  and skips the first argument (which is generally the name of the command being executed). In your own parser, you could rewrite this line to start at  instead of  and avoid this necessity.Conveniently, Tornado's  does include the ability to specify a list through the  parameter of . You would still have to strip the resulting values of their extraneous quotation marks, but that's done simply enough.
