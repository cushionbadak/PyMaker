So where I am finding I have an issue is when trying to add items to the list. If i do something like:my code fails stating object has no attribute. Not sure why it is failing since I have almost the exact same code for another program except the find is using a sequential search where as this is a binary search.
You have multiple syntax errors in your code. Also recursion doesn't work that way, you need to have a base condition which returns. This solution will work, but I strongly suggest you to solve simpler problems using recursion to understand how it works.(there are other ways of solving binary search too - i.e. iterative approach, passing low/high index values rather than splicing the input array). Try to solve binary search using those two approaches.Binary search with passing low/high index values, your signature for binser will look like: 
Your code is failing because you misspelled . You need two underscores on each side, or it's just a weirdly named method. Since you lack a , the default  (which sets no attributes) is used, and you don't have an  or  attribute. You need to fix the , and use a consistent name for :You have many other problems here (you're not maintaining sorted order, so binary search won't work, you haven't implemented  so  won't work so you'd need , lack of  means  won't work either, etc.), but the two issues above are what specifically makes you get the .
