I am a new one in Python programming and have not been able to solve the following problem for hours. I have sample file which contains four lines. I wish to get two inputs from user by the time it is found in the file line, however my loops do not seem to iterate over all the lines.This is the content of the file, elements are separated by a space:  And this one is my code:I wish to input for example Google and Microsoft and get following output:  as two lists. However, my code only finds the first line and  not the others. Could you tell me why it does not iterate over other lines, please. How to fix this?  Thanks in advance!
Here is something that does not change the code from your attempt to drastically... It makes use of  and  to allow for various capitalization's of user input:Example Usage:Here is how you can only prompt the user for only "two terms":Example Usage:
Try the following code. This code identifies which term is found and asks the term which is not found. You are not making your loop properly. When your loop executes first time it has Google and term1 contains Google and term2 contains Microsoft. So it prints Google and after that you are stooping the execution using sys.exit(). So of course it prints the first line not the others.
