I am wondering if I have the functionif I run it like this, do I have any guarantee of the order of processing arguments? I know c++ does not guarantee an order like this.If the arguments were processed out of order, we may getororIt seems to work, however I am not sure if this is just an effect of cPython or standard of python, or neither. I cannot seem to find the documentation on this.
The  will come through in the order you sent them, this is guaranteed by the language.  Function arguments are also evaluated left to right, this is guaranteed by the language.  Python has to make some choice about this, otherwise the evaluation of one argument could mutate another argument and result in unspecified behaviour.You can rely on the behaviour you've described in the question:However, note the result below is also a valid Python output.  Though you're unlikely to see it in CPython due to some implementation detail about  and .
Unlike C and C++, Python guarantees that function arguments are evaluated left to right. You can be sure the  calls will run before the dict comprehension.6.15. Evaluation orderPython evaluates expressions from left to right. Notice that while evaluating an assignment, the right-hand side  is evaluated before the left-hand side.In the following lines, expressions will be evaluated in the  arithmetic order of their suffixes:
