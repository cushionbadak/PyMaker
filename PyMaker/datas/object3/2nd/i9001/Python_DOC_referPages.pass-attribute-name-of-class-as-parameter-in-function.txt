So I have a class like this:And I want to make a function that takes as a parameter the name of one of the attributes of my class, to make something like this (example):Obviously I can pass 'a' as a string and make some if cases:But in that case I'd have to copy the entire code inside the if's (obviously I want to do more than just assign a value). I'd like to know if there's a clever way to do that.edit:To clarify, my object has more variables:And I will access these in my functions. That's why i don't pass simply object.x or object.y. I will pass the object and the variable I will use, but there are other variables I will access.
You may want to use :
Extending what Daniel showed in his answer, you can first check if the object has the attribute or not by using , and then set the value of the attribute by using .Note: take a look at this comment, which showed the correct way to determine if an object has an attribute. What I mean is  doesn't include method names.
