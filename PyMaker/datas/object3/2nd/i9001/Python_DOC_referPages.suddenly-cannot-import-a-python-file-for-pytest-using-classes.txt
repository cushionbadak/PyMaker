I was checking a similar problem about importing python files and it seems like something to do with my  file in the main parent folder a level up from my tests folder (which contains all my test files) for importing classes, but not sure. Maybe it is nothing to do with this.I am using  for testing and want to group multiple tests into a class that helps me test the parsing of multiple sentences: http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/getting-started.html#grouping-multiple-tests-in-a-class.Now, when from another file which is in the same folder (), I try and run  I am unable to do this. Why is this so?The main issue here is this statement  within  is not even picking up the file , let alone within it.Contents of test_text.py
The file  is used to structure your modules and group them.If you place your  in the same folder where you have the script that imports it, there should not be any problems. In case your  is in a subfolder I would recommend to add the  file.This is how a package structure would look like:Inside the  you can declare vars like  which will import all submodules that you specify wen PS: I have copied your code and did not have any problem to import it from the same folder.PS2: source: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packagesPiece of code that works for me when i place prueba.py (your code snippet) in the same folder as the scripts that imports it.
