I want to interact with a process.I can start the process and print out the first two lines (something like 'process successfully started').Now I want to send a new command to the process which should return again something like 'command done' but nothing happens.Please help me.Update:same problem, no output after 'process successfully started'
Your I/O should be line buffered, so  should send a  at the end of the string. BTW, you have a couple of spelling errors. That function should be named  to conform to PEP-0008, and "successfully" has 2 c's.When using  like this it's a good idea to put it in a  statement. From the subprocess.Popen` docs:Popen objects are supported as context managers via the   statement: on exit, standard file descriptors are closed, and the  process is waited for.
