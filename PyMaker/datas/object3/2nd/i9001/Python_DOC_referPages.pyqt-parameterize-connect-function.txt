I have a set of 3 list widgets all with drag and drop capabilities.  I am looking to eliminate repeated code and am looking for some help. As you can see in my Dialog class I create 3 Image classes that are drag and drog lists.  As of right now each List Widget corresponds to a connect function. It seems to me that the function could be turned into a function where  is an argument, but I am having trouble setting that up and could use some help. Here is my code. I have only been working with Python for a few weeks so apologies if this is a simple question. 
Firstly, you are using old-style signals and slots, which are outdated and have been removed in more recent versions of PyQt. You should use the new-style mechanism if possible. Your example would become:To answer your question, in python you can use a lambda expression to add additional arguments when a slot is called.First you would define a generic handler that takes an  instance as an argument.Then the signals are connected like thisIf you are unfamiliar with lambdas, they can be a powerful tool when used like this, but beware of potential unintended behaviour due to late binding of variables. 
You can include the dropped function and its signal in your image class so you do not have to repeat this function for each class, here is an example :
