My problem looks quite simple but I can't figure out a clean (and efficient) solution.I have a list of tuples corresponding to common groups of words:And a sentence:I would like to merge the common groups of words in a single token like that:I am sure there is an elegant way to do so but I haven't been able to find any..If there were only 2-tuples, iterating on  would do it, but I have up to 8-tuples in  and this solution is not tractable!
You can build a list of replacement strings from your words in :And then, for each element in that list, use :There might be a more one-liner-y way to do it, but that seems relatively terse and easy to understand to me.
While Haldean Brown's answer is simpler, I think this is a more structured approach:Output: after sorting:That's needed to try to apply  earlier than  (or, in general, to try to apply a sequence earlier than its prefixes). Actually it's possible that non-greedy things like  are more desirable than , but that's another story.
