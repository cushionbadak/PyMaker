I'm very beginner in Python. I have problem with matrix multiplication. I read matrix from txt file using list of lists (matrices). When I want to use multiprocessing I have problem with divide list and use new lists in Pool function. How can I fix this problem?Please Helperror from comment, with an attempt to restore formatting:
I don't think you want  in this instance. what it is doing is unpacking each matrix into 61 elements as it is handed to  which only expects one argument.from the docs:starmap(func, iterable[, chunksize])Like map() except that the elements of the iterable are expected to be  iterables that are unpacked as arguments.Hence an iterable of [(1,2), (3, 4)] results in [func(1,2),  func(3,4)].you could fix this in a number of ways, but I think the most sensible is to use  instead, as it won't unpack your inputs and leave them as a single variable. you could also define  to allow a variable number of inputs that would be concatenated into the list  (which you don't use within the function, but I'll leave you to figure out what to do with it..)
In what is ?  I don't see such a function in your code.  The error message suggests it is .But in  ,  is never used.It looks like  is a list of lists of floats.  Are all the sublists the same length?  If so, why didn't you read the  file with a numpy loader like ?  But that's a side point.Does  work?  Besides the messed up calling argument, it doesn't return anything.  I'm guessing it's supposed to be doing a chained matrix product, .   for  is matrix product, not element by element (the  of ).But that won't work;  is a (1,n) matrix.  It can't multiply another (1,n) matrix, no matter how many times you wrap it in  (why do you do that several times?)What's the purpose of the multiprocessing?  What is is supposed to do that a single call to a corrected  can't do?
