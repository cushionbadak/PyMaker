How do I write a function called  that counts down starting from  and goes until 1 ? The function should return a , the contents of which should be integers going from  down to 1.
Since you want to return a , you need to create that list in the function. creates your sequence from n to 0 (non-inclusive, which means it'll stop at 1), with a step of -1 each time. then converts the sequence into the list that you want returned.This also means that you don't actually have to create a specific function for a countdown list. You can just directly call . 
Using recursion:This approach provides the "base case" and creation of a list of integers once the base is reached.Check out this link to visualize the execution. Do let me know if you have any questions.
