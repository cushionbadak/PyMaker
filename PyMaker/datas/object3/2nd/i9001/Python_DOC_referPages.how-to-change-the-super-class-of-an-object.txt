I have a class containing methods and a constructor in Python. The return value of the constructor will be an object, but I need a return value of a class (constructor) such as  type. Is it possible to change the return value of class by adding  as super class of this class, and if so, could someone describe how to do it?Now I want  to return  value whenever we call constructor of .
I'm not sure what you're trying to accomplish by doing this, nor what you expect to happen as a result. However, since  is an  (abstract base class), it means you can make your own class be considered one of its subclasses simply by registering it with the . (There's no need to override  as I first thought because I didn't realize that  was an .) Here's what I mean:
Perhaps you have to inherit from int type:
This can be done through standard class inheritance.It should be noted that all classes of the numbers module are Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) and cannot be instantiated.  They are similar to interfaces in other languages (like Java) and are implemented in corresponding types, e.g.  implements .By using  as the base class, you will have all of the operations from that class in , but if you instantiate it with a value like  you will get .
