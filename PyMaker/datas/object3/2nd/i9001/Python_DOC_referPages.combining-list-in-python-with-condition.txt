I have two lists as shown below:I would like to combine a list with the condition that will take the max num for each user so finally I will get this listany suggestions?TNX
You can use  to pair the lists up, then group pairs by user and from each group pick the one with max value:In above  returns iterable of  tuples:Then  is used to group the items based on the first item in each tuple:Finally  with  function is used to pick the pair with maximum value. Note that the items on  are strings so they need to be converted to numbers so that we pick  instead of :
If order matters, you can use an , otherwise, a normal  will do. But basically, use one pass to make a mapping from user to num, keeping the larger value each time. Then, another pass to get the data-structure you want.
The sorting that you require needs numbers not strings. A different result is returned when sorting the numbers as strings.So I would convert to numbers, sort and get the max and finally switch back to strings.if you explicitly require a list of lists as the output you can add a list comprehension on top like so:
