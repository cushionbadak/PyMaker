This question already has an answer here:How to test multiple variables against a value?                    21 answers                I was making a short program just for fun that when my name is inputted, it will say 'hi programmer'. That worked but the other conditions with elif and else did not work, instead they only printed out the if condition. `a =input('What is your name')I was looking through StackOverflow but couldn't find the answer I was looking for. I also looked at other websites but they never seemed to really help. The output of my if statement should print out 'hi programmer!' and it does. However, When I checked my elif and else condition, it still outputted 'hi programmer' when the output for the elif condition should have been 'Big fat boi' and the output for the else statement should have been "(a), i'm sorry to say this but you suck!!!" I'm sorry if I haven't specified anything, this is my first question.
The correct syntax for this example is:The way you written it at first is wrong. The statement:return True when  is equal to 'Hasan' and return 'hasan' in all other case. Basically, the first if branch is always used, because 'hasan' is evaluated to True by Python interpreter.There is some resources on the Internet and StackOverflow to understand what happen in this case. For example, read answer for this question: Python boolean expression and or
When you doit checks:orSince  is not an empty string, it'll always return . (See Truth value testing on Python docs for more objects with Boolean values.)This leads to the code always returning  on your first  statement.In order for your code to work as you intended, you want to checkYou could also check against the lowercase of your input like so
You need to change your  statements :This is because  always evaluates to be true.
