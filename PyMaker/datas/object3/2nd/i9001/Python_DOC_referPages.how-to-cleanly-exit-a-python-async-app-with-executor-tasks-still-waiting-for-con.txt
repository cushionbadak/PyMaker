I'm trying to add a console input listener to an async app, and I've hit an interesting problem.The following code doesn't terminate when it should, and instead continues waiting for input after the script has terminated:I've looked into other methods for getting input asynchronously, such as using add_reader() on sys.stdin, but this doesn't work on Windows, and I need my solution to be platform independent.Does anyone know either a better way to get console input asynchronously that will gracefully halt when the app halts, or a way to fix my existing code so that it cleanly exits?
A possible workaround is to disable the exit function for threads in concurrent.futures:Also, aioconsole provides a cross-platform function for handling console input in asyncio:
Although Vincent's answer above does solve your problem, I would like to suggest trying not to use  when building  programs.Instead, use a socket (or a signal) to supply input to your coroutines.i.e., instead of:Do:
