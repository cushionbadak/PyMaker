As a follow up to this question, I have an expression such as this: which was created by using  method, however within this list of strings, there are two errors. One is the '+(' and the other is the '))'.Is there a pythonic way that I could split just the operators such that the list would be something like . (keep the digits/letters together, separate the symbols)Thanks
Short solution using str.join() and re.split() functions:The output:
An alternative would be to change the regex in order to keep the non-alphanumeric characters separate :
You want to split characters of grouped non-alphanumerical characters.I would create a 1-list item if the item is ok (alphanumerical) or a list of characters if the item is a sequence of symbols.Then, I'd flatten the list to get what you asked forresult:EDIT: actually you could link your 2 questions into one answer (adapting the regex answer of the original question) by not grouping symbols in the regex:(note the lack of  after ) and you get directly:
Try this:May be it helps to others.
