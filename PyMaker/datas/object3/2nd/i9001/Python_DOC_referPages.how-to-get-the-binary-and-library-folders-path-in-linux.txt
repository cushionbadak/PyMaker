Let's say that I am writing a Python program on Linux. And I want to run a binary manually-installed command called "foo" using its path. Usually this is in . But on some distributions it's . Some other distributions may change it too.So my question is how to get something like  or  which would instantly give me whether it is "/usr/bin" or "/usr/local/bin/" or something else (PATH gives a lot of paths, I am looking for a single output option if it's there)? Also for libraries folder. How to know if it was  or something else? In Python for sure.
In general, you cannot. If you want to find a particular binary, your best bet is going to be searching the PATH variable. There is some code on activestate that does what you want.
