Small question: Why doesn't this piece of code work when I use  but does when I use ? can only take one input? Is there a way to make it take multiple inputs as concise as using eval? Int is a stronger condition so that's why I am curious about how it would work.This gives , but the following code does work.
 takes one input and possibly a base:But you can use  along with : 
Use list comprehension:
Python is trying to parse the whole string as one integer rather than three.What you could do is:This way you are splitting the list into three strings, and then converting (mapping) each string to an int.
 can only take one input?Yes, and that is technically true for , too. It's just that  might return something other than an . In your case, I'm assuming you enter something like  on the  prompt.  simply parses that as a tuple, which it returns, and unpacks into your three variables.You can, however, easily achieve something similar to what you want using list comprehension:This has the added benefit that you don't risk having some completely unexpected type returned from .One caveat with using  that should perhaps be worth noting is that it accepts any valid Python syntax and executes the parsed result, which may include arbitrary function calls, including code to erase your hard drive. Not much of a problem when you're just writing a program for yourself to use, but just so that you know.
