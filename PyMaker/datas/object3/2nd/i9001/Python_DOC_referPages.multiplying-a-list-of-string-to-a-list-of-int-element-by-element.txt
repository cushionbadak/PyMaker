I have a a list of ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'] and [1, 2, 3, 4], both list will always have the same number of items. I need to multiply each string by its number, so the final product I am looking for is:['A', 'B', 'B', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'D', 'D', 'D', 'D']. Any help would be appreciated, thanks. 
Nested list comprehension works too:In above  returns  tuples:Then for every tuple the second  loop is executed  times to add the character to the result:
I would use  for a nice, efficient implementation:I also think it is quite readable.
The code is pretty straight forward, see inline commentsOUTPUT 
You use  to do it like this way:Output:Or you can do it, too, using  and :Output:
