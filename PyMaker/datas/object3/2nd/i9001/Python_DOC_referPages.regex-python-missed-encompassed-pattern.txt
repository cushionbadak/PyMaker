I have tried to research answers to this question online, but nothing seems to describe the problem I have here. If I missed something, please close the question and redirect it to where it has already been answered. That being said, my python regex doesn't seem to want to recognize a pattern if it is already encompassed in another captured pattern. I tried to run the code and here are the results:I don't understand why it didn't yield this output:Thanks!
Return all non-overlapping matches of pattern in string, as a list of strings. The string is scanned left-to-right, and matches are returned in the order found. If one or more groups are present in the pattern, return a list of groups; this will be a list of tuples if the pattern has more than one group. Empty matches are included in the result unless they touch the beginning of another match.https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.findallIf you're not just trying to understand why, but actually need to get overlapping matches, you can use lookahead with a capturing group as described in this question's answers.
This is in fact possible, using a lookahead assertion.will match at any position directly followed by pattern without consuming the string, and will capture the group that matched.
