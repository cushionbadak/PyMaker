I have written the code for quick sort in python, but this code is throwing an error.The error it is throwing is Enter the value n 4Enter the 4 no. of elements [5,6,2,7]        Traceback (most recent call last):        File "C:\Users\devendrabhat\Documents\dev\dev\quick.py", line 38, in             brr=quicksort(arr,0,n-1)        TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'int'
n is string. So you need to change it to int:If you input [5,6,2,7] on line 37, python interpret it as string like "[5,6,2,7]".So, you need to convert string to list.
You need to change n to an integer, not a string.  Your error is telling you, that you are trying to perform an operation (- in this case) on a string and an integer. Change  to  so you have the same type throughout.
you are declaring 'n' as string there in your code. And trying to perform arithmetic operation with string.So it is giving that error. Change this  to .It will work !!!
