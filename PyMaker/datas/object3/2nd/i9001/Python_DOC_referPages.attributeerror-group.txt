I have written python code for MapReduce Job where CreationDate="2010-07-28T19:04:21.300". I have to find all the dates where creation date is at or after 2014-01-01. But I have encountered an error.
 is just a regex. You need to match your input string before you can call 
Regular expression object (the result of ) does not have  method:To get a match object (which has a  method), you need to match the pattern against the string () using  method (or  method depending on your need):NOTE: modifed the regular express to capture the numeric part as a group. and convert the matched string to int (comparing string with the number 2013 has no meaning, or raise exception depending on Python version)
