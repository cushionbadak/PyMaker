I have a list I want to run a block of code on, but the list is a couple thousand items long, and it takes way too long to iterate over them.Is there a way I could have my script run a check on every item in that list simultaneously?My code looks like this:
Consider the multiprocessing or threading libraries
If you really really want to do it simultaneously you can use threads. Here is a website about threading: https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/threading.htmlBut I am sure there is a simpler way. Threading is like doing a little bit of everything over and over until everything is done and it is really complex. I think you could just try to speed up your code. If you are using IDLE it will always be slow and the time you get isn't actually correct. It can actually go way faster.I hope this helps.
