I'm trying to split a list into two lists. Here's the list:L = [3.5, 1 ,7, 2 ,4.5, 1, 6, 2, 4.8, 2  ,3.1,1, 9, 2]If I want to split the list based on the bold number (1 or 2), which are always the even number (2x) in the position, so the numbers before 1 go to one list, and the numbers before 2 go to another list:Also, the question may be extend when there are  bold number and thus needs to be split to  list.How should I use - statements for list?
Do that using ternary in a step 2 loop which dispatches the previous element in the relevant list (I took a shortcut: if value is , it's  else it's , so it's rather fragile):yields:General case: create a list of lists according to the maximum index, and dispatch the value according to the index in a loop ( is the 0-starting index and  is the value to insert)result:more "pythonic" for the last part using  instead of playing with indexes:
You can use a dictionary to hold the new lists, using the category number as the dictionary key. We use a defaultdict to simplify creating the lists in the dictionary.outputThis code copes with any number of categories.As Jean-Fran√ßois Fabre mentions in the comments there's a slightly more efficient way to do the printing in sorted order.outputThe heart of this algorithm is creates an iterator object from the list. We then pass two copies of that iterator to . Looping over  yields tuples containing the successive items from each of the arguments you feed it. In other words, if you do  you get the first elements of each of , , , then you get their 2nd elements, etc.  But here we've passed  two references to the  iterator. So when  reads the next items from each of the two s its really working its way through the pairs of items in . Thus on each loop of the  loop we get successive pairs of items from . 
not the cleanest attempt, but here you go
