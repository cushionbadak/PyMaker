I  think it is called a shell. the window that one writes and runs python in.I have installed python 2.7.135;   it runs from command line, but will not open when clicking on the python gear icon in dolphin.   Am I  missing something?when I  installed in on win7, it opened a shell that i could program, save,  and run.  In kubuntu 14.xx I can only open it  in command line.
I think you should add more context and clarity to the question.From what I understand, Python, in Windows environment, comes bundled with the IDLE - a window to write programs and run and another one to see the execution results. https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.htmlYou may install a Python IDE (PyCharm, Sublime), etc. or just use the bare-bone python shell. If the linux machine is local, then you may also run IDLE itself.
you have to run it via comandline.run cmd dir to directory and than type in python type in not clicking
