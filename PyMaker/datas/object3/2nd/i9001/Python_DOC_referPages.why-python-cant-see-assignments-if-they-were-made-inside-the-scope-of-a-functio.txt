Here's my code:I define them initially like this (I know it's a bit java-ish, but anyway), because when I press ESCAPE, I want to reset the whole game to its initial values:It's pathetic to copy and paste the whole thing. Running like this, Python gives me the error:That's because Python just can't see the assignment inside the function.If I make the assignments in global scope, it works. Why Python can't see the assignments even if I "declared" as None and called the function with the assignments afterwards? (I know this is c/c++/java-ish thinking, but it makes sense nonetheless).
It isn't that "Python can't see assignments", but simply that you didn't declare your names as global.https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#python-scopes-and-namespaceshttps://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#globalChange your function to look like this and try it:PS.  Using global variables is very poor design.  I recommend using a different approach to organizing your program's data and code.
Any assignment in a local scope, is considered a local variable, you need to get it from the global scope
If you don't send variables to the function it will try to create it locally, so to allow the access it must be declared globally inside the function. Example:
