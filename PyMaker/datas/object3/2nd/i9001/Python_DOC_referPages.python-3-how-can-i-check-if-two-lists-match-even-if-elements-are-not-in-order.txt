I have two lists:Other than using sort and then list in list, how can I compare the original_list values are in new_list?
You want to sort each  in , not  itself. Try this for instance using :or if you only care for the existence of the same elements regardless of their count:
supposing your original list is already sorted (if not, just apply ), you have to compare each element - sorted - using a loop or :prints  if a sub-list of  has the same elements as That avoids to rebuild the original list using  to get sorted items, since order may be important after all.
Besides  which has  runtime behaviour (worst case I think) you can use  (almost guaranteed  runtime behaviour):That uses the fact that Counter compare both keys and values and therefore are only equal if the dictionaries (inside the ) are identicalIf you can exclude duplicates then instead of  you can also use s.
