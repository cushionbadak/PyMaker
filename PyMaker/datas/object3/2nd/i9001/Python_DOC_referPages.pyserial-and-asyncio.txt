Trying to use pyserial with asyncio on a windows machine.Inspired by https://stackoverflow.com/a/27927704/1629704 my code is constantly watching a serial port for incoming data.After serial data has been returned. the coroutine  is called inside the while loop creating a new executor. I always learned creating a new thread is expensive so I feel I should take another approach, but I am not sure how to do that.I've been reading this article https://hackernoon.com/threaded-asynchronous-magic-and-how-to-wield-it-bba9ed602c32#.964j4a5s7And I guess I need to do the reading of the serial port in another thread. But how to get the serial data back to the "main" loop ?
You can either use the default executor and lock the access to  with an asyncio lock:Or simply create your own executor once:
