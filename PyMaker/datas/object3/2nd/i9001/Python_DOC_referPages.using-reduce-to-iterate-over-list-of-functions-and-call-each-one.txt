Currently i'm using a list of strings with names of functions to fix the flow of my software:Then i iterate over the flow and call each one passing the options:I would like to know if is it possible to do the same, but avoiding side effects, using reduce. Currently, this approach it's making the functions receive the option, but isn't necessary return the options for the next function, so i'm changing the options that is declared in other scope.Thanks.
You can use  (which is sometimes called  in other functional programming languages like Haskell) to indeed call the function.In that case however you will need to define a function taking two parameters: the old accumulator value and the element itself. You simply ignore the old value and call the function on the element.So for a generic function , you can do this with:So in your case that would be:EDIT:after rereading your question, it appears to me that each of the functions takes as input , and generates the "new" options that should be passed to the next function. Well the return of the first function, is the first parameter of the  of the next function. So you can fold it together like:This will result in something equivalent to:but of course this happens inside the .
so reduce takes one a function, say , that takes on 2 arguments. When it goes through a list it takes the first two items as the params of  for the first call, then on each subsequent call, uses the return value as the first param, and the next value on the list as the second param. This means, for you,  needs to be the followingand your list needs to be the following:Now, I used a list of functions and didn't use import. In stead of , you could pass in  as a string (call the param something like ), and do some splitting and inside of  as some set up.
