When I am doing a while loop, I want my code to go through the same file multiple times:My code is different, so I have given a simpler piece of code as an example. Whenever I do this, the while loop executes, goes through the file once, and then goes through the while loop till it stops, only going through the file once.How do I get my code to run through the file multiple times? The reason for this is because in my actual code I edit he text file in each loop. Please can someone help? 
You can only iterate iterator  once, then it will not yield any more. You can use  read the file each time you run through the while loop
File objects in Python are iterators, once you read until EOF once, the iterator gets exhausted.You could read the file into a list, so you can iterate on it as many times as is required:
You can use  to set a file pointer back to the beginning:
