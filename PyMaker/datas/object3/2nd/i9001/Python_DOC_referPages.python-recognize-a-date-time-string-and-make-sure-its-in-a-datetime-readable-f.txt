I have a script that reads emails and pulls out date times from the body. which was working fine until it received an email with the datetime format as per below:There was no space between the 22nd and February, hence when the function run to get the times out of the body i got the errorMy current function is as per the below, can anyone think of a way of validating it/making sure there are spaces where there needs to be? given that there could be a space issue anywhere in the string and that the dates will obviously change as more emails come in?Thankssample body:
This is more of a regular expression problem. The part you're catching the exception, make sure you reformat the incorrect data using:This should get the right date every time in the array. This is however limited to the specific problem which you are referring to i.e. No space between the day of the month and the month itself.
