I am trying to add the values of a dictionary of the same key(s). In my example below, I strip off the version numbering for each keys while trying to add the values of the 'same' key.My expected output should be:but instead I got the following if I tried printing :But the moment I tried to strip off, it seems that  is read once. How can I make it read 'twice' so that I can get  as the output for it?
You can use a  to group and sum the result by a desired part of a key which you can get with, for example, a regular expression. Something along these lines:You can approach extracting the desired part of a key differently - with the :Or, simply via slicing, if the length of the substring before the digits or the number of digits at the end of the string is constant:Or, by right-stripping the digits:
You could iterate the original dictionary and append to the new dictionary the new keys, if the key already exists, add the current value to the original value.
You can use  to collect all the similar keys and then construct a new dictionary summing up all the group values, e.g.:@alecxe describes several methods to getting the desired part of the key, above uses .There was a request to get both the  and , which you could implement in a simple loop and manage a counter but here's one way of doing it:
