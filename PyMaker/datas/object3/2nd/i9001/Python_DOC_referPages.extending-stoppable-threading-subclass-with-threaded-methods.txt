I'm trying to create a subclass of threading.Thread whose methods are threaded. I'm using it for video, but I suspect that a working example will be generally useful for folks.I realized here that I never instantiated a thread and never called the  method, but I don't know where to call it from or how. I also want to save the thread handle so I can stop it if I receive a  signal.The class works as far as it goes, but of course, none of the methods are actually threaded. is public so I can start a threaded sequence of videos like this:Or when I instantiate the class like this:Later, if I need to stop it, I can:What am I missing?
You should rename the  method to  and delete the  parameter (use  instead). Also, delete those two last lines in  method. I mean:Then, to use your class just do:And you can stop it using:Note that when you call , it invokes the  method in a separate thread of control, check the official documentation for more information.
