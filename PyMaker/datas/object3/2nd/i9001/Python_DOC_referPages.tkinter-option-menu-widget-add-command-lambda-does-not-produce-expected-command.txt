I am trying to create a window that has an optionmenu that is populated based on a fileselection dialog. I am able to make the optionmenu contain all options based on a previously selected file. However, no matter what option is selected by the user, the variable contains the last option that was read from the selected file.I would love if someone can explain me why this happens. Therefore, I have included a minimal example below:This code will show  on the optionmenu, regardless of what the user has selected, while the  in the code produces the expected ,  and . I would understand if the  also showed 3 times  but the mismatch of what is printed and what is shown in the GUI is throwing me off.
I have fixed the issue of the lambda in a for loop (thanks to @j_4321) by adding an intermediate function as shown in the below code.Please comment if this is not the 'correct' way of addressing this issue.
