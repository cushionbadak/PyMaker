Desired output Desired outputvariant Can't seem to find what's wrong with this bit of python code:I am trying to space the variables: , , and  based on input from the user (). The (var_range//3) acts as customized spacing. I want the output to vary depending on the range by the userP.S. I am using Python 3.4.4
Use newer style string formatting:Since your pattern is the same for each, create the formatting for one field and repeat it 3 times.
I not exactly sure what output you're attempting to produce, but this example might help:Output:This format string requires 3 pairs of values for a total of 6 in the tuple that follows it. The first value of each pair is the field width ( in all three cases), and the second value is the numeric value to display (which is also the same in very case because you've repeated  three times as well).I also changed the formatting for each value from  to  so the value display is right-justify instead of left-justified with the width. See the string formatting documentation for details.
