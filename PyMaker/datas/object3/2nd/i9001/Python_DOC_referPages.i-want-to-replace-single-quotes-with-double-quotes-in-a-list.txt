Natural Text
So I am making a program that takes a text file, breaks it into words, then writes the list to a new text file.The issue I am having is I need the strings in the list to be with double quotes not single quotes.For exampleI get this  when I want this Here is my codeI am new to python and haven't found anything about this.Anyone know how to solve this?[Edit: I forgot to mention that i was using the output in an arduino project that required the list to have double quotes.]
You cannot change how  works for .How about using JSON format which use  for strings.
Most likely you'll want to just replace the single quotes with double quotes in your output by replacing them:You could also extend Python's  type and wrap your strings with the new type changing the  method to use double quotes instead of single. It's better to be simpler and more explicit with the code above, though.
In Python, double quote and single quote are the same. There's no different between them. And there's no point to replace a single quote with a double quote and vice versa:2.4.1. String and Bytes literals...In plain English: Both types of literals can be enclosed in matching single quotes (') or double quotes ("). They can also be enclosed in matching groups of three single or double quotes (these are generally referred to as triple-quoted strings). The backslash () character is used to escape characters that otherwise have a special meaning, such as newline, backslash itself, or the quote character..."The issue I am having is I need the strings in the list to be with double quotes not single quotes." - Then you need to make your program accept single quotes, not trying to replace single quotes with double quotes.
