This question already has an answer here:How to find most common elements of a list?                    9 answers                I have a list such as this:I would like to find all the elements which occur most frequently.So I would like:1, 3, and 5 would occur the most, which is 4 times. What's a fast, pythonic way to do this? I tried methods shown here:How to find most common elements of a list?. But it only gives me the top 3, I need all elements. Thank you.
With  and a list comprehension:    You can generalize for values with highest count by using  on the counter values:For large iterables, to efficiently iterate through the counter and stop once the required items have been taken, you can use  with  without any parameters:You gain by not having to iterate through all the items in the counter object, although there is some overhead with having to sort the items using ; so I'm sure if this absolutely efficient after all. You could do some experiments with timeit.
You can also get the same result with  from  module and  in this way:Output:
You can do the following if you like to print all the most frequent,Please note, if you want to limit, you can enter the number inside  function. Ex: . Hope this answers your question.
