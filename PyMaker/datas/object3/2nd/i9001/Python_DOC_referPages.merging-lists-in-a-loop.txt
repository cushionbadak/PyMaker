I iterate through a list of dictionaries ,in which a particular maps to a list.  How do I merge the lists corresponding to the 'ccy' key,while looping through the list of dictionaries?Expected output:  Preferrably a one-liner solution.
You could use a nested comprehension:The  method ensures an empty list is returned in the case a dictionary has no key  (courtesy @tobias_k)
You want to iterate over a bunch of things, and "accumulate" an answer?This sounds like a job for sum, a Python built-in!
