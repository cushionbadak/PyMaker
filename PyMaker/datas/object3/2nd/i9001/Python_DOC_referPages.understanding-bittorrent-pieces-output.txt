Natural Text
After using https://github.com/utdemir/bencoder to extract the metainfo from a single file torrent I am seeing the following text under the "pieces" section of the output-And after looking at https://wiki.theory.org/BitTorrentSpecification I am under the understanding that this output is-[a] string consisting of the concatenation of all 20-byte SHA1 hash values, one per piece (byte string, i.e. not urlencoded)However I am seeing the constant backslashes "\" and am wondering if this is something like hexadecimal codes since SHA-1 commonly outputs to hexadecimal?
The output you see from the program is encoded as a Python bytesliteral,were non printable bytes and ASCII is escaped.   => hexadecimal 0x8F => ASCII "1g" => hexadecimal 0xDB1E17 => Escape Sequence meaning ASCII Linefeed (LF)  (hexadecimal 0x0A) => ASCII "(" => hexadecimal 0xF9BBB0etc.
