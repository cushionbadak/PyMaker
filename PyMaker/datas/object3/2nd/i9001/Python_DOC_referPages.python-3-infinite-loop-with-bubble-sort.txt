I have a problem where I had to sort  a list of numbers, which I did fine. But then I am to put into a list the 5 highest numbers in the list, and I have to note that there are repetitive numbers. However, when I try to do this, nothing prints. If I try to print "count", there is just an infinite number of increasing numbers printed. What am I doing wrong? #this is where my problem is 
The problem is that your  variable passes 5 on the first time through the  loop, so  is never equal to 5 when the while loop checks its condition.  To fix this, you need to move the check inside the inner loop like so:
Instead of counting, I suggest to simply use sets and then use slicing to get the desired numbers in the list.Also, I suggest to not use  as a variable name as it's a default function to convert to type . Here I'm using the variable  instead.
You can use a set to only get unique elements in a list, since the list is sorted you can get the 5 highest numbers like so:Try it here!Other general tips: Use snake_case in python rather than camelCase
