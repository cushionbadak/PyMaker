Natural Text
I have some code in Python 3 that looks like this:So the idea is to find the indices of all occurrences of a character in a string.The problem is that  could be anything, so if it's something normal like  or , then everything is fine.But if it starts with a regular expression control character then you have a problem.  For example, if you have , then  is , and  will return an error since  is an invalid regex.In my scenario I'm always searching for a character literal.  So is there a way to ensure that  is escaped (i.e. ) if and only if it needs to be?
Do a plain string search. If you want to count occurrences of a substring,  instances provide the   method for that.
Niemmi's comment was the answer I needed.  Looks like re.escape is the answer.
