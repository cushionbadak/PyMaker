This question already has an answer here:Call a function from another file in Python                    13 answers                I'm new to Python, coming from Matlab like many. I'm used to defining my functions as standalone .m files and calling them easily from a second script as long as the function is saved somewhere within the defined Matlab path. I've learned how to define a (user-defined) function in Python (def my_function() etc.), but I'm coming up short in my Google searches on a way to define the function in a a separate .py file A, and how to call it in another script B. All help files I can find give support on how to define the function within the same script. When I try calling the function (which I've defined as a .py file in the same folder I'm using for script A) my script doesn't recognize it. Do I need to be declaring the function at the beginning of my script? I'm getting the sense that Python is very different in the way it handles these things than Matlab--perhaps I can't do this?Cheers
You have to use importsfor example, you have the function doSomething() in functions.py and want to work in main.pyin main.py
