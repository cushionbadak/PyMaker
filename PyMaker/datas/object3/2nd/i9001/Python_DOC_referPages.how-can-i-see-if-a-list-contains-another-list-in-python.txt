How would I check to see if a list contains other lists? I need it so that would output , while something likewould output .
If you also want to find subclasses of lists then you should use : stops as soon as the condition is  so this only needs to check only as many items as necessary.The  is a generator expression that works similar to a -loop or a list-comprehension. It could also be written as (longer and slightly slower but maybe that's better to comprehend):
You can use this method if your list does not contain some string with '[' int it .In python 2.7 we have a module for this work:( I don't know about any such module in python 3.x )
Here's a neat solution using a list comprehension.Given , we'll first use a list comprehension to get a list of types in :Now, we simply check if  is in the list of types we created. Let's revisit our list comprehension and turn it into a boolean expression:There, that's nice and short. So does it work?
