I want to multiply an element of a list with all other elements.For example:I have done thisbut this gives me  etc. I don't want the , ,  bit in there.
you could check for equality
 is your friend here:I made it a generator function, because frankly, almost any function that's just slowly building a list element by element and returning it should really be a generator function (if the caller wants a list, they just do ), making it easier to use iteratively without blowing main memory when many arguments are passed.Example usage:Which outputs:
So if the values are  you want all and only these products:This means taking all combinations of  and then multiplying them togther with . The  module has a combinations function, and reduce can be used in conjunction with operator.mul to do the calculation:Output:
Does your list have duplicate elements, like ?If it does not, here is a one liner:First, with tags to illustrate the pattern:And here, with numbers:or the sum of the products, if you wish:If the list has duplicates, it gets more complicated.  Do you want the first occurrence and the second occurrence of  in  to be separately calculated (you might need that for some purposes even though you will get the same value for both)?
