Natural Text
I am using this code, which I picked up from the 'net somewhere, to split a line of text into "words":   However, I just noticed that it is not behaving well with multiple internal spaces (or tabs).gives2 words  A B3 words  A  B4 words  A   BWhat's the best way to collapse multiple delimiters (spaces in this case) which are internal to the string?  I really only want to do it for the first X "words", as everything beyond word 5 is free format text, where I suppose I ought not to collapse multiple spaces.  But that would be "nice to have", not "must have".
By adding a  to , you should be able to get what you want.
