Basically I want something that was asked in All combinations of a list of lists,but using ONLY  or/and  loops. In the other words, without the use of  nor recursion.I know many similar questions have been asked before, but unfortunately I could not find a desired answer. I have looked for some solutions which make use of both loops and recursions, but when I attempted to translate them into only loops, I found out it did not work for me. I have thought of putting  loop inside a  loop but then it works differently than using recursion, because the entire  loop finishes before another  loop starts.I have stuck for hours, any help/hint is greatly appreciated. I am using Python 3 though!
Well, if you are asking for an implementation of  using only for-loops, you'll find exactly that in the documentation.
