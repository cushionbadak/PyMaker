In Haskell we have asynchronous exceptions; we can use  to raise any exception in another thread: raises an arbitrary exception in the target thread (GHC only).To be able to write code with guarantees like "will always release a lock after acquiring it", we have  to run code in which asynchronous exceptions may only be received while the computation is blocking:Executes an IO computation with asynchronous exceptions masked. That is, any thread which attempts to raise an exception in the current thread with  will be blocked until asynchronous exceptions are unmasked again.and a stronger  in which async exceptions will not be raised at all during a masked computation:Like , but the masked computation is not interruptibleMasking is used to implement higher-level abstractions like :When you want to acquire a resource, do some work with it, and then release the resource, it is a good idea to use , because  will install the necessary exception handler to release the resource in the event that an exception is raised during the computation. If an exception is raised, then  will re-raise the exception (after performing the release).If I understand correctly, Python has a (less general) form of asynchronous exceptions, with the most notable manifestation being :Raised when the user hits the interrupt key (normally Control-C or Delete). During execution, a check for interrupts is made regularly.The documentation is imprecise about when the "check for interrupts" may occur, but it seems to imply that a  may be raised at any point in a program's execution. So it seems, then, that Python's async exceptions come with all the same subtle difficulties of maintaining correctness.For example, consider a pattern like this:If any exception is raised during , then we are assured that the contents of the  block will be executed. But what happens if a  is during ?It seems fundamentally impossible to guarantee resource cleanup in the presence of asyc exceptions without a way to mask them. Is there some facility for this, or do we rely on the ostrich algorithm?
This is what context managers are for. returns an object whose type defines an  method, which returns the value bound to , and an  method, which is executed at the end of the  statement regardless of how the statement is exited.
