I've been trying to write an elegant [y/n] prompt for scripts that I'll be running over command line. I came across this:http://mattoc.com/python-yes-no-prompt-cli.htmlThis is the program I wrote up to test it (it really just involved changing raw_input to input as I'm using Python3):However, whenever I try to run the code I get the following error:Changing "from distutils import strtobool" to "import distutils" doesn't help, as a NameError is raised:How do I go about solving this problem?
The first error message:is telling you that there's no publically visible  function in the  module you've imported.This is because it's moved in python3: use  instead.https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/apiref.html#distutils.util.strtoboolThe second error message deeply confuses me -- it seems to imply that the  you input is trying to be interpretted as code (and therefore complains that it doesn't know about any  variable. I can't quite see how that'd happen!
