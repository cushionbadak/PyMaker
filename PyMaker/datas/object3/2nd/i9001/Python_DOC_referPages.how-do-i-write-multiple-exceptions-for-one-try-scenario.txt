Is there a better way to write these exceptions instead of putting one exception into the other? In this case it works fine, but if I needed to add more exceptions, things might get very messy. 
One  can have multiple s.
Another variation is to use  to restart your loop in exceptional situations.  This would preclude the need for  clauses:The disadvantage of this approach is it is more verbose than Kevin's answer.  The advantage is that each  deals with only one type of thing that can go wrong, so it can make your code easier to think about.
You can provide each handler underneath the next if you don't mind writing multiple except clauses or if you need specific handling of each case.If you can provide a single error message and want to trim down as much as possible, you could always provide a tuple to  to catch many classes:if an exception that is an instance of one of the classes specified in the tuple is raised, it'll get caught and assigned to  if that is wanted.
If you want to except 2 cases as 1 you can do as Jim suggested.I personally prefer this solution:
