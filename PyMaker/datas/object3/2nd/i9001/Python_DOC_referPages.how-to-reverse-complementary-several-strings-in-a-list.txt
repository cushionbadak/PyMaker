How can I get the complementary reverse for dna? following formula works for first string but when I add the second string in the list it does not work. 
If you pass a  to , it will reverse andtranslate the characters, which is what you want.If you pass a  of  objects, as you’re doing here, it willreverse the , then try to look up each  in the , andthat will fail.How to fix it? That depends on whether you want to pass single DNAsequences or lists of them. The former seems more generic, so I’ll gowith that. already works with strings, so that’s unchanged.We need to call it differently:Edit: how to print results as a list.With a loop:With a list comprehension:
You need to perform the translation on each of your strings seperatly (and not the list itself), this can be done with a loop or with  or an explicit list-comprehension, for example:However when you want to map characters to other characters it's generally better to use  and :The  is another (also more efficient) way of reversing a string.
