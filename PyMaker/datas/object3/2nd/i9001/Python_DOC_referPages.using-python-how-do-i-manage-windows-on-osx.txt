I am trying to manage windows using python.Specifically I am trying to find a window that I have opened using selenium then have it focused and maximise it. I believe this is possible using a window manager as there are programs like qtile written in python.I have read on the python documentation that there is something called pythonw.https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.htmlI am using python 3.5 but I can upgrade if this is an easier option.How do I use this on OSX?Is there a library or are there any more resources on this subject?I would like to learn how to use simple window management in python for osx.Any help is appreciated.
You need a system level window manager for this
