I have a list of strings as the following one:I would like to cluster those strings by similarity. As you may note, , and  share the same root: . I would like to produce a new list of lists that looks like this:What would be a way to do so?. So far I have not succeeded and I don't have any decent code to show. I was trying comparing strings with  but doing so requires creating possible combinations of strings and that scales badly with list's length. 
You can use  to group the strings by key generated with : returns an iterable of tuples  where  is a key used for grouping and  is iterable of items in the group. First parameter given to  is the iterable to produce groups from and optional second parameter is a key function that is called to produce a key. Since  only groups the consecutive elements  needs to be sorted first.
