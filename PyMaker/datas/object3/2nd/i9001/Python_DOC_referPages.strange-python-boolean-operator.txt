I saw some variations of the following simple piece of code: Variation 1:Variation 2:Can someone please explain how this  code works? 
Booleans are actually a subclass of integers in Python:are both true statements. So you can index a two-element sequence with a boolean. If the boolean is , you will get the first element. If the boolean is , you will get the second element.The expression  creates a two-element .  provides the boolean index. The  is incidental; it is just used to output the result.
If you put some element(s) in parens with at least one comma it becomes a tuple. Similar to a list, you can index a tuple. You index using integers, usually. However, if you index using a boolean then False will be interpreted as 0 and True will be interpreted as 1.So the code:Is interpreted in English as "if dist_1 > than dist_2 give me item 1 from the tuple, else give me item 0."If you want, you can do a tuple tutorial.
