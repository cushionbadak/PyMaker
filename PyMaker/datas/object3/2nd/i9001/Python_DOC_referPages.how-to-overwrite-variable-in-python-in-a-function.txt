So basically I'm working on a simple game for myself on Python, and I'm having an issue with my variables as when I run the program original variables are set to 50 dmg and 100 health, but what I want to do is be able to run the code, change the variables and then have them stay as that. Although I understand why the variables aren't staying as the new values, I have no clue how to over-write them, help would be much appreciated.Thanks.
I suggest creating a class to package all of the variables into a single object:Now you create an instance of the class:And change the variables directly:Alternatively, you can add functions to the class:Now you can call the function on an object:Classes are incredibly powerful and great tools for organizing code. They allow you to treat a lot of data as a single entity. I strongly encourage you to learn more about them and object oriented programming in general.
Place the variables outside function body and make them accessible within usng global keyword:
