I am trying to get an understanding of the different version's of Python.  Currently, their website provides several different version within the download section.I understand the distinction between Python 2.x and 3.x, and the larger confusion I am having is between different versions of Python 3.x.For example, their website currently lists the three most recent releases as:Python 3.4.6 (2017-01-17)Python 3.5.3 (2017-01-17)Python 3.6.0 (2016-12-23)Clearly, the most recent release is 3.4.6, but it is not the largest release number.What is the distinction between these three different versions?  Should I install the most recent version, or the largest release number?  All help is appreciated.
According to this, a version number is defined byMAJOR.MINOR.PATCHwhere MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changesMINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, andPATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.According to this and this Python 3.5.0 was released in 2015-09-13, while Python 3.4.0 was released on March 16th, 2014.The third number in the version number is the PATCH which usually fixes bugs, so the last version of Python is 3.6.0 which has no patches so far. I recommend to use the version based on the compatibility of the libraries you are going to use.
