Natural Text
I have been trying to figure this out for a while now and i just cannot figure out why my code only displays the first use of the word.If someone could suggest a quick and easy way that it would display both then that would be greatly appreciated.
That's how  is designed; to only return the first occurrence.If you want to find all occurrences, you must call it multiple times in a loop or with recursion. Before we do that, you should know that you can provide  and  parameters to define where to search in the sentence:This way we can avoid getting the same index all the time in our loop:Here's a recursive generator if you want to go fancy:Usage (also still supports  and  arguments):Or if you want a non-recursive generator, you could use the original  loop and have it  instead of append to a list:Exact same usage as before.
Because that is how  is defined: the documentation says:Like  ,  but raise  when the substring is not found.and :Return the lowest index in the string where substring sub is found  within the slice . Optional arguments start and end are  interpreted as in slice notation. Return  if sub is not found.(highlighting added)An idea to find all indices is to use:Or perhaps more efficient: a generator that generates indices:
