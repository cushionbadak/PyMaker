You can simply  the sequence with itself (without the first item):Or use it as list-comprehension without intermediate function:
You can use list comprehension with  and  to iterate pairwise over the list:In above  returns an iterator that starts from the second element on .  is used instead of normal slicing so that the original list doesn't need to be copied:Then  is used to create iterable pairs of items from the original list and iterator:And finally list comprehension iterates over the pairs to create the result:
