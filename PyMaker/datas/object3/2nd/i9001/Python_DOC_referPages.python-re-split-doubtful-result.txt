Natural Text
I'm a python beginner.I'm having doubt about the output about re.split()why these output are different?please help me ,thank you very much!
As is specified in the documentation of :Split string by the occurrences of pattern. If capturing parentheses  are used in pattern, then the text of all groups in the pattern  are also returned as part of the resulting list. If maxsplit is  nonzero, at most maxsplit splits occur, and the remainder of the  string is returned as the final element of the list.A capture group is usually described using parenthesis () that do not contain  or lookahead/lookbehind marker. So the first two regexes have capture groups:In the first case the capture group is a single comma. So that means the last capture is used (a single comma thus). In the second case () it can capture multiple commas (and a regex aims to capture as much as possible, so it captures here all).In the last case, there is no capture group, so this means splitting is done and the text matched against the pattern is completely ignored.
