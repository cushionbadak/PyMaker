Suppose I have 5 objects:  to :How can I find (efficiently) the highest value of , and identify the corresponding ? Here the expected answer would be:By the way, in the actual case, I have  objects.
If you have a list and you need the index of the maximum, you can combine  and  to make an equivalent to  in pure Python: will be the index containing the maximum value, so you can print it asIn the example you gave, , which prints .
Best to put them in a collection (i.e , , ..) and use  with  to grab the object with the max value of :The value  returned now corresponds to the one with the max value for the attribute , i.e :Ideally, you shouldn't "identify" the object by means of its name, that can easily change and if you have a list that isn't ordered by the name you'd get wrong results. Instead, you should give the class it was created from another attribute, say, and define an / for it that prints out the name and the value.
