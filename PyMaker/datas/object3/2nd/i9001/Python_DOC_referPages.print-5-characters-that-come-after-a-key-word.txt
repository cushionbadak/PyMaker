Use  instead. is not necessary for . It is required if there's special characters that has special meaning in regular expression.
Or a better solution:OUTPUT:OUTPUT:I added an additional 1 for the space, and assumed keyword after  is big enough. Otherwise spaces will occur. If this is unwanted it can be fixed. But such behavior is not defined by you how should be.
