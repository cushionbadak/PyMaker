First of all you are using  wrong https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.strptimeAfter you converted  to datetime with  you need to convert it back to string using  https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.strftimeUsing @FeebleOldMan partial answer
Put the correct formatting into strptime to mirror your input:See here for the formatting directives. (Here for Python 3.)If you  the subsequent   object you created, the default  formatting of the  object will be as you requested (2014-11-4 12:00:00). If you want to modify how the printed output looks, use  as shown in Sardorbek's answer and again, use the formatting directives you desire.
