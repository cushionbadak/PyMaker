I have a string which is list like thisthen I use eval() to convert it to real list object in PythonHowever, the output is rounded which I don't wantHow could I make it keep the values as in String (decimal with precision) ?I need to use eval() because it will use other operation on this list as well
While there can be loss of precision in floating point, there is no loss of precision here, given that it looks like the string was generated from a Python list of floats to begin with.  Note that  is recommended over , however:Note the above exactly matches the original string.  However, printing individual floats as opposed to the whole list defaults to six digits after the decimal, so if you want more precision, specify it:I also recommend looking into the pickle or json modules for saving the list in the first place to avoid using  or even .
Using Decimal in python
 are represented by binary fractions and there is a loss of precision when converting to and from the dotted decimal representation you are using (see here). The python  package implements decimal floating point arithmetic and doesn't have that limitation. You can't use  to break up the list because those values will evaluate to floats, but you can use the regex package to extract the floats and build the list from there.
