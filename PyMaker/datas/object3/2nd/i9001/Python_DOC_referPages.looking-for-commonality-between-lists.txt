Natural Text
python newbie - I have multiple text documents that contain users from several AD groups, I need to parse through each document and group users(usernames) by their group membership: for instance: Marketing doc has Marketing_grp:Sales doc has Sales_grp:Technology doc has Technology_grp:I need to be able to see that both Bob and Sally belong to multiple groups and I need to know what those groups are, how can I accomplish this with Python?The data in the text file is in the form of email addresses as in username@company.com
I'd do something like this.Now you have a dictionary mapping emails to the files they appear in.  This code expects the names of the relevant files to be passed as command-line arguments.
