I want to be able to sort a list of classes by one attribute, which happens to be another class Date. I have done some research and want to use the  method of sorting, but seeing as date is a class in itself how can I write an  function in date to allow me to sort chronologically?I want something along the lines of:and so on.Here is my Date class:I should probably mention that this is the first time I have ever used Python, so I'm not very good at this.Thanks in advance!
The easy way to compare two complex data structures is to compare tuples of their attributes, in the proper sort order. Try this:Of course, this only implements . Depending upon the nature of your code, you may want to implement all of the other comparison functions, , , , etc. One convenient way to do this is to use the  class decorator.Reference:How does tuple comparison work in Python?https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#common-sequence-operationshttps://docs.python.org/2/library/functools.html#functools.total_ordering
I propose adding a  object to the class definition:Then you can use  to sort, e.g.:
