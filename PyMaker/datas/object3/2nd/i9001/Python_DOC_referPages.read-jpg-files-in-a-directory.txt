I am trying to go through different image files in a directory. I am using Jupyter to run my python code as well. However I keep getting this error. Below is my code and the error I receive.CODE:OUTPUT:ERROR:
You have a path mismatch in your code, and your error is clearly showing it (file not found). When you do:You're listing the  directory in your current directory. The  will contain values in the form of ,  etc. as  lists only the names of files and directories in it, so when you call:you'll essentially ges nothing because the  doesn't contain any path information. So, finally, when you do: You technically pass only the file name as  is empty. Since your image is in the  subdirectory and not in your working directory, you'll normally get file not found.There are a several ways to solve this issue, the easiest would be to just declare a lookup directory in a variable and use it when needed, e.g.:
In my opinion I prefer using the glob library to return a list of files in a directory. returns:If you want to continue with your approach, I am sure that you are not giving a correct path to the folder directory. Think about it, how does the program know where  is located.
