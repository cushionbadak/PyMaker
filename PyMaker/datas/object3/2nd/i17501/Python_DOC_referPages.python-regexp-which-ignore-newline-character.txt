Natural Text
I have text which contains newline character like below. I wondered whether it possible to use Python's regexps which will just ignore newlines like  or  does not exists in string?For example, in text:find by regexp  should return one match.As I understand re.MULTILINE here in unapplicable and re.DOTALL also because it is just treating dot char as newline also. In my case I do nto want to expand regexp.NOTE: I cannot just trim newline chars because this text must be saved back.
At first:  is not a pattern, it is a fixed sequence of characters. If you would allow newlines between the words, it could become a pattern, but then you need to describe this in your regex.What you could do is to replace every space in your pattern with :See it here on Regexr is a whitespace character, including  and , see python.org
