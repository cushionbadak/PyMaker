This is a coroutine but Python3.2 sees it as a generator - why? What is going on here? I'm referring to Python Essential Reference by David Beazeley pg:20.To quote the relevant section:Why doesn't my code work - not that DB's works..
You're getting thrown off by the error message; type-wise, Python doesn't make a distinction - you can  to anything that uses , even if it doesn't do anything with the sent value internally.In 3.x, there is no longer a  method attached to these; instead, use the built-in free function .
For python version 3.2 the syntax for the  in-built function should be  or . 
In the case you find yourself patching somebody's code, it seems that the built-in python3 next() function calls the iterator's next() function, so you may be able to find/replace somebody's python2  with the python3-tolerable  as I just did to make portions of the primefac module work in python3 (among other trivial changes).Here's the reference:next(iterator[, default])Retrieve the next item from the iterator by calling its next()      method. If default is given, it is returned if the iterator is      exhausted, otherwise StopIteration is raised.
