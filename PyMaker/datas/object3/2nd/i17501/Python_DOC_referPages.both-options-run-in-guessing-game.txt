So I'm very new to programing and I'm using Python (v3.33) to create little programs like so:Here is my problem- I want the user to be able to select 'A' or 'B' (I will get to adding 'C' and 'D' but want to fix problems first) but the program takes the user through 'A' automatically and then to 'B': How do I get it so user can select 'A' and 'B'. Also, how do I make it so user can have option to say 'Yes' or 'No' if they want to run it again.Thanks
wrap the whole thing in a while loop:About your code:that line simply tests whether option is equal to 'A'. It returns a  or a .You want to test for options actual value. Hence the  statements above.Your code is just running through all scenarios because you haven't provided the conditions under which things should happen. Only when  should code for that situation be run. Only when  should code for that be run. And only when  should the main loop break. This is a good example of when to use the  statement.EDIT:With regards to your comment, you could do the following:Or check out how the  method works here
It takes you through both options because you are not using a check for the option.While your code is technically checking  and then later , it's not checking one or the other and not doing anything with that check.Instead you would want:The  is there instead of  so you have room to add code for options C and D.
