Quick question, what is the magic method python calls when you say ? I know it's not  and it isn't , so what gets called if anything? If nothing is called, then how can I customize the events that occur when you delete an object? Take a look at the following example:When I delete log I would like it to set Logger._instance to None again, so you can reinitialize the singleton. How might I do this?
You could use a weak reference instead; as all references to the  instances are cleaned up, the weak reference won't prevent the object from being reaped. is now a weak reference object; you call it to retrieve the referenced object, and if it returns  the object is gone and you'll need to create a new one.Just take into account that the deletion is not necessarily going to be instantaneous; garbage collection needs to run to reap the object once the last regular reference has been removed.The  call as the first line in the  ensures that any weak refences are cleaned up before testing.
