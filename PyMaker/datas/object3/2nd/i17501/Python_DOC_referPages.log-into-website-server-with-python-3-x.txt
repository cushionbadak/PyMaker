Natural Text
I would like to be able to log into a website or server by having the user input the username and password. The python program would then log into a website and print the source code of the redirected URL. I am able to print the source code of a webpage with the following code from eHow. The server I am trying to access is 192.168.0.1 which is the wifi server of my home network.
I'm guessing the D-Link is using Basic Authentication. In that case you may use this code from the documentation in order to get the through the login.
