Let's assume that we have this code:What does the -1 do? I have seen it in various codes but not sure on what it does?And what would the difference be if there was a  or a ?
The line of code you gave is basically doing three things:It takes the string  and splits it on 's using .  This will return a list of substrings:The  then indexes that list at position . Doing so will return the last item:It takes this item and assigns it as a value for the variable .Below is a more complete demonstration of the concepts mentioned above:
Negative indexes in Python are syntactic sugar for accessing the elements in reverse order, from right-to-left, starting in . So  is the last item,  is the second-to-last item, and so on - the first item would be . For example:
 returns a list: yields the last item (negative index starts from -1)See  - Python tutorial (contains indexing, slicing).
 will create list and from that you are getting the last element using
