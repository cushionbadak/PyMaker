I was reading another page on fibonacci sequence:How do I print a fibonacci sequence to the nth number in Python?and I was wondering if anyone can break down what is happening and how this specific line works.  I dont fully understand how "cur" and "i" is changing and such.  it was part of the fibonacci function
More generally speaking, a commatized list of l-values used as an l-value in Python unpacks an iterable from the right-hand side into the parts of the left-hand side.In your case, this means that the right-hand side creates a three-tuple of the values ,  and , which is then unpacked into ,  and , respectively, so that it is the same as saying:However, it is more useful, since  isn't clobbered before  has been assigned to. It can also be used much more generally -- the left-hand side can consist of any l-values and the right-hand side can be any iterable, and you can do things like these:ororIn Python3, you can also used asterisk expressions to unpack "the rest" of an iterable; for instance, like thisThat doesn't work in Python2, however.For the details, this is covered in section 7.2 of the language reference.
The line you gave is equivalent to this:which is using a technique known as unpacking*.  Below is a demonstration:In a longer form, your line is equivalent to this:which can be simplified to:*Note:  Actually, it has quite a few names.  In addition to unpacking, a very common one is multiple assignment.  @user2864740 also mentioned two more names in his comment.
