I have a program that works with Python 2.7 but not python 3.3 Of course I know I need to use range rather than xrange, add () for print etc.. but the program has a lot of the 'map' method and it seems to create problems. When I got this error:  I just casted it as a string and it worked. What I couldn't figure out how to convert was this expression:I get this error: but this time I'm not sure what to cast and how. I can post the entire code if that'd help.This is how P is being initialized:
Instead ofuseThe problem arises because you are trying to call  later which works in Python 2 but not in Python 3 because Python 3 evaluates this  lazily (it's a generator there).  Run the explicit  around it to strip the laziness and get a real list.BUT consider that you could maybe strip that  altogether because if you are only interested in the length of the list, there is no need to  it somehow.  ping it won't change its size.That would mean evaluate this:instead.
You can convert each element of  to a list first:Or:A better way will be to follow @Alfe answer.Here's a simple (though not perfect) rule: replace Python2  with  in Python3.
You can force  to be evaluated strictly with , so  or similar expressions would remain valid in Python3.Basically,
In Python 3,  returns an iterator, while in Python 2 it returns a list. You can construct a list from an iterator by calling .So you need to change P to be :Then the elements of P can be passed to .Another way to change it would be to have the expression be:You can always replace a  call with a generator expression in Python 3 (in 2 you'd replace it with a list comprehension).
