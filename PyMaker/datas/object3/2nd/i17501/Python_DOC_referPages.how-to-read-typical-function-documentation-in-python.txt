Why does have all these  included?I don't understand how to read this structure?
Usually, in documentation, [] is read like ' is optional'. In this particular case, it also implies dependency and should be read like this: is optional, but if you use it you can also use:   , which is optional, but if you use it you can also use:, which is optional, but... and so on
"a phrase enclosed in square brackets ([ ]) means zero or one occurrences (in other words, the enclosed phrase is optional)"See http://docs.python.org/2/reference/introduction.html#notation means for instance that  is optional but if you use  you must also use  and so on. This is what the embedded brackets mean.If you do not name the parameters you can use in any of the following examples (but no other combination!):Otherwise if you do name the parameteres you can use any of them optionally. The constructor has following default values:See the source code of the constructor (https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/src/9d88b4875d6e/lib-python/2.7/multiprocessing/pool.py)For more on keyword arguments you can read the following:http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#keyword-arguments
The use of  indicates that the enclosed parameter is optional and can be omitted.
