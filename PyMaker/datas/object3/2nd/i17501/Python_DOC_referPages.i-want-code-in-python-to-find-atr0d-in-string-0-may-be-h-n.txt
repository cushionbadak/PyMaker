I need a code to choose between two characters within the same string.Example: I want to find  in 
This is a problem which is solved using regular expressions. Try using findall from the re module:Output:
 only returns all non-overlapping matches of pattern in string, as a list of strings.It doesn't contain inforamtion about position, which is probably what you want.Try  instead, it returns an iterator yielding match objects, while match objects contain those info. The above code doesn't work if matched patterns overlap. To find all overlapping matches, see Python regex find all overlapping matches?.For your questionSince your specific pattern definitly won't lead to overlapping, it makes no difference which form you use.
