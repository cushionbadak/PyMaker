I have a list of values that are the result of merging many files. I need to pad some of the values. I know that each sub section begins with the value -1. I am trying to basically extract a sub-array between -1's in the main array via iteration.For example supposed this is the main list:I would like to extract the values between the -1s:I have extracted the indices for each -1 by search through the main list:I also assembled them as pairs using a common recipe:The next step I am trying to do is grab the values between the index pairs, for example:so I can then do some work to those values (I will add a fixed int. to each value in each sub-array).  
You mentioned  in the tags.  If you're using it, have a look at .For example:This yields:What's going on is that  will yield an array (actually a tuple of arrays, therefore the ) of the indicies where the given expression is true.  We can then pass these indicies to  to get a sequence of arrays.  However, the result will contain the 's and an empty array at the start, if the sequence starts with . Therefore, we need to filter these out.If you're not already using , though, your (or @DSM's)  solution is probably a better choice.
If you only need the groups themselves and don't care about the indices of the groups (you could always reconstruct them, after all), I'd use :I missed the  tags, though: if you're working with numpy arrays, using / is a better choice.
I would do it something like this, which is a little different from the path you started down:
I think when you build your , you can directly add the values to a . So rather than starting with a  like , you can start with , and then do an update like . The result will be a  rather than a . Then, you can just use the  method on the strihg. Am sure you can take it from here ...
