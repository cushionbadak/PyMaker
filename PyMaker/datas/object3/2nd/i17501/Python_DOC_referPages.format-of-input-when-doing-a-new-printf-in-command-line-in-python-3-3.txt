I am new to python. I just write a server-client program to achieve multiple clients chatting in a room using command line to receive conversation and get input from type. The problem is in the client end. When I am typing, if new words coming from another client, my typing is becoming to be appended. It is like the data I received is appended to what I am typing.What I used in client reading is:What I used to display new conversation on command line is:Thanks.
You are confusing input and output.If you are using a multi-threaded client, one thread writing to the  output will be intermingled with another thread taking input on  and showing what is being typed with the standard input echo.Any characters typed for the  call are echoed to  and that is mixed with anything else being written to  at the same time.This does not mean that the actual return value of  is going to contain anything other than what the end user typed.You'll have to build a more sophisticated terminal-based UI to keep  and input echo separated. Something like  could work, but this requires some sophistication.
