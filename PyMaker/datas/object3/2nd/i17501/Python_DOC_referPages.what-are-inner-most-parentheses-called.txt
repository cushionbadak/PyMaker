The fact the the parenthesis` are nested has nothing to do with anything.It is the  (comma) that is important. Which is why  works and whose end result is the equivalent of For example, in python:but(128,) is called a  which is something like a LIST ()One of the main differences is a LIST can be modified, a tuple cannot:e.g.
You are passing a tuple to the  method. The distinction is as follows:Your  variable is also a tuple, which is why it works as well:
Its called a tuple. See this link on tuples and other sequence types.
 is a function that takes a  as its first argument. When you do , python tries to treat  as a tuple (by indexing it), which it isn't, and so you get your error.In the case of variable assignment like , python understands that  is meant to be a tuple, but in the context of , python assumes you meant to pass in two  arguments, and not a single .
