Is there a way to parse a URL (with some python library) and return a python dictionary with the keys and values of a query parameters part of the URL?For example:expected return:
Use the  library:The  and  methods parse out query strings, taking into account that keys can occur more than once and that order may matter.If you are still on Python 2,  was called .
For Python 3, the values of the dict from  are in a list, because there might be multiple values. If you just want the first one:
If you prefer not to use a parser:So I won't delete what's above but it's definitely not what you should use.I think I read a few of the answers and they looked a little complicated, incase you're like me, don't use my solution.Use this:and for Python 2.XI know this is the same as the accepted answer, just in a one liner that can be copied.
For python 2.7
I agree about not reinventing the wheel but sometimes (while you're learning) it helps to build a wheel in order to understand a wheel. :) So, from a purely academic perspective, I offer this with the caveat that using a dictionary assumes that name value pairs are unique (that the query string does not contain multiple records).I'm using version 3.6.5 in the Idle IDE.
