My function doesn't work as it is supposed to. I keep getting 'True' when all line[0] are less than line[2]. I know this is pretty trivial, but it's an exercise i've taken to better understand files and formy data:
Having been thoroughly schooled in my over-thought previous answer, may I offer this far simpler solution which still short-circuits as intended:
for all cases in your data  ('3' < ' ' = False)you need to dothen then looks at  and 
1) You are comparing strings that you need to convert to integers2) You will only grab the first and third character (so, you won't get the 0 in 20)Instead use
Here's a whole-hog functional rewrite. Hope this is enlightening ;-)
"3 20" is a string, just do map(int, LINE.split()) before.but how do you want compare 2 numbers with 2 numbers?
The main problem is you are comparing characters of the line, not the values of the two numbers on each one. This can be avoided first splitting the line into white-space-separated words, and then turning those into an integer value for the comparison by applying thefunction to each one:This can all be done very succinctly in Python using the built-infunction with a couple of generator expressions:
