I'm trying to import a python function into another python while loop.  This is the code:test.pysleep_test.pyWhen I run sleep_test.py, 15 is printed once and then the loop hangs.  I'm trying to print 15 consecutively after a 10 second delay.  Does anyone have suggestion how I might accomplish this with the code I've provided?
The problem isn't the . The problem is actually in the When Python imports a module, it only does so once. Subsequent  will be ignored.You should refactor your modules to this:test.pysleep_test.py
It's not that  hangs (for longer than it's supposed to); it's that trying to import a module that's already imported doesn't re-import it. If you really want to force a reload, use the built-in  function:However, you're probably better off restructuring your code entirely. This is a pretty ugly way of doing things.(In Python 3,  was moved to the  module.)
