Take for example the code below with 2 for loops.What I'm wondering is, if after the if statement is found to be true, will it keep iterating through 'dict' or will it go back upto the first for loop and move onto the next iteration? I can't believe how long I've been using python and I don't know the answer to such a simple question.Thanks!
It will continue to iterate in dict. If you want to jump out of the inner loop, use .You can also try.
It keep iterate through .If you want the loop  go back upto first  loop, use  statement:As Jacob Krall commented, You don't need to iterate the dictionary object to check whether key() exist. Use  operator:If you want print  only once, use :BTW, do not use  or  as variable name. It shadows builtin function , .
It will continue to iterate over . If you do not want this behavior try this:
