I need to make a simple python script, but as I mostly do PHP / C++ I find it hard to manage myself without simple for loops.Let's say I have a code:As you can see it simply goes as many times as many letters I have in my string. Of course, I could do this in a while loop, but that has an issue. I have to either create a variable outside of the loop which will make it global or create it inside the loop, but this variable's value can't be used in the argument of loop.Wrong:As you can see it doesn't make sense at all. So how can I do this?
The construct from other languagestranslates directly into a Python for loop over a :By default,  is 1, so you donâ€™t need to specify it for .  defaults to zero, so you can also leave that out, if you start with :So, if you want to iterate  over the length of a string, you can just do this:Usually, you would want to access the character of that string though, so you can just iterate over the characters directly:Or, if you really do need the index as well, you can use  to get both:
I think you'd be surprised how rarely you actually need , though. You're better off learning how to use Python idioms, rather than forcing yourself to write PHP/C++ code in Python.
Try:

If you have a :you can do this:
