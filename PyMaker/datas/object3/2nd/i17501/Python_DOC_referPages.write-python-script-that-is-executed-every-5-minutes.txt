I need to write a python script that autostarts on boot and is executed every 5 minutes on a raspberry pi. How can this be done? in particular, how can I avoid having a script locking up the cpu running a infine loop waiting for the 5 minutes to be over?
You can easily use cron for this task (schedule to run Python script). ;)How to setup cronI suppose that you have cron installed already; if not, then install some (vixie-cron for an example).Create a new file  with the following content:where  is the user to run the script (it shouldn’t be root if possible, for security reasons). If this doesn’t work, then try to append the content to  instead.You might want to redirect stdout/stderr of the script to file, so you can check if everything works fine. This is same as in shell, just add something like  after the script path.
You can use time.sleep
