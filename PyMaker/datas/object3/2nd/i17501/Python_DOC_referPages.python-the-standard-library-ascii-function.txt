I have begun to look through the Python Standard Library: (http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html) In an attempt to further familiarise myself with basic python.  When it comes to the explanation on the ascii( ) function, I'm not finding it clear.Is someone able to supply a concise explanation giving examples of useful situations in which one may use the ascii( ) function please? 
 is a function that encodes the output of  to use escape sequences for any codepoint in the output produced by  that is not within the ASCII range.So a Latin 1 codepoint like  is represented by the Python escape sequence  instead.This was the standard representation in Python 2; Python 3  leaves most Unicode codepoints as their actual value in the output, as long as it is a printable character:Both outputs are valid Python string literals, but the latter uses just ASCII characters, while the former requires a Unicode-compatible encoding.For unicode codepoints between U+0100 and U+FFFF  escape code sequences are used, for anything over that the  form is used. See the available escape code syntax for Python string literals.Like ,  is a very helpful debugging tool, especially when it comes to exact contents of a string. Unlike , the  output makes many Unicode gotchas much more visible.Take de-normalised codepoints for example; The  character can be represented in two ways, as the U+00EB codepoint, or as an ASCII  plus combining diaeresis  (codepoint U+0308):Only with  is it clear that  consists of two distinct codepoints.
 can be useful for finding out exactly what is in a string. If a string has whitespace or unprintable characters, or if the terminal is turning the string into mojibake because of a character-encoding mismatch, it is useful to look at the  representation of the string since it provides a visible and unambiguous representation for those otherwise unreadable characters which will print the same way on everyone's terminals.There are frequent questions on Stackoverflow regarding incorrectly printed strings, and sometimes it is hard to tell what's going on because the question only shows the mojibake and not an unambiguous representation of the string. When the questioner shows the  representation (or the  in Python 2) then the situation becomes much clearer.
