I am looking at the code listed here and they provide a very interesting structure to writing a "clock" in Python on line. I have never seen this quirky syntax before and quite honestly do not know how it works. This is utter black magic in Python. But even though it is not the most Pythonic way to write what the author intended, I would still like to know how it operates.My though process: returns True is the duration has been passed starts as an int, but is later changed to a lambda function?Why are there lists at the end of each of these? I have a feeling these are not lists.
This is an archaic way of writing a ternary conditional.  It should be:Before Python 2.5, which introduced the ternary conditional (link) you could emulate it by creating a 2-element tuple and indexing it with a boolean expression, since  gets treated as  and  as .
In Python,  is a subclass of , so a boolean is either 0 or 1 depending on it being the value  or .Thus,  is either set to  or , depending on  being greater than 0 or not. is then set to  or .You can translate this to:which is shorter and more readable. Go figure.
