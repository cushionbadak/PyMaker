I have used BeautifulSoup for Python 3.3 to successfully pull desired info from a web page. I have also used BeautifulSoup to generate new HTML code to display this info. Currently, my Python program prints out the HTML code, which I then have to copy, paste, and save as an HTML file, then from there, I can test it in a browser.So my question is this, is there a way in Python to launch the HTML code generated by BeautifulSoup in a web browser so that I don't have to go through the copy and paste method I use now?
Using :
Use Flask to turn your code into a local web application:Run the script, and point your browser at .
(this grew enough I figured I should split it off as a separate answer:)As @reptilicus points out, you can use the built-in http.server module as follows:Create a web file directory and save your .html file in it.Open a command-line window and doPoint your browser at This only works for static files; it will not run your script and return the results (as Flask does).
