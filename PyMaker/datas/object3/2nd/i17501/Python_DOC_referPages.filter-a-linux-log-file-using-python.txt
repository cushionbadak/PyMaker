I want to filter a log file to keep all lines matching a certain pattern. I want to do this with Python.Here's my first attempt:How can I improve this to:save the result to a new file of similar name (i.e., a different extension)use regex to make it more flexible/powerful.(I'm just learning Python. This question is as much about learning Python as it is about accomplishing this particular result.)OK, here's what I came up with so far... But how do you do the equivalent of prepending an  as in the following linewhere the string is not a string literal, as in the next line?Other than that, I think this updated version does the job:Can this be easily improved?
Well, you know, you have answered most of your questions yourself already :)For regular expression matching use  module (the doc has pretty explanatory examples).You already have made use  function for opening a file. Use the same function for open files for writing, just provide a corresponding  parameter ("w" or "a" combined with "+" if you need, see  in the Python interactive shell). That's it.
