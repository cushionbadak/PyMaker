Why does this not work?it says on the that I need to make a maketrans function, what does that exactly mean?Also it says that print str.translate is an invalid syntax, how can I fix it?
Because in Python 3  takes a dictionary instead; it appears you are looking at the documentation for Python 2.The dictionary should map codepoints (integers) to their replacement value (integer or unicode value), or  to delete codepoints.There is no need to import  for this job; the  static function is available to do the job.Demo:From the  documentation:Return a copy of the s where all characters have been mapped through the map which must be a dictionary of Unicode ordinals (integers) to Unicode ordinals, strings or . Unmapped characters are left untouched. Characters mapped to  are deleted.Incidentally, Python 2  also works this way, while in Python 3,  also uses the old API.
