I am currently trying to write a function that creates and returns a list of a specified length, containing repetitions of a specified value. I'm really unsure of how to get the function to create the list from the arguments that are inputted. Help would be greatly appreciated! I'm not asking for the code to be written for me, just a simple explanation of what Python functions I should be using or something to point me in the right direction. The only code I have so far is this, which I know is wrong:
Edit:Since you said that you wanted to use a loop:Actually, because the solution is quite short, the easiest way to explain it is with a demonstration:Basically, you place  in a list and then multiply that list by .  Doing so will create a list whose contents are  repeated  times.It should be noted however that, if  is a mutable object (such as a list), the above function will return a list that contains  references to the same object .  If this behavior is undesirable, then you can use a list comprehension and :Finally, here are some useful references regarding the tools used here:Sequence typesList comprehensionsNote: In all of the demonstrations, it is assumed that  is an integer.
You can multiply a list to make a bigger list. Try this code in a Python interpreter:So you should be able to do something like this in a function:You can also use the list's append() function:The interactive Python interpreter has a great built-in help system. you can use dir() and help() to find out what functions are available and how they work. Try this:etc.
