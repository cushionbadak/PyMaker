I am using Mock (http://mock.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) library with Python 2.7. I have a main function that calls a few other functions that I am trying to test.The other functions that it calls are other instance methods (so for example, .I am calling my main function, and I have the other functions that it calls patched. I just added  to the patch. When I check for call arguments however, it shows a  argument (as expected):Before setting , it would only show that arguments that I actually passed (1 and 2). Since now the call args show a reference to , I can't just call . I will need to pick out the arguments from  and compare.Is there a way to still call  without having to pick out the arguments manually to check that the arguments passed are correct?Or is there something better in general that I can do to patch instance methods?
Essentially there are two ways to play around  reference for  patches.Use  to ignore the first argumentPatch object by  instead of patching the static method reference.Anyway 2 cannot be used in all cases sometimes you cannot have the object instance in test method context; moreover that way often make test less clear and more complicated. I always prefer to use 1 in my tests:
