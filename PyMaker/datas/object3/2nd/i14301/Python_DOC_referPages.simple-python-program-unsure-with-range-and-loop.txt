Your lineis not valid Python. If you wanted to use looping here,  is helpful but you need to add a  function:See the Python tutorial on the  construct. Since the  function returns a string, you need to convert it to an integer first, using the  function.Your code otherwise pretty much matches the pseudo-code otherwise, apart from using a lowercase  in your  line; you may want to correct that as you only test for uppercase  in the result:You also made a small typo in your  update; replace the second  with :Putting that together would make:
In every language,  loops are more commonly used to iterate over a range of value as inOn the other hand,  loops are used to perform blocks of code while a given condition evaluates to trueAnd so on.It seems to me that your case fits more in a  loop. Something like:Last note:Python has some style guides that are intended to keep your code cleaner. While style is sometimes a personal choice, it would be nice if you take some time to read them. For instance, in your case, your variable names should be divided by underscore as in . Checkout more here:Google Style GuidePEP-8
If I've guessed your intentions, the code should look like this:
