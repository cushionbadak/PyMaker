I'm trying to connect to more than one server at the same time. I am currently using  but it freezes up at the first non-responding server.I tried threading this but it created problems with the sid value being used as well as various errors such as  and .  Also, according my variables (tho were getting mixed up) the protocol's  method gets executed when  throws an exception.I don't understand much about the asyncio module so please be as thorough as possible.  I dont think I need reader/writer variables, as the reading should be done automatically and trigger  method.Thank You.
You can connect to many servers at the same time by scheduling all the coroutines concurrently, rather than using  to make each connection individually. One way to do that is to use  to schedule them all and wait for each to finish:This will kick off all three coroutines listed in the call to  concurrently, so that if one of them hangs, the others won't be affected; they'll be able to carry on with their work while the other connection hangs. Then, if all of them complete,  gets executed, which will allow you program to continue running until you stop the loop or kill the program.The / variables you mentioned would only be relevant if you used  to connect to the servers, rather than . It uses the Stream API, which is a higher-level API than the protocol/transport-based API that  uses. It's really up to you to decide which you prefer to use. There are examples of both in the  docs, if you want to see a comparison.
