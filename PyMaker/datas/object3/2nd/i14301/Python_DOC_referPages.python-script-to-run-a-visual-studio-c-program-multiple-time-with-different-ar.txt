I have a C++ Visual Studio program called Test which takes two arguments. I have to run this program with large number of different arguments like:./test  -a  -b (a is arg1, b is arg2)./test  -c  -d...How can I create a python script which runs this program multiple times if I provide the set of arguments? (instead of me running the above command multiple times). Soln:This is the code I used:I am giving the arguments in a list of 2-member tuples(listargs). Each tuple has the arguments for one execution. Or as abernet mentioned, we can give arguments in csv file. Thanks for helping me.
For this type of stuff, you should use , possibly :This is a very versatile command that will also allow you to redirect inputs and outputs. See PMOTW.
You haven't explained how you want to "provide the set of arguments".Let's say you want to create a CSV file, like this:That's nice and simple to create in a text editor, or you can even do it in Excel.Python has a  module in the standard library that knows how to read exactly that format, turning each line into a list of values.And it has a  module that knows how to run a program with a list of arguments.So, for example:If you want to store the output of each run in a file, or check the output and raise an exception on errors, etc., you can do almost anything you want with , you just have to read the docs.
