Is there a way to show float value in Python 2 like Python 3 does?Code:Python 2.7.9Python 3.4.3I'm interested in result variable. not in step. Sorry for insufficient explanation what I want. :)
 shows more digits (I'm guessing just enough to reproduce the same float):
Running your code in Python2 or Python3 calculates the same value for  and . The only difference is in the way the float gets printed. In Python2.7 (or Python3) you can control the number of digits shown after the decimal by using :prints
Storing decimal floating point numbers in binary causes rounding issues when representing them in decimal. This is a fact of (computer programming) life in any language, but Python2 deals with this differently than python3 (see: 25898733).Using string formatting you can make your script produce the same output in python2 as in python3 and also have a more human readable output:Output:
