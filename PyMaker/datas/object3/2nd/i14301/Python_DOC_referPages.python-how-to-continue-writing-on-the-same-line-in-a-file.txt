This occurs because Python reads the entire line, including the new-line character represented as  in python. The string in your example would result in an array like:To solve this you need to remove the trailing  from each line, but beware that the last line might not contain a  so you cant just remove the last character of each line. There are pre-made methods built in to python to help you remove white-space characters (like new-line  and space ) from the beginning and the end of a string.The official documentation can be a bit daunting, but finding and using information from documentation is probably one of the most important skills in the field of computing. Look at the official documentation and see if you find any useful methods in the string class.https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.strip
