Here's the exercise Lessons from a Triangle! 1) How come when I try to change the speed of the turtle like wheel.speed(10) it doesn't work? What's the default speed if I don't indicate the speed?2) How do i put my turtle to the middle of the circle once it's done?Thank You so Much!
As abarnert said, the link to your exercise is broken, but there are a few things you can do to speed up your program. FWIW, the turtle module has a  method, but I guess the point of your exercise is to use a polygon to approximate a circle.  does work (although  is even faster). It doesn't appear to make much difference because the sides of your 360-sided polygon are so tiny, and so the turtle has to do several moves & turns just to traverse a single pixel.Using a 360-sided polygon to draw a circle, no matter what the radius is, is not a great strategy. The code below determines the number of sides from the circumference so that each side is approximately 1 pixel. This will look good for a circle of any radius, and it avoids doing too much work for small circles.Apart from using  to speed things up you can also reduce the canvas's frame delay. Also, if you hide the turtle while drawing, it'll go even faster. The following code was tested on Python 2.6.6; it should also work without modification on Python 3.x, but on Python 3.x you may remove the  line.
