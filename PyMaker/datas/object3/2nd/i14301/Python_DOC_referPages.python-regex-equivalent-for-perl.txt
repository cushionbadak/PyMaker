what is the equivalent of following Perl condition in Python I tried the following but it didn't match(the line at the bottom)I had to change it to to match this lineIs there a flag to match it anywhere on the line without explicitly matching starting characters ?
You need to use , not .   only matches as the beginning of the string, while  matches anywhere, like in Perl.
See re â€” Regular expression operations for an explanationre.match(pattern, string, flags=0)If zero or more characters at the beginning of string match the regular expression pattern, return a corresponding match object. Return None if the string does not match the pattern; note that this is different from a zero-length match.Note that even in MULTILINE mode, re.match() will only match at the beginning of the string and not at the beginning of each line.If you want to locate a match anywhere in string, use search() instead (see also search() vs. match()).
