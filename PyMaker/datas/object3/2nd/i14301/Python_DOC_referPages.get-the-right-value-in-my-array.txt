I am trying to save only the DateTime, and DateTimeOriginal in an array list.When I run this script, I get the following output when I print my arraylist:I am trying to only get the following output, like I get with the  function:My code:What is the best way to store  and  if I have to use them later on? Is it better to put them in a variable? How can I do that?What I am trying to do is:Getting the time dates of images and put them in a timeline. So I have to use my output later on in my script, but I don't know how I can store it.
It is the same tag instances in both cases, but with different string representations.You can either add  to your list, or use  when reading them out again.Example:
I'm only about 80% sure I understand what you're asking, butâ€¦This prints out the string you want:This stores some complex  object that you don't want:What you want is just the same string you printed out, not the  object.If you look at the docs for -style String Formatting, the conversion type  gives you:String (converts any Python object using ).So, if you want to store the same thing that gets printed with , just call , the same way it does:I'm not sure why you want to build a list containing the string representations of all the  and  tags interleaved like this, but if that's what you want, that's how to do it.
Try to use  to get just string representations. Actually if you'll check sources of  you'll see that  returns .
