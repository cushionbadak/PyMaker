see  or the website documentation of .Since  limits itself to the shorter sequence,works too.EDIT: Steven brought up the interesting point that if  is very long, doing the implicit copy to get the separate pyObject that is  is problematic. In this case, you might want to use  and its options to get a view on the same data with but a offset.
This can be done using list comprehension and list slicing, you iterate over the elements upto  and on each iteration slice the elements form  and the element next to it.
