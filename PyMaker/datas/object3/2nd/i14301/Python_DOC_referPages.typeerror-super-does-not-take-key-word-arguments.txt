I also have some Kwargs in some other class's supers, but these are the ones raising any kind of issues (as of right now). So what could be causing this?

Option # 1 : Python 2.7xHere you can pass  keywork to super() which inherently refers the instance properties. Option # 2 : Python 3x no longer need to any parameters and you can simply write
