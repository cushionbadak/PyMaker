I am trying to input from stdin.I think there are many ways to perform it.Among them, I want to use one of below two ways.(if there is more efficient alternative, let me know) first,second,which one is more efficient way?if there is no difference, which one is more Pythonic or closer to standard?sorry for my poor English.I looking forward your answer
The second () is more efficient, more DRY, and more Pythonic.
The second  is more efficient, because it just has to do less.One way to get a quantitative glance at performance is to look at the bytecode:You can use the  module for that:This is the first function:This is the second one, it has about 50% of the instructions:Note that the first needs to make attribute lookups, , and a function call, , which are expensive and absent in the second bytecode excerpt.
You can use iter:Or with raw_input:Your loop won't break using I would use raw_input or input if you are actually taking user input, I also doubt efficiency is going to be an issue whatever you choose.
