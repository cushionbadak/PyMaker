I have seen something interesting here, saying you can store lookup tables at magic numbers.I have tried using brute-force to find the magic number, but all the results are incorrect.How do I find the correct magic number for a certain lookup table?Thank you.
As the author of that answer puts it:The magic number stores the table as a bitstring, with the -th  digit (from the end) corresponding to the th table entryHere's a really simple example:So the "magic number" for this lookup table, reading up from the bottom, is:Or, to rotate it:In terms of extracting the output, the right-shift binary operator  moves all bits in  right by  places, truncating the last  bits:and the bitwise AND  tells you the value of the last bit. Getting the results back out:Another example:So the "magic number" for this lookup table, reading up from the bottom, is:Or, to rotate it:
