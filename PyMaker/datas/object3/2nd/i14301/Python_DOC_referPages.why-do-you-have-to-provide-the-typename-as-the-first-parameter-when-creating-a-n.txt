This question already has an answer here:Python syntax for namedtuple                    4 answers                In the collections.namedtuple() constructor, the first parameter is the name of the type that you want to create, but as far as I can tell, it's irrelevant aside from diagnostic messages.Is this just a necessary item that the programmer should keep consistent for diagnostic purposes because there'd be no way for Python to learn the name of the variable you're assigning the namedtuple to?  Seems error-prone, but I can see how it'd be necessary.  Just wondering if there are any other reasons or repercussions of mismatching these two names.
Named tuples are implemented in a kind-of dirty way. There is a template string that has a few placeholders, and when you call  what happens is actually that those placeholders are replaced by the arguments and the template is ’d. This implementation seems really dirty (since it uses eval) but is really simple and powerful.The downside is that there is an actual need for a class name because one of the first lines is actually this: . So you do need to specify a type name for it to work.As for the value of that name, it does not matter much but as you said yourself, for debugging purposes, it’s useful to choose the same name you also use for the variable that holds the type. Otherwise, the whole thing wouldn’t be much different to this:
