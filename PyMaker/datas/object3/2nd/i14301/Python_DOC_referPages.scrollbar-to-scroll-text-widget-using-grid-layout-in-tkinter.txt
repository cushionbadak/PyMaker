Natural Text
I am trying to use the grid layout manager in Tkinter to create a dialog box.I want the Text area at the bottom to have a scrollbar. Unfortunately I can not figure out how to make the scrollbar be the same height as the Text widget beside it.  The sample below shows that the scrollbar is in the right position but is the wrong size (only about 10% of the height of the Text widget). 
Add North and South to the sticky option of the Scrollbar grid call, so the Scrollbar is stretched in vertical direction.
You can only use one geometry manager on each of a container's child widgets, but if a child widget is itself a container, you can use any geometry manager you like for its children. This means we can just make a  and  the  and  into it, using the  argument to make the  fill the available space.Change this:to this:
There is the ScrolledText module. If you are using Anaconda python distribution then in  command line do:Then in your .py file import module (if python 3 and up)And if python 2.7 thenThen you call it like a normal Text widget like so, in python 3:self.textBox = ScrolledText(self, borderwidth=3, relief="sunken")It is a compound widget (Text & Scrollbar).
