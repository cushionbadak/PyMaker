Natural Text
I am trying to scrap some data from a website, and below is a long string that I have managed to get. Above is not a javascript list, it is a String. I want to create a list of all player names from this string. So I have to extract all the substrings between " " and add it to a list. Alternatively if I can somehow convert this string as it is to a list or an array, it would be great.Can someone suggest how can we do this in python? 
You can use As Steve mentions below in the comments, it is better to use,
