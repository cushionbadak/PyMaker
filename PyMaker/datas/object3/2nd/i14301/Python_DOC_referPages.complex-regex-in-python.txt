Natural Text
I am trying to write a generic pattern using regex so that it fetches only particular things from the string. Let's say we have strings like GigabitEthernet0/0/0/0 or FastEthernet0/4 or Ethernet0/0.222. The regex should fetch the first 2 characters and all the numerals. Therefore, the fetched result should be something like Gi0000 or Fa04 or Et00222 depending on the above cases.I am not able to understand how shall I write the regular expression. The values can be fetched in the form of a list also. I write few more patterns but it isn't helping.
In regex, you may use  function.OROR
You can try this.This will make sure only digits from end come into play .
