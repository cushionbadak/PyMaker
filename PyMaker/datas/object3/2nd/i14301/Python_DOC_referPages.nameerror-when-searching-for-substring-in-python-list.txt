I have a list:I want to identify the three digits associated with 'item', but 'item' is not always in the same position, so I cannot use .I looked at the accepted answer in this StackOverflow post, and tried the following:I get the following error:In researched that error, but I haven't been able to find any examples/solutions that fit this particular situation.
That error is happening because you are trying to look into s before s has been defined in the for loop. A simple work around for that would be to break the statements apart into:
The simpler way to approach your problem is by using a list comprehensionIf you are assured that there is only one element like that in the list then you can aswell use list-indexesOr a better way would be to use  and a gen-exp.And to get the 3 digits from the string  you can do  where  has the value 
s only exists in the scope of the single statement:If you want to find all items you'll have to save them first into a list. I'm not sure if you want the index of each item or the text of each item or what but you could do:
I have tried the answer in your linked post too, and have run into the same problem. However, if you use a proper comprehension to create a list of booleans, it should work:prints out what is expected.
