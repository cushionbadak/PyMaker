Sometimes I am running unittest on specific modeule by pointing to   and if this module  imports some other python module that were updated, will importing done from this module be taken from the updated py source file or from the unupdated pyc file , or will the import lead to updated of dependent pyc file ?
From PEP 3147:CPython compiles its source code into "byte code", and for performance  reasons, it caches this byte code on the file system whenever the  source file has changes. This makes loading of Python modules much  faster because the compilation phase can be bypassed. When your source  file is foo.py , CPython caches the byte code in a foo.pyc file right  next to the source.If your source changes; CPython will recompile and re-cached the bytecode.Note that the above is for . This all changed in  in Python 3.2: PEP 3147: PYC Repository DirectoriesNote: When we refer to "CPython" here we are referring to the implementation of Python that you are most likely using from https://www.python.org as this behaviour (I believe) is implementation specific.
