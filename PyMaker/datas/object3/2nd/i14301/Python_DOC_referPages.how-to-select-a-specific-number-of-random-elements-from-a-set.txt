I have a set of 9 elements and I want to write a program which prompts the user for an integer , then displays  number of elements selected randomly from my set. This is what I tried:
Use the  function to pick  random elements without repetition:If all you need is an integer from the user, don't use ; stick to using  instead: gives you more than you bargained for; it executes any valid Python expression, letting the user do anything they want with your program.
You neeed to call the  method inside the for loop so that  random elements are printed.
