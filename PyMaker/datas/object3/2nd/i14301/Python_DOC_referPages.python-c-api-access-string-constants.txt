I wanted to implement a library I have written for python in C using the C-API of python. In python I can declare "constants" in my module by just stating:Those constants are then later returned by the functions offered by the module. I have some trouble doing the same thing in C. Here is what I got so far:I have already marked the problematic part. After I add string constants to the module with  how can I actually return them as a  from my methods? Do I need to increase the ref-counter when I return them?
Since PyModule_AddStringConstant(module, name, value) adds the constant to the module, it should be available from the module's dictionary which can be acquired with PyModule_GetDict(module). You can then access any attribute from the module via its dictionary using PyDict_GetItemString(dict, key) This is how you can access the constants from your module (after their definitions):To put this into context with your  function, you want something similar to:
