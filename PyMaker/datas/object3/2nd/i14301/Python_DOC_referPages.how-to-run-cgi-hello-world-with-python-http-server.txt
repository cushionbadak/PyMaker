I am using Windows 7 and Python 3.4.3. I would like to run this simple helloworld.py file in my browser:What I do is:1) Go to command line  (where python is installed)2) run: 3) Got to Firefox and type However, instead of "Hello World", the browser just prints the content of the hello.py file.How can I fix it?
From the  docs: can be enabled in the command line by passing  the  option:Put your script into :This defaults to  and describes directories to treat as containing CGI scripts.Open in the browser:where :I had to make it executable on POSIX: . 
I did this some time ago for Python2.7So in Python 3 you just need to change importsI do not know right now if the print-function in python 3 is orbut i guess it was with ()Edit: it is print()
I created a complete example for a friend. It is a complete demo you can run with 8 simple copy-paste ready lines of code. Enjoy.
