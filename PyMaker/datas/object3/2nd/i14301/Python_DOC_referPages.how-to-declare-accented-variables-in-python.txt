Natural Text
I need to write few basic scripts for students in Python, like this one: But apparently I cannot use accented characters while declaring variables. Is there any way out? ("mia_et√†" means "my_age" in Italian and I would like to avoid them to write grammar errors in their firts language while learning Python) 
Python 1 and 2 only support ASCII alphanumeric characters and  in identifiers.Python 3 supports all Unicode letters and certain marks in identifiers.Identifiers are normalized according to NFKC, so you can indifferently write U+0061 LATIN SMALL LETTER A followed by U+0301 COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT, or U+00E1 LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH ACUTE.
