I just found that a bunch of unit tests are failing, due a developer hasn't mocked out the dependency to a redis client within the test. I'm trying to give a hand in this matter but have difficulties myself.The method writes to a redis client:Later in the assert the result is retrieved:I managed to patch the redis client's get() and set() successfully.but I don't know how to set the  of  to what the  would set in the code, so that the test would pass.Right now this line fails the test:Any advice please?
Think you can use side effect to set and get value in a local dictnot tested this but I think it should do what you want
