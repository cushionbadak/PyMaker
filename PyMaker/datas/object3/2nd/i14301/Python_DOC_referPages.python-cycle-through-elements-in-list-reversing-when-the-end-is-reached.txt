I have a list that looks like:I need to cycle through this list one element at a time but when the end of the list is reached, the cycle needs to be reversed.For example, using itertools.cycle:I get:but what I need is:I need to cycle through  for a fixed number of times, say 200.
You can  the  of your  and  , eg:Which gives you:Note: If  is an exhaustable iterator, you will need to make a copy of  first. But given your example, this will be fine.
Do you actually need to cycle through the list, as in go forward and backwards forever?  Or just  the list?Will do what you describe.  The  built-in also works, but you need to  it, as it returns an iterator, e.g.:You can call  on either result to get an infinite iterator of the list concatenated with its reverse.
Make a copy of list a, reverse it, then append it.or based on a comment suggestion.
or (using 's approach, which works for all iterators)
