I'm new to programming and I'm making a small game as practice. A thing that I would like to implement is saving character's attributes as variables in an executable .py file and then to import that as a module to use those variables. The problem is that I would not like to hard-code the savefiles' names (so to give the player freedom to choose a savefile's name and to have multiple savefiles without them overwriting each other).So is there a way to basically make the module name a variable? Or perhaps there's an easier way of going about this.
where  would be the variable.
If I understand your question correctly - You want to store attributes of a character and want to be able to retrieve them later is that right? The way to do is to use pickle. Where you can serialize an object and store it to a file and later load it again. eg. If you've those attributes as a dictionary - you can do something like followingNote: All objects are not 'pickle'able - read the above document. With regards to your original question - yes a module can be attributed to a variable simply as followsorBut I don't think that's what you are specifically looking for. Hope that helps.
