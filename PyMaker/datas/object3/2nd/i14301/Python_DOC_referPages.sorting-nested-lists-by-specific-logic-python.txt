This question already has an answer here:Sorting a Python list by two fields                    6 answers                A nested list, I am trying to sort it based on the  element in ascending order, i.eWhen the  element is common in any of the nested lists, I am trying to sort it based on the  element. So, This is my code so far:I am able to sort it based on the  element, but am clueless how to sort it again on the  element without the remaining order getting messed up. Thanks!
This shows how to fix your  code.When you pass multiple arguments to , it returns a function that can be used to construct a tuple from a given sequence with values from the respective indices that were provided as arguments to .Tuples, like all sequences, can be compared lexicographically in Python. That means they will be compared from left-to-right, index by index, until one sequence overtakes the other. It also means that tuples make excellent keys for your sort.
Provided we have items in individual sublists in the reversed order, we can sort the whole list directly. So let's inform the  function that we want to consider reversed sublists:
