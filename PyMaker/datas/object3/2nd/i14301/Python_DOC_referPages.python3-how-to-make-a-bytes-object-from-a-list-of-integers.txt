I have an array of integers (all less than 255) that correspond to byte values  (i.e. ) how can I turn that into a bytes object that would look like   etc.Thanks
Just call the  constructor.As the docs say:â€¦ constructor arguments are interpreted as for .And if you follow that link:If it is an iterable, it must be an iterable of integers in the range , which are used as the initial contents of the array.So:Of course the values aren't going to be , because  means hexadecimal, and the decimal values  are the hexadecimal values . But if you had the hexadecimal values , you'd get exactly the output you want:
The  constructor takes an iterable of integers, so just feed your list to that:Output:See also:  Python 3 - on converting from ints to 'bytes' and then concatenating them (for serial transmission)
I think will workif you want hex you need to make it hex in the listin all cases if that value has an ascii representation it will display it when you try to print it or look at it ...
