I thought I understood how assignment works, but after running these two pieces of code I realized I am pretty confused now.This is in Python 3.3:When I  instead, I get  which is what I was expecting when printing .On another example:How come when assigning a list to second variable, like the first example shows, I get None when printing that second variable, but when assigning a string this does not happen? I ran it in the Python visualizer, but this still does not answer my question as to how/why this is.
That's because  reverses the list in place.Your code shoud be:or if you don't want to modify original list , copy numbers to hello:The documentation of the methods will always tell you if the method works in place (i.e. it change the object you are calling the method on to), or if it returns the result
As in document specified,  "reverse the elements of the list in place" while  "return a copy of word with only its first character capitalized."One works in-place while the other returns the result.
