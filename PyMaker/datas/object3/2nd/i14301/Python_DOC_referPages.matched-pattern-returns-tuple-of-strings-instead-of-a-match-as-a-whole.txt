I have a regular expression to fetch some links in HTML document.What I am intending to match is, if the  part exists match it if not, don't. If  part exists match it if not, don't. If  exists match it if not, don't. The same about  and the other one, if exists match if not, don't. Finally, if it has one of the following image formats match it if not, don't. I expect to get a list of links likeAnd the elements in the link continue to be filled with different combinations. Anyway, I am getting results as a tuple likeI don't want to get a tuple, I want the match to be represented as a whole. Only a complete link in each list element. How can I avoid getting a tuple as a result of the Regex match?

I.E. Updated CodeChanged it to search only for  in each link. You can find more on using  module at 6.2. re â€” Regular expression operations.
