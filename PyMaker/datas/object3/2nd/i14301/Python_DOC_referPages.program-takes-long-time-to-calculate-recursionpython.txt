my program takes long time to look up all the list of the vocab in the file in order to print all the possible words that can be created.How can i make it read more faster by not using any import? I'm new to python by the way :(For example, i have more than 4000+ vocabs/letters/words contain in 1 fileif you enter any letter, it will find all possible outcome in that file.it will display: (assuming all these 3 letters/words out of 4000+ are in that file that can be created)here is my program
It seems you want to generate all the permutations that can be created from the given letters and then check whether those correspond to any "real" word from some dictionary, kind of like for looking up what words can be created in a game of Scrabble.You can make your  function a bit faster (and a whole lot shorter) by just swapping the letters in the arguments to the recursive call. This way, you do not have to swap them back:You could also use  for this, e.g. like this, generating all the permutations for different word length using the given letters:According to IPython's , this is about three times faster than your implementation:However, you do not need to generate all the permutations at all! Just count the letters in the words and compare them to the counts of the letters you have available. You can use  for this, or create your own counter-like dictionary.This will print  and If you want to avoid using libraries (okay for practicing, but don't stick to this habit) you can create your own counter, e.g. like this:
