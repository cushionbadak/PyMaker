Natural Text
I'm attempting to recursively compare two directories that are structurally equivalent (XML documents in a decompressed excel file), and if any files differ, then overwrite the text from the first file with the text from the corresponding file in the second directory. In the Unix command line, you can easily output a script that will do this for two files using:I can then invoke the script with:However, I'm using Git Bash Windows 7, and there is no "ed" program installed. Is there an equivalent that can output a script and execute? If not, is there a way to install ed on git bash? I've already tried sudo apt-get install ed but the commands don't seem to be possible. My ultimate goal is to run this scripts using python with the subprocess library Any advice or suggestions are welcome. Thanks!
Yes, these tools are available for windows, consider Cygwin or MSyS.  
If you have git bash installed already, check in its bin folder. There should be a diff.exe that you can call directly. For me, that's (This is probably easier than trying to call a *nix-like shell from python on windows, and then run diff on that command line)Edit: Doing this from python, assuming the aforementioned diff.exe path: 
The GNU tools  http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/diffutils.htmAlso from  the  command, try  for parameters.Edit:  you have the python tag on this question, do you have python available?  If so then look at the  module in the standard library: https://docs.python.org/3/library/filecmp.htmlExamples here: http://pymotw.com/2/filecmp/
