This seems like a simple question but I've looked around and cannot find a simple answer.I've set up a virtual environment in my project folder using , and now I can run plain python in that environment. How can I run the Canopy GUI using this virtual environment instead? 
Your launch script will have to activate that virtual environment:    $ source myenv/bin/activate    $ python my_app.pyor the equivalent in Windows:    C:> /Scripts/activate.bat    C:> python my_app.pySee here for details.
