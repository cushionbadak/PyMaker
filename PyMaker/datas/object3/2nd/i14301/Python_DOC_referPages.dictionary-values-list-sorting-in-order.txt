I have a dictionary with a list of names as keys and values as lists of three (str, int, int):I need to format the data as:Register Number: Position, Name, salesRegister Number: Position, Name, salesRegister Number: Position, Name, salesWhere the register numbers are in numeric order and the Position, Name, and sales are associated to the correct register number.I can get the register numbers in order with converting to a new list, as below:But I can't get the reaminder of the associated values or keys to print. All I've been able to do is get one set of the other values to print for all register numbers, and I can't get the keys (names) to print at all.If it's not obvious - total Python newbie, and appreciate any light that can be shed on this!
Use an  - it's sort of a list-like dictionary.
Instead of creating a sorted  which only holds your sorting information, iterate over a sorted stafflist instead:
