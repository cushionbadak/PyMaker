Natural Text
In a hangman game I am making, I have a text file containing this:So using file io, I wrote this:But all I get is:How can I make it a list divided into the 4 subgroups, which are also in 4 sublists, and lastly how I remove the s?
If you change the single quotes to double quotes on lines 3, 4, and 5, then your file would be valid json, in which case you can easily parse the whole thing with the  module:data.json:Your script:Result:If you're absolutely committed to not changing a single thing in your file, including quote marks, then I suppose you could also use . But this is not the idiomatic solution.Incidentally,  is valid syntax, but if you want this element to have a length of three like its siblings, you probably meant to write 
The file contains a valid Python literal, so you can use the  function to parse it directly into a :You could also change the first line of the file to  and then use astatement instead of doing all that.
