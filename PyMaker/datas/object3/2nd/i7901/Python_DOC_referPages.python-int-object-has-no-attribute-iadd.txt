I declared a integer variable  with value .When i run this line:Everything goes well. But when i run this line:Python raises an exception:Why python throws this exception while in official python documentation for  module said  operator calls  method?
in official python documentation for  module said  operator calls  method?No, it says that  is equivalent to , not . is not equivalent to .  falls back to  and  if  is not present or returns .
It does not say that; what you're linking to in the documentation is the  module:  is equivalent to .The  module contains function equivalents for operators and similar things, it doesn't define standard Python operators. It doesn't say anything about .The relevant documentation is rather this: These methods are called to implement the augmented arithmetic assignments (, ...). These methods should attempt to do the operation in-place (modifying self) and return the result (which could be, but does not have to be, self). If a specific method is not defined, the augmented assignment falls back to the normal methods. ...So, an object can define  to override the behaviour of a  operation, but if such a method is not defined, it falls back to the default  behaviour.
