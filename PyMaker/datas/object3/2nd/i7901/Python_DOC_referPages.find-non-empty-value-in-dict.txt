I have a dict like this:and I want to find first non-empty value (and it's name, in this example ). There may be more than one non-empty value, but I only want the first one I find.How can I do this?
You could use  (dictionaries are unordered - this somewhat changed in Python 3.6 but that's only an implementation detail currently) to get one "not-empty" key-value pair:
Use an  which preserves the order of elements. Then loop over them and find the first that isn't empty:
Like this?
Edit 1 if the value is  or  we better use  instead of .  only check the  and skip others
