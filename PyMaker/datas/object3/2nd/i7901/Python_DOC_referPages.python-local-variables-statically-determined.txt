Python tutorial says that (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#python-scopes-and-namespaces)In fact, local variables are already determined statically.How to understand this? Based on what I knew static means that the type of a variable is determined at compile time. But it is not true considering for examplewhere the variable x is dynamically bound to objects of type int or string at runtime. Reference: Is Python strongly typed?
In addition to the other answer, consider the error produced by the following code.This will produce an error like "UnboundLocalError: local variable 'x' referenced before assignment" because it is determined that  is a local variable in  so it should be found in the local scope, negating the global definition.
Their existence, and whether a variable lookup is local or global, is determined at compile time.
