I'm trying to learn the ins and outs of symbolic manipulation in python (I'm a beginner).I have the following basic code, and the output is giving me an error telling me that it "can't convert expression to float".What's wrong with this code:
This is a classic example of what is said in PEP-8 about wildcard imports:Wildcard imports (  ) should be avoided, as they make it unclear which names are present in the namespace, confusing both readers and many automated tools.The problem is that you need to work with  class, but using  function instead which works on  objects, not  objects.When you writeyou are importing in your module namespace everything that  package providing at the top level (and there are a lot of stuff, much of that you don't need at all), including  class.After next statementyou are importing everything in  module, including , which overwrites previously imported  class.Considering this your example may be written likegives usP. S.: I've removed  import since it is not used in given example.
The problem here is that both the  and the  package define a function called .Importing them as  and then  overrides the  with .Better always use  and then call your functions  or (if as lazy as me) do  and then . Be sure to do so with the math package as well. This method will save you a lot of hassle in the future and makes your code easier to understand for others.
