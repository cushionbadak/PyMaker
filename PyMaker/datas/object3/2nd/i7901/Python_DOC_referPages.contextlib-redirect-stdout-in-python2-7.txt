I use Python2.7 and I want the function: contextlib.redirect_stdout.I mean, I want to redirect the output of specific function (not the all program).The problem is - only Python3 supports "context.redirect_stdout" and no Python2.7. Someone know how can I use the same function in Python2.7 or to implement the same idea?Thanks in advance
Something like this should do the job if you're not worried about re-using the same context manager object.
