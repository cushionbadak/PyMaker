I have a python class which has multiple methods. I have defined my methods via  instance and I want to call other methods of my class from inside my main function(). I think I need  parameter for calling my other functions from my main function and I want to pass this parameter to my  when I create an instance of my class. I got this error:The problem is that I have not  parameter when I create my instance. I tried to remove  keyword from my method definition and remove all  parameter using, but this does not work.
Only use  if you are creating a function that you'd normally want to tie to specific classes but do not need any other context. For example, the  function is a static method because it is a utility function you'd often use when working with strings, namespacing it to the already-existing  type (which pre-exists as a class) makes sense there.You appear to be using classes as a namespace instead. Don't do that. Use a module for your functions, and you don't have to worry about the special scoping rules that apply to classes. Only use a class when you need to bundle state with functionality.If you insist on using classes with static methods anyway, you are stuck with hardcoding the class name everywhere:You could make use of classmethods instead so you have a reference to the class object:This has the added advantage that you can use inheritance.However, using a module is the correct way to organise a set of functions into a namespace. Put everything into a  file in your package, and use importing;Now all globals in my_module are bundled into one module object, and no prefixing or  references are needed.
