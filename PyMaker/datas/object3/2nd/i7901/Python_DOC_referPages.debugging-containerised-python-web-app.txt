I have made this first docker container, and it works as per the .after running this command:docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v  ~/Development/my-Docker-builds/pythonReact/statics/:/statics/ -d   ciasto/pythonreact:v2and when I open the page  i get error:but if I run this application normally, i.e. not containerised directly on my host machine: it works fine.So I want to know what is causing server error. How do I debug a python app that runs via container to know what is causing it to not work. or what am I doing wrong.
Mainly, this:Should be:I've got your application up and running with your 'Hello World'Did these changes:1) The mentioned 2) This Dockerfile (removed VOLUME)3) Moved the non-static app.py to a proper place: root of the project.4) Run with: , then You should see  from terminal output. And  in browser.I've forked your Github project and did a pull-request.Edit:If you need make changes when you develop, run the container with a volume to override the app that is packed in the image. For example:You can have as many volumes as you want, but the app is already packed in the image and ready to push somewhere.
You can use  to debug Python code in CLI. To achieve this, you just have to import  and call  where you would like to have a breakpoint in your Python code. Basically you have to insert the following line where you want a breakpoint:Then you have to run your Python code interactively.You could do that by running  interactively in your container withand then running manually your app withWhen the code will reach the breakpoint, it will pause and a prompt will be shown where you can type commands to inspect your execution.For more detail about the available commands, you can give a look at the pdb commands documentation.Also, I noted that you are building your image using the  base image which is a (very) light Python image which does not include all is commonly included in a Python distribution.From the Python images page:This image does not contain the common packages contained in the default tag and only contains the minimal packages needed to run python. Unless you are working in an environment where only the python image will be deployed and you have space constraints, we highly recommend using the default image of this repository.Maybe using the standard  image instead would solve your issue.
As a quick tip for debugging containerized applications. If your application is failing with container crashed/stopped. Just launch the container image with  as   then manually start the application once you have the container shell you can debug the application as per normal Linux system.  is straightforward to override as per  just use  flag with  command.
