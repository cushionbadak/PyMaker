Hi I am trying to plot a numpy array of strings in y axis, for examplevs a float array with equal length. The string array I am working with is very large ~ 100 million entries. One of the solutions I had in mind was to convert the string array to unique integer ids, for example,and then . But I cannot afford to run a for loop to convert the array of strings to an array of unique integer ids. In an initial search I could not find a way to map strings to an unique id without using a loop. Maybe I am missing something, but is there a smart way to do this in python?EDIT - Thanks. The solutions provided use  where  is the returned unique integer array. But it seems like np.unique is O(N*log(N)) according to this ( numpy.unique with order preserved), but pandas.unique is of order O(N). But I am not sure how to get  from pandas.unique. plotting data i guess can be done in O(N). So I was wondering is there a way to do this O(N)? perhaps by hashing of some sort?
 used with the  argument allows you to obtain the inverted index.such that  returns the original array .This can be easily used to plot the data.
you can factorize your strings:
You can use the numpy  funciton to return a unique array of values? also return the value and number of counts:Does this help at all?
