In my Flask web app I have a login system. When user logged, in the table of my database I want to update the datetime when user made the last login.I'm using this code:but I receive the error:what it is wrong?thanks.
As the error says, a keyword in a function call argument list cannot be an expression, such as , but an identifier. Instead you should pass  a dictionary of column, expression pairs:Note that since you commit right away, there's no need to synchronize the session, since all state will be expired anyway.You could also make some changes that'd improve your code's readability. For example instead ofjustNo point in checking if a list of 1 item contains something, compared to just testing equality.Finally, you create a new  class and an instance  of it, but you commit a different session: , which you should've probably been using all along. What this means is that your updates will not take place, as that session's transaction is not actually committed.
