I'm using  on python to list all the files/folders in one folder:When I print "lista" I get all the paths in a single-element list:So in order to separate them and get each file I first export them to a .txt, call it back and delete Print "content":Is there a way to do it directly without the export part? Thanks in advance!
first, you souldn't use subprocess to call ls. For your purpose the glob or os module is the better choice.Why do you get "\n" strings? Well, you just call a subprocess which will return it's output as string.With your suprocess-ls solution, you could now go on and split your string by "\n", to get a real python list.Much better would be using glob instead. https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.htmlYou would get exactly what you want, but it's the much faster, safer, pythonic and better solution.
I changed the subprocess for this, don't know if correct or the same but so far it's working well.
