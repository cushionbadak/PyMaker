Can someone give me an example of how to use the following tickFormatters. The docs are uninformative to me.for example I might think that would set my tick labels to be dollar signed and comma sep for thousands places alabut instead I get an index error.For  docs say:Set the strings from a list of labelsdon't really know what this means and when I try to use it my tics disappear. 
The  works indeed by supplying a string that can be formatted using the  method. So the approach of using  goes in the right direction. However from the documentation we learnThe field used for the value must be labeled x and the field used for the position must be labeled pos.This means that you need to give an actual label  to the field. Additionally you may want to specify the number format as  not to have the decimal point.The  is of little use here. As you found out, you would need to provide a list of labels. Those labels are used for the index, starting at 0. So using this formatter would require to have the x axis start at zero and ranging over some whole numbers.Example:Here, the ticks are placed at  and the respective letters from the list  are used as labels.
