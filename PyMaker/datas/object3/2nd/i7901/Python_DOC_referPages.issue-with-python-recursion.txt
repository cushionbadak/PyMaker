I have the following code written in python 2.7 to find n time Cartesian product of a set (AxAxA...xA)-This works properly when n=1. But changing the parameter value from cartesian_product(events,events,1) to cartesian_product(events,events,2) doesn't work. Seems there's an infinite loop is running. I can't figure where exactly I'm making a mistake.
Output:you can also pass string in your events list but it'll print string in tuple also.
When you pass the reference to the global variable  to the recursive call, you are modifying the list that  also references. This means that  is growing as you iterate over it, meaning the iterator never reaches the end.You don't need a global variable here. Return the computed product instead.If you want to perserve the order of the original argument, use  and  instead.
inside the recursive call  you are passing the list prod, and you are again appending values to it, so it just grows over time and the inner loop never terminates. Perhaps you might need to change your implementation.
