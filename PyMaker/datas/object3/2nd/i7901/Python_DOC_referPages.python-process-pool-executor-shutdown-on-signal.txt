I use supervisor to run some script like this. so when supervisor is stopped or interrupt, i try to gracefully exit from the script. This is my current codeThis works fine and now i am confused when i read about executor.shutdown(wait=True/False). So i tried that and i couldn't get the executor to shutdown (It just hangs). please help me out with these questions
1) Apparently, shutdown stops all the existing messages being processed, but sys.exit() just comes out. (in the docs https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html)2) If somebody got stuck in the same place, use some global variable to signal shutdown.
