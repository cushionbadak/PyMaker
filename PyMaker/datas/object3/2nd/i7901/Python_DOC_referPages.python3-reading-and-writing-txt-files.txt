This question already has an answer here:What does “SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'” mean in Python?                    6 answers                I'm somewhat new to Python, but I have enough under my belt to know what I'm doing. What I'm trying to do is write a few lines for a .txt file (as well as a variable), and then print 5 of those characters.It then creates the file without issue, but when I add to the code, it gives me a syntax error for file.read, and I have no clue why. I've been on the internet for a few hours now and I can't find anything. Either I'm extremely bad at google searching and I'm an idiot, or something's broken, or both. Any tips/ideas? :/
You're writing Python 3 code. In Python 3,  is a function, not a special statement. You need parentheses for function calls:
