Natural Text
I have the following dataframeand I would like to look up the word/sentence on the left with the sentences on the right and if there is a match on the max first two words (e.g. 'potato la' and leave out 'best') then it would give a score. I have already used two different methods:And which I found on the internet.The second one works fine, except that it tries to match the entire phrase. How can I match the words in the first column with the sentences in the second column so that it ultimately gives me a 'Yes' they are in the sentence (or partially) or 'No' they aren't.
I had the best success using FuzzyWuzzy's partial ratio on this one. It will give you the ratio of partial % match between Column1 "tomato fruit" and Column2 "tomatos are not a fruit" and the rest of the way down the columns. See results:You can consider any FuzzyWuzzy score > 60 to be a good partial match, i.e. yes the words in Column1 are most likely in the sentence in Column2.row 1- score 67, row 2- score 71, row 3- score 80, row 4- score 75
