Natural Text
I am using matplotlitb to plot a box figure but there are some missing values (NaN). Then I found it doesn't display the box figure within the columns having NaN values. Do you know how to solve this problem? Here are the codes.Here is the final figure and some of the treatments are missing the box.
You can remove the s from the data first, then plot the filtered data.To do that, you can first find the s using , then perform the bitwise inversion of that boolean array using the  operator. Use that to index the data array, and you filter out the s. In a complete example (adapted from here) For 1D data:For 2D data:For 2D data, you can't simply use the mask above, since then each column of the data array would have a different length. Instead, we can create a list, with each item in the list being the filtered data for each column of the data array.A list comprehension can do this in one line: I'll leave it as an exercise to the reader to extend this to 3 or more dimensions, but you get the idea.
