I wrote a function to handle arrays.I passed the 2D array into the function as "someFunc(*dna)" but inside the function, it turned out to be 3D.Why has the dimension changed? How can I keep the same dimension of the argument I passed inside the function?Returns
There are two issues - what  does, and what's the shape of a tuple.The proper use of *arg is to receive elements of a tuple:Giving 3 arguments works, giving 1, even a tuple does not:Adding a * in the input unpacks them:Same goes for an array: is a tuple, regardless of what is provided:Taking the shape of a tuple amounts to taking the shape of the array formed from the tuple
Because  collects passed arguments into tuple. So what you have done equals To keep the same dimension, just remove * before .
