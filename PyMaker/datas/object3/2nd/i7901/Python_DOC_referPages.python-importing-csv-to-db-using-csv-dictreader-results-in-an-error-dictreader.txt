I was trying for importing data from the csv file to the sqlite db using python script.I have a DB table with the name NSETCS:On running the code, I get an error:  Error: DictReader instance has no attribute 
You are not reading the contents into a list here:That only puts the reader into a list. Use  instead:Not that you need to do this; you could just loop over the object directly:thenDo indent the code that loops to be part of the  statement, because you need to keep the file open to read until the loop is done:I'd not catch exceptions; just use the connection as a context manager (just like you do for the file) so that your inserts are committed only if no exceptions took place: doesn't really care if you pass in  objects, or ; the database is happy to accept either for numeric columns. You can use your  dictionaries directly if you don't convert to , except for the  column (I used an alias in the dictionary for that one). This simplifies your loop somewhat.
