Hi I have two times in slightly different formats and I need to work out the difference. The first was parsed from a ISO 8601 date using dateutil.parserI'm not sure what I need to do to parse them into the same format, but my two dates are:If they were both in datetime format I could just subtract one from the other, so I need to chop the milliseconds off both (coz that's not relevant to me), and tell python the new strings are both datetimes?
Since you're already using dateutil, what's wrong with just removing the timezone (or adding it to the other) and subtracting them?You can call  on your dates to remove the microseconds.
You could transform the second datetime (that is a timestamp) into the first one with this code:or:Then, you can calculate the difference between them.I hope this help. Greetings!
Probably you want to use this methoddatetime.strptime(date_string, format)Also remember you can get rid of elements you do not want in your date (Like milliseconds) when you declare the specified date, as inclass datetime.datetime(year, month, day, hour=0, minute=0, second=0,  microsecond=0, tzinfo=None, *, fold=0)For more on this topic you can always read the python docs, you can find the same information I just gave you and more here:https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.htmlHope it helped.
