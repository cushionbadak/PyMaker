Suppose we're checking if there's any odd numbers in a . The most direct way is:The  function checks if there's any odd numbers in a , once an odd number is found, it returns . But this seems a bit verbose. A more concise way using  is as follow:But this will iterate through all elements and is unnecessary, because once an odd number is found the result is surely .So, are there any other ways to do this?
You can use the  function to reduce the verbosity:Note however,  is pretty much the same as you had originally just generalized, so don't expect a speed improvement:
first of all let's write small indicator function for "oddness" likethen we can write our indicator for "has at least one odd number" using  with /Python 2.*Python 3.*or with generator expressionExamples:
Another way. you can use
