can you help me a little bit i'm stuck somewhere in my python code.i'm sorry if my english is bad, but i'll try my best.To make a line of the data i sorted the x and y. But then when i scattered my plot, the colors where wrong. I know it's because i didn't sorted the colors. But if i try to sort them i fail. Because of the variable value:You can't sort this.please help me, i don't know what to do
Implementing quantik's suggestion to use collections.OrderedDict makes sorting the keys possible and may yield the desired result:produces this output:
To make a line of the data i sorted the x and y. But then when i scattered my plot, the colors where wrong.Your expected results are not clear, but I have the impression you interested in directly plotting the data.I know it's because i didn't sorted the colors. If you are only interested in plotting data from the dictionary, sorting is unnecessary as we can unpack the dictionary in parallel.But if i try to sort them i fail. Right now, you are unpacking parts of your data separately, which causes misalignment. You may be mistakenly tempted to sort the data to correct this misalignment.  Instead, try unpacking with  loops or a list comprehension (note  is used instead of the builtin  variable):Alternatively, you can substitute the last two lines with the following, which unpacks all  data in parallel using :
