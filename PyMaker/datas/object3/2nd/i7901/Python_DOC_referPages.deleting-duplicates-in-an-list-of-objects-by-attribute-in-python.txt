I have a function for which I would like to go through a list of custom objects (with given midpoints) one at a time and take objects with unique midpoints and put them in a new list.  The following code gives me an error that the list has no attribute called 'midPoint', but I am not sure how to get the code to search the list for objects with matching midpoints. Does anyone have recommendations?
You may use  along with  function to remove the duplicate entries from your list. For example:Here, I have added the  function to your  class to display the value of  with your class' object:Note: This solution won't maintain the order of elements in orginal list. The new list will be sorted based on the value of .Below is the complete code for your reference:
If i understood correctly, this may work as you asked. 
Use 
We can use a dict, with setdefault, using the key as a tuple of the midPoint and the value as a list, which we then append to.Then we have a dict with a list for each value of midPoint, and we can iterate out the [0]th element:If you want all those with duplicates removed, we can do the same, but return only if our lists length is 1:
If you don't care about the order of the objects in the new list, you may use a  to achieve this:Create a dictionary with key as tuple of your  value, and values as the object of  class. Then call  method to get the list of values i.e. list of  objects in your case.However, in Python 3.x  return an object of  type. In order to convert it to list, explicitly type-cast it to  as:
