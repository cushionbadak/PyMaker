Natural Text
I'm trying to create a text-delimited file containing the data from the "Actions" table on webpages like this one: http://stats.swehockey.se/Game/Events/300978I would like each line to include the game # (from the end of the URL) and then the text from the line on the table. For example:I haven't been able to get each row to actually separate. I've tried parsing through each row and column, using a list of stripped strings, and searching by different tags, classes, and styles.Here's what I currently have: Thanks for any help or guidance!
First of all, you don't have to construct the CSV data manually, Python provides a built-in  module for that.Then, since you are up to "actions" only, I'd identify the "actions" table and find the events-only rows. This can be done with the help of a filtering function checking the first cell to not be empty: Note that I'm using  here.
