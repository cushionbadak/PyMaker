I just spent ~30 minutes debugging and double checking Python & C# code, to find out that my struct.pack was writing the wrong data. When I separated this into separate  calls, it works fine.This is what I had beforeThis is what I have nowWhy does the first variation not write the data that I expected? What is so different than writing these separately?(File is opened in binary mode, platform is 64 bit Windows, Python 3.5)
Presumably because, as the  documentation clearly states:Note By default, the result of packing a given C struct       includes pad bytes in order to maintain proper alignment       for the C types involved; similarly, alignment is taken       into account when unpacking. This behavior is chosen so       that the bytes of a packed struct correspond exactly to       the layout in memory of the corresponding C struct. To       handle platform-independent data formats or omit implicit       pad bytes, use standard size and alignment instead of       native size and alignment: see Byte Order, Size, and       Alignment for details.
