The insertion-order of keyword arguments is now guaranteed to be preserved in the 3.6 version of Python. This has been made possible by a change to the underlying representation of the  object. However, it has been stated - somewhat strenuously - that the order preservation of the  object should not be relied upon in general as of yet. The docs explain the situation this way: The order-preserving aspect of this new implementation is considered  an implementation detail and should not be relied upon (this may  change in the future, but it is desired to have this new dict  implementation in the language for a few releases before changing the  language spec to mandate order-preserving semantics for all current  and future Python implementations; this also helps preserve  backwards-compatibility with older versions of the language where  random iteration order is still in effect, e.g. Python 3.5).PEP 468 does not mention anything about copying the keyword arguments. But there are times when one may wish to iterate over a copy of the  arguments (e.g. while mutating  in a for loop):My question is: should the order of the object resulting from  be considered guaranteed as well? Or should this also be considered an implementation detail? Is the  only mostly dead?
The answer would be implementation dependent.Assuming the highly popular CPython, the answer would be yes. As you can see from the  function (line 2615) in the  code, along with increasing references for the values, the function starts the copying with the piece this, after  had been assigned the dicitionary object (or more exactly, an explicit casting of the original  into a ).Since the keys preserve their order, and considering the current form of storage (as seen in Jim's explanation here), the resulting dictionary should be ordered the same way.Again, that is currently considered an implementation detail and you should not make any of your code depend on it.
