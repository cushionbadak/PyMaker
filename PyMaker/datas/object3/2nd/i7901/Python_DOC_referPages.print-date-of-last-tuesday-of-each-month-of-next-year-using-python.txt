How can I print the date of the last Tuesday of each month for next year using Python.For example the first line outputted would be: 30/Jan/2018I do not want to have the full name of the month only the first 3 characters!Currently I have figured out how to get the next year:Can anyone please help?
The calendar module is perfect for this:You can use calendar.month_abbr which is an array of   abbreviated months just like you want. is an array representing the days of the week starting at Monday so Tuesday would be .Output:
I would also suggest the pandas DateOffset object .Describes monthly dates in last week of month like "the last Tuesday  of each month"
