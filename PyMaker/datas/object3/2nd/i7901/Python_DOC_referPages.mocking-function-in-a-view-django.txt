I'm new to writing unit tests, this question might be silly but I'm posting this after a lot of research.I'm trying to write a unit test for a function in the centralized/views.py which is being used in a lot of other views.The function looks like thisI need help in mocking the request in the unit test, since this function is called by other views I'm not sure how to test this function independently without relying on the url path.What is the approach to mock this request?Thanks
You can use mock.patch as a function decorator, or even better as a contextmanager:https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#patch[edit] sorry, I was reading a little too fast. You can create fake request objects via Django's RequestFactory:https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/testing/advanced/#the-request-factory
