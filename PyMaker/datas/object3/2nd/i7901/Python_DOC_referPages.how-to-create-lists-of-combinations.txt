I have generated all possible combinations using elements in a list, as explained here. Now, I would like to know how to save each combination as a list.I get this output:I would get something like this:Is there a simple way to implement it?
You could use  like so:Which would return a  (Python3) or a  (Python2). If you want a  just cast it to list:This would convert the inner tuple structure to a list:If you want to also flatten the tuple to get the following result:You should change the first argument of the  for this:
If you're saying you have a list of tuples, and you want a list of lists, you can convert it usingor you could use .In Python 2:In Python 3:
Following the example linked by the OP:gives EDIT:The same as one-liner:
You could use a list comprehension with :Instead of the list-comprehension you could also use a generator expression:
