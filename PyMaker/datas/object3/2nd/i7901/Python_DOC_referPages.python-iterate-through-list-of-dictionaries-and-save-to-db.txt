Im new to python and trying to save raw post data in python into mysql.I want to iterate over each element in the json that is posted and save all the data to DB.json list of objects:  (30 objects with each 11 columns)'json_test' table desc:CREATE TABLE  () ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;UPDATED to save data to DB:My py code looks like:UPDATED code result:Only the last record seems to be inserting
Replace this messwithSummation object is redundant,also name  is unclear and makes me think like it is some kind of index when it is not: it is a  object,we don't need to create connection for each object from  because it is an expensive operation,we don't need to create  object on each iteration as well (it remains unchanged),storing columns names in / will save us from writing them twice: in a query and in values extraction.creating binds dynamically based on number of columns saves us from typo when we've missed/added too many bind aliases
 does the opposite of what you claim; it converts a Python object into a string.The result of  is already a Python datastructure. You don't need to do anything else with it.
