Just starting to learn Python and this is my problem:I am taking input a and b and if a < b then then output is a to b in ascending order. If a > b then the output is in descending order. When I put in a < b it works but it gives me nothing when a >b. This is the code:This is the output when a > b:Process finished with exit code 0
When a is 10 and b is 2 your code is doing:Maybe you want to do:
Okay so what you want to do is this....
How about
You can change  to the following:and your code will work just fine. You can also shorten your code by doing it like this:
Because the last value  prints is the biggest value for  that is less than . If  is less than  and the  is positive, there is no number which satisfies that condition: will never be smaller than 1 (where  is a positive integer)Instead, do this before you range:which will ensure a is always the smaller number moving forward, by swapping their values if that is not the case.If you want to preserve the ascending/descending order:Then, after building the list
