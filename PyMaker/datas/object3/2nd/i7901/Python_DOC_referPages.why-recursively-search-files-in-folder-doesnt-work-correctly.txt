I need help to understand why this piece of code didn't work as expect.My directory structure looks like this:The script - tryWalkDir.py is intented to search all the .cpp files. I don't know why [TryCPP/tryHashMap/tryHashMap.cpp,TryCPP/tryHashMap/tryHashMap.cpp] collect 2 times?tryWalkDir.py
The error is happening because you are calling  multiple times without realizing it.  recurses for you into subdirectories. However, you then call  for each subdirectory in your current directory. This will actually cause a file at depth  to appear  times in your output array.To fix your code, simply remove the loopAs an aside, you should probably use  instead of manually concatenating slashes throughout your code. For example,  could read . This is the way suggested by the  documentation:To get a full path (which begins with top) to a file or directory in dirpath, do .
