Given the following unordered tab delimited file:The goal is to generate the following output (tab delimited):I have created the following script to achieve the goal:Now I intend to print the desired output using two dict created earlier (root and link). I am not sure how to go about doing this in python. But I know that we could write following in perl to achieve the result:Could you please help me achieve the desired output in python 3.x?
I see here next problems:reading relations from file;building hierarchy from relations.writing hierarchy to file.Assuming that height of hierarchy tree is less than default recursion limit (equals to  in most cases), let's define utility functions for this separate tasks.UtilitiesParsing of relations can be done withBuilding hierarchy can be done withPython >=3.5Python <3.5: extended iterable unpacking was added with PEP-448, but it can be replaced with  likeHierarchy export to file can be done withUsageAssuming that file path is :gives us and our hierarchy isfinally export it to file called :(we use  to get hierarchy like in your desired output file)P. S.If you are not familiar with  generators we can define  function likePython >= 3.5Python < 3.5
