I am drawing dozens of functions as subplots, by storing pure functions as list. I find many different functions are considered the same. Here is a simplified example, where two cosine functions are drawn.The plot shows both  functions, but one should be .

Your  list contains two identical functions because of how you defined it. Both functions return , where  has its final value, 2. You could copy  to another variable to get this to work:
