I'm trying to create a database from an external sqlite file using this python class, but I'm getting this error message: query() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were givenI think I understand the issue, but I don't know a way around it, can someone point me in the right direction?
Your  only takes one argument  but you pass in  (implicitly) and  and . Given that you don't use the  you should probably only call:
if you take a look at your declaration of queryfor your class you will see that you got two parameters: self and arg However when you call your query function, there are three parameters that are passed: the implicit self that you don't need to mention, the db and the parameter. If you want arg to be a multiple argument you will need to rewrite it like this : *arg. Otherwise, you can modify your query declaration for three parameters.Keep in mind that *arg is iterable and you might need to deconstruct it before passing it to your other functions.For further reading about *args and **kwargs you can visit this website: *args and **kwargs in python
