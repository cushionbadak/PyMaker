I have a tar file whose name I am successfully able to read and store in a variable, But how do I extract just "Mona" from this file name and store it in a variable?(The filename structure for the tar file will be same as above for all tar files with the name occuring after "es-archive--{Name}-AB" , so a solution which returns any name obeying this format)Thanks!

 module is good for this kind of stuff.  You may think of it as the inverse of .  Demo: 
Easiest way I can think of:Split the filename on the  character.Get the 3rd item from the resulting list (index 2).In code:Simple one-liner. This is of course working off your example. I would need more sample filenames to account for possible variations and know for certain if this will always work.
