Does anyone know how to convert a matplotlib plot into a panda dataframe (either as a PNG or a JPG) without having to save the graphic to a file first. The code here for SQL Server 2017 outputs a varbinary(max) https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/advanced-analytics/tutorials/sqldev-py3-explore-and-visualize-the-data using pandas and pickle but it is not recognised by SSRS as a valid PNG (or JPG) graphic. The aim to is get Python graphics into SSRS the same way as we do for R graphics via sp_execute_external_script in SQL and a varbinary(max) output.
The heart of your problem has nothing to do with the  dataframe per se - the dataframe is only the container of a pickled object here.Instead of pickling the figure, my guess is you should save the figure to a Python file-like object like io.StringIO (Python 3) or Stringio (python 2)If the PNG must be contained in a  dataframe, that can be done too, but I don't know if this data will make much sense...:Whenever you return  now as a , my guess is the contents will be exactly the PNG file.Curious to hear if this works!
