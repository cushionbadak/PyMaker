variables.pymain.pyi have such error:SyntaxError: import * is not allowed in function 'run' because it contains a nested function with free variables
This should do for path variable from other fileHope this helps!
You should be very careful with global variables. It is considered a better practice to avoid using global variables, updating them in different locations in the code. It should not be a problem if those are only constants, though. Usually I do it this way:variables.py:main.pyIf you are working with path strings, you may also want to take a look in the documentation for the  module. It helps making path descriptors compatible with the different platforms, among other useful things.
