I’m struggling with urllib.request and unicode. I have a script that gets a list of city names, builds geonames.org API-request URLs from them and parses the output XML Data to display geonames information exactly in the way I need it. The script works fine as long as the cities names don’t contain any non-ASCII character like ö in Köln (I have to use german city names).When I switch  with  the Script exits with the error message . One other thing that does not work is city names with blanks in it like . Am I using the wrong method to request the XML or is it that I have to decode my city names before building the URL (which is nearly definitely the case for two-word cities as when I use  it works)?Thanks for your help!
