I have a Python script I wrote to be called from the command line.  I am writing a GUI wrapper but do not want to change the main function.  In the GUI code, I am calling the script using  but the input is not visible in 's  list.  How do I pass the input such that it would be visible to ?Here is a test script I have saved as  (made it executable ):Here is what I get when calling this from the command line:Here is what I get when calling this from within a python shell:How do I get  to show up in ?
The safest way to do this is to simply remove :The other option is to combine the list of inputs into a single string:I am not completely sure why the original method (with a list of inputs and  fails) fails.  Regardless, to avoid running unintended commands/code it is best to avoid using  (note on when you should use ).
