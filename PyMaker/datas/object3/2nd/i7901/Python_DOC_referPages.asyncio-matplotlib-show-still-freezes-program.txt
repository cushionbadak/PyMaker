I wish to run a simulation while at the same time output its progress in a plot. I've been looking through a lot of examples of threading and multiprocessing, but they are all pretty complex. So I thought with Python's new  library this should be easier.I found an example (How to use 'yield' inside async function?) and modified it for my cause:QuestionI added a simple  and the program still freezes. I thought with  I could run it in parallel? Obviously my knowledge is still lacking.An example that does the following would be really helpful:Add a line to a plot (of ) everytime  returns a value.
First of all, I misunderstood asyncio, it doesn't make run things in parallel (use asyncio for parallel tasks).It seems the only thing that worked for me was  (Plotting in a non-blocking way with Matplotlib).  opened a window, but it didn't show anything and  freezes the program. It seems that  is deprecated and using  gives the problem that the final result closes when the program is finished. Also  didn't make the plot draw a line.Working codeNotesYou get however a deprecated message: , which you can suppress with: .I'm not sure if  was actually necessary for my use case...Difference between  and  for who's interested: Multiprocessing vs Threading Python
