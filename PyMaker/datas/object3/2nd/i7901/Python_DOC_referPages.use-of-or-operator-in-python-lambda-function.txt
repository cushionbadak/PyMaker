There is a code example in the O Reilly Programming Python book which uses an OR operator in a lambda function. The text states that "[the code] uses an or operator to force two expressions to be run".How and why does this work? 
Every funnction in Python returns a value. If there is no explicit return statement it returns .  as boolean expression evaluates to . Thus,  returns , and the right hand side of the  expression is always evaluated.
The Boolean  operator returns the first occurring truthy value by evaluating candidates in sequence from left to right. So in your case, it is used to first print  since that returns  (considered falsey), it will then evaluate  which ends your program. Python Documentation: The expression  first evaluates ; if  is true, its value is  returned; otherwise,  is evaluated and the resulting value is  returned.
