My program is to iterate through coordinates(list) and check to see if 3 coordinates come out True from the ocoords(list) and return or possibly get that False value(coordinate)I'm trying to find an efficient way of finding similar values in two lists that are structured differently but have the same coordinates.Then my next list is structured like this (with specified coordinates that should go together...So how would you go about this? I'm novice to this, so sorry for the question. I thought of using Boolean, but then I need to get that value that is False.I want to see if any of the coordinates are in ocoords [0] and if they are, but one isn't give me that value.
You can use  with a predicate that checks for items in  that are also contained in :If the items are aligned, you can go faster with  and not having to check for the containment of each item, rather check until there is a pair-wise mismatch:
