I am trying to create a simple stock management program as a learning exercise but I can't seem to find a way to save the changes I make while the program is open to a file. Here is the python code.And then there is the .json file I am trying to write to The program runs fine without any problems, especially when I was just using a python dictionary instead of the json file, the only problem is that it won't write to memory so when I close the program I lose any data I entered when it was open.
When you load from a file and parse it using json you get a dict/list.  You are then working with it but you don't write it back to the file.  I'm guessing you would want to do that when exiting.  Something like:https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.dump
Say "data" is the variable you want to write and update on each iteration then we use "wb" as used in the code below to write json file.
