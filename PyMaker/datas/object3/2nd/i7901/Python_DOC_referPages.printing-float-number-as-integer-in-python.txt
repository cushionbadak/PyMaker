So I want to print a float number as an integer. I have a float called "percentage" which should be like percentage=36.1 and I want to print it as an int number, with digits after comma missing.I use the following code, which is more like using C logic:But that gives an error. How would I have to reform it so that it works in Python? What I want to print is:"The moisture percentage is 36%."

the string format specification has a percentage already (where  is ):where the  is the specifier for the percent format and the  prevents any digits after the comma to be printed. the -sign is added automatically.usually the percentage is just a fraction (without the factor of 100). with  in the first place there would be no need to divide by .

You can see the different formatting options in the python docs.
