I have a variable  in my code that takes only three values . When use the  sys.getsizeof() I get  which is the size of an object in bytes. QuestionI was wondering if it's possible in python to convert  to char with  size. I used the  but  printed .
It is not possible for a single byte, since python objects always include the overhead of the Python implementation.Your use case is only relevant in practice, if you have larger amounts of such values (thousands or millions, e.g. an image). In that case you would use for example the  or  objects as containers. Another approach would be using  arrays.
