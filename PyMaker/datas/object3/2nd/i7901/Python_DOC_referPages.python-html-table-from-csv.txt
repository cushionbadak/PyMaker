I've been trying to read a CSV file into a HTML table through Python for a little while now. Currently my code looks like: This is the output of the written table:https://www.w3schools.com/code/tryit.asp?filename=FG5TPW9EY3LTIt has got all the HTML table tags throughout along with a few errors in names and odd additions that shouldn't be there.The header line is clean besides the odd addition in front of the year cell.Here is a link to the csv: https://uploadfiles.io/6joj6If anyone could help to 'clean up' the table by adjusting the code it would be much appreciated.Thanks in advance,EDIT: Thanks for the help, the html tags were rectified by correcting the backslash to forward-slashes, the addition to the year cell was corrected by changing the encoding option. I discovered that the \xa0 was an encoding error or something along those lines and used:  to replace the additions.
Do not generate HTML "by hand", use  module instead. Much easier and more robust. Also, you have two typos in your code -  should be , and  should be .
As @błotosmętek already mentioned, you have  instead of  in some HTML tags.Regarding the strange additions, it looks like the CSV is not UTF-8, it's UTF-8 with BOM. Try .
