I have two dfs, one with data and the other with "keys" to replace. I want to go on the "keys" df, and if the key exists in the data df, then in the data df, change to the key's value and do some merging on the rows.so for example, this is the data df:and this is the "keys" df:so the output value will merge rows with same value (bbb and rrr same value), if the value is '----' then the data will be the same, and if there is no key then also the data will be the same. so the output is:is this possible with pandas?
