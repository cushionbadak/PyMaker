here's the code :this is the value of combi2 at the end : when i make a line of code that prints combi_operation like this :this is what i get : and i'd like to turn that into a list of list...how do i proceed? thanks!
You need to create a new list each time, otherwise you're modifying adding the same list over and over and over. The easiest way to do that is to clone  each time you append it.or
You can do it this way:The problem is that you are always modifying the original list, so it modifies the reference you have in combi2. For lists, python stores the references and not the values.
The proper way to do this in python is to use the product function.
If you are looking for permutations of a list you can go straigth to itertools:Each element of the resulting list is a tuple, but you can easily cast each element with a comprehension expressionTake a look to the documentation for more info on permutations:https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html#itertools.permutations
You might want to check out the itertools module from the standard library. What you are making looks like cartesian products. https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/itertools.html#itertools.productItertools also have combinatoric generator for permutations, combinations and combinations with replacement:
