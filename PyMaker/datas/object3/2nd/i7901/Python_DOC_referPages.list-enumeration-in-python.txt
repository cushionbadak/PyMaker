The snippet below is from a code tracing exercise. The part I'm confused about is the enumeration used in the for loop. From the documentation for enumerate() it looks like  should had have values like:during the iteration, which means  should have values from  through  and , the tuples  through . However when I run this code through the debugger, I see both  and  are lists instead. For example, when  and so forth. Can someone please explain what is going on?
With the line ,  gets the index values in the list  and goes from 0 to 9 while  gets the values from the list  one by one. So for , the  is . Then you call  and this means  get the first list while  gets the second list in the tuple. Hope this helps.
Of course  and  are lists. If you runyou will get the desired result. So the tuple you are looking for is saved in . With the lineyou split up the tuple referenced by  into its elements, which are – in the first iteration – the two lists referenced by  and .The above line essentially means which is equivalent towhich in turn means "assign  to  and assign B to ".
