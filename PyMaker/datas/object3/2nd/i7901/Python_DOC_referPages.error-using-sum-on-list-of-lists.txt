I have a  and I want to create a single list with all the elements of all the inner lists. I don't understand why can't use  to achieve this.If I use  it works fine:
Because  initializes with a default 0. Initialize with an empty list instead:However, it is not a good idea to flatten lists with  (horrible performance), you could use a nested comprehension or  which was created for this.
I am going to elaborate on @moses-koledoe answer. In order to flatten these lists (effectively, that's what you're trying to achieve), employ .If you want to avoid the unpacking syntax (), use the  variation of the same functionality:Actually, the second method might be a little more performant on large lists since it doesn't construct an intermediate tuple of args required to call the  function but works on the provided iterable (which could be a generator) directly.
