You could use the synchronized queue Queue as a pipe to send a value to the thread. 
It is rather unclear what you're trying to do.You're talking about loops but I see none in your code.Also, written like that, you will first wait for thread1 to stop, then wait for thread2 to stop, make sure it's what you want.Put a timeout inside these 'join' calls, otherwise it prevents the listening of exceptions:becomesYou may want to think about the changes it induces on your code.
