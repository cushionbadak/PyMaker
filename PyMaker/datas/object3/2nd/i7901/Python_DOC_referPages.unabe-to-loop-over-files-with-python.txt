I have a folder with 40 files in it which I want to loop through. When I print out the name of the file my code works fine:It will print :File1File2File 3.....File 40But if I try to open the file / files in the loop I get the following error. IO error: IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'file.txt'This is the code I am having issues with :I have verified , and the string I am searching for, it does exist in the files.Can you please provide some insight as to what is wrong with my code ? Thanks.
