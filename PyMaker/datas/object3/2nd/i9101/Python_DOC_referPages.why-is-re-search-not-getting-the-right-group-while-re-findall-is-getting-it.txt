Given the string  the aim is to break it into two groups  and . Actually, I'm only interested in the group before the . Why is re.search not getting the right group while re.findall is getting it?Another example where the input is , the expect output is to isolate the final fullstop and get  and . So  is getting it as desired:But  lumps the final fullstop into the first group.Is it possible for  to return only ? Is there some flags that needs to be set?
