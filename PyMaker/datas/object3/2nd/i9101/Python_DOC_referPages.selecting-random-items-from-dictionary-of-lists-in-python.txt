I am trying to randomly select a specific number of sequences from a dictionary of lists and then append these sequences to a new list, but I keep receiving an empty list. My code:I am comparing line[0] with k, and if they are the same, I want to pull random sequences from v. The number of sequences I want is the number at line[1]. The final_List would look like:
You could use nested list comprehension:In above  will iterate over elements in  and unpack them to respective variables. Note that we only need the name and count so the throwaway variable is named as :For every element in  a list is constructed by selecting  elements from respective list in  with :
The problem is in the line where you make the random choice. You are using  incorrectly. Also, we want to make sure you are iterating over line[1] correctly. The lines:should be
Similar to the list comprehension idea, but I would use a function to make it a bit clearer
