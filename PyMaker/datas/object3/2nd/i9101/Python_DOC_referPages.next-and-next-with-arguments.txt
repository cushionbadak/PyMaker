I'm writing an implementation of doubly linked lists. In order to traverse the list, I'm using something like:where  and  are just getters of  and . However, PyCharm yells at me for trying to call  as. What's the proper way to do this?
Besides  there is also . Both are required to return . The  method should be implemented on  (not on node-classes). Note that all magic methods (when called by a function like  instead of directly invoked) need to implement the expected arguments not more - not less.For example a doubly linked list could just implement  and  and rely on  and  attribute of the Node:For example:gives:similar for :
The extra argument to  is a default value, and  doesn't take any extra arguments. Python doesn't have any sort of two-way iterators. If your interface is not exactly the same as , then you should write your own.
 is part of the iterator protocol and should be used as described in said protocol, doing otherwise only make problems with the rest python.In your case just rename the function to simple  and use as , though I would change the  argument to a boolean, as that is how you use it, and its name too. Like this for exampleand use as ,  or even  (using 0 instead of False for the same effect)
