I have two dictionaries:andI am trying to create a new dictionary that maps the values  and  as keys to a dictionary that would contain the info of , while keeping those that are not present in  as keys, e.g.:
Use  to create the nested dictionaries in  if not yet there, and  to determine the key in the top-level output dictionary:So  will produce the value from  for a given key from , using the key itself as a default. So for the  key, that'll produce  as there is no mapping in  for that key.Demo:
I actually figured it out while abstracting the example and typing up my question here (should have maybe done this earlier...). Anyways: Yay!So here is my solution, in case it may help someone. If someone knows a swifter or more elegant way to do it, I would be glad to learn!
