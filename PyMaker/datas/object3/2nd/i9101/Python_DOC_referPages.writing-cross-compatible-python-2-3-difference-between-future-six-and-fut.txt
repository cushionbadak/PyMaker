I'm writing cross-compatible Python 2 and 3 code with some help from this cheatsheet. I've noticed there are different packages and modules that help to do this: the  package (e.g.  etc), the  package, and the built in  module.Are there any differences to be aware of when using these packages? Should I be mixing and matching them, or is it possible to write fully cross-compatible code be written with just one of them?
In terms of python 2-3 compatibility: - is a built-in module in python which allows you to use optional features in python versions where they are optional (vs mandatory). For example,  was optional in  but became mandatory in . - mostly renames modules/functions to produce higher compatibility between  to , but doesn't actually backport (or forward-port) functionality. It is also supported for python versions . - more modern, only supports , and is more rich in features.Seems like there is some agreement that  is preferred to  if you can drop support for old versions of python.
