What does  in the coding above?What does  mean?
If  is a sequence containing another sequence with at least 2 elements,  will give you a list of the second element in each of those sequences.Example: For each of the lists , , ,  chooses the respective second element.  would choose the first and  would not work because the lists only have two elements.Note that the  in  has nothing to do with the  you define in the line above. Instead it is the variable inside the for loop to which the elements of  are repeatedly assigned.I would recomment to study some basic python tutorial before continuiung with more advanced tasks like plotting.
