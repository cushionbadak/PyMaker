What's the pythonic way to implement this:This does give me  as I need but I fell there's a more elegant way to do it. Suggestions?
You could use , perhaps:You could inline the  values by adding another  call starting at zero:This version can be made into a list comprehension:Demo of the latter version:The double accumulate could be replaced with a , wrapped in the  function from the  documentation:I threw in an  call to prefix that 0 starting position, rather than create a new list object with concatenation.
I would use  for that, with accumulating:With your example:
Could use . Probably not efficient, but maybe at least interesting and simple.
Just because I believe there have to be ways to do this without explicit loops:OUTPUT
