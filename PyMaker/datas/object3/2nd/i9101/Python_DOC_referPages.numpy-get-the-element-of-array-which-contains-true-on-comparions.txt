The  looks like this:I want to get the element of array which contains True. How do I get this?
Do you actually need  here (see @Divakar's answer if you don't)? If you do, you could convert the  to  and index:This is called . Just in case you're interested.Just a performance tip: If you use a regular expression several times: compile it and reuse that compiled one:That could be much faster and easily combined with the other answer.
You could directly get those within the  -On a closer look, With the search method, we get an object for a match : For a no match case, we get .According to the  :In the context of Boolean operations, and also when expressions are  used by control flow statements, the following values are interpreted  as false: False, None, numeric zero of all types, and empty strings  and containers (including strings, tuples, lists, dictionaries, sets  and frozensets). All other values are interpreted as true.  User-defined objects can customize their truth value by providing a  bool() method.So, if the search method results are directly fed to , we get objects for matches and  for no matches. As such using the definition, with the , a match would be evaluated as  and  otherwise. Thus, we can skip the bool() there and have a simplified version, like so -
