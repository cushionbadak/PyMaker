Usually we have to (1) declare a list (2) calculate a sum of this list using But now I wish to specify a list start with 1 and interval 4, 100 elements, like this:I donâ€™t want to envolve mathematical formula, so(1) How to get the sum without even declaring this list?(2) How to quickly get sum from 101st element to 200th element of this list?
Simply use  to get a counter and  to get the required number of elements (you can iterate these instances but they don't create a list!):The  also supports start/stop:
The built-in class  does does exactly what you want in Python 3. In Python 2, use . instead. For example:The  object does not contain a full list. It records only the start, end and step size. The iterator will also record the current position.It is important to use  in Python 2 because the range function will return the entire list, which is exactly the opposite of what you want. will compute the sum you want and allow you to reuse  afterwards.A note on the number 401The end of a range is exclusive. There are a couple of common formulas to get the correct number of elements in the range.  is the one I have chosen here because it is the easiest. It is also the largest number that will give  rather than  elements to the range.  is the formula for the smallest number that will give you  elements. Since you want 100 elements, an end value of 398, 399, or 400 would give you the same result as 401. 
You can write a generator:Or, if you want a specific number of elements:And then sum that:
You can use generators with  to avoid creating a list at first:As @Mad Physicist mentioned in the comment, you don't even need the  part:
