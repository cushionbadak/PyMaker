I am making a blackjack game and am stuck on the first part where I need to define a function that gets the integer points for the card . So input is the string value of card and the output should be the integer score of the card. Can anyone help with what I've written?
Accessing values in a dictionary is not done via the  method, but rather via bracket-notation (eg. ). See  in the documentation.Additionally, you could try just making a  instead of a full-blown function:If you need it to be a function you can easily wrap this dictionary:Note:  is the exception raised when trying to access a non-existent key in a dictionary, so if we encounter one of those, we can choose to instead raise our custom  exception.Or if you want to get fancy (read: save some keystrokes):In the snippet above,  uses a dictionary comprehension to create a dictionary mapping string values for the integers 2-10 to their numeric values. For the non-numeric cards, I pass them in as keyword arguments. Luckily, python's built-in  constructor can handle both of these at once! So if you are just beginning you might want to use the first form rather than leverages a bunch of python's advanced features :)
I recommend writing a dictionary outside the function but if you want it inside try thisand then try it like thisKeys in dictionary are strings so you have to use function get_card_value using strings
