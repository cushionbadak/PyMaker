I am trying to test if my user input is a string or an integer. Here is my code, it works if I enter numbers for the values for feet and inches. However, if feet = a I get an error stating that a is undefined. What am I doing wrong?
What you're doing wrong is using . That's never a good way to do anything.Instead, try to convert to int and catch the exception:
Don't use  to test if user input is an integer. You get an error because the interpreter is trying to find a variable called  but there isn't one defined. Instead you can check if a string only contains digits.This assumes that negative numbers are invalid.
