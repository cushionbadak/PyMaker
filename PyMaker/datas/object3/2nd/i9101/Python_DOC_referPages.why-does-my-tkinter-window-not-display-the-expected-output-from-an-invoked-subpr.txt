In this code i am trying to finger users from a domain to return their credentials, but when i actually call the finger command in variable pep and have it displayed in the variable results which gets packed into a tkinter window. When i run it the only thing that is displayed is a '0' and i can see the finger command run properly and return the correct info the background Debug I/O but it does not display it in the tkinter window, i have no idea why. Any help? (P.S. for anyone running the code, entering a blank string on the finger_target returns a list on all users online)
subprocess.call returns only status code - error code returned by  - and  means .Use subprocess.check_output to get text.BTW:  should have only one  window (main window). To create other windows use . And  should have only one  (it is its )BTW: you can use  to display window with message.BTW: I use  names to make code more readable.See PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code
