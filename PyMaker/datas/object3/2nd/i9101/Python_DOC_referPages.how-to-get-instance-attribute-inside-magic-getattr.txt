In a class I want to map call to  to a value crated by calling , and thus created this code:However, it results in recursion, since the  calls , so I can't get access to the  function.How to get access to a named attribute inside the instance?
Python language refererence about __getattr__:object.__getattr__(self, name)Called when an attribute lookup has not found the attribute in the usual places (i.e. it is not an instance attribute nor is it found in the class tree for self). name is the attribute name. This method should return the (computed) attribute value or raise an AttributeError exception.Note that if the attribute is found through the normal mechanism, __getattr__() is not called. (This is an intentional asymmetry between __getattr__() and __setattr__().) This is done both for efficiency reasons and because otherwise __getattr__() would have no way to access other attributes of the instance. Note that at least for instance variables, you can fake total control by not inserting any values in the instance attribute dictionary (but instead inserting them in another object). See the __getattribute__() method below for a way to actually get total control over attribute access.This means that  is only called if no instance variable, no class attribute and no method with the same name are found.So your code works for "addr". You will get infinite recursion for other names because  also uses .You should avoid using  and  inside .Instead you can use  in a  block that catches .Please note that  doesn't call  on parent classes. So if you want to support a class hierarchy in which  may chain to the  method of another class you would need to call  if  failed. 
Use .  For example:
