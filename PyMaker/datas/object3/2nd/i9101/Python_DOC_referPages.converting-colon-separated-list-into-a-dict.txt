I wrote something like this to convert comma separated list to a dict.Isn't there a way to or something?
If I understand your requirements correctly, then you can use the following one-liner.Example:You might want to  the keys and values after splitting in order to trim white-space.
You can do:
You mention both colons and commas so perhaps you have a string with key/values pairs separated by commas, and with the key and value in turn separated by colons, so:This uses a dictionary comprehension iterating over a generator expression to create a dictionary containing the key/value pairs extracted from the string.  is called on the keys and values so that whitespace will be handled.
