I have a python3 object (class instance), generated by anline. I have also a  string:. How can I call a method of  named by ? Thus, in this case, I want to call , which is coming from like a .Unfortunately, a naive solution refered by the python docs (for example, here) gives my only a  or .This fails on that myObj doesn't have a  method:This fails on that  has more of fewer arguments:Calling simplywhich would be the most logical, givesSo, how can I do this?I use python 3.6, if it matters.Extension: here is an MCVE:
Your example can be changed for the following:I think you are missing the concept of bound/static method in Python. See this answer, it is describing the different types of methods.
If the attribute passed to  is a method name then it returns a callable which is already bound to the object:Return the value of the named attribute of object.  must be a string. If the string is the name of one of the â€™s  attributes, the result is the value of that attribute. For example,   is equivalent to . If the named  attribute does not exist,  is returned if provided, otherwise   is raised.Proof:
The first error is caused, because  returns a method that is already bound to the object instance ().So all you have to do is call your  variable as if it was a function.The second error is probably due to your exampleName not having the same number of parameters as the number of arguments passed to .All you have to do for the second error is to add the same parameters to the method in the class:Update:You have some more problems in the example you added:
