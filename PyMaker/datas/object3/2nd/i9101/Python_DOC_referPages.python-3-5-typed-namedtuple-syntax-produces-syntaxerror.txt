I get a  error when I try the new typed namedtuple syntax:in Python 3.5.2 even though according to the documentation it should be valid from 3.5+ onwards. Am I missing something? I've imported  from  in the code.
The syntax to declare the types for the  and  fields you are using requires Python 3.6 or up. Python 3.5 does not support the variable-level type hints required.From the  documentation:Changed in version 3.6: Added support for PEP 526 variable annotation syntax.Use the backwards compatible syntax also included in the documentation:so listing the field names as  tuples.If you are using Python 3.5, you may want to switch to the Python 3.5 version of the documentation instead (there is a selector in the top-left corner, or you can just replace the  in the URL with ).
