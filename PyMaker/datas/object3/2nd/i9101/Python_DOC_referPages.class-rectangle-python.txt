I'm just beginning working with object-oriented programming. I have created some classes and am trying to complete the rectangle class. Any and all help is appreciated. I'm confused about when you need to refer to self and when you can just create variables. For example, in defining the length of the rectangle, I don't know if I should call the variable self.length or just length, and I haven't been able to find any rectangle classes defined in this way.
Basically, setting a value to  gives you the ability to access this value from other functions inside the class and from outside of the class. If you set a value to , you are able to access this variable only in the current function inside the class.
Just a start, try to continue yourself:[EDIT]With regard to the additional code in your comment, it's quite close to what it should be. With some corrections:So, how far did you get now?
