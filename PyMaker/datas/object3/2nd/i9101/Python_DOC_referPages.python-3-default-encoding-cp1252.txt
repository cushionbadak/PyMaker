I recently ran into some problems decoding a handle (with errors mapping 0x81, 0x8D) from the Biopython module with an anaconda 4.1.1 python 3.5.2 installation on a sony vaio windows 10 systemAfter some research, it seems that possibly the problem may be that the default decoding codec is cp1252. I ran the code below and found that indeed the default codec is set to cp1252. However, several posts suggest that python 3 should have set the default codec to utf8. Is that correct? If so, why is mine cp1252 and how can I solve this?
According to What’s New In Python 3.0,There is a platform-dependent default encoding […] In many cases, but not all, the system default is UTF-8; you should never count on this default.andPEP 3120: The default source encoding is now UTF-8.In other words, Python opens source files as UTF-8 by default, but any interaction with the filesystem will depend on the environment. It's strongly recommended to use  to read a file.Another change is that  and  with no argument use utf-8 instead of ascii.Python 3.6 changes some more defaults:PEP 529: Change Windows filesystem encoding to UTF-8PEP 528: Change Windows console encoding to UTF-8But the default encoding for  is still whatever Python manages to infer from the environment.It appears that 3.7 will add an (opt-in!) mode where the environmental locale encoding is ignored, and everything is all UTF-8 all the time (except for specific cases where Windows uses UTF-16, I suppose). See PEP 0540 and corresponding Issue 29240.
