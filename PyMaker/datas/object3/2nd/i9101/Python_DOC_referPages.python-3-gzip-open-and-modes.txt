Natural Text
https://docs.python.org/3/library/gzip.htmlI am considering to use , and I am a little confused about the  argument: The mode argument can be any of 'r', 'rb', 'a', 'ab', 'w', 'wb', 'x'  or 'xb' for binary mode, or 'rt', 'at', 'wt', or 'xt' for text mode.  The default is 'rb'.So what is the difference between  and ? The document states they are both binary mode. So does that mean that there is no difference between  and ?
It means that  defaults to , and if you want text you have to specify it using .(as opposed to  behaviour where  means , not )
Exactly as you say and as already covered by @Jean-Fran√ßois Fabre answer.I just wanted to show some code, as it was fun.Let's have a look at the  source code in the python library to see that's effectively what happens.The  can be found here https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/gzip.py and I report belowFew things we notice:  the default mode is  as the documentation you report saysto open a binary file, it doesn't care whether it's  for example.This we can see in the following lines:basically the binary file  gets built wether there's an additional b or not as  can have the  or not at this point.Now the class  is called to build .In the constructor the following lines are important:   where can be clearly seen that if  is not present in the mode it will be added  so there's no distinction between the two modes as already discussed.
