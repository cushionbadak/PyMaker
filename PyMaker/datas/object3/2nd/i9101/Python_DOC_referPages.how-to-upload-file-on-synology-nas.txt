I want to make a file and upload that on a Synology NAS. I am using Python. It doesn't support FTP but it is just a network drive.I know the question is really short, I just don't know what more to tell.
The point of network drives is that they are used like local drives. So make it accessible to your operating system (mount on Unix/Linux/MacOS, share on Windows...) and copy the file to it. Alternatively, you can use a network protocol, such as webdav, sftp, whatever is enabled. python supports them all (sometimes with some support from the OS)
