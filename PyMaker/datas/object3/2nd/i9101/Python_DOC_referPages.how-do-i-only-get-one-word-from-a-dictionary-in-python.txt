I'm writing an English to Spanish dictionary in python. I have the user input what they want translated and the my program reads a file I created and print the Spanish equivalent of the word. Currently it just print the whole dictionary. This is probably easy but I am new to this and can't seem to figure it out. Thanks 
You need to specify the key which you want to translate.
