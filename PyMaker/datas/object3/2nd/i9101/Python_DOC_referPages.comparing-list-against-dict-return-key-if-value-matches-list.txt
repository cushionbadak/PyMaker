This is Python 3.6 I need help comparing a list against a dictionary and if there is match I need to return the dictionaries key.That prints all the matching numbers so in this case  which is perfect. How do I make it return  (the keys) if those values are found in both places, instead of returning the values that match
Notice that this code in the question is not doing what you imagine:The above does not check if the  is in both the dictionary and the list (that's not how ,  work in Python!). It's simply iterating over the  list, and nothing more. Try this instead:The above will compare each value in the dictionary and if it's present in the list it'll add the corresponding key to an output list. For instance, this is the output for the test data in the question:Now you can use it as needed,  it if you want.
First you need to have strings as keys in your dictionaryAlso why not use the id as the key instead of the name,that would be a bit nicerBut here is the code:
