For the following codemypy return following errors (python 3.4):I don't understand how specify i want subclases of  as Dict keys. How to declare type ?
I may not be understanding how the  and  modules work, but there seems to be some kind of bug going on here. If I do this (example adapted from the  section of the docs):There is no  error. If I do this: There is also no error. However, this does produce the  error: Based upon my understanding of the documentation, this error shouldn't be happening. 
It looks like you are doing this correctly, but it is required to declare the types for the  and  first. This fixes the problem. No  errors. However, it seems to me that your code as written should work, and that this is the symptom of a bug.
