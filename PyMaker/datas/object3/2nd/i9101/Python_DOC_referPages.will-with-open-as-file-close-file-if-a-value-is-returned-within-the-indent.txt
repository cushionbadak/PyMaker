Natural Text
I have the following function,Will there be a  called? I know that the  keyword normally calls the  method for the file at the end of the indented block, but at the same time the  keyword means that the rest of the function does not run. 
Just like /, anything that exits the  block (, / that affects a loop surrounding it, exception thrown,  called, etc.) will perform appropriate cleanup as execution bubbles out of the  block.The only exceptions are:When there are actual bugs (in the interpreter, or in misuse of intrinsically dangerous tools like ) where the interpreter itself crashes or otherwise exits "forcefully" (e.g. due to a segfault)Calling  bypasses all cleanup procedures (that's why it should never be used in anything but forked worker processes)
Return exits the with block like a normal dedent
Yes.If an exception is raised, a context manager has the option of changing its behavior, but there's no difference between a return and falling off the end of the statement body, and with few exceptions most context managers will perform their cleanup and allow the exception to propagate.The idea is that it's comparable to a  statement, and will be executed no matter how the block is exited. The  class from the standard library makes this analogy concrete.We can use  in various ways to see how the with statement performs in a more visible example than closing a file.
