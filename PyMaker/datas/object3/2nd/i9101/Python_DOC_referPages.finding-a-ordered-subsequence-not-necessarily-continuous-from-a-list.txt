I am stuck with a problem. I have a list for e.g. . the size of the list may vary. I have to check whether a sub-sequence for e.g.  occurs in the main list. The size of the sub-sequence may also vary.The problem here is that the sub-sequence here need not be continuous. Just the order of occurrence matters. Some examples:
You could use  to produce an iterator whose consumption enforces order on each member check. DemoThis approach works because the  keyword for a list is implemented as a sequence iteration (the docs): For container types such as list, tuple, set, frozenset, dict, or collections.deque, the expression  is equivalent to .
You could easily write a recursive solution if you want to understand how to solve similar problems:called like 
You can do a fairly simple iterative solution as long as both inputs are iterable.
