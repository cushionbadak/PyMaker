This question already has an answer here:How to clone a Python generator object?                    5 answers                In python i tried to create a copy of my iterator with using assignment however it create a copy of iterator which reference to the original iterator itself. For instance:As you see in the example first_it and second_it both refer to same iterator object. Is it possible to create a copy of iterator object which is not reference to the original object?NoteThis question is about how to creating a copy of iterator object by value. So don't mention  like solutions.Thanks in advance 
Use the  function to produce copies; these use a buffer to share results between different iterators:Note that you should no longer use the original iterator; use only the tees.Note that the buffer also means that these can incur a significant memory cost if you advance one of the copies far ahead of the others! From the documentation:This itertool may require significant auxiliary storage (depending on how much temporary data needs to be stored). In general, if one iterator uses most or all of the data before another iterator starts, it is faster to use  instead of .
