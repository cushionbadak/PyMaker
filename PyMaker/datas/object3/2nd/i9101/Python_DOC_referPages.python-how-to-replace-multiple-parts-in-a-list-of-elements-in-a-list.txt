Strings are immutable. Hence, none of the methods you can call on a string does an in-place modification. They all return a new string, so you have to reassign the string returned by :You can check out this question for how to merge the replacement of multiple patterns.
Because string is immutable, you have to reassign the list element. hope this helps. 
You are printing the results of the replacement, but do not change the list contents. If you have a closer look on the replace method (for strings(!)), you'll see that you are not only not changing the list but also not changing the strings you are getting . I omit including a working example, since schwobaseggl and thangtn [1] already provide it.[1] Who was really first? The SO timestamps contradict my personal experience.
Is that what you need?
