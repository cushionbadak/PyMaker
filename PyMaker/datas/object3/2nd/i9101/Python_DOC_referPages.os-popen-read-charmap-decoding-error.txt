I have already read UnicodeDecodeError: 'charmap' codec can't decode byte X in position Y: character maps to <undefined>. While the  error message is similar, the code is completely different, because I use  in this question, not . I cannot use the answers from the other questions to solve this problem.This line, which is supposed to assign the output of command "dir" to variable "output", is causing this error:I think this might be happenning because some files in the folder contain letters such as ł, ą, ę and ć in their names. I have no idea how to fix this though.
 is just a wrapper around  along with a  object:The returned file object reads or writes text strings rather than bytes.If Python's default encoding doesn't work for you, you should use  directly.The underlying issue is that cmd writes ansi garbage by default, even when the output is to a pipe. This behavior may depend on your Windows version.You can fix this by passing  flag to cmd:
In this case, using  is too general, too verbose and too hard to remember. Use  instead.It returns a  object, which can be converted to  with  function.Try it online!
