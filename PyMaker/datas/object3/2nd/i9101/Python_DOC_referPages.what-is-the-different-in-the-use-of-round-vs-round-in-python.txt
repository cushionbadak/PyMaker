In python 3 this works:But, this doesn't work, Why?:Also, nowdays lots of python scripts don't use this old format , I think for the reason to make the script look more clean. Any other core reasons?
There is no  method, no. You'd use the  function instead, passing in your value and the number of places to round to. is a function because rounding is an operation that applies to all number types, not just floating point numbers. Just like  applies to all sequences (not just  or  or ), and  to all Python objects.Like all  dunder methods,  is a hook for custom classes to override how rounding works for that class. The  function uses it when producing the output, as does some other functionality.This works:Note that I did not use  here! In Python two, that'd be 1.0:because  is calculated first using integer division.  uses floating point division (because at least one of the operands is a floating point value), so gives you the right quotient:You are using Python 3 here, where  means true division (producing floats even for integer operands), but the  call is still just redundant there.
