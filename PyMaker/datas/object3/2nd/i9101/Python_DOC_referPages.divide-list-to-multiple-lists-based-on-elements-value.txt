I have the following list:On each element of the list I apply a function and put the results in a dictionary:This gives the following result:What I would like to do is separate the keys from initial_list based on their values in the next_dict dictionary, basically group the elements of the first list to elements with the same value in the next_dict:'A' and 'C' will stay in the same group because they have the same value 'C', 'B' and 'D' will also share the same group because their value is 'D' and then 'D' will be in it's own group.How can I achieve this result?
Try this:Or this:
You need , after having sorted your list by  values :It generates a break or new group every time the value of the key  function changes (which is why it is usually necessary to have sorted  the data using the same key function).
Simplest way to achieve this will be to use  with key as  as:
I'm not exactly sure that's what you want but you can group the values based on their values in the :and then convert that to a list of their values:Combine everything into a one-liner (not really recommended but a lot of people prefer that):
We can sort your list with your dictionary mapping, and then use  to form the groups. The only amendment I made here is making your initial list an actual flat list.
