When I write it, it gives me scientific notation array like,but I don't desire it. I'm wanting normal numpy array like,Edit: I know np.set_printoptions but I'll write the array to a csv file and when I do it it still writing with scientific notation to file. What should I do?
To control the way the array is displayed, you could use np.set_printoptions to set a float formatting function:The meaning of the  format is described here. While the  format generally succeeds in presenting simple floats in a humanly readable way without exponential notation, it does not guarantee that exponential notation is never used.Therefore, you might instead use the  format,e.g.  if you wish topresent all floats with a fixed level of precision. This guarantees that no exponential notation is used.Alternatively, you could use tells  to suppress the printing of small floating point values using scientific notations.To create a CSV file useThe  parameter allows you to control the float format using printf-style string formatting.
