Aside from using  (as posted in the other answer), you can also use  function and dynamically determine the beginning of a slice:By the way, this approach is a bit safer than using  since, here we are only stripping a single  character at the beginning of a string if it exists, but  would replace all the occurrences of  in every  text you are extracting. You may get some unwanted side effects.Note that you have to do it in two steps in any case - the  or  functions would not be applied to every node if used like , references:How to apply the XPath function 'substring-after'Is it possible to apply normalize-space to all nodes XPath expression finds?Or, you can trim it using Python and :
This will evaluate the  in , and for the , it dose not contains , this will return  and will not show in the result
