I'm multithreading an API and I want to give each thread a unique ID so that I can process the response after the program is finished based on the indices.Here is the code that I'm currently using. The problem is that  is not unique. When the thread is killed, the identifier can be recycled.Any solutions to this? 
You can set a thread name when creating the thread. I like to use  to make program-unique numbers because it is is thread safe. Here I use it to make unique thread names. You can change the format to meet your needs.
Try to use worker.get_ident()https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#threading.Thread.ident
