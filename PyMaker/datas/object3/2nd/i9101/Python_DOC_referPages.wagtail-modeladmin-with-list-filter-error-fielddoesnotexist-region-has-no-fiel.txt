You are missing a comma:Without the comma, the parentheses are ignored and django will be iterating the string, and not a tuple (because there is no tuple!), hence the attempt to access field .From the docs:a tuple with one item is constructed by following a value with a comma (it is not sufficient to enclose a single value in parentheses).
