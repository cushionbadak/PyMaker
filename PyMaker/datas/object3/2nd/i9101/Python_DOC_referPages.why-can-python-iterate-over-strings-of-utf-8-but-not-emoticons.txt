In Python 2.7:Since  only contains a single unicode code point (0x0001f44d), why does  return 2 instead of 1?
Your Python binary was compiled with UCS-2 support (a narrow build) and internally anything outside of the BMP (Basic Multilingual Plane) is represented using a surrogate pair.That means such codepoints show up as 2 characters when asking for the length.You'll have to recompile your Python binary to use UCS-4 instead if this matters ( will enable it), or upgrade to Python 3.3 or newer, where Python's Unicode support was overhauled to use a variable-width Unicode type that switches between ASCII, UCS-2 and UCS-4 as required by the codepoints contained.On Python versions 2.7 and 3.0 - 3.2, you can detect what kind of build you have by inspecting the  value; it'll be  for a narrow UCS-2 build,  for a wide UCS-4 build. In Python 3.3 and up it is always set to 1114111.Demo:
