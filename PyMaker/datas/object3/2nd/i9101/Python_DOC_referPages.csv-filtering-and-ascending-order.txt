New to Python, so I need a bit of help.I have a CSV file that has an id, created_at date, first/last name columns.I want to filter the rows between two dates lets say  and (dates don't really matter), and then order those rows in ascending order (by created_at)I know this code will just show all or most of the dataBut I'm not sure how to do the rest, or how to filter using this timestamp would using  be more beneficial for me, over using csv?Any help is much appreciated or a guide/book to read for more understanding.

So if you pass a dataframe with boolean values to pandas, if will return only the ones that correspond to True.ReturnsThis is how you can filter easily in pandas
Downloading and installing (and learning)  just to do this seems like overkill. Here's how to do it using only Python's built-in modules:
