Assume two Python modules titled  and .Module  is intended to supply the other module with the global variable .Module  contains a class with two functions ( and ), one of which (i.e., ) is a staticmethod that attempts to access the aforementioned global variable. Function  accesses the staticmethod and is supposed to return a concatenated string.When I attempt to load both modules and execute function , the global variable does not seem to be properly accessed. Why is that and what is the solution?
In your particular case you don't have to use  keyword nor  class.Instead:By the way python docs have little section about sharing global vars across modules: https://docs.python.org/3/faq/programming.html?highlight=global#how-do-i-share-global-variables-across-modules
