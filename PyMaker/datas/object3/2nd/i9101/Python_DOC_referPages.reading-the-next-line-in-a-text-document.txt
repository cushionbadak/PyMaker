Hello I'm trying to make an live info screen to a school project,I'm reading through a file which does a lot of different thing which depending of what line it's reading.As seen in the code, every line in my document i want to check the next line because if it matches a certain string, i set a variable.from what i could read myself to, python has a built in function next() that is suppost to be able to do the job for me. But when i run my code im presented with `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'next'`

you can hold your previous line in a helper string. (note, I'm using previous/current instead of current/next)
