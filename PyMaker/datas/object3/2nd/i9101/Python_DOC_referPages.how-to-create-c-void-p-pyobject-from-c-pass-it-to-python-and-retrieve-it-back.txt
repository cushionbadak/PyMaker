I need to share an ArrayFire array creating in C++ to Python. That works OK:Now if my Python script return an ArrayFire array I need to read the arr attribute and get my pointer back and assign it to a C++ arrayIssue here is that PyLong_AsVoidPtr failswith class 'TypeError': an integer is required.ctypes doc (16.16.1.4. Fundamental data types) says the Python type for c_void_p is either int or None. Obviously it is None in my caseHow can I convert c_void_p to python using the C API?Thanks!
I solved it.The ctypes type objects values can be read from the value attribute.
