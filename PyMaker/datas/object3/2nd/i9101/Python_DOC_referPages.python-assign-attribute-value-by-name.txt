As part of a bigger project in python3, I need a method in the spirit of to the following (not working) code: I need this because I don't have prior knowledge on which attribute of Q has to be incremented. A  solution would be to declare specific functions for each attribute and use some selector, but I'd prefer to avoid this if possible. Is there a tidy way to do this ?
It is a very bad idea to use  (in almost any context). You can use  and  which are more secure: and  get and set the attribute of an ect. So here you can get/set an attribute if you do not know the name in advance.So the resulting code is:
A combination of  and  would do:yielding  for  after your snippet executes. just grabs an attribute from an object by a given name (and allows for a default to be used if the attribute doesn't exist); similar to .  performs the assignment, setting the attribute with the given name on the object.
You can use the build-in function vars which returns a dictionary of variables declared in given scope. It's usage looks like this:
