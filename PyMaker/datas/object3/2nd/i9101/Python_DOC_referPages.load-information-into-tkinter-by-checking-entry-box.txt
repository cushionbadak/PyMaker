Is there any way to get a tkinter widget to update after an input into an Entry widget is completed? https://i.stack.imgur.com/egSX6.pngThe original Elo program was done with a Form in Access. When the player entries are filled, the Label/Entries denoted by the $ would search through the database and display information.Is there some way of having the Label update while the GUI is running? A trigger for it could be when character count in the Entry field is 3 characters. I don't know how/if it's possible to make a Label/Entry update after the GUI is already running.Edit:    When I run the code like this, as soon as I enter text into the winner_id box I get this error: TypeError: update_winner() takes 0 positional arguments but 3 were given
You can associate an instance of  to the entry widget and then put a trace on the variable. The trace will be called whenever the variable value changes, and the value changes whenever the user types into the entry widget.In the function that is called, you can change the value that is displayed in a label with the  method.Here's a brief example. In this example, when you type into the entry widget, the label will be updated to display what is entered.You can of course do anything you want in the variable trace, such as look up values in a database.
