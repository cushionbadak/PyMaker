I'm looking to move a motorised slider using a Raspberry Pi. However, while debugging the system I was wondering if it is possible to use: In a way that message could dynamically change before the user inputs a value. For me, it would be great to see the current value that is read from the slider in this  for example.And if that isn't possible, is it possible to have a line printed above or below the  that remains changing while the system waits for the users' input?
You can find that as a non-blocking input. Here is a solution from stack overflow, which uses threadsI did a little modified solution, it still needs some tweaking, but its more or less what you have to do.See if that answers your question! :)
