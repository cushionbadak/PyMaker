I'm new to python and I have a list, each item in the list has 7 values in it, I want to check if value one has duplicates and if so remove all except one but only where value 7 which is a float is highest.I can't get my head around it!The values I'm checking if duplicated are pred, if pred has duplicates check the highest score and return that one of the duplicates.I also don't want any of the unknowns but I'm not sure on that either...Any help would be appreciated or even if my question is worded wrong and could be improved. Thanks!EDIT:Below is the list that gets returned. As you can see I have multiple  and I only want the highest scored one, (the last float value)EDIT #2:Thanks to everyone for the feedback, I have learnt a lot about the language!The answer is from @jpp however modified to sort by the highest scored results.
I believe this is what you need. You can sort your list and then use .Result:
