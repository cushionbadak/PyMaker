I am having issues running a Python file that uses "import enum", giving me this issue:I know I have Python 2.7 and "import Enum" exists only with Python 3, but I am having troubles going about how to create two different environments where I have both Python 2.7 and Python 3. How would one go about doing this on Mac Unix terminal, which I also am not very familiar with.
 didn't show up until Python 3.6, and is not in the  backport.  If you want 2/3 compatible code you'll need to use 1.I do not have any experience with the Mac Unix terminal.1 Disclosure:  I am the author of the Python stdlib , the  backport, and the Advanced Enumeration ()  library.
