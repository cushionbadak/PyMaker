Suppose  contains:And  contains:I want  to be set to the  attribute of the calling functions' module (which is 'myapp.foo') in this case. How can this be done?
Check out the inspect module: will return the stack information.Inside a function,  will return your caller's stack.  From there, you can get more information about the caller's function name, module, etc.See the docs for details:http://docs.python.org/library/inspect.htmlAlso, Doug Hellmann has a nice writeup of the inspect module in his PyMOTW series:http://pymotw.com/2/inspect/index.html#module-inspectEDIT: Here's some code which does what you want, I think:
Confronted with a similar problem, I have found that sys._current_frames() from the sys module contains interesting information that can help you, without the need to import inspect, at least in specific use cases.You can then "move up" using f_back :For the filename you can also use f.f_back.f_code.co_filename, as suggested by Mark Roddy above. I am not sure of the limits and caveats of this method (multiple threads will most likely be a problem) but I intend to use it in my case.
I don't recommend do this, but you can accomplish your goal with the following method:Then update your existing method as follows:
