I managed to construct a Trie and now i want to return strings that matches a prefix from the Trie but I'm having issues writing the search function.For example, if i have a prefix "aa", i want to have the strings "aa" and "aac" as an output.I was thinking of just joining up the alphabets together to form the final string through the search function but i just couldn't think of any better way to do so.
The  value so far is just the prefix, split up into separate letters, but now you need to process each node you find in the  attribute that is not , to find all nodes that have  set to . Each time you find such a node, you have a complete word. Any node can have multiple child nodes again, branching out into still more words to output.You could use a stack to keep track of all the nodes you need to process to build the list, together with their prefix so far. Add child nodes to the stack with the prefix for that node, and process these nodes one by one (adding more child nodes to the stack as you do so).Note that to start with, you don't need to build a list of prefix characters, you already have that prefix as a variable. To get to your starting point it is simpler to just iterate over the prefix itself:For your given sample trie and prefix, the stack starts with the node at . The first  iteration removes that node from the stack and because this node has  set to true,  is added to . The node has just one non- child node, for , and so the node is added to the stack with .Then the  loop repeats, finds that one element on the stack, sees  is set so  is added to , and no more child nodes are located. The stack stays empty and the  loop ends.Demo:
What about , it seems to me the easy way of implementing your search.
