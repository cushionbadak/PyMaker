I'm trying to import a file but I can only get it to work from one context at a time.This my project structure: is usually called externally directly it imports  imports .py Is a file that contains tests and includes both  and My question is how to do the import statement in When I call it from  it needs to beBut when I call it from  that results in an error requiring it to beIs there a way I can get the import statement right in both contexts?Or do I need to change something structurally in my project?Thank you :) 
If what you want is being able to use  from test.py you could modify the search path of modules.  is the list of paths where the interpreter will look for modules to import. Do  and you'll see. You can also modify it while running your script.For example, keeping with the file structure you described   In  I have inserted  in  which is the relative path where the running script will to be looking into for modules  or . That's why it is able to acess directly yo those two modules.If that's not what you were trying to do, please explain further.
