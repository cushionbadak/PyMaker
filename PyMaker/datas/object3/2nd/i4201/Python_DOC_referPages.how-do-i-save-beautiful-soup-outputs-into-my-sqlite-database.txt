I have a basic web page running and I have web scraped some temperatures for the week. The output on the page is displaying perfect on the web page. I now want to input these into my SQLite3 database. I've tried finding some tutorials but couldn't find any clear ones. Can someone guide me on the right path? Thanks in advance.
I know that this question already has an accepted answer which will work for your purposes, but I just want to mention that you should always use query parameters rather than string formatting to create SQL statements with variables. So instead of:You should use:The documentation confirms that this is the way to go:Usually your SQL operations will need to use values from Python  variables. You shouldn’t assemble your query using Python’s string  operations because doing so is insecure; it makes your program  vulnerable to an SQL injection attack (see https://xkcd.com/327/ for  humorous example of what can go wrong).I realise that for this small example program it's unlikely to make any difference, but it's best to get into good habits.
If you want to just store your  in database, then do a simple SQL insertI recommend you to read some documentation
