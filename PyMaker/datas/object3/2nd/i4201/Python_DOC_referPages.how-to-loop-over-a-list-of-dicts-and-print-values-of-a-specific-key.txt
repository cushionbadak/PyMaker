I'm new to Python and have (what I know to be a very simple) question.Running Python 3.4.I have a list that I need to iterate over and pull specific information out.  Here is a sample (truncated, many thousands of items) of the list (called parts):I want to do this using a for loop where I pull just the value after the  key and print it to my console. A simple for loop looks like this:This, of course, prints all the information in the parts list again, which isn't what I want.So I need to do something like:This isn't correct because it just prints:So I need to do something where I tell it "every time you see , print the value after it, but I'm unsure how to structure that loop.Can anyone give me some guidance?
If I understood you correctly. You are looking for fetching a value using key from a dict.Ex:Output:MoreInfo in Python Dictionaries
