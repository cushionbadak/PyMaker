I am trying to write in Python a script that takes a string and returns a list of string by iteratively moves the letters in the original sequence.For example : ACGT-->TACG -->GTAC-->CGTA-->STOP (original sequence)I am a beginner in programming, here is what I've succeed to do It only returns the first step like TACG and doesn't go on. Output : multiple time (endless loop)Expected output : 
Basically, you need to move the last element to the beginning until you come to the original sequence. For this  and it's  method (which is equivalent to )  should be the most efficient:Demo:
Simple solution without any import.OutputACGTTACGGTACCGTA
One option is to use  and :
If you want the output to be:The above code can be change to:

If you only need rotations to be printed, have a look at this:If you need in a list just omit the  part:
This can be achieved using queue data structure.Here is the general versionpop the element from the last indexpush the element to first indexrepeat it for the length of the input string.I leave the implementation to you, use this as reference Queue DS in pythonHere is the implementationCode
