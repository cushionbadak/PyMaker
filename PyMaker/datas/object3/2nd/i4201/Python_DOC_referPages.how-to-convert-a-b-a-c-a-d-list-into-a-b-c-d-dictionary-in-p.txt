This question already has an answer here:Merging repeated items in a list into a python dictionary                    2 answers                Python creating a dictionary of lists                    6 answers                Imagine we have a list of lists where the nested list contains two elements [A, B]. Now, you want to convert such list into a dictionary where the first element should be the key and the second element should be its value. For example:The order of the values should be kept. I have a straightforward solution:And an ugly list comprehension solution which is significantly slower because it performs a loop over complete data for each single key.There should be a better and more elegant way to do this. Can you come up with something?
Use a defaultdict:
An alternative to  is to use the  method of a plain .outputThis will preserve the order of the values in all versions of Python, and in Python 3.6+ it will also preserve the order of the keys.
Another approach would be this:Output:
