Natural Text
I am trying to match a number and all the words that come after the number in a line. The regular expression that I found to work was '(90[13]).*'. I am using Python with Sublime on Mac.On regex101.com, it works and matches 901 and 903 and the words that come after it on each line. However, when I try that in my code editor, it only matches the numbers 901 and 903 but not the words after. Here is the string Expression should match "901    Not supporting null originator (DSN)    msg denied before queued" but only matches "901"

Either remove the groups altogether, or add a group for the text following your number:Output:
