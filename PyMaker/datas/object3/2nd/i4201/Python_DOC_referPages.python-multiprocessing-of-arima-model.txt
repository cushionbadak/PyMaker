Is it possible execute the ARIMA model with multiprocessing in python? I've got an error in the following code I'm using:The error I got is:res =  pool().map(evaluate_models,[Bar(series.value),Bar(p_values),Bar(d_values),Bar(q_values)])      TypeError: 'module' object is not callableAny help would be greatly appreciated.PS: I'm using Python v3.5.2
This is all related to one line :You are trying to call a module as if it was a function.You have to read the documentation of the multiprocessing module.
