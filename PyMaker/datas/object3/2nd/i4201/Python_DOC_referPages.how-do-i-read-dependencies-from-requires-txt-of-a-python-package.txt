I need the dependencies because I want to add these to my RPM meta-data.To build I use:When I build the package  it creates a file It contains:How can I read all dependencies, evaluating the expression between ?I'm using Python 2.7 (don't ask)I need the following output:I want to omit other sections like ,  etcetera.
The  is part of the dependency metadata, so you can use the same tools  uses when installing the egg. Assuming the file  is in the current directory:Now you can filter all dependencies for your current platform with :The list would be different if I used Python 2.7:or PyPy:Now, if you want to generate a list of requirement strings (like when you want to generate a requirements file for ), convert the requirements to strings:PEP 508If you also want to take PEP 508 environment markers into account independent of the current platform, things can get a bit trickier, but still manageable. First, convert the requirements with env markers:Now handle the platform-independent deps, these house under the  key in 's dependency map:Combine both lists to a string ready to be written to requirements file:
So I was able to find one working solution for the same, there might be other possibilities as well, but i think this should work on most versionsThe output of the same is belowIf I change the  like belowThe output changes to
You could test the beginning of each line to whether or not it is a match to the pip dependency declaration format.Regex is probably the best solution to pattern matching:Where: matches to beginning of line/file matches any word (), digit (), underscore (), and dash () more than once.All in all:Result:
