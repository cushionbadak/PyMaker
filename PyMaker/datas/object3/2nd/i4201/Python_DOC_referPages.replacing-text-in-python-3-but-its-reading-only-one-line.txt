I am trying to use search and replace in Python 3 with filebut when i try my code it only works on the first line and don't go through each and every line and replace it.What i am trying so farThis code is only reading the first line but doesnot work further.
The method  reads until EOF using  and returns a list containing the lines.I changed a few thinks based on what I understood of the question.  checks if the input you look for is in the line. If it is, the line is written to f2 with the replace, else the line is written to f2 as it was.EDIT: You got another issue I guess. Works for me.Input file was: test.txtOutput file:Version with only one word that is going to be replace by only one word on every line:
This is happening because you are not reading the file properly.f1.readlines() consumes all the file lines returning a list of strings.You just need to remove the f1.readlines() line.Check the documentation if you would like to know the various ways of reading a file in python.https://docs.python.org/2.7/tutorial/inputoutput.htmlhttps://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html

I think you already have a solution, however there are few places where it can be optimized. Use python contextmanager  for handling files, then you dont need to worry about closing it. In your case the file will not be closed in case there is an exception thrown during for loop.Using  you dont need to call .Use  block if you getting inputs from external source.Here is another way of doing it.I hope it helps.
