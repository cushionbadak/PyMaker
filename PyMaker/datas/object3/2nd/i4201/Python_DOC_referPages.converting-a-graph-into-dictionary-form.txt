I am currently writing a program to model Dijkstra's algorithm, however I am having some trouble the graph in its current form below:I want to get the graph in the form such as the one belowWould this be possible?
You can use  for this.Code:Output:
Here is a compact way using list comprehension:Breaking this down: is iterating over the first element of  to get the keys of the output dictionary. is a generator expression over the second element in , which will yield a value if the key  is contained in the set. is the symmetric difference of the set with the key- this removes the key from the set. converts the set to a list and gets the first element. This assumes there will always be only 2 elements in the set, one of which is the key. makes a tuple where the second value is the number. calls the dict constructor on this list of tuples.Perhaps a slightly friendlier version, using more sensible variable names instead of tuple indexing and  instead of list indexing:
