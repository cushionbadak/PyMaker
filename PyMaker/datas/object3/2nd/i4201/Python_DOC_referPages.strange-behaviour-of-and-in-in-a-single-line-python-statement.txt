This question already has an answer here:Why 1 in range(2) == True evaluates to False? [duplicate]                    2 answers                From the disassemble code I can see the  should return  since it won't execute the  comparison and hence .But what happens to foo2(), why does this return False?Whereas foo3() and foo4() works perfectly as we can be confirmed from the disassembled code.Ref: https://docs.python.org/2/library/dis.html Python2.7I've seen similar behavior python3+; the disassembled code is different but logic seems to be same in the disassembled code.Python operator precedence:https://docs.python.org/2/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence Operator precedence for and  is same but it doesn't match the expectation.
Both  and  are relation operators, and relational operators in Python chain.  performs both  and  simultaneously.But you shouldn't be comparing against booleans regardless. Pass the result to  if you need to, but  already results in a boolean.
