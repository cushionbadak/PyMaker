I am very new to python and need some help, I am trying to make a simple if/else script.my previous version worked as it should and I have have to make the only change of a user entering a variable rather than a pre-determined variable. But I get a syntax error on the final line, can anybody show me where I am going wrong.my code is thanks in advance for your help.
Multiple problems here:In Python indentation (the spaces from a line or tabs if you wish) are important to distinguish different scopes of the code like functions, if statements etc. Your first line has such invalid indentation. This function reads an input from the user and returns it as a string, regardless if you provide a numeric value. You need to use  to convert it into an actual numeric value, so that you can then do range checks like "if is greater than 0 and less than 10" for example. Obviously, if you don't convert it to integer and you are working with strings you cannot do such range checks as the value is not treated as a numeric value.Here is a working copy:
There are 3 errors:Your first line should not be indented.Convert your  to numeric type, e.g.  or .Hours between 0 and 12 should be "am" rather than "pm".This will work:
The error is  This means you write the line of code indented. that's incorrect. To solve it remove the spaces before first line.You also have to specify the type of input.
