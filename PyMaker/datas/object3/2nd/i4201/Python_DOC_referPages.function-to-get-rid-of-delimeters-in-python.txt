I have a function where the user passes in a file and a String and the code should get rid of the specificed delimeters. I am having trouble finishing the part where I loop through my code and get rid of each of the . I will post the code down belowAfter running the file I would like for the output to look like this
Here's a way to do this using regex. First, we create a pattern consisting of all the delimiter characters, being careful to escape them, since several of those characters have special meaning in a regex. Then we can use  to replace each delimiter with an empty string. This process can leave us with two or more adjacent spaces, which we then need to replace with a single space.The Python  module allows us to compile patterns that are used frequently. Theoretically, this can make them more efficient, but it's a good idea to test such patterns against real data to see if it does actually help. :)output
