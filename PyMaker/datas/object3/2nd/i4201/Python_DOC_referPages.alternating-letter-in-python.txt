I am trying to return a matching string where every even letter is uppercase and every odd letter is lowercase. But the code doesn't show this exact result, any solution?
The problem is that you're only incrementing  after the loop, rather than each time through it. So, inside the loop, it's always 0. The smallest fix is:But this kind of mistake is very easy to make (and sometimes not as easy as this to debug)â€”which is exactly why Python has nice tools like , that make it impossible to get wrong:
People, including myself, have already pointed out your programming error. Here is an alternative one-liner solution to your problem using a generator expression and a ternary conditional operator: will return a tuple of the form  for each item in the iterable. In this case, the iterable is the string .At each step in the iteration, we check to see if the index  is odd.  will return  for even numbers and the  statement will evaluate to . Likewise, it will evaluate to  for odd numbers. Respectively, we call  and  on the current character .Finally we use  to concatenate all the individual letters back together. Here we join the characters using an  with is the empty string.
The problem was with how you were incrementing. You only set up your index to increment inside the "Else" block of your code. It was missing from the "If" block. As such as soon as you entered the "If" block you would be stuck there.     
You weren't increment your index in the correct spot ;)If you execute  it will print
