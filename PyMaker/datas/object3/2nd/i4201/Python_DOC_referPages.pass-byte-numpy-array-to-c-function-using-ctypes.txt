I want to pass byte numpy array to a  function using . The  function takes  so I thought to pass it as the following:This gives the error  which means  does not handle numpy. Is there a workaround?
 generates a plain bytes object ([Python 3]: class bytes([source[, encoding[, errors]]]) which is not handled by ctypes.The original lst object on the other hand ([SciPy]: numpy.ndarray), is. So, removing the above line of code, would fix the error.
 is now a python  object, not a  array. Thats what  does. Why not do ? I'm not even sure why you tried to convert to a byte which is 8 bit when c pointers are 32 or 64 bit.
