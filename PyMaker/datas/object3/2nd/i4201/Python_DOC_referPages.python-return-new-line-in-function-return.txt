If you are trying to format this as HTML, I would suggest you add  also to the returned text:This first builds a list of entries with the correct numbering, and then joins each line together with a newline. The newline is purely cosmetic and will only effect how the HTML appears when viewed as source. It is the  which will ensure each entry appears on a different line. is used to automatically count your entries for you.
You're presumably returning HTML, and viewing that HTML in a browser.In HTML, all runs of whitespace are equivalentâ€”there's no difference between  and . The browser should convert them all to single spaces, and then decide how to flow the results nicely.So, you're going to have to learn some basic HTML. But here are a few quick hints to get you started: defines two separate paragraphs. defines a paragraph with a line break in the middle. defines a table of two rows (and one column).The last one is the most complicated, but given that you've got things named  and , I suspect it may be what you actually want here.HTML itself only specifies "structure", not layout. It's up to the browser to decide what "two paragraphs" or "a line break" or "two rows" actually means in terms of actual pixels. If you want finer control, you need to learn CSS as well as HTML, which lets you specify explicit styles for these elements.
