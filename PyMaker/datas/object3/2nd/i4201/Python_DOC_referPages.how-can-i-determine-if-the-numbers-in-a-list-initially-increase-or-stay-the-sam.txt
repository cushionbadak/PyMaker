For example, the digits of  and  increase and then decrease. I wrote a code that breaks the numbers into a list and is able to tell if all of the digits increase or if all of the digits decrease, but I don't know how to check for digits increasing then decreasing. How do I extend this?
Seems like a good opportunity to learn about using itertools and generator pipelines. First we make a few simple, decoupled, and reusable components:Then we put the pieces together to solve the wider problem of detecting an "increasing then decreasing number":Usage is like this:This solution will short-circuit correctly for a number like:121111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111...2I've addressed only the "strictly increasing, and then strictly decreasing" number case.  Since this sounds like it might be your homework, I'll leave it as an exercise for you to adapt the code for the "non-decreasing and then non-increasing" case which is mentioned in the question title.
Find the maximum element.Break the list into two pieces at that location.Check that the first piece is increasing, the second decreasing.For your second example, , you find the largest element, .Break the list in two:  and  (the 8 can go in either list, both, or neither).Check that  is increasing (okay) and  is decreasing (also okay).Is that enough to get you to a solution?
Split the list at the maximum value, then take the min/ max of the diff of each side: Results:
