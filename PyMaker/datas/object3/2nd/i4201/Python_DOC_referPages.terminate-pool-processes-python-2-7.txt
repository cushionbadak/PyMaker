My goal is pretty simple:Terminate all processes in the pool after n seconds. I need to use Pool and not multiprocessing.ProcessIs there a way to terminate the whole pool or all the processes in it?Pool of threads is also an option.
You cannot do this with threads (no way to force a thread to exit from the outside). You can  a process pool. Something like this, but you need to use map_async. If you use the blocking map, then you are probably out of luck.This submits tasks to a pool and after 10 seconds terminates the pool if it has not completed yet. This may or may not be suitable for your purposes.
