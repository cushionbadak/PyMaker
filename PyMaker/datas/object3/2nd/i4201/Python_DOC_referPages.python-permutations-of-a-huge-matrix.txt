I want to create permutations of a matrix, which has 10 rows with 70 items each.Every item contains either  or . I need to create permutations of this matrix.The problem is that I would need to write 1400  statements.Is there a better way to do these permutations?Edit: Loop through all possible combinations of all  and  items in the matrix.
I agree 100% with the comment made by @user2357112, there must be an underlying issue with your solution that prompted you to pursue such a solution.However, if for any reason you do want a solution to this you might consider using itertools.product.This will produce all rows of 70 items of , I do not suggest running it.You can then easily extend this to be a solution to your problem, but I repeat, this is probably not a good way to do this.
