I have looked up definitions but all of them seem confusing. Sorry I am a very new to this and I would if there is a simpler way of putting it 
A code block is a Group of statements that will be run as a Unit.For example:You will find that statements 1,2,3 will have the same indentation therefore is of the same block. and similarly statements 4,5,6 is of a another block.You may refer :https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.htmlhttp://www.peachpit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1312792&seqNum=3
When we say "block" we mean an element of code nested inside another syntactical element, like a method or function, or a structure like  or .The exact definition depends on your language's syntax tree, something that's formally defined.
All of your programs, consist by too many blocks.Block is just a concept and you can't see like as function. Block is structure of code to separate part of code from another part of code.Function is block., classes is block and self consist by many blocks inside.
