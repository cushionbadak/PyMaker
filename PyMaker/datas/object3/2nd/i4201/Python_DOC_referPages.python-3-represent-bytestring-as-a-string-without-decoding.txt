Is there a builtin way to "convert" a bytestring to a unicode string?I don't want to decode it, I want the string i see on print without the "b".e.g.Input:output:I've tried iterating over the byte string, but that gives me a list of integers:I get:I want:
Use the [Python]: chr(i) function:As @hop mentioned, it would be better to use this method:However, looking at your 2nd example, it seems you need [Python]: repr(object):
Technically you cannot get from bytes to strings without decoding, but there is a codec that does what you want:There is also . You can read about the differences in the documentationI very much doubt that there is a use case for having binary data in a unicode string.
