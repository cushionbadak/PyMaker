So I'm just trying to learn programming/coding. and I'm trying to make a loop where the computer guesses at random a number that I put in (the variable), I mostly the loop with the "while" and "if/else" loops down but like...idk how to put the variable in. I'm sure there are other things wrong with the code. Its just a simple one since I actually just started 2 days ago. here is the code
is always .  is the random function,  is an integer (well, it should be).You mean:(store the result of the random function to be able to display it and test it, calling it again yields another value, obviously)and yes, the first line should be  to be able to input an integer value.
Updated according to the comments:I just made a working version of your program, your input would be 1, and computer would randomly guess from 1,2,3 until it gives the correct answer.output:
