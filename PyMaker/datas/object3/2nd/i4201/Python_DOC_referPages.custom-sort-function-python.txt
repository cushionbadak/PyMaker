I have a class object which is 5 integer values. I understand that for sorting you override the  functions, but I want to be able to sort comparing any of the 5 values, so I would want to have 5 sort keys. Is there any way I can make it easier? I've thought of making a global class switch that keeps track of the correct value but is there an easier way?
If you want to sort by multiple things, it's probably easier not to try to build it into the class, but rather use the  parameter for  when sorting and supply a different function depending on what you want to sort by.
