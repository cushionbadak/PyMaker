all,The  code:What's the function for this operator [...]?(data is a  nd-array)I've tried on searching on google, but couldn't find any usage or meaning of this operator.THX!
Not sure if you are asking about element wise selection but here is the syntax for that. If I've misinterpreted, perhaps explain what the three dots are supposed to represent. You may be asking for the closest function to the element wise search, in which case you should look at the take() function.
