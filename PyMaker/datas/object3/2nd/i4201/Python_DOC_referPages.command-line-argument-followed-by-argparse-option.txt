I'm new to python and currently playing around with argpase. I'm trying to call a function using a directory path given as a command line argument followed by an argparse option(-name) and a regex that goes through all the files in the directory and spits out all the matches to the regex as so: However, I'm getting a error that looks like And without the -name its just printing all the files inside the path.Here is what I have so far:Any thoughts?
In order for your program to operate, you need a path. So, the  option must take an argument. Modify your  function to change the linetoYou need to call  only once. Remove the  invocation to the top of the loop.And you needn't doif you are using . returns a  object, which is probably not what you want to print.You might want to take a look at  versus . The  function only checks if the RE matches at the beginning of the string while  will scan forward through the string for a match.If you wanted to print the file names matching the regex, you could doSo  should be something likeIn order to specify the regex matching the file names, you must specify the regex using the  option. By default, you've made it to match names having only numbers and (English) letters.or
Argument Parser PATH Example : Different type of arguments with custom handlers added. For path here you can pass '-path' followed by path value as argument
