Here is a simple example of using  to print out numbers from 0 to 9.Problem: Sometimes the code prints out the numbers from 0 to 7, then prints 9, then 8. Especially when you set  to a smaller number like 4 or 5.How do you get it to always print in sequence from 0 to 9? Why did it not print in sequence?Code
What happens in your code now?You create list of coroutines () that will each run  in thread pool, than you start them all at once (). Since multiple  running in same time and each prints on being run, all this prints can happen any time.What do you want to do?You probably don't really want to run coroutines in order (otherwise you can just call it in loop without ), you want to run them in thread pool concurrently, but print their results in order coroutines were createdIn this case you should:split actual work that will happen in thread fromprinting itprobably prefer to use asyncio.gather to get computed results in orderfinally print ordered results you got in main threadSummaryHere's modified version of your code that does explained above:
