I have 2 coroutines (, ) in different classes (, ) that are called regularly by a scheduler.At some time during the execution  needs a result that  is calculating during its run.What I would like to do is something like this:My approach is to have an empty Future in class_A that gets filled during co_A and in co_B wait in a loop until the Future is set:Is there a better way to do this without having to sleep in a loop until  has calculated the result?
Whole idea of futures is that you can await for it just like for coroutines, tasks, etc.See section "Things a coroutine can do" here.
I would use  class to synchronize coroutines. @Mikhail approach is 100% correct but doesn't address that you would like to get notified in the middle of .
