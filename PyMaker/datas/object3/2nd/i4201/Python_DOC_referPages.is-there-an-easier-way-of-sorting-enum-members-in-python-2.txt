I'm stuck with Python 2.7 for a project, and I have several s for integrating a Python framework (OpenERP) with a legacy framework.  In Python 2, s are not ordered by default:If order is important one has to manually add an  attribute.This works fine for smaller s, but I have several that have between 10 and 50 names, and that is simply too many to either type or read or keep in sequence when names are added/removed.Are there any other options?
As of 1 the  attribute can be a function; this function will be used as the  to  to put the  members in the correct order:and in use:While I wouldn't call this next version easier, if you can't use , and don't want to try and maintain a huge , it is possible using the Functional API:Ugly, but it works.  However, it would not work if the  field was needed.1 Disclosure:  I am the author of the Python stdlib , the  backport, and the Advanced Enumeration ()  library.2  is necessary in this case as I do not want the  value passed to the  constructor.3 the key function will be given one argument:no  -> a tuple of  where value may also be a tuple (it would have been in the example above)with  -> an  with fields  plus whatever fields are in  (so , , and  in the example above)
