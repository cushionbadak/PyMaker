In particular, it is not  encoded in some specific Unicode format like UTF-8, rather it represents Unicode Code Points in Python's internal  format. takes as input an , and returns a single character . The returned  is just like any other  in Python, and similarly is not a specific encoding using .At no point do either  or  deal with , nor do they deal with specific Unicode formats like UTF-8, they are only dealing with Python's internal  representation which deals more abstractly with Unicode Code Points.
You are right. and  deal only with single-character strings.Their documentation is quite clear about that:Use  /  for conversion to/from bytes.
