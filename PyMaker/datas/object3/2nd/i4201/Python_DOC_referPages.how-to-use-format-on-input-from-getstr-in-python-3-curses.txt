Natural Text
I'm trying to learn some very basic use of the curses library in Python 3.5.I'm facing the following problem: after retrieving the string "foo" with , if I use the string method  what is printed is the string with a prefixed b and apostrophes:  instead of just .Does .getstr return something different than a common string?What is happening here? What should I do to have just the variable printed?Here few lines of code to show the issue:Thank you
From  docs:Read a bytes object from the user, with primitive line editing capacity.So this API returns a  object that represents, well, raw data. You can convert it to text using  (it will assume UTF-8 encoding by default).Literature:https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html
