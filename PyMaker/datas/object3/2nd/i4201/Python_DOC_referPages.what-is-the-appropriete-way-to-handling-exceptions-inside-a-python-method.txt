You already seem to know how exceptions work.The best thing to do in case of an error is to  an exception.Returning some magic value is considered a bad practice, because it requires the caller to explicitly check for it, and a hundred of other reasons.You can simply let the  exception escape (by removing the  and the  block in ), and let the caller handle it with a  block, or, if you prefer to do some hiding, you can define a custom exception:and use it like this:Feel free to make the  class more informative by explicitly adding some attributes and a constructor to set those, if needed.The default constructor makes a decent job however:
