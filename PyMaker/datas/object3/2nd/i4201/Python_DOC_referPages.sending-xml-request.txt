I've spent a total of 30 minutes in python lol, so take that into consideration when you answer lol:I'm trying to send an HTTP POST request with a body and reading the response. I'm using Python 3.6.5 on Windows 10. This is what I have so far:import http.clientimport xml.dom.minidomtest.xml contains the XML request. When I run, I get an error:
Your problem is that you mixed up the  and  methods. (Not surprisingly, given the brevity and sparsity of the documentation… most modules in Python are documented a lot better than this, so don't let that worry you about the future.)The  method is a convenience function that adds the request line, all the headers, and the data all in one go. After you've done that, it's way too late to add a header, hence the error message.So, you can fix it either way.(1) Change it to use . I realize there's no example using  or  anywhere in the docs, but it looks like this:(2) Change it to use . This is what all the examples in the docs do; you just need to build up a dict of headers to pass to it:(3) Read this at the top of the docs:This module defines classes which implement the client side of the HTTP and HTTPS protocols. It is normally not used directly — the module urllib.request uses it to handle URLs that use HTTP and HTTPS.See also The Requests package is recommended for a higher-level HTTP client interface.For most real-life cases, you want to use  if you can use a third-party library, and  if you can't. They're both simpler, and better documented.
