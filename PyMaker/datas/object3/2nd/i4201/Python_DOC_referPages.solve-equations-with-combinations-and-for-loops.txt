I have equations with multiple unknowns, and a number range:I know that I can solve the equation by checking all possible combinations:So, the problem is that I want a function to deal with  amount of unknowns. So that both the following equations, or any, can be solved in the same manner above:I just cannot think of a way, since for each unknown you need a  loop. 
You could use  to generate the Cartesian product for anarbitrary number of variables:So you could modify your code like this:which yields a lot of solutions, such as The  unpacking operator was usedto create a function, , which accepts an arbitrary number of arguments (i.e. ), and also topass an arbitrary number of arguments to  (i.e. ).
