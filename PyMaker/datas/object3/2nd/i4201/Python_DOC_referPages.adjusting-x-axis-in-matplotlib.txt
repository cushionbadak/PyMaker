I have a range of values for every hour of year. Which means there are 24 x 365 = 8760 values. I want to plot this information neatly with matplotlib, with x-axis showing January, February...... Here is my current code:x_data is a list containing dates in  format. y_data contains values corresponding to the values in x_data. How can I get the plot neatly done with months on the X axis? An example:
You could create a scatter plot with horizontal lines as markers. The month is extracted by using the  module. In case the dates are not ordered, the plot sorts both lists first according to the date:OutputThe disadvantage is obviously that the lines have a fixed length. Also, if a month doesn't have a data point, it will not appear in the graph. Edit 1:You could also use Axes.hlines, as seen here.This has the advantage, that the line length changes with the window size. And you don't have to pre-sort the lists, because each start and end point is calculated separately. The toy dataset is created as above.Output  Edit 2:Now your description of the problem is totally different from what you show in your question. You want a simple line plot with specific axis formatting. This can be found easily in the  documentation and all over . An example, how to achieve this with the above created toy dataset would be:Output
