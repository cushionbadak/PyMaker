Natural Text
I'm trying to enable the downloading of previously uploaded files in Django, here's the code I'm using so far:The inspiration for this trial comes from this thread but I don't get it working. An empty txt file is downloaded instead of the image that is stored on the server.In this trial code the exact filename and extension is hard coded in the path variable.
Here is a way you can serve a file through Django (although it is usually not a good approach, the better one is to serve files with a webserver like nginx etc - for performance reasons): infers the content_type from the file extension.https://docs.python.org/3/library/mimetypes.htmlmore on HttpResponse here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/request-response/#django.http.HttpResponseAnd here is why it is not recommended to serve files through Django, although not recommended just means that you should probably understand what you are doing:https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/howto/static-files/deployment/
