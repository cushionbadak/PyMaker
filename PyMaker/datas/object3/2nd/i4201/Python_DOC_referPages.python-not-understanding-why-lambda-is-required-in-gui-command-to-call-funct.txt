This question already has an answer here:Why is Button parameter “command” executed when declared?                    7 answers                How to pass arguments to a Button command in Tkinter?                    12 answers                in the process of learning Python.I understand the use of lambda, here's an example and link(for others).Why are Python lambdas useful?Would assign [3, 6, 9] to  mult3.Here is the code I was required to do in the book's quiz:That is the verified solution. What I had come up with was the same except for the code in variable button.Here's my line:The absence of lambda prevents the counter from working. I don't understand why lambda is required? As I'm just calling a function I had made, I'm not requiring a new unnamed function..?Thanks in advance for your time :)
There are a couple of things going on here. First, When python compiles , it calls the function and assigns its result to . You called  and your callback is now  and that's obviously not what you want. You can't just do  which would simply make  the function to use in the callback because the API doesn't have a way to include arguments for the callback. So you doThis assigns an anonymous function that takes no parameters to  just like the API wants. The lambda contains a reference to  in the containing scope which it then uses to call . And that's how you created a parameter for the target callback you really wanted.This reference is a bit strange. Its a reference to the  slot in the containing scope, not the object that happens to be in  at the time of assignment. If you change  before the callback is made (or the containing scope disappears as in locals disappearing on return from a function), that new object is used. So, put your code in a function so you don't drive yourself crazy!
