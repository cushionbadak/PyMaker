Is there a way of changing the content of  instance in python?I don't want to just create a new string because i need to pass the string instance as a parameter to another class which will operate with it. Then I need to change the content of the string.I can't just create new method of the class so it reassigns the string because it's a  class of module .I need this to change the color of the widgets. I know that there are methods such as  method that will do that for me, but when I have about a hundred widgets and then I need to change the color of all of them and every color is different it's very non-elegant, inconvinient to write config line for each one of that widgets and it is very hard to maintain.I thought in this case it would be great to use a pointer but unfortunately there are no pointers in python. I even thought about creating some kind of class that would somehow  the  content instead of the instance identifier such as .I don't want to use the  method though, because of the brackets  at the end. In this example i simply want to return  string. Is this even possible?
No, you can't change string objects once they are created. String are immutableHowever, If I understand you right, what you want can be done with
