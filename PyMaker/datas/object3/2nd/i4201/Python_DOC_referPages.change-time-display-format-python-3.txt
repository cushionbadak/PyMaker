I'm adding UTC time strings to Bitbucket API responses that currently only contain Amsterdam (!) time strings. For consistency with the UTC time strings returned elsewhere, the desired format is  (followed by , but that's not germane).What's the best way to create such a string (without a microsecond component) from a  instance with a microsecond component?I'll add the best option that's occurred to me as a possible answer, but there may well be a more elegant solution.Edit: I should mention that I'm not actually printing the current time â€“ I used  to provide a quick example. So the solution should not assume that any  instances it receives will include microsecond components.
If you want to format a  object in a specific format that is different from the standard format, it's best to explicitly specify that format:See the documentation of  for an explanation of the  directives.

In Python 3.6:https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.isoformat
This is the way I do it. ISO format:You can replace the 'T' if you don't want ISO format:
Yet another option:By default this uses local time, if you need UTC you can use the following:
Keep the first 19 characters that you wanted via slicing:
Since not all  instances have a microsecond component (i.e. when it is zero), you can partition the string on a "." and take only the first item, which will always work:
I usually do:output:
We can try something like below
I found this to be the simplest way.
