I made a treeview, and I want to add values in first and second column and then the program needs to calculate the values that will put in third column when you press the ENTER button (I used events and binds). I do not know how to put values in the specific column in treeview , I always get this error:I know how to insert values in every column at once, but I do not know how to insert only one value to a specific column, without changing the values in other columns.This is the function that I wrote:
The  method is creating a new item in the  but what you want to do is editing an existing item, so this is not the method to use.One possibility is to use the  method of the  to either get or set the value in a specific column: will give you the value in the first column. will change the value of the third column into .You can also use the column's name (the one given in  when creating the ) instead of .Another possibility is to use the  method: will give you the values of the item. will change the last value of the item.Documentation on the Treeview widget: http://infohost.nmt.edu/tcc/help/pubs/tkinter/web/ttk-Treeview.html
