Given a list of functions (functions) and an integer n, I'm trying to figure out a way to compose them stepwise, and return a list of each stepwise result as follows:So, as of now I have figured out how to compose a list of functions and return the result as follows:However, I'm extremely confused how to keep track of each step and return it as a list. I'm assuming that I need to use map somehow in order to map each stepwise piece to the list. I have also come up with a method to apply all functions in the list to n as such:I was thinking of somehow using the composeFunction function to compose a new list of stepwise functions, all the way up until the fully composed function, and then using this as my new list for the apply_all_functions in order to achieve the desired result. But currently, I'm pretty stumped. 
You can use  with a composition function
 is the way to go, but if you're wondering how you could do it on your own, here's one wayIf you need the form in your original questionThe above form operates on  and  which shows this can be expressed as a vanilla
