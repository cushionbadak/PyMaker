What does .start() do in the following script?
From the Python documentation for the start methodhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/re.htmlIt returns the index of the substring that matched.So, str2.start() is where the regex was matched in str1.Think of that return as saying, Returning everything in str1 up to where the regex was matched, and strip whitespace.
If you are more of a reader, the documentation of  would tell you what it does.If you are more of an experimenter, open an interactive  console, and input the following (feel free to change the input data, after all you are an experimenter):Short explanation: it tells you the index of the starting position of the match.Hope this answer will teach you something more than just what does  do ;-)
