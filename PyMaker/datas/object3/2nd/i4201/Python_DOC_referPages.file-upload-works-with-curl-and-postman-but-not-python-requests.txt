I am attempting to upload a CSV file to an API (which gives me very little error info) using python requests library.(I'm running Python 3.5 and using requests version 2.18.4 on OS X 10.11.6)This curl command in terminal works fine: A multipart/form-data POST request from Postman also works, but I can't seem to make it work with the python requests library.I've tried many variations of this request:I get a status code of 200, but the response is  (frustratingly unhelpful).What am I missing in the python request compared to the curl request?EDIT: it seems that the  flag for the  command emulates an HTML form that has been submitted...is there a way to do this with requests?
In your  code you're using the  parameter, which submits the data as a multipart message - in other words you're uploading a file.With  you can post files with the  parameter. An example:  Note that  creates the Content-Type header automatically, based on the submitted data. 
The python  function returns a file object. This is not what you want to send to the API.Instead, you can use:Syntax taken from here.
