You need to strip the newlines off each of the dictionary lines. In other words:When you iterate a file like , you get a string for each line in the file, including the newline at the end. So, your dictionary ends up full of entries like  instead of .
You can strip the trailing newline from  by calling str.strip.You can also use  to load the contents of the file which doesn't include newlines.
