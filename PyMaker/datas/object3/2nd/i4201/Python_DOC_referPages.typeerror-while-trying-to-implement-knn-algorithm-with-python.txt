Error I am gettingDataset ScreenshotI am getting TypeError while executing the code basically in this program i am trying to find euclidian distance from a test point to each point in the given dataset and then after sorting trying to get neighbors with least distance .
The error says you are trying to subtract a string from a string (line 22 in your  function)You need to parse the two co-ordinates into numbers to be able to subtract them. The float function will be able to do that.Example - you're using  which is a string representing a floating point number, so  should give you a number.Just leave a comment if you're still struggling and I'll show you the update you need to make.
