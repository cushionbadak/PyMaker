I have a data frame with a column 'Date' with data type datetime64. The values are in YYYY-MM-DD format. How can I convert it to YYYY-MM format and use it as a datetime64 object itself.I tried converting my datetime object to a string in YYYY-MM format and then back to datetime object in YYYY-MM format but it didn't work.Original data = 1988-01-01.Converting datatime object to string in YY-MM formatThis worked as expected, my column value became1988-01  Converting the string back to datetime object in Y-m formatI was expecting the Date column in YYYY-MM format but it became YYYY-MM-DD format. 1988-01-01  Can you please let me know if I am missing something.Thanks
