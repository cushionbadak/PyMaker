For the normal arrays, use :'s though are a little tricky because of how Python renders them as strings:One hack you could use though for simple ones is replacing the whitespace with commas using :Then, you can use  and turn it back into a :
I would suggest that you don't actually want to do this. This kind of thing isn't going to be scalable easily to sending, for instance, instances of classes you've defined across a network. Instead, I would suggest that you use something like pickle or json to convert the data to bytes, send it across the network, and then convert the data back. However, in other situations I would always use ast.literal_eval. If you specify how you are sending the data across the network, I'll give you example usage of  for your situation.
Try this:

If you're sure the strings are always going to have that structure, you could remove the brackets and split the string:
