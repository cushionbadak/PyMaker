I have a form that allows you to pick multiple project types to filter from.  For instance, say you have the project types "Research", "Training", and "Evaluation". Basically what I'm looking to do is build a queryset using Q objects like:I'm just not sure how to build this without the filter() input being a string, which produces an error: So what would be a way to iterate over the types to create a queryset with Q objects?
You are just building a string with no relationship to actual  query objects; start with the first  instance and add more:You could also use the  function to do this:The  call does exactly the same thing as the  loop above; take a series of  objects and combine them into a larger query with all the parts combined with  or operations.
