(I am quite a newbie in Python, so lots of things puzzle me even after reading the tutorial...)Initially, I had the code like the following:-- which did what I expected. But then for some reason I wanted to determine the number of members in matrix; as len(matrix) gave an error, I decided to copy it with converting to the list: . Surprisingly, after this line the content of matrix seems to be changed - or at least I cannot use it the same way as above:Can anybody explain what is going on there?
You're using Python 3, correct? returns a generator that can only be iterated once. If you want to use it more than once, then your options are:Write  each time you need it.(iterate  as many times as you like. This is the easy option. The downside is that if  is big then it uses a lot of memory that the generator doesn't.)(iterate each of  and  once. This is worse than the  in your usage, but it's useful if you want to partially consume , then use some of , more of , etc)(iterate but using , not , as many times as you like. Doesn't use extra memory for a copy of the result like the  solution, but the syntax for using it is a bit annoying)(iterate using  as many times as you like. Deals with the syntax annoyance, although you still have to beware that if you modify  between iterations over  then you'll get different results.)
