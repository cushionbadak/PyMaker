I am working on a Python program, and I have results on the command line.Now I need to do analysis on the results, so I need all results as exported in any format like either SQL, or Excel or CSV format.Can some tell me how can i do that ?Here this is infinite loop and I want to have a csv file containing 2 column of x1 and x2. and with regularly updated all values of x1 and x2 row wise (1 row for 1 iteration) But by this code I'm getting a csv file which is named as 'large1.csv' and containing only one row (last updated values of x1 and x2).So how can I get my all values of x1 and x2 as row was in python.
Have a look at the open() documentation.Mode  will truncate the file, which means it will replace the contents. Since you call that every loop iteration, you are continuously deleting the file and replacing it with a new one. Mode  appends to the file and is maybe what you want. You also might consider opening the file outside of the loop, in that case  might be the correct mode.
Just use the csv format it can easily imported into Excel andthe python standard library supports csv out of the box. @See python-csv
One way to handle this is to use the CSV module, and specifically a Writer object to write the output to a CSV file (perhaps even instead of writing to ). The documentation has several examples, including this one:You should then be able to import the CSV file easily in Excel if that is what you want.
