I'm working with CSV files and here is what I have so far. I get an error that my index is out of range. It finishes the first for loop and then messes up. I am trying to populate a dictionary.
Your  loop isn't going to break as soon as  becomes empty, it's just going to check that at the start of each loop.So, when you've read all but the last line, you do this:The smallest fix is to put the check directly after each :(Note that if there's a blank line in the middle of your file, you will return early instead of raising an error, because you're checking  after the , so you can no longer distinguish between an empty line, , and end-of-file, . If that's a problem, just move the test up one line.)A better fix would be to just iterate over the file:  does exactly what you want the loop to do, without having to deal with  and checking for empty strings and ing from a loop and so on.But a much better fix would be to  use the  module and let it do what it does:Or, alternatively, just build a list of dicts (which you can do with ), then convert it to a dict of lists at the end.
