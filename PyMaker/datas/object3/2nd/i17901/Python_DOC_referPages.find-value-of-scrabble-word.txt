I have little experience in any higher level language. Fiddled with basic and dos-batch when I was a kid.I'm trying to find the point value of a word in scrabble. This kind of recursive structure seems slow and inefficient. What would be a better way to address this problem in terms of program structure/concept?
You'd loop over  directly and use :There is no need to use recursion here; the above needs no globals either. Try to avoid global state, as that easily leads to hard-to-debug problems when you start using functions in multiple locations.
First of all, you can use  of values instead of , and just count index for the letter  in this  as Second, don't use , it is a bad programming habit. You should accumulate your value in local variable and then  this value from the function.And third, use loop instead of recursion or, even better, functions like .

Yeah, function call is expensive is Python.Martijn Pieters's method is a good example for beginners to understand list-comprehensions.If you want a more simple and readable way, try this:
