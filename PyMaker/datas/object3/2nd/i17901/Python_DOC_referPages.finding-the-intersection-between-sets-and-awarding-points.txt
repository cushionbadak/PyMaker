First, I apologize, I am an extreme beginner, so I will probably sound ignorant.I have 5 word sets. 4 of them are imported through csv, the other one is created from user input. I would like to find the intersection between the input set and each one of the other sets. Then award points based on how many intersections there are.For example, I would like to find the intersections between "set_1" and "input_set". For each of the intersections add 1 to user_score. Then, find the intersection between "set_2" and "input_set" and for each of those intersections add 2 to user_score. And so on up to add 4 per intersection.Would I use an if loop or a for loop?Something like this?or like this?or am I way off? Any help is appreciated. Thanks!
This:â€¦ isn't how for loops work. You need a loop variable, like this:If you don't care what the "thing" is, you can call it . This doesn't have any special meaning, but conventionally it implies that it's a useless dummy variable:Meanwhile, if you're using the built-in  type, there's no function called , but there's a method called , which you can use like this:You can also spell this as the  operator.However, if you think about it, there's a much quicker way to do this: instead of looping, just get the  of the intersection. So:One last refinement: Instead of having four separate variables for the four sets, why not just have a list of sets? Do you also have four copied-and-pasted-with-slight-variations chunks of code to create the separate variables? If so, get rid of them. Then you can do this:Even if you have the separate variables, you can always create  on the fly, like this:But it would probably be better to just have a list of the sets in the first place, instead of four separate variables. See this blog post and this one for more discussion on that.
