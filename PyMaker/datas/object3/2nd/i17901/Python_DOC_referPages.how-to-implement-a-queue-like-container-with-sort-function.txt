I want to a fixed length list-like container, it should have a sorted()-like function that I can use to sort it,I think there should also a function I can use it to detect whether the numbers of items in it reaches the length of the container , because if the numbers of items in it reaches the length(fixed) of the container,I want to process the data in it .Is there a container in Python like this ?If not, what base container should be used to implement such container?the container is similar to queue ,but queue doesn't have a sort  function 
You can make your own container class if you want. Below is a very simplistic sample that may point you in the right direction.Calling this function with  and  will sort the list depending on the length of your items and convert all strings to lowercase.
It sounds like a PriorityQueue fits the spec. This allows items to be added to the queue in any order (up to a maximum), but they are then taken off the queue in sorted order:Output:
