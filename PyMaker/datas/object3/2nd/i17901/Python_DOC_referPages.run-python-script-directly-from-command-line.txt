I put that at the top of a script.  I've seen that should make the script runnable from the command line without the need for .  Unless I'm misunderstanding I should be able to use  as long as I have the above line at the top of the script.  Is this correct?  It isn't working for me I just get an error indicating that I would have to use  at the beginning of the 'call'.
Universal running of Python scriptsYou can pretty much universally run without the shebang () withOr nearly equivalently (it places the current directory on your path and executes the module named ) (preferably do this!):from the command line, as long as you have Python installed and on your path environment variable (i.e. set to run with , which, if installed, would typically be the case).Shebangs () are a Unix thing.The shebang, as you're using it, is typically for running on a Unix platform (typically Apple or Linux). Windows would typically require cygwin to use the shebang.You can usually default to whatever python is available on your system path with:Assuming you're on a Unix, you might try other locations for your python setup, like:Muddling throughYou can see what python you're currently using by using the unix  command, so if you want to see where your python is coming from, use this command:or on Windows (cygwin probably can run the shebang):On Linux/Unix, you'll need execution perms to run the file as well, in that manner. Use chmod (chmod also may apply to Cygwin in Windows)If you're not running as root, you may require , and that would be And then attempt to run (within the same directory) with
make the file executableand then from the same directory as file.py:
