Given a dictionary with lists as values.How can I remove items from the dictionary if the value list is empty?I tried to iterate over the dictionary and remove items, but the dictionary size is not allowed to change during iteration.
Using dict comprehension:Adding, deleting dictionary entries are not allowed while iterating it. Make a copy of keys to overcome it. For example, in the following, I used  to get copy of the keys.
This will remove any key for which the value is and empty array.
