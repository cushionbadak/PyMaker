I am getting a bit of headache just because a simple looking, easy statement is throwing some errors in my face.I have a json file called strings.json like this:I want to read the json file, just that for now. I have these statements which I found out, but it's not working:The error displayed on the console was this:EditedChanged from  to and got this:
The  method (without "s" in "load") can read a file directly:You were using the  method, which is used for string arguments only. Edit:The new message is a totally different problem. In that case, there is some invalid json in that file. For that, I would recommend running the file through a json validator.There are also solutions for fixing json like for example How do I automatically fix an invalid JSON string?.
Here is a copy of code which works fine for mewith the datayou may want to wrap your json.load line with a try catch because invalid JSON will cause a stacktrace error message.
The problem is using with statement:The file is going to be implicitly closed already. There is no need to call  again.
In python 3, we can use below method.Read from file and convert to JSONorUsing with statement will automatically close the opened file descriptor. String to JSON
To add on this, today you are able to use pandas to import json:https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_json.htmlYou may want to do a careful use of the orient parameter.
