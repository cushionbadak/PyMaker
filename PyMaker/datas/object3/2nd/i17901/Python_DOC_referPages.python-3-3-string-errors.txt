I'm trying to make a very basic calculator to familiarize myself with the basics of python. Part of the code involves asking for inputs and setting those as different variables, but the variables put in as inputs are stored as strings, even though they're entered as numbers:Is there a fix for this? 
 doesn't modify the variable you pass it. Instead, it converts the value you give it and returns a .Soby itself does nothing, wherewill give the behavior you're looking for.Keep in mind that  (and the other type-conversion functions) will throw an exception if you pass them something they're not expecting.  For a better user experience, you should handle these exceptions1.  Typically, one does this in a loop:We can wrap this behavior up into a nice little function to make it more re-usable:and call it like this:1 - Wow, I just realized that I independently wrote almost the exact same code as the Python tutorial, which I linked to, after the fact.
You can convert the inputs to float when you take them from the user.TryAnd so on.
Yes. Simply convert it to a float:or an integer:
