 removes all the leading and trailing characters from the input string that match one of the characters in the parameter string:You want to use a regex:  or s path manipulation functions:
I don't know what you need is, but if it's retrieving filename without extension, you have the  function:
Maybe a bit late, but for those reading this in the future, there is a lazy way that appears to work fine too (assuming all the files from which you want to retrieve the names are CSV files):As said in other solutions, the  method removes all the leading/trailing characters that match those inside the parentheses. Therefore, the idea in this approach is to:Remove the  extension - since there is a  we know  will stop searching there. This will leave us with the  string.Remove the  from the  string - the  will only look for trailing dots.Why : Since we know that the text to be removed is in the end of the string, we can specify  for better control (i.e. to avoid unintentionally removing any eventual leading c, s or v characters)
