I usein order to import some module.How to add permanently this folder  to the Python library path, so that I will be able to use onlyin the future?(Even after a reboot, etc.)
just put the folder in  directory. ie:Note: you need to add an empty file  to the folderFiles named  are used to mark directories on disk as a Python package directories.If you have the files:you can import the code in module.py as:If you remove the  file, Python will no longer look for submodules inside that directory, so attempts to import the module will fail.If you have lots of folders, then create the empty  file in each folder. for eg:
Set PYTHONPATH environment variable to D:/my_library_folder/
If  is a project you're working on and has a setup script, you could also do .  Not entirely related to the question, but I also recommend using virtualenv.
