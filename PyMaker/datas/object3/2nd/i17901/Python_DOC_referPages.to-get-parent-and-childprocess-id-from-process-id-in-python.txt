I am trying to get the  of the process that I want.I used following code to get the pidNow in the , I have the pid of the process say ruby, I want to get the parent process ID  and child process ID of the same process.I need this solution to be run on  6.0Is there any way to get that like  and ? Or do I need to do it by  command again and splitting?
Using this code is a bad idea. Your code will not work on solaris.You can use 'psutil' library, that way you can keep your code independent of os.https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil
I presume there's nothing wrong with os.getppid() .Shrug.http://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#process-parameters
The answer depends on your system's  command. On Linux,  will include the PPID for each process with the  flag (among others), so  will include the ruby process id in  and ruby's PPID in .
