I am trying to figure out how to append multiple values to a list in Python. I know there are few methods to do so, such as manually input the values, or pur the append operation in a  loop, or and  functions. However, I wonder if there is a more neat way to do so? Maybe a certain package or function?I am day 1 to Python, so please forgive me if I asked naive question.Thank you very much. :)
You can use the sequence method  to extend the list by multiple values from any kind of iterable, being it another list or any other thing that provides a sequence of values.So you can use  to append a single value, and  to append multiple values.
Other than the  function, if by "multiple values" you mean another list, you can simply concatenate them like so.
If you take a look at the official docs, you'll see right below , .  That's what your looking for.There's also  if you are more interested in efficient iteration than ending up with a fully populated data structure.
