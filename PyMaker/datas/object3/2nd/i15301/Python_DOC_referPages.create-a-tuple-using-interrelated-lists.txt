This question already has an answer here:What's the Pythonic way to combine two sequences into a dictionary?                    2 answers                I have 2 lists which are interlinked as exampleandI have to create a tuple using these 2 lists.Final output should be    data={'pablo':21,'rob':23,'rahul':20,'roni':24}.And let the output of the above problem is given. How can I get back the original lists i.e. 'name' and 'age'.How can I do it using python commands?
