I wonder what is the meaning of  (e.g. ) in Python Tkinter. I was trying to check what is returned by Of course it will return  But when I check what is returned by the widget before packing, it gives something as this . This is how I got it in IDLE Python3.3.
The number  is the unique Python object id of the button widget:Moreover, the string  is the button widget's window path name.  Window path names are used internally by the TCL interpreter to keep track of widgets as well as what their parents are.  In other words, they are paths for the interpreter to follow in order to reach particular widgets.You'll notice too that  is the same number returned by the  method:Note however that  only returns the last portion of a widget's window path name (its object id).  To get the full path, you need to call  by doing either  or .The documentation for calling  can found through :In addition, you may be interested in the Basic Widget Methods page over on Effbot (specifically, the section which talks about the  methods).  It contains information about how to get specific parts of a widget's window path name.Also, if you want the Python representation of the object, you can use :
yieldsAs you can see, the  of the widget is a  for the root widget, and is a dot-separated sequence of  numbers for child widgets. The sequence of id numbers shows the lineage of the widget.
