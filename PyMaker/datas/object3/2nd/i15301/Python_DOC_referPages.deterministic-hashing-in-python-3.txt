I'm using hashing of strings for seeding random states in the following way:This is unfortunately (for my usage) non-deterministic between runs in Python 3.3 and up. I do know that I could set the  environment variable to an integer value to regain the determinism, but I would probably prefer something that feels a bit less hacky, and won't entirely disregard the extra security added by random hashing. Suggestions?
Use a purpose-built hash function.  is an excellent choice; alternatively, check out the  module for more options.
Forcing Python's built-in  to be deterministic is intrinsically hacky.  If you want to avoid hackitude, use a different hashing function -- see e.g in Python-2: https://docs.python.org/2/library/hashlib.html,and in Python-3: https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html
