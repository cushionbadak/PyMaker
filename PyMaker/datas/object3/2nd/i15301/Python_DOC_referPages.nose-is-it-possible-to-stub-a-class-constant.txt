N00b at Nose framework here.Looking at the docs for unittest.mock, I do not see an obvious way to stub a variable. I am testing a class with constants declared. One constant is a really large int and for testing purposes, I'd like to replace it with a much smaller int.My understanding is that you can only mock (with the @patch decorator) a function, and not a variable.Is this possible, and if so, how?
You can use the patch decorator to replace a constant.  e.g.:Specifically, look at the documentation for the  keyword argument to  (or any of the various items in the  family)...I'm on python2.x where  was still a 3rd party module.  Changing to  should make the above code work for you.
