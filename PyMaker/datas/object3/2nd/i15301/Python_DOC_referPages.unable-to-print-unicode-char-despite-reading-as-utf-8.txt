I am reading in file as follows:Code gets struck at this line (I don't know if it will show in browser):Notice that Black Chess Queen (i.e. \u265b) just after the words  seems to be causing the problem as reported in-I have-read docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.htmlused used  while opening fileNo love. Also charbase says that python escape for that BCQ is , what does it mean & am I not implementing it already?Edit: Strangely, typing  or  in IDLE works fine without any error & shows that beautiful BCQ - so what is wrong, why won't my code read beyond this line?
The problem occurs when you are trying to print the BCQ character. I would guess that your console encoding/locale is not capable of emitting all Unicode code points - i.e. it is either ASCII or a 256-character codepage.Instead of printing, try:
The error is (almost) self explainatory. It says that Python tries to encode the string in Windows 1252 character set, that cannot represent . It works fine in idle, because idle is a GUI application is only limited by the glyphs that the font can represent, whereas a console application con only display the 256 characters of the code page of the console.You should explicitely convert the string into a byte array in the correct code page, with  :Of course it will display a  instead of the  as the console driver cannot display that UTF character, but you won't get any error.If you do not like the  saying that you are printing 8 bits characters, just convert back to string again :The forward-reverse encoding just ensures that all characters are now printable on the console (or are replaced).
