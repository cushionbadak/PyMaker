why it is showing error on line 14
You cannot assign to , no. If you wanted to get the next letter in the alphabet, you'll have to do a little more work:That creates a new character from the ordinal of the current character, plus one.Far more pythonic would be to use the  string in a loop:This'll loop once over all uppercase letters in the ASCII standard; you can always use  if you need to limit the loop to  at some point, or use a numeric limit (between 0 and 26) and use slicing. However you are not even using the  variable anywhere in your loop.
