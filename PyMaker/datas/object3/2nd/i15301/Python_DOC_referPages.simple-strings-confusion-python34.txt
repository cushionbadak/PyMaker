I am REALLY new to this and have been trying to figure this out for a day now. Having a bit of an issue with Python34. Here is my code:When I input- Jerome enter 22 enter into the console it still goes to the condition by printing:Why is this happening? I also tried messing with the if statement by writing it like this:  and I still got the same response.
In Python 3, the  function returns a string, but you are trying to compare  to an integer. Convert one or the other first. You can use the  function to do this:or use:Converting the user input to an integer has the advantage that you can make other comparisons, like smaller then, or greater then, etc.You may want to read up on asking for user input with proper error handling, in that context. See Asking the user for input until they give a valid response.
This is the culprit always returns a stringtype cast it to  like ORChange your  condition asBut this is an inferior method, as if you want to use your age somewher else, then it will become a problem
The method  returns a string, which is a word or sentence, but you need to make it an integer, a whole number. To do that, just simply type instead of , you need to type . That will turn it into an integer. Hope this helps!
