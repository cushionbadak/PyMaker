I have a string:I want to cycle through the string and, one by one, replace each character with one of 4 characters (1,2,3,4):etc etc and so forth. However everytime I try, I end up altering the original string and my output ends up being strings of 1s!Example code below:
Rather than change a list you reuse between iterations, produce a new list each time and replace the one character:You can combine this with a nested loop:In essence you are creating the product of  and a position from , so you could use  to make that a single loop:With a little  trickery you could make this a one-liner generator expression to produce all combinations:This builds a new list on the fly by iteration over , swapping out the one character at position  for the digit.Demo:
Reinitialize the list each time.
