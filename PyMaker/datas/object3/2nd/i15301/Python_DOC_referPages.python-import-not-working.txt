In the given file structure, when I try to access the class ekantipurSpider in spiderdir_test.py,i.e from spiders import ekantipur, it says following error.
You cannot import  from the  directory like that, unless you have it in your  environment variable. Please read about Python's import system.For a quick and dirty (!) fix add this at the top of your file:Or read this post about relative imports: Import a module from a relative path
try running the spiderdir_test.py from the parent folder of spiders and tests with this command "python -m tests/spiderdir_test". Note that you need to have __init__.py into tests folder also. Basically you will be running spiderdir_test.py as a module.
