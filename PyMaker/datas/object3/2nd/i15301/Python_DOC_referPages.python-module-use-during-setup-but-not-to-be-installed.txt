How can I specify to Setuptools that a module should be available during setup, but not installed for run-time?I have made an extension command used by my Python distribution (in this case it auto-generates version metadata), and the module is included in the project tree.To run Setuptools commands (such as  or ), the  module is imported by . So that file  needs to be part of the source distribution.But putting that file in the source distribution also (by default?) automatically includes it in any binary distribution, such as  or . That's wrong, because the file isn't needed at run-time and should not be installed.How can I specify that the file is a Python module needed in the source distribution for setup commands, but not to be installed?
You can include source distribution files in the  file; these files are included when building a source distribution that includes the  file.Do not include the file in  or  or  and it won't be included in the binary distribution (just like  won't be).
