This question already has an answer here:Generate a list of datetimes between an interval                    5 answers                I have two yyyymm values that will be input by a user:I want to be able to iterate through this range in increasing month order:How can this be done in python?Update: Ideally, the solution should be as simple as possible without requiring external libraries.  I'm not looking for a generic date manipulation solution, but a solution to answer the specific question I have asked above.I had seen lots of generic solutions before posting my question.  However, being a python noob, couldn't see how to adapt them to my question:Generate a list of datetimes between an intervalIterating through a range of dates in PythonOn that note, the other questions linked to from this page are much more generic.  If you are looking to generate a range of yyyymm values, I urge you to look at the selected answer on this page.
Here's another rather simple variant, without even using . Just split the date, calculate the 'total month', and iterate.Output:For output in the same  format, use .
You can do this using the builtin  module and the third party package .The code first converts your strings to  objects using . It then uses the  function from  to create a period of one month that can be added to your datetimes.Within the  loop you can either work with the  objects directly, or construct the month and year as strings using , I've shown an example of both in print functions.
