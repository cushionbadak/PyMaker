I'm attempting to create a program that relates to poker using python.When someone inputs , is there a way to separate the  from the ?
The easiest way to break a string into individual characters is to call  on it:This will iterate over the string and collect its characters into a new list object.
You can access each individual character in a string using its index, there's no need to convert the input to a list. If it's just two characters, you can always do this:Or even simpler, we can unpack the elements in the string:Now  will contain the string value  and  will be equal to . Be careful with the edge case though - how do we process a card such as ? a bit clunkier, but we can use regular expressions, and this will work for all valid inputs of cards:
Convert it to a list:
Note that all these answers are scary if you'll be expecting input like  rather than . In which case I'd consider stripping the last token (which should always be a single character representing the suit) from the rest and doing that instead.This plays nicely for more "normal" inputs as well:
