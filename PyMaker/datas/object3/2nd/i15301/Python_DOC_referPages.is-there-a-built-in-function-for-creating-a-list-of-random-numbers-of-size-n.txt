The standard way of creating a list of random numbers is:However, I recently stumbled upon , which is much more compact:But this results in an error if  is greater than 10. So, my question is, does there exist a built-in function that does exactly what I intend it to do without running into error? If not, is there at least a more efficient alternative to the first excerpt (considering that  can be quite large)?
The activity of sampling is to select a maximum of  elements from the sample space of size . That is why you are getting an error.Having said that, there are many efficient ways to solve your problem.We can simply wrap your code in a list comprehension, like thisUse  instead of , like thisIf the number of possible elements is small, you can even use  like thisNote: Since  is going to large, if you are using Python 2.7, use  instead of .

No, there is not a function specifically dedicated to this task.  But you can use a list comprehension if you want to condense the code:
I think you're going to just have to sample it n times, each with size 1.  The reason you are running into the error is that sample doesn't want to repeat numbers:  when you ask for 12 unique numbers from a 10 element list, it chokes.  Try:
