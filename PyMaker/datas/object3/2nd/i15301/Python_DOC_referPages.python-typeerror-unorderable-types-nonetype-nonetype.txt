Using IPtools python package I am trying to see if an ip address is in a specific range or not. Here is my code:and here is how my file looks like:I am getting this error, which I cannot find why. can anybody help?
The  function returns  if it cannot parse a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address.Both your  and  addresses failed to parse as such, and the  function on two  values then fails with the exception you got:Triple-check the addresses you pass in to make sure they are valid. You could catch this exception to print out the values that cause the problem, for example:on a side note, you do not need to test for  in an  statement. That is what  is for. With comparison chaining the statement doesn't mean what you think it means in any case. Strictly use:When using  you are really testing , which will never be true.
