I have a class:I'd like to write a unit test to test the  method. The problem is that it requires an instance of the  class which is very complicated to construct in isolation as it requires network connections and other stuff. How can I mock this class and provide something that just has the  method. So that I can create the  class and test the method.
By use  library you can patch  class and replace it by a  object.  library was designed exactly to do these kind of works and to break hard dependencies from problematic object or real resources.In your simple example the complete test will be:module_a.pymodule_a_test.pyPatch will live just for your test method context. That is a simple and straightforward example of how to use mocks and patches from  but the real cases can be little more complicated. 
Create a mock class for B, e.g.:Then, in your test case, wrap A in a class that inits with MockB instead of regular B:Though, to be honest, I'm not sure what that proves.
