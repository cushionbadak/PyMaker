I have below dictionary:And  and  return following:How do  and  really work in this case?
 and  work on iterables. If you try to convert a dictionary into an iterable, you get back its keys. So,  is sort of the same as . There are some details on the ordering of the various builtin types here. As an example,  is . This is used to find the maximum of the list. Similarly for . As a note, I wouldn't recommend doing something like this in production code.
 and  functions, when applied on dictionaries, they work on the keys of the dictionary.In your case, they have to work onAs you can see, there are multiple types of data present in it. In Python 2.7, if the types are different, then the string value of the types are used for comparison.. Quoting from that section,Note that comparing objects of different types is legal. The outcome is deterministic but arbitrary: the types are ordered by their name. Thus, a list is always smaller than a string, a string is always smaller than a tuple, etc. (The rules for comparing objects of different types should not be relied upon; they may change in a future version of the language.)So if you actually sort the dictionary keys,As you can see now, the smallest is  and the biggest is .
