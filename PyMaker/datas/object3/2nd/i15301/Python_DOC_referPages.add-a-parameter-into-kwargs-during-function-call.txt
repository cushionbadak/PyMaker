Is there a way to add key-value-pair into kwargs during the function call?Or even change the existing arguments?These two examples don't work, as they raise errorPointing at the comma in between the arguments
For Python versions < 3.5, you need to place the  variable keyword argument last:See the Calls expression syntax; in all forms of the grammar the  rule is placed last. In other words, using anything after the  syntax is a syntax error.If you want to update the dictionary with new values, you can use the  callable; it can create a copy of your existing dictionary and update keys in that, provided the keys are also valid Python identifiers (start with a letter or underscore, and only contain letters, digits and underscores):Here  sets a new value for the  key. This same syntax can be used to add keys too, of course.You cannot use the same key both in the  mapping and explicitly; that'll raise a . Again, from the documentation already linked:If the syntax  appears in the function call,  must evaluate to a mapping, the contents of which are treated as additional keyword arguments. In the case of a keyword appearing in both  and as an explicit keyword argument, a  exception is raised.Demo:This restriction has been lifted as of Python 3.5 (thanks to PEP-448 -- Additional Unpacking Generalizations; you can now freely mix the order of argument types and use multiple  references in a call (using distinct mappings). Keywords still have to be unique across all arguments applied; you still can't 'override' arguments that appear more than once.
