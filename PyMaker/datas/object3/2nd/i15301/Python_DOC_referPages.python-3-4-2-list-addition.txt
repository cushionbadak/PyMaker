I'm really new at Python and programming in general. I'm supposed to add the first 7 numbers in the listso I wrote this code:but it only prints out "97710396"which is the numbers just printed out as it was an index without spaces. How do I add them so I can get 51 to print out? 
Without giving too much away... the "numbers" in your list are actually s, and python allows you to add strings... by concatenating them together. So  gives you . You need to convert these s into s as , so  gives .
Convert everything to an integer, sum what you need, print it:
You need to convert strings to s to do numeric operations (instead of string concatenations):Or, using  with list slice (useful if the items to add are continuous items)
These are individual strings. You cannot do math on strings.What happens when you do  on strings is called string concatenation.ie.  will produce  and not You need to convert these to integers using  in order to perform arithmetic.So eitheror a snazzy list comprehension with list slicing and sum
The list  contains string variables. Integers are whole numbers. You need to change the values in the  list to integers. To do that, you need to remove the quotes around the values in . Then it will output the sum of all the numbers in that list. Hope this helps.

You can use  with  for this ,As you tagged this question with python 3.x the  is now part of  module.
