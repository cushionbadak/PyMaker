I have a tkinter GUI that allows users to perform searches on a sqlite database. The database is not static so it's unknown how long each search will take. The application is single threaded (and I'd like to keep it that way). I'd therefore like a progressbar (or something animated) to re-assure the user that something is happening while the search is going on. At first glance  looked like it might do the trick with its  mode but it doesn't seem to work as detailed in TkDocs.For indeterminate progress TkDocs states......at the start of the operation you'll just call the progressbar's "start" method, and at the end of the operation, you'll call its "stop" method. The progressbar will take care of the rest....but that doesn't seem to be the case. If I just use  before I perform my sqlite query, and  once it's finished, the progress bar is present but doesn't animate at all.I can force it to update if I execute the sqlite select statement in a  loop and include a  and a . But this impacts performance and only really works if multiple lines are returned since the loop is .So how can I get an indeterminate progress bar (or animation) to animate on a single thread without forcing it with  and ?The code. This doesn't work...Works-ish, but is hacky.
So taking your second working code block and refactoring out the progress bar update cleans things up.
