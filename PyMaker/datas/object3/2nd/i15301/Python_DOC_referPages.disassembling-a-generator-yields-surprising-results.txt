I know how to use generators but I don't know anything about their internals. I tried this:Now I disassemble it:Why does the opcodes suggest  while  actually returns a generator?
All functions return  at their end if there is no explicit return, generators are no exception. As of Python 3.3, generators can return a final value when ending, but in Python 2.7 a blank return is mandatory if you use  to end the function early.This is a 'limitation' of how Python frames are implemented; you have to have a  opcode to exit the frame cleanly and unwind the stack, and that opcode requires an operand, always.Calling the function still produces a generator, but the byte code isn't executed until you actually call the  method on the generator.
