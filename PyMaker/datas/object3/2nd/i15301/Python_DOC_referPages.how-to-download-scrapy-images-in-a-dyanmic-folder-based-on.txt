I'm trying to override default path  to , I've tried How to download scrapy images in a dyanmic folder using following code:but I get:I don't know what's wrong, also is there any other way to change the path? Thanks
I have created a pipeline inherited from  and overridden  method and used it instead of standard 
Problem raises because dst folder doesn't exists, and quick solution is:
To dynamically set the path for images downloaded by a scrapy spider prior to downloading images rather than moving them afterward, I created a custom pipeline overriding the  and  methods.This approach assumes you define a  in your spider and replace, e.g., "field1" with your particular field name. Setting Request.meta in  allows item field values to be used in setting download directories for each item, as shown in the return statement for . Scrapy will create the directories automatically if they don't exist.Custom pipeline class definitions are saved in my project's . Methods here are adapted directly from the default scrapy pipeline , which on my Mac is stored in . Includes and additional methods can be copied from that file as needed.
the solution that @neelix give is the best one , but i'm trying to use it and i found some strange results , some documents are moved but not all the documents. So i replaced :and i imported shutil library , then my code is :i hope that it will work also for u guys :)
