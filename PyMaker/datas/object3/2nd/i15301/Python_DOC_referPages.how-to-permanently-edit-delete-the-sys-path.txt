This question already has an answer here:How to temporarily modify sys.path in Python?                    2 answers                for some reason, my pythonpath got messy. I'd like to organize it. Is it correct that I don't need the first and the last one above? And how can I change it permanently? (Not like sys.path.remove or sys.path.append)I'm using Python3.2. in windows8.
Path 'C:\Python32\lib\site-packages' is added to sys.path by the built-in site module.If you want to, you can start python with the -S flag to tell the site module "Don't add site-packages". Next, 'C:\python32\Lib\site-packages\django'.Here's a wild guess: you installed django with pip/easy_install/msi-installer and there is a file C:\python32\Lib\site-packages\django.pth (or something like this ending with .pth)Quoting the docs:A path configuration file is a file whose name has the form name.pth  and exists in one of the four directories mentioned above; its  contents are additional items (one per line) to be added to sys.path.You can remove django.pth file (not recommended, see below) to remove '..../django' from sys.pathSo, short answer: don't mess with sys.path, what's in sys.path is probably for a good reason.If you don't need django, then uninstall django using whatever tool you used to install it. Same for every package you don't need.
