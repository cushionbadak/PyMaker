I'm writing a Python program and I need some way to count the number of times an X or a stretch of Xs occurs in a string. So for example if the input is  then the output should be 5, since there are 5 stretches of X in the string.In Perl I would have done this as follows.I'm familiar with the  command in Python, but I'm unaware of how to count the number of results, and I'm unsure whether this is the most efficient way to approach my problem in Python.My highest priority is readability/clarity; efficiency is secondary.
You can use  for this:This groups the elements in the iterable -- if no key-function is given, it just groups equal elements. Then, you just use  to count the elements where the key is .Or how about regular expressions:
This should work:
