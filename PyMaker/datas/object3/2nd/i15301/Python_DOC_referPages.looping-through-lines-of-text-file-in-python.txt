Natural Text
I have two text files, I want to read it line by line and check if a match occurs and if it occurs then print or else do nothing. But in the following code it checks only for the first line of the first file and checks for the all lines of second for loop file. But I want to check for all lines of the first file as well as second file. I am not sure what mistake I am doing.My data is likeI would like to have an output like
To loop "in parallel" over two iterators, use built-in , or, in Python 2,  (the latter will require an  at the start of the module, of course).E.g, change:into:This assumes the two files are indeed "parallel" -- i.e, in 1-1 correspondence line by line.  If that is not the case, then the simplest approach (unless the files are so huge that your memory can't take it) is to first read one into a , then loop over the other one checking in with the .  So, for example:then, separately:or vice versa, building the dict from the file that's expected to be smaller, then using it to check, line by line, the file that's expected to be larger.
Just put the reads in the same loop. A minimal working example for two files, named t1.in and t2.in respectively would be:This example reads the lines from two files simultaneously and if one of them has fewer lines than the other,  lines are read.
Here's an implementation of @Alex Martelli's  suggestion:Output (for the input from the question)
