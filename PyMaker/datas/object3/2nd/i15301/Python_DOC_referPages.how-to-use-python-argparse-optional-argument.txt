my python code looks like thisthe idea is when running with  option, I could have select to use myspecial config file. However, I issue my command , I am getting . What am I missing?
As Adam mentioned, you'll want to change your parser's "action", as stated in the docs.But it sounds like you want to indicate whether that special config is active, or not. In which case, using  or  would be correct. You just won't pass the myconfig argument.
"-c" will store  or , so why are you passing a value (myconfig) to it?  You would call it as:If you want -c to take an argument, then it shouldn't have the action store_true.
