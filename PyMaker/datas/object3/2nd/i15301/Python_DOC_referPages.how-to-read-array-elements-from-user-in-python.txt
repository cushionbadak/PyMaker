Since there's no input delimiters in Python, you should use  and split the input that you've received from the user:
Your first approach is OK, for the second way use this:This will  the function  on the split parts (what  gives) of the user input (which are , ,  and  in your example.It also uses slicing (the  after ) to slice in case the user put more integers in.
The  function returns a string that the user enters. The  function expects to convert a number as a string to the corresponding number value. So  will return 3. But when you type in a string like  the function  does not know how to convert that.You can either follow your first example:The above requires you to only enter a number at a time.Another way of doing it is just to split the string.The  method returns a list of numbers as strings excluding the spaces
