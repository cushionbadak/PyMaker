Once I made my virtualenv, Python was already installed. How do I add the option ? Do I delete it or start virtualenv over from fresh? If I do that, how do I add the Python option? I don't want to mess anything up.
When you create a virtual environment, the Python binaries will be copied, not compiled. Quoting from the  documentation,It also creates a bin (or Scripts on Windows) subdirectory containing a copy of the python binary (or binaries, in the case of Windows)But  is an option for the  script, which is used during compilation of the Python from source code.So, you first have to compile Python from the source code, with  option, and then create virtual environment with the compiled python binary.If you are using unix based OS, then by default, the installation will happen in  directory, so that you will not mess up with the current Python installation.Moreover, instead of , use . This will install the Python with the  version format.
