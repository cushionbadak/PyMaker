You want to  the sequence .You can easily build this sequence using Sample run:
You want , see here:https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html#itertools.cycle
 is a good start. Else you can program it yourself:

Essentially, you just want to loop and constantly check the condition. And each time yeild the next item from the cycle. Now, admittedly there are better ways to check a condition than a function call, but this is just an example.
