This question already has an answer here:Best way to check if an item is present in a list of lists? [duplicate]                    5 answers                I have a nested list of Python strings, like this one:I would like to quickly test if a given string is equal to any of the strings in any of the sublists. I could write a function to flatten the list, but the test needs to happen in a time-critical portion of my program. Is there a faster or more elegant way to do this?
You can't avoid having to loop and scan through elements here; but you can at least avoid having to scan all lists, and delegate the task of scanning each sublist to Python C code.Use the  function to test each sublist in a generator expression: will stop iterating over the generator expression the moment if finds a  value (e.g. when  found a match).
