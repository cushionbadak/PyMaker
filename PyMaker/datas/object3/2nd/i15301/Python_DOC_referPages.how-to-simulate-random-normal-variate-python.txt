First of all, I am extremely new with coding. I got the assignment to "Simulate many normally distributed random numbers, then calculate mean and standard deviation." using Python. To begin with, I'm having some difficulties interpreting the question...Anyway, I think I've figured out how to generate a wished number of random numbers from a standard normal distribution using a for loop (though I'm not sure this is what's asked for). What I'm struggling with is to use these numbers for calculations - since they are random I don't know how to use lists. Thank You!
You can generate the random numbers using . For example I'll create a list of 10 random numbers, with a mean of  and standard deviation of Then you can use the  library to calculate mean and standard deviation.You can see that if I generated a lot of random numbers, assuming the  library has a good implementation of sampling numbers from a desired distribution, you will get back approximately the mean and standard deviation you used to describe the original distribution.
