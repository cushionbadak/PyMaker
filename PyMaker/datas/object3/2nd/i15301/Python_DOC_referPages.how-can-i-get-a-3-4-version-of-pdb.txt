I tend to use a Debian wheezy system, that ships with Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.2.However I'm developing now using a local installation Python 3.4 because has a very interesting advantage over Python 3.2.The problem is that I don't know how to install such a thing as a . When I run  over my Python 3.4 program, it runs as a Python 3.2 program, failing.I'm on the need of general Python advice on versions and multi-host (Ubuntu precise and trusty, and Debian wheezy) multi-version development, and I particularly need downloading and building a 3.4 version of , but I don't get to find any documentation on that.
Every version of Python comes with its own  module. It is part of the standard library.The version in the 3.4 standard library has no special advantages over the version that comes with 3.2 or 2.7. The last time  functionality was changed was in the 3.2 and 2.7 releases (the only thing missing in the 2.6 version is the  keyword argument to , and 3.3 added more tab completion support).If you have a  command line, then that's just an alias for ; you can use that with any of your versions:Debian and Ubuntu simply copy the  module to  with the Python version appended, so  is copied to .
