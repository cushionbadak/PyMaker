I have 10 transactions with properties shares and size. I want the sum of each of these. Is there a way to do it in one loop instead of 2?How I achieve this now:
Nope.  function can find the sum of only one iterable at a time. So, you either need to change your code like thisOr be happy with the code which you have already shown in the question. That is perfect and nothing wrong in it.If you really like to complicate your code, you can change it into thisThis get first generate tuples with  and  and then  will transform the tuples into two tuples of  and  and finally  will be applied to each of the tuples which will be unpacked over  and .Note: The ,  and  variation actually runs more loops internally than the explicit two loops like you have shown in your question.
If you want to go full functional, toss in a  with your : Though, if you only have 10 transactions, it's not like it really matters how many passes you do.
You could use  and write your own addition operator:No bets on whether this is an improvement though.  It might even be a pessimization.
