In Python I want to make sets consisting of sets, so I get a set of sets (nested sets).Example:However when I try the following:I get an error:Can anyone tell me where my mistake is and how I achieve my goal please?
Your issue is that sets can only contain hashable objects, and a  is not hashable.You should use the  type, which is hashable, for the elements of the outer set.
You cannot have a set of sets because sets are unhashable objects; they can be mutated by adding or removing items from them.You will need to use a set of frozensets instead:Demo:Frozensets are like normal sets in every respect except that they cannot be mutated.  This feature makes them hashable and allows you to use them as items of a set or keys of a dictionary.
