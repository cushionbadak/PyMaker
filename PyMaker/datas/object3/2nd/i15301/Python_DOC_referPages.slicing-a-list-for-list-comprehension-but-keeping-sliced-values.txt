I would like to replace , ,  with a boolean value based on whether or not the value is None. This works but eliminates , ,  from the output. I could insert/append the values back in, but I'm thinking there must be a way to do it in a single line.Expected Output:
using nested list comprehensions:
You are close, you can use  when iterating over your inner lists and test whether the indices are in a set that should be modified. This allows you to easily modify which indices should be tested by simply modifying the  set, and doesn't require some form of slicing which is difficult to modify easily.Personally though, I wouldn't use a list comprehension in this case as it's ugly. The code below does exactly the same and is much more readable:
You need to add the rest of list (that you don't want to replace its elements ) to your edited sub_list :
