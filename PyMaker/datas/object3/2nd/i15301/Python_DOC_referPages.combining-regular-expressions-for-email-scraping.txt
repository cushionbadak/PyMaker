I have two expressions: 1. 2. The first one identifies : csk at cs dot xyz dot edu   csk(at)cs dot xyz dot eduThe second one identifies : csk at cs.xyz.edu   csk(at)cs.xyz.eduHow do I combine the above two? I also want to include @ in it, what I did was :but it is not working. Can some one please help? I have lot of formats to cover but dont want to write each regular expression explicitly.
