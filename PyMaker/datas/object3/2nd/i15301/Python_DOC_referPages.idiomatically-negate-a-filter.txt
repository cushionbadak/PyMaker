What's the most idiomatic way of writing a  with a negation?Example:Of course, you can just use list comprehensions - but then you needn't use  anywayIn case anyone wonders, I've stumbled upon this while trying to split a list based on a condition
The  module includes both ifilter() and ifilterfalse(), which filter elements where the function returns  and  respectively.Note that, in Python 2, there is a difference between  and :  here would be an iterator, while filter() would give a list (see itertools.ifilter Vs. filter Vs. list comprehensions). If you actually want to build a list, your example with  seems fine, assuming you are set on using  - list comprehensions may be more 'idiomatic' (List filtering: list comprehension vs. lambda + filter).In Python 3, filter() constructs an iterator, not a list, and itertools.filterfalse() is the complement.
Splitting based on a predicate is called a . I would find it more idiomatic to implement  as a separate function rather than repeat its internals specifically for odd and even numbers.  Python 3's Itertools Recipes has the following implementation:It uses  (as described by @Lack) and  defined in that module.  So your highest-level code would look like:
