If I understand correctly, when I run a Python program, the Python interpreter generates bytecode (the  file that appears alongside the  source) unless the source contains a syntax error.Does the bytecode compiler generate any other exceptions or are all the other exceptions raised at runtime when the  code is being executed?
Well, any exception type can technically be raised during runtime via . But I assume that you understand this and are asking what exceptions might be raised while Python interprets your code (before execution).  There are actually quite a few:: This is raised by the parser as it reads the code.  It results from invalid syntax such as unbalanced parenthesis, using a keyword in the wrong place, etc.: This is a subclass of  and is raised whenever your code has improper indentation.  An example would be:: This is a subclass of  and is raised when you inconsistently mix tabs and spaces in a source file.: This is raised by the interpreter when an internal operation fails.  Encountering one usually means that your Python installation is messed up and might need a reinstall.  : This is similar to  and can be raised when an internal operation fails for lack of memory.All of these exceptions can be raised before your code even begins to execute.  The first three are caused by a corrupt source file and can be resolved by simply fixing the syntax or indentation.  The latter two however are raised by the interpreter itself for internal operations which fail.  This means that they are rare, but also that they are more serious and not so easy to fix.
There is no compilation step typically when you're working with Python code so I would argue that all errors in Python, SyntaxErrors included, are runtime errors.For example, lets write this file:That's obviously just nonsense (we'll even name it nonsense.py), but lets fire up the interpreter:So there you have it - a SyntaxError was raised and caught at runtime, which, in my mind at least, indicates that it's a runtime error.
