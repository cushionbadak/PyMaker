How can I collect the combinations of a string, in which certain characters (but not all) are variable?In other words, I have an input string and a character map. The character map specifies which characters are variable, and what they could be replaced with. The function then yields all possible combinations. To put this in context, I'm trying to collect possible variations for an OCR output string that could have been misinterpreted by the OCR engine.Example input:Example character map:Intended output:
You can use :Note that I made  a list rather than simply a string for consistency.
My own solution was very ugly and non-Pythonic, but here goes:Outputs:I figured there should be way more elegant solutions than a recursive function with multiple loops.
