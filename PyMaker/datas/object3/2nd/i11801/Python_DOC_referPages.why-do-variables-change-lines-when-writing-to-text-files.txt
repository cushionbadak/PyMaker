Natural Text
I have a text file which I read information off of as variables, as a saving system in my game. The problem is I need my document to read and write to a certain line, it works fine the first write and read, but the second time the line before it has moved up one and I get "Index out of range" Because line I'm trying to write/read is blank. I've looked through my code and can't seem to find the problem..I have a little over a thousand lines, but I think this is where the problem would lie should there be one.
I believe the error occurs either because you're using  somewhere which strips the newline characters at the end of lines; or it could be that you're abusing ; even though Python 2 documentation says something about general linewise random access, in Python 3 the documentation clearly states that:The linecache module allows one to get any line from a Python source file, while attempting to optimize internally, using a cache, the common case where many lines are read from a single file. This is used by the traceback module to retrieve source lines for inclusion in the formatted traceback.In any case using  is a very poor match for your use case, because  assumes that the files do not change, but your savefiles do change; and you're refreshing them after save. I'd recommend that you'd save and load your game state data to and from a single dictionary using the  and Something like:Running the program printsand the contents of  are
