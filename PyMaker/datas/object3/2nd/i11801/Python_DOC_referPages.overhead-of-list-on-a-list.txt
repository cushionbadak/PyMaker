In certain styles of python, everything is a generator, e.g. uses  rather than constructing and ing a list. If you need to use it as a list, you can just call .If I have a list already, what is the cost of calling ?Use: I have a variable that I know has an iterator and might be a list, but I need to use it as a list. Is it better/more pythonic to do  or some other way of checking its list-ness?If it matters I'm using Python 3.5.
If you call  you are certainly creating a new list, even if  is already a list. If you want to avoid it, you can use  to check if  is a list or not.
