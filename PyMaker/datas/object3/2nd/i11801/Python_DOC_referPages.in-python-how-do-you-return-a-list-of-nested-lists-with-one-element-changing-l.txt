Natural Text
For example, say I have a list of lists such as this:Can I add another item, say 'x' into the empty slots one at a time and create a list of all outcomes?To clarify, since there are 5 empty spaces, I would want 5 new copies of ls, each with only one added 'x', just in a different spot each time.
You can use a generator function to find each position where there is an empty string then deepcopy as you iterate over the positions yielding a new copy with the next pos set to x:Output:If you want just one each time not keeping the previous updated x's then we just need the first logic:Which gives you:If you want a list of lists you can just call list:Which will give you:But unless you really need a list at once, you can just iterate over the generator function as in the firs example.
