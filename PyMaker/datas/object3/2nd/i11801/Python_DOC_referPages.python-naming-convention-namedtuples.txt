Natural Text
I am new to Python and I have been reading both the online documentation and (trying) to follow PEP 0008 to have a good Python code style.I am curious about the code segment I found in the official Python docs while studying about the re library:I cannot understand why the  variable is named with a first letter capitalised; I have read through the PEP 0008 and there is no reference for it for what I have seen. Should it not be  instead or  if it was a constant (which for all I know it is not)?
In the code-segment you provided,  is a named tuple, definitely not a constant. It does not follow other variable names naming style only to put emphasis on the fact that it is a class factory function. No warning will occur from an PEP 0008 style checker (like PyCharm for example) if you write it as  but I think it is not good practice since this way it does not distinguish it as a class factory name.So, namedtuples fall under the Class names in PEP 0008. Too bad is not stated more explicitly.Besides the example you mentioned for writing a tokenizer, this can also be seen in the collections.namedtuple docs examples:
The key here is . As the documentation says, Returns a new  subclass named . The new subclass is used to create -like objects that have fields accessible by attribute lookup as well as being indexable and iterable. Instances of the subclass also have a helpful docstring (with typename and field_names) and a helpful  method which lists the tuple contents in a  format.There is no PEP 8 violation;  is an user-defined class and its name is capitalized as it should.
