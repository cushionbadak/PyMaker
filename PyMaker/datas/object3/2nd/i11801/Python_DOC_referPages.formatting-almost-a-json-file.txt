Natural Text
I'm a beginner in Python and I'm reading from a file with the content:{"quotes":["I could calculate your chance of survival, but you won't like it.","I'd give you advice, but you wouldn't listen. No one ever does.","I ache, therefore I am.","I've seen it. It's rubbish. (About a Magrathean sunset that Arthur finds magnificent)","Not that anyone cares what I say, but the Restaurant is on the other end of the universe.","I think you ought to know I'm feeling very depressed.","My capacity for happiness,\" he added, \"you could fit into a matchbox without taking out the matches first.","Arthur: \"Marvin, any ideas?\" Marvin: \"I have a million ideas. They all point to certain death.\"","\"What's up?\" [asked Ford.] \"I don't know,\" said Marvin, \"I've never been there.\"","Marvin: \"I am at a rough estimate thirty billion times more intelligent than you. Let me give you an example. Think of a number, any number.\" Zem: \"Er, five.\" Marvin: \"Wrong. You see?\"","Zaphod: \"Can it Trillian, I'm trying to die with dignity. Marvin: \"I'm just trying to die.\""]}*As you can see it's almost a json-file but with additional characters like: [\ .Task: Formate content of the file so I can access separate quotes and print out random quotes. I could try something like thiswhich will get rid of {quotes:} from the string. Though additional unwanted characters remain and I have tried using  separately and in a loop but it doesn't give me the result I want.Example: After the formatting is done I guess I should use a loop and try the random module with ?
You have valid JSON data already.  is an escaped quote (so it is part of the string value), and  is a JSON array (analogous to a Python list).Just load your data as JSON:In the above demo I used the  function to pick one of the quotes from the list at random.The only thing missing is Marvin's lullaby, my favourite of all Marvin's utterings:Now the world has gone to bed  Darkness won't engulf my head  I can see by infra-red  How I hate the nightNow I lay me down to sleep  Try to count electric sheep  Sweet dream wishes you can keep  How I hate the night
This should work as is.
