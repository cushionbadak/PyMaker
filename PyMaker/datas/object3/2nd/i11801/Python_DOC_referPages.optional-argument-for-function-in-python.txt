This question already has an answer here:Is there a way to pass optional parameters to a function?                    5 answers                If i try to give a function an optional argument, this way it won't work:Can someone help me to understand this and how to do it better?Do i really need the if statement? Maybe there is an easier and faster way with some kind of special argument?
Use a default argument value to set  to  when omitted:Now the caller can simply omit specifying a value for the  argument:would leave  set to .
