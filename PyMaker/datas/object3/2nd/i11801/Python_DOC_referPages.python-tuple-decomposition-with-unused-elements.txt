What is the meaning of  after  in this code?
 has 3 main conventional uses in Python:To hold the result of the last executed expression(/statement) in an interactiveinterpreter session. This precedent was set by the standard CPythoninterpreter, and other interpreters have followed suitFor translation lookup in i18n (see thegettextdocumentation for example), as in code like:As a general purpose "throwaway" variable name to indicate that partof a function result is being deliberately ignored, as in code like:The latter two purposes can conflict, so it is necessary to avoid using  as a throwaway variable in any code block that also uses it for i18n translation (many folks prefer a double-underscore, , as their throwaway variable for exactly this reason).
It's just a variable name, and it's conventional in python to use  for throwaway variables.  It just indicates that the loop variable isn't actually used.
Underscore  is considered as "I don't Care" or "Throwaway" variable in PythonThe python interpreter stores the last expression value to the special variable called .The underscore  is also used for ignoring the specific values. If you don’t need the specific values or the values are not used, just assign the values to underscore.Ignore a value when unpackingIgnore the index
There are 5 cases for using the underscore in Python.For storing the value of last expression in interpreter.For ignoring the specific values. (so-called “I don’t care”)To give special meanings and functions to name of vartiables or functions.To use as ‘Internationalization(i18n)’ or ‘Localization(l10n)’ functions.To separate the digits of number literal value.Here is a nice article with examples by mingrammer.
