I would like to see if there is a Python equivalent to the mathematical concept of "for all" (cf https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mathematical_symbols), for example to check if some condition is True for all instances being evaluated.For example Assuming:I would like to check if each letter in 'piza' is in 'pizza', and conversely if each letter in 'pizza' is in 'piza'.Is there a way of achieving this with something such as a ?e.g. 
In the example problem you provided I'd just use  to check if a string contains each letter from another string:In a general case I'd use  as others suggested.
Using a generatorWe can use a generator coupled with Python's  to achieve this easily.Or ExpandedExpanding the one-liner makes it a little bit easier to see what is going on. The function continues until it has gone through all of the letters in  and checked to see if they are in . If the function finishes the , it means that all of the letters in  are in , so it returns . If one letter of  is not in , it returns .Output
Non matching elements will be added to the generator making it non empty, so the condition fails
