I need to output these deposits in order based on the club number. take a look at the first item in deposits (0434512). The first two digits represent the club number(in this case it is club number 04). The remaining digits represent the deposit made to the account(34512). This needs to be rounded so it should be outputted as 4 $345.12I thought i had this completed but turns out that i need to add the deposits made to the same club. so i would need to add 1452.34 and 6545.34 together and same with club 4.Thanks in advance!
You can use a dictionary:Output:Python 2: is used to keep the clubs in number order.Here are some links you might be interested in: Dictionaries, OrderedDict creates an ordered dictionary called .This  loop then creates a key using the first 2 characters in each entry in . I.e. The club number. It gives every club a value of  to start with.This second  loop goes through  and adds everything after the 2nd character to the corresponding key's value in . This only works because a dictionary can't have 2 keys with the same name.I hope this helps you understand. It is relatively simple once you understand how dictionaries work.
Never use a list to do a dictionary's job:Now you can just iterate through the dictionary and print your results:
I think you should convert your club numbers to int, but solution based on your code can be like this
