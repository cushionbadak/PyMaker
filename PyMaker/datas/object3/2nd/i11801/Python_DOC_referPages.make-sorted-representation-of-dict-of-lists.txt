Not sure to understand your question but here is one way you can create a list of sorted keys:PS: please do not use  as a variable name since it is a built-in type in Python
 by nature are data structure which does not keep order of their items (key:value) pair, so, if you want to write a sorted value from your dictionary, here is one way:Then you can loop through it to write to your file:On the other hand, if the order of items matters to you within your dictionary, then I suggest to you to use  from  module:This will create a dictionary as yours but at the same time it will maintain the order at which its items where inserted in the first place (during the  loop in this case)
You need to convert your dict into a list using , as dict cannot be sorted.This returns a list of tuples On that list, you can access  to retrieve the You can apply that to a sort:
