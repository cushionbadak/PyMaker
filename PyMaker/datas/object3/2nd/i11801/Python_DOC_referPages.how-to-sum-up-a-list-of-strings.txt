Given a list of strings as such, sum up the integers to return the sum as a string and append the sum to the list so that the returned list I understand the process of going through the list and iterating this, I just don't understand how to get rid of the  character so that I can only use the integer to find the sum? 
To answer your question a bit more directly (leaving out the iteration since you said that's not the problem):Believe it or not,  actually ignores the trailing newline when you use it to parse:Once you have an , you can do arithmetic as normal.This is a documented feature in Python 2 and 3:Optionally, the literal can be preceded by + or - (with no space in between) and surrounded by whitespace.-Python  documentation (emphasis mine)If you're interested in more streamlined ways of doing the iteration, you can see Joran's answer and the comments on it, but if this is some kind of assignment, I wouldn't use them if I were you. It benefits you more to work through the problems yourself. You of course want to use the more advanced features for professional work.
