having trouble with my function to slice a string (DNA code) in 8 places and return them. I'm new to the rstrip() and split() functions and I think I may need to use them here, but I don't quite understand how.Here is my code:the query file looks like this:Any help would be seriously appreciated! I'm pretty sure my problem is how to deal with the query file so that the function can recognise it and slice it?
I'd suppose you're not that keen on slicing the header in that file, so you have to skip it first, one way or the other:The function then has to read the file line by line to a string, stripping newlines as it goes:I'd also suggest changing how you pass the slice indices to the function a bit:This way your function accepts 0 or more slices as positional arguments, slices being tuples of indices here. Putting it all together you get:
In the function , remove the line . That's raising an error. You haven't created a variable named  in the function and no parameter is named so. That is raising an error. You can't set a variable in a function as another variable. You'll have to globalise the other variable first.
I'm unclear from the question whether the result should be 4 slices or 8. Below is an attempt to generalize you code. This code returns 4 slices within a list of lists. The 1st slice is from a->b, 2nd from c->d, 3rd from e->f, and the 4th from g->h.  The slice from a->b is:The slice from c-d is:as so on.
