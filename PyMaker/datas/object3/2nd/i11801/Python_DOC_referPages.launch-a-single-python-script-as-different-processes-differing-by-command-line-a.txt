I have python script that takes command line arguments. The way I get the command line arguments is by reading a mongo database. I need to iterate over the mongo query and launch a different process for the single script with different command line arguments from the mongo query.Key is, I need the launched processes to be:separate processes share nothingwhen killing the process, I need to be able to kill them all easily.I think the command  would work and satisfies the second constraint.Edit 1From the answer below, the  program looks like thisThe problem is that  has a call that blocksWhen I run the launcher, it just executes one of the  (there are at least 39). How do I modify the launcher program to say "run the launched script in background" so that the script returns to the launcher to launch more scripts?Edit 2The problem is solved by replacing  with  One thing I noticed though, if I say , the PID seem to be all different. I don't think I care since I can kill them all pretty easily with .[Correction] kill them with 
There are several options for launching scripts from a script. The easiest are probably to use the  or  modules.I have done this several times to launch things to separate nodes on a cluster. Using  it might look something like this:using killall you should have no problem terminating processes spawned this way.Another option is to use  which has got a wide range of features and is much more flexible than . An example might look like:In both of these methods, the processes are independent and share nothing other than a parent PID.
