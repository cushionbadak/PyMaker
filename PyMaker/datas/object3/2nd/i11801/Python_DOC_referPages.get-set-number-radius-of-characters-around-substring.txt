Natural Text
In Python, how would I get a certain number of characters around a substring?For example, here's my string:Let's say I wanted to add four characters away from , on both sides, into the output, so it would be .If the substring to look for was  in , then the output would be , and it would ignore that there's nothing to add on the right side.
 comes in really handy here:You could also just return  in the  statement instead of raising a .  That would return the string unchanged.  Usage:
you could also get the string before and after the substring with  then return parts of both:it is worth noting that in this case if  is not actually a substring then the first line will raise a but you can get the exact indexes for splitting it up like this:In this case  will raise a  if sub is not in string.
