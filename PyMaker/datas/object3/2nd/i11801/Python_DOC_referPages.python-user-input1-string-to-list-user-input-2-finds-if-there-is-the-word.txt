Natural Text
EDIT The code is to show the position of the second input variable in the original sentence/list and it always returns 13 if you input to on the second inputWell my code needs to have a user input that is then converted into a list. I'm done with that part. I need help with the taking a second user input and then finding if that second user input is in the sentence that is provided from the first. My code I'm working on is below: 
You can use :You don't need to use  on  because  converts to  anyway.More on: list comprehensions, ,  , Edit:This is a simple example of :Output:As you can see, you can use  to find the index of each element. The  and  in the code above corresponds to the index and value of each element in the list.
Use the output of the split function. To get a list of all occurrences of the lookupword you can use list comprehension. More on that can be found here: https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions
The  method returns a list.  You need to assign the return value to a variable to use it.  The method does not modify the string object.However, I recommend using a different variable name for the str object and the list object.  I find it makes it easier to keep track of what the names mean and what operations are valid on them.
How does this work for you:UPDATEIf you want it case insensitive then change two lines to:and
There are some redundant steps in your code. See if the following works,No need to  into a list. But the code will still work if you do it.
