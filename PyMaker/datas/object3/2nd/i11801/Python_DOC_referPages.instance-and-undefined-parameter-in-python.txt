I'm not very familiar with Python, so when I met this code, there are a few things not quite clear to me. Here is the code:Why does  not have  as a parameter but in the above code there is ?Also, what does  mean, because I don't recall that there is an attribute called instance.Can someone please help me understand what this code does, and if a java version can be provided will be much appreciated since I'm more familiar with Java. Thanks
The code has no context to say what  might be. As for , the  definition makes clear that it is lazily assigning sequential names to instances. It sets  to  so it knows it hasn't been initialized; when  is accessed, it will recognize the placeholder, replace it with a new value, and return the new value.Note that providing some assignment to all instance attributes in  is considered good form in Python, since otherwise it can be very hard to figure out what attributes an instance might have. And in modern Python (3.3 and up), doing so gets you a memory savings; as long as all attributes are initialized in  and no new attributes are added after , the  for all instances is a key-sharing dictionary which reduces the cost of each instance significantly (by roughly two-thirds, though that's an implementation detail). So if some other method/property would set  later, it's best to initialize it to something in  both for maintainers to know what it's supposed to have, and reduced memory consumption in Py3.3+.
There are just object attributes with default value. You don't need to put them into  parameters if they are not required for building class instance.
