Natural Text
Okay I am writing a python application using curses and I am trying to center my text in a terminal window from the documentation you can get the x and y using this I got this from hereI guess they return the x and y as a integer Here is how I am doing this but when I run the program i get thisI am dividing by 2 to get the center but it keeps throwing the error
You not only have to calculate the center of the  but also move the starting point half the length of the text to the left.  So the center of the text and the center of the screen fall onto the same coordinate.
