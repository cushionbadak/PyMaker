You're going to want regular expressions.If you have a particularly big file, you can wrap it in a generator:
Rather than storing heterogeneous data in a homogeneous data type, I'd recommend using dictionaries or creating a class.With dictionaries:With a class:Note that in each case I am storing each person's info as an entry in a dictionary, with a key of what looks like their ID number.
Simpler than regex:You can transform numbers into s afterwards.However, I believe that you are looking for the wrong way to do it. The right way is to split by commas, then give special fields a dedicated treatment.
For each line:This will correctly handle input that has any slashes in the non-date parts, and easily handles the conversion to integers at the same time.
