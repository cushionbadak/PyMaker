Given a list of length n, I need to find the index of the biggest number in the list in a time complexity of O(log(n)) without using python's inbuilt max method. Below is my attempt, however I get the erroron the linewhen I run my code. Feedback on my code and alternative solutions would be appreciated.
You can simplify your function  a bit:Alternatively, you can go for the index directly:
Just use Python's  instead to find the greatest number in the list, then use  like you were to get the index.CodeOutIf your not allowed to use max:Initialize  to  to cases where max < 0. This works by going through each element in the , testing if it greater than the current greatest number, and if it is it sets the greatest number to the current number.
