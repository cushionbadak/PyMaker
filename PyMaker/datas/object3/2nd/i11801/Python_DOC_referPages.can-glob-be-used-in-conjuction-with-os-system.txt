I need to run a command prompt command on a few files in a folder (.apk's). I used glob successfully to print out multiple text files in a directory but when I use it with os.system nothing happens. I used the command line command I want to use via os.system on a single file (.apk) successfully as well. Any help? 
Try doing this. In your code the word "filename" in the os.system() argument does not get replaced with a filename found by glob. It should work by using string formatting syntax.
Why not just use the glob library? and then use the output with os.system:
