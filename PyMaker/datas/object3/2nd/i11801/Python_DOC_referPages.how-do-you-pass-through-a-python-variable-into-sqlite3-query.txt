This question already has an answer here:Is there a way to get a list of column names in sqlite?                    10 answers                The code is supposed to execute the query base on the input from the user in the python environment (not within the sql query). For example, the variable is defined in the Python environment, and in raw input for , I would expect the query to print the column names of the table customers. However, the below code report syntax error. If I remove the backward slash and the inner quotation mark, it will report . It appears that the value  is not being pass through into the query, and the query is reading  as a string. Please help. Thanks
You can do this using parameter substitution.  When using Python's sqlite3 module, replace your parameter values with question marks () and provide a tuple of values.  Python will handle the substitution automatically and also escape the values to limit the risk of SQL injection.Here's an example: first, create a table:Now insert some values: note how the  character is used as a placeholder for the values:And here's a query (note that we keep pass the values as a tuple, even though there is only one value):
