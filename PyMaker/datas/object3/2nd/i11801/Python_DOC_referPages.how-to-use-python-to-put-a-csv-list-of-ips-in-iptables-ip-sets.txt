Natural Text
I would like to use this CSV file to block all IPs from the list. The entries in the CSV file are IP ranges. How do I seperate the IP ranges from text, and add those IP ranges to the  with the rule to drop all connections with those IPs.Btw, I think this is better to use for large ip ranges, http://ipset.netfilter.org/index.html 
You will need python netaddr module for that
maybe take a look at https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html to manipulate your ip addresses. ipaddress.summarize_address_range(first, last) could be nice to generate the iptables rule.
