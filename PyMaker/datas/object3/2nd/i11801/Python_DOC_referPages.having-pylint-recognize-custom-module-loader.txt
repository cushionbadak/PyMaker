I have a custom module loader that basically does some redirection. I would like pylint to recognize this custom loader. This is my situation:I have a lot of clients importing . I wrote a custom loader in  to redirect these to import  under the hood. How do I get pylint to recognize this? When it lints , it complains that it can't find . This is only a problem with pylint. I can get client code to recognize the custom loader without any issue.
from the documentation on modules:Packages support one more special attribute, . This is initialized to be a list containing the name of the directory holding the packageâ€™s  before the code in that file is executed. This variable can be modified; doing so affects future searches for modules and subpackages contained in the package.So if I understand correctly you want to redirect any references to  to redirect to , so all you would need to do is replace the  folder with  that contains this:Then when anything tries to import  it will end up importing .
You have to remember that pylint is a static analyser and as such doesn't actually load python file (except in some cases where it can't do otherwise, e.g. compiled code). As such it's not aware of custom importer or other tricks taking part of python's high dynamicity.That being said:you may still write a "brain" plugin for astroid (the library under pylint) that will help pylint understand your code's specificityby relying on standard mecanism such as  manipulation you'll get more chance to avoid such need, either because at some point pylint may understand this or because someone else will have contributed a plugin for that purpose.
