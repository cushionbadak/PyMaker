I want to test a http post method, this method will call some service, but the service cannot work in local test machine, so I want to mock it.test.py:test case:but test case is always failed, it tried to call  method, but it cannot work on my machine. I just want to mock it, but doesn't work. Anyone can help me! Thanks in advance!According to @syntonym answer, my test case should be wrote like this:
 actually takes the lookup name - not the place where the object you want to patch acutally resides. The documentation reads: patch() works by (temporarily) changing the object that a name points to with another one. [...]  The basic principle is that you patch where an object is looked up,  which is not necessarily the same place as where it is defined.
