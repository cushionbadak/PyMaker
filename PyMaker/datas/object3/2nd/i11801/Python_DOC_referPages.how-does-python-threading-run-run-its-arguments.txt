I have a python threading problem. I have been looking around for more than a day and it doesn't get any better, so I thought of asking for help. I use .The first question is what would be the difference between:and I'm using  at some part in the code. If I used the above method, it doesn't give me errors -but it still doesn't work like it should, not all the threads does run. While if I used the below method it tells me it :Note that I do have this declaration .The second question is about the rest of the code, only two threads do the work, the rest of the thread -whatever was their number doesn't work.Full code:not url is initialized like this  and this is how i run my threads,
