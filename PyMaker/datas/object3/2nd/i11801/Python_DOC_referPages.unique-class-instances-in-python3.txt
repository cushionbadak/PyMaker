suppose I have a class definition like thisHow can I use  or another tool of Python3 to find unique elements in a list of instances of this class? The comparison should be done with respect to the value of the  field.
 is not the best tool for custom classes. Make your instances hashable (implementing  and ), then use a set to reduce a list of instances to unique values:Sets efficiently can detect duplicates via the hash, confirming that the objects with the same hash are also equal first.To get the unique instances, simply call  on a sequence of instances:Demo:Do take into account that the hash of any  instance stored in a set or used a dictionary key must not change; not altering the  attribute during the lifetime of an instance is the easiest way to ensure this.
