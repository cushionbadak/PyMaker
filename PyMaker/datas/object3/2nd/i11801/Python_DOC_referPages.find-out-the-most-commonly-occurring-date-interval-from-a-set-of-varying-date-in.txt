I have a CSV file with a column that has varying date ranges for a million records. For instance, I have something like this:2004-2016; 1980-2016; 1991-2006; 2000-2012; 1998 - 2011If I want to find out the 3, 5 or the 7 year range that is most common in all these records, how will I do this in Python? It doesn't matter if a few records are eliminated but I am trying to find out which 7 year frequency or a 10 year frequency is most common for all the ranges. Can someone help?
You can use a  of  to handle this. The  is used to group the date ranges by the number of years, and the  keeps track of the counts of range strings for that number of years:If you want to know the most common range string with year range 12:Not sure how you want to handle cases where there are multiple range strings representing the same year range with equivalent counts.
Parse file; get 2-element tuples: .Transform it to differences: .Create  object with this sequnce and call  method.
Split your sequence into individual ranges. Assuming you call the resulting sequence diff.
