I install some packages with pip command and when use  command shows some packages that is installI want to know where is location of this modules in Windows ?I installed them with: I search in python`s installation directory but not found anything  
From this in python documentation:Python usually stores its library (and thereby your site-packages folder) in the installation directory. So, if you had installed Python to C:\Python\, the default library would reside in C:\Python\Lib\ and third-party modules should be stored in C:\Python\Lib\site-packages.If you want to install your packages in a different directory, use:Use can use also  to force all dependencies to be reinstalled.see other options
Having installed modules using pip on windows, they should be in the installation directory, in  directory.So suppose you have installed Python at C://python27_x64then those modules should be at C://python27_x64/Lib/site-packages/
