I'm trying to figure out how to use Python with MySQL. I'm having trouble addressing entries in the query results.So if I do something like this:  I get the third entry of the third row which seems plausible.If I do this:I get the first to entries of the first row. Which also seems plausible.However if I do something like this:I get the error:Which I do not understand.Also I am unable to get (for example) all the first entries of all the rows. To achieve this it seems I need to do a loop through the entries I want.Could someone clarify what I'm doing wrong or how this works?Greetings! 
First of all, without a specified ordering you do not get "third row" with You get a random row. It may seem stable enough, but do not trust it.The reason you get  is that withyou take a slice of elements from 0 to 1 from the result set and then you try to take the 3rd element with , which does not exist, since your slice had 2 elements.E.g.To actually take the 3rd attribute from the result tuples you can use for example a  or a list comprehension:
A tuple of list elements when queried with range of indexes returns another set of tuple with list of elements.Here you can observe that resulting tuple size is 2 elements. And indexes can be 0 and 1 only. Hence following statement fails.  Correct statement can be this.  If I understand correct, your intention is to find 2nd column value from first 2 rows from the dataset fetched. Possible statement can be:  Hence, the statementcan be re-written as:
