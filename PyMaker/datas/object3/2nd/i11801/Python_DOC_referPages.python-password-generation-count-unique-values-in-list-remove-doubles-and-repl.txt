Im searching for a fast and pythonic way to generate new (forgotten) user passwords with high entropy. To achieve this i use a list with 64 chars which in this code will only be named "chars = []"The problem is that sometimes chars are more than once (sometimes even triple) in a password. As far as i found out i can remove repeating items from a list with "set". But how can i append new items with this code that dont repeat again? Maybe this could be done all at once when generating it?I need to say that im quite new to programming. Maybe my code is bad but i was reading much about random and urandom and i am sure i want to use os.urandom. Any suggestions, snippets and hints to make the code better would be very much appreciated.Thank you for taking your time!
Loop while you reach the desired length
Remove each char from the list of available chars after taking it.Output (example):
