Is it possible to add a Custom Message globally on runtime-erros? I would like to have a time-stamp as this would help figuring out if a file eventually was written by that execution process.
Replacing  with an appropriate function will allow you to do whatever you like upon every occurrence of an uncaught exception.
Take a look at the Python docs (2, 3) on handling exceptions. You can catch the RuntimeError and print the original message along with a custom timestamp. For more information on accessing the stack trace and exception messages, check out this question.Ignacio's solution is also great if you'd like to set the message globally.
