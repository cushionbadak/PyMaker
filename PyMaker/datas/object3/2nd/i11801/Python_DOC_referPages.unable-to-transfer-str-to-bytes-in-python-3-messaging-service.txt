I can't figure out how to transfer  to  in Python 3.This is the client code:This is the error I get:
This is because  is an  (string) object. You could just do :but you might find it simpler if you used  
In the line, which is a , is being concatenated with two  (we know they're  because  is called on them.  This is an error in Python3, but it can be fixed by calling  on the string.The second parameter to  should be an address.  The exact type of the address depends on the socket's family.  In this case you have correctly defined address as a tuple (), but you are erroneously calling  on it.Try changing the line to:and the error will be fixed.
