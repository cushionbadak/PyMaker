This question already has an answer here:Is floating point math broken?                    28 answers                Am working on a small math-checker using Python and everything works well except of divisions. Problem: The quotient with two decimals (2/3 = 0.67), float, is equal to an input (0.67). But the if-statement I use to compare a user's input with the result says it isn't equal. Assumption: the problem is related to float. My code:Of course I could create a function with a different approach, but I am curious to understand why it doesn't work.If there's a similar thread, please post the link and close this one. Thanks for any help.
when checking floats for equality always use
