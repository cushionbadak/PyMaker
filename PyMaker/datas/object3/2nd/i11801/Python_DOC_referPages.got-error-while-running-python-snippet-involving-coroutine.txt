New to python. Tried to run the following sample program from https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html  but got errorHere is the code snippet in coro.pyI am running python 2.7.6 in Ubuntu 14.04.Suspecting that I don't have asyncio, I tried to install it (didn't have any effect on previous code snippet), got funny result, I really don't know whether it worked
From https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html:The async def type of coroutine was added in Python 3.5--> you say you're using Python 2.7, that won't work
Looks like async is only supported in Python 3, as per this documentation
