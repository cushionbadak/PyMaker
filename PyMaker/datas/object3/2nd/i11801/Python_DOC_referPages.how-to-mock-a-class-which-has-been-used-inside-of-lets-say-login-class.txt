I have a login method that I have written a unittest for it and it works great. But login method calls external classes to verify username and password. As I want to make the procedure faster and do the test in isolation I want to mock those classes.Inside of  there is a class that connects to DB. How should I mock the part conneting to DB? Lets say the DB class is called . Any thoughts?EDIT1:This gives the error of:The error makes sense as it is not present in , it is a working class in a different place in project that login function uses! How to mock it?
A basic approach to patching with mock objects would be something like:The actual solution depends on how your project is set up.Note that depending on how you import your  patching may not replace the correct reference during testing:outputs:So if you have imported  in to the namespace of your view module, you can try and patch it there instead:
