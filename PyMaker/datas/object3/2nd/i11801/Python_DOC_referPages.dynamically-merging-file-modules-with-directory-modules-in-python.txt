Given a directory with the following structure:and the following file contents:foo.pyfoo/bar.pyfoo/bar/baz.pyI would love to be able to do all of these things from some other file:i.e. as if the definitions in each file were "merged" with the module definitions comprising the directory with the same name. How can I accomplish this in a dynamic way (whether involving  or otherwise) that won't require me to manually specify each path?When I place empty  files in each directory and attempt to perform the above imports, I receive the following error:which seems to me to suggest that the  file has been overridden by the  directory so that the definitions in  are not visible.
try doing:with the folder structure you show I'd expect the result to be something like:But when you add an  to the  folder it would instead be:with python packages you cannot actually import a folder so what ends up happening is that you import the  file from that folder instead of the  so all you need to do is move the  into the folder and rename it to  and you can then  or  the same way as you have it set up now.
