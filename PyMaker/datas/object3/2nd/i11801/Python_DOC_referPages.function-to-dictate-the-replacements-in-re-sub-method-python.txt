Trying to use regex to perform substitutions on a string.The problem is that I do not understand how the replacement will occur via the  when I need the substitution to be dependent on the matching object from that ; i.e. I will use that matched object as a dictionary key to get the matching value with which that particular object needs to be replaced.I have tried to iterate all the matching objects, as seen above, but cannot figure out how to apply the re.sub. If I understand correctly, the  in my first code segment needs to somehow know which is the matched object from that regex.Any ideas, especially using code will be much appreciated cause I am only just now starting with Python.
The  function passed the matched object to  as an argument replace the returned result from that function with matched string. If you want to replace the matched object with a particular string in a dictionary you can simply use a function to handle that:
The  docs are pretty clear on this one:Return the string obtained by replacing the leftmost non-overlapping occurrences of  in string by the replacement .If  is a function, it is called for every non-overlapping occurrence of . The function takes a single match object argument, and returns the replacement string.
