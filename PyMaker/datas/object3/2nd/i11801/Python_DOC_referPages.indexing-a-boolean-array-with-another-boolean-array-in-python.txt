I have a dataset with two Boolean arrays. The first boolean array indicates which data points have an error attached to them and is used to specify whether or not to turn on the error in an MCMC routine. The second array indicates whether or not each data point has a measured length. How can I index the  array by the  array, so that I will have a list comprised of objects with  with either  or ?Here's an example of what I'm trying to do:
Here you go. That does exactly what you need.The  function takes 1 value from each iterable every time, and the list comprehension filters out the false , and takes the  for those that are .Another, more efficient approach would be to use  like so:
You could just write a function to do this.
