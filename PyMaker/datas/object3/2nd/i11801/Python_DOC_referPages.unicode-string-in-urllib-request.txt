Natural Text
The short version: I have a variable . I need to convert  to ASCII so that .Long version:I'm using  to read an mp3 pronunciation file from URL. This has worked very well, except I ran into a problem because the URLs often contain unicode characters. For example, the German "BÃ¤r". The full URL is . Indeed, typing this into Chrome as a URL works, and navigates me to the mp3 file without problems. However, feeding this same URL to  creates a problem.I determined this was a unicode problem because the stack-trace reads: ... and other than the obvious , I can see it's trying to  to ASCII. Interestingly, when I copied the URL from Chrome (instead of simply typing it into the Python interpreter), it translated the  to . When I feed this to , it processes fine, because all of these characters are ASCII. So my goal is to make this conversion within my program. I tried to get my original string to the unicode equivalent, but  in all of its variants didn't work; further, I'm not sure how to store the Unicode as ASCII, given that Python 3 stores all strings as Unicode and thus makes no attempt to convert the text.
