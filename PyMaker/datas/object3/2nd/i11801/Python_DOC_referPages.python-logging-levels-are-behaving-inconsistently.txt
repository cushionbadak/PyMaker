I can't understand why the following code does not produce my debug message even though effective level is appropriate (output is just )while when I add this line after the import: it produces following output:so even though "Start..." is not shown, it starts to log. Why?It's on Python 3.5. Thanks
The top-level  call calls the  function for you if no handlers have been configured yet on the root logger.Because using a call to  does not trigger that call, you don't see any output because there are no handlers to show the output on.The Python 3 version of  does have a  handler, used for when no logging configuration exists, but this handler is configured to only show messages of level  and up, which is why you see your  level message () printed to STDERR, but not your  level message. In Python 2 you would get the message No handlers could be found for logger "root" printed instead, just once for the first attempt to log anything. I'd not rely on the  handler however; instead properly configure your logging hierarchy with a decent handler configured for your own needs.Either call  yourself, or manually add a handler on the root logger:The above basically does the same thing as a  call with no further arguments. The  created this way logs to STDERR and does not further filter on the message level. Note that a  call can also set the logging level for you.
The root logger(default logger, top level) and all other logger's default log level is (order 3) in all 5 log levels:  <  <  <  <  in order. So at your first , you haven't set the root log level to  as following code and you can't get the output. see python logging HOW TO for detail
