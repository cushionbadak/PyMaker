I'm reading various logs from a Windows Server and current am grabbing the most recent log in a folder.I then want to scan that log and only print the last line where it contains a particular string.The following will print all lines containing the string - How do I get it to print only the last match that it's found?
Easy way to do this is just store every time you get a hit, and print outside the loop:You can generalize to the last  matches using a  with an appropriate , so you just  all matches as you go, pushing out the oldest once you exceed the limit. The following works identically to the code above, but allows a second argument that prints more lines:
Store it in an array and then print the last item in the array. Can use  to return the line as a .
You could iterate over your file in reversed order.If your file is small, reading it in won't be a problem. If it is large, choose another solution.
