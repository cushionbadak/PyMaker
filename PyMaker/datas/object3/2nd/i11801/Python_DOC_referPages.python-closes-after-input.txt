I'm brand new to python! My programs keep closing immediately after I input some data. So for example, I run this:And after I put in a number, the program shuts down without displaying an answer. It works just fine on my school's computers. How can I fix this?
You've probably used Python 3 on your school's computers. On Python 2  already does  on the input that user entered where as on Python 3  just returns a string that needs to be converted to number in one way or another.If you want to convert the example to work on Python 2 I'd suggest that you use  that returns the user input as a string and convert it to number with . You also need to either use  statement or import  function from  as I've done in the following example:
Your program exits immediately after input. You can block it simply with a "raw_input()" at the end. If you're using Python 2.7 (as opposed to 3.x) you should use raw_input() instead of input(). Using eval is a bit strange here, so let's use a float. Finally as this is tagged Python 2.7, I made the print use a formatted string because it feels more 2.7-like:Now your program will exit after you hit Enter!
