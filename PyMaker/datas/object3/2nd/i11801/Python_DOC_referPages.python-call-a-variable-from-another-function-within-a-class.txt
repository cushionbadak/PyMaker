You need to use   if you want to call an instance method or access a name (instance variable) from  other instance methods.
Instead of:I would try:
Let's look at this case first:When you instantiate a class:And then try to see what  or  are:Notice - it says bound method of an instance of . These methods are bound to an instance - you can only use them with that instance. Incidentally, have you ever wondered what  was and why you always have to pass it in to instance methods of a class? Did you know you could rewrite your class like this (not recommended, always use self for this, just doing this to illustrate the point).And it would work the same way? If you also added  to , like so:And tried printing out the method a and calling the method:This was just to illustrate the point that these methods are bound to an instance, and to use them you need to use that specific instance, thus:And when calling  you would again, use the instance -
