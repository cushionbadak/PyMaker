(top_25 is an array of words, and the random.choice randomly selects characters from the respective arrays). As the for loop iterates, the wordDic keeps updating and overwriting itself-is there a way to add the new values of the wordDic into the dictionary, so it prints out all of them in one dictionary?
Because you are defining the dictionary inside the loop.Which means that you are redifining/overwriting the dictionary during each iteration of the loop ( Comment from: @M.T ) Define it outside the loop to get it work.
The compact way to do this is with a dictionary comprehension. Also, there's no need to pass  a list of single characters: you can just pass it a string.I've used the  prefix on the strings to make the code compatible to Python 2 as well as Python 3.
