but what about sep? i tried to replace end by sep but nothing happened but i know that sep is used to separete while printing, how and when can i use sep? what are the differences between sep and end?
The print function uses  to separate the arguments, and  after the last argument. Your example was confusing because you only gave it one argument. This example might be clearer:Of course,  and  only work in Python 3's print function. For Python 2, the following is equivalent.You can also use a backported version of the print function in Python 2:
The following two are equivalent:
sep='' and end='' are two different thing. ignore space and make variable as a single string.. like: -->abBut  make  -->a b see the below example.for sep=' 'for end=' '
