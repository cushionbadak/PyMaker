I've recently been using this code answered from another question:I used this to sort averages. However, the code fails to sort averages producing results as such: As seen it's not sorted from highest to lowest or lowest to highest. How would I be able to change this code so it does sort from highest to lowest or vice verse?Thanks
https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sortedYou may prefer  which returns None but sorts foo itself in-placeIf you want to insert an element into a sorted list, import bisectPS if  isn't throwing a syntax error, you're on Python 2
Sorting a list after every update can be fine for small lists, but will be resource-consuming with long lists.If you need to automatically maintain a sort order while updating a list, try SortedContainers.
