I am trying to write a python program that takes an input directory, and prints out all the .txt files that are in the directory. However, if there is another folder inside that one, it must do the same thing using recursion.My problem is that is only does the .txt files and does not traverse further into the directory.What is the problem?          
You are missing full path otherwise it's fine. see below 
It looks like the reason your code is failing is because the  line always fails, regardless of whether or not the file is the directory. This is because the  variable stores relative paths rather than absolute paths, which causes the check to fail.If you want to do it using the recursion method you gave, your code can be changed as follows:Here is a better way to do it using fnmatch (adapted to suit the rest of your code from Use a Glob() to find files recursively in Python?). It will recursively search all files in the supplied directory, and match those that end with
