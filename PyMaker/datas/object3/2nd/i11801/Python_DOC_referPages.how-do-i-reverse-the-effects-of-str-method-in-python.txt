I am wondering if python has an in-build method to reverse the str() method.Example: MyList contains a dictionary, a string and an integer.Let's say i want to arrange these items in order of size(length).here is my functionIf I run this Function on MyListThe current output is:Expected output:I was able to change the Integer back from a string but the dictionary remains a string in Quotation Marks(obviously because i only reversed the str() only for the Integers and not the dictionaries).How would I be able to reverse this element back to a Dictionary?
You need to use the  key parameter to  to specify a function to be called. Here a  expression will work fine.
Generally  is not meant to give something that you can decode back into a python object. It is meant to give a human readable string. If you want to encode into a string that is machine readable use something like json.
