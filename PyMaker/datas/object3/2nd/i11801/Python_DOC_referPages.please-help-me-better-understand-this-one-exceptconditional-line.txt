I'm about a couple weeks into learning Python.With the guidance of user:' Lost' here on Stackoverflow I was able to figure out how to build a simple decoder program. He suggested a code and I changed a few things but what was important for me was that I understood what was happening. I understand 97% of this code except for the  line in the . As of now the code works, but I want to understand that line.So basically this code unscrambles an encrypted word based on a specific criteria. You can enter this sample encrypted word to try it out.  the answer should be I tried replacing the except:  with a Value Error because I have never seen a Try/Except conditional that just had an operational and no Error clause. But replacing it with Value Error created a never ending loop. My question is what is the purpose of writing the except:  as it is.'Lost' if you're there could you answer this question. Sorry, about the old thread
The purpose is to advance  by one, skipping the current character in case the cast to  fails, i.e. if  is not a digit.
There are a couple of errors, than can occur inside the try-Block: is out of index, because the while loop runs one index to far. is not a number, which leads to an ValueError gets to big, and the next index access leads also to an IndexErrorIn either way, the except-clause will ignore the next character. And the loop goes on.An correct implementation wouldn't need any exceptions:
