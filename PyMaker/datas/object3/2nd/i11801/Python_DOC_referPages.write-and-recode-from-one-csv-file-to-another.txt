I am trying to select specific columns from a large tab-delimited CSV file and output only certain columns to a new CSV file. Furthermore, I want to recode the data as this happens. If the cell has a value of 0 then just output 0. However, if the cell has a value of greater than 0, then just output 1 (i.e., all values greater than 0 are coded as 1).Here's what I have so far:The first issue I am having is that I want to also take from column 6. I wasn't sure how to write column 6 and then columns 9-2844.Second, I wasn't sure how to do the recoding on the fly as I write the new CSV.
I wasn't sure how to write column 6 and then columns 9-2844.This works because you can add two lists together. Note that in Python3,  doesn't return a list, so we have to coerce it.I wasn't sure how to do the recoding on the flyThis works because of the conditional expression: . The general form  evaluates to either  or , depending upon the condition. Another form, which I think is "too clever by half" is . This works because the  operator always returns one or the other of its inputs.
This should work:
