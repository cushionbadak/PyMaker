I am trying to process a 3GB XML file, and am getting a memoryerror in the middle of a loop that reads the file and stores some data in a dictionary.I'm using an iterative parsing method so the issue isn't with reading the file.  I just want to store the data in a dictionary for later processing, but it seems the dictionary is getting too large.  Later in the program I read in links and need to check if the nodes referenced by the links were in the initial batch of nodes, which is why I am storing them in a dictionary.How can I either greatly reduce memory footprint (the script isn't even getting close to finishing so shaving bits and pieces off won't help much) or greatly increase the amount of memory available to python?  Monitoring the memory usage it looks like python is pooping out at about 1950 MB, and my computer still has about 6 GB available of RAM.
Assuming you have tons of s being created, you might consider using  to predefine a fixed set of attributes for each . This removes the overhead of storing a per-instance  (in exchange for preventing the creation of undeclared attributes) and can easily cut memory usage per  by a factor of ~5x (less on Python 3.3+ where shared key  reduces the per-instance memory cost for free).It's easy to do, just change the declaration of  to:For example, on Python 3.5 (where shared key dictionaries already save you something), the difference in object overhead can be seen with:And remember, this is Python 3.5 with shared key dictionaries; in Python 2, the per-instance cost with  would be similar (one pointer sized variable larger IIRC), while the cost without  would go up by a few hundred bytes.Also, assuming you're on a 64 bit OS, make sure you've installed the 64 bit version of Python to match the 64 bit OS; otherwise, Python will be limited to ~2 GB of virtual address space, and your 6 GB of RAM counts for very little.
