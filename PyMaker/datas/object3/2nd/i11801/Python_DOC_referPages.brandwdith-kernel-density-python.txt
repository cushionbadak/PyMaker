I'm tryingh to calculate the kernel density function of a list of values:following this website: http://mark-kay.net/2013/12/24/kernel-density-estimation/ I want to calculate the best value for bandwidth, so I wrote this piece of code:but I get this error when runs this:Error: TypeError: list indices must be integers, not tupleDoes anyone know how to fix it?Thanks
You are using a python list where you should use a numpy.array. The latter supports richer indexing.
