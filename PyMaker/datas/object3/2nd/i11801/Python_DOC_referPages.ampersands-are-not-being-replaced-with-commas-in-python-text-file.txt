Natural Text
Because ampersands are a delimiter in the file I am trying to process, I am attempting to replace all the instances of ampersand with commas in a Python text file, however the below code has no effect on the file.
You're replacing the ampersand with an ampersand plus a space. Use this:See the docs. Return a copy of the string with all occurrences of substring old replaced by new. If the optional argument count is given, only the first count occurrences are replaced.
Your  parameters are wrong. Try this to replace "&" and also "& ".
