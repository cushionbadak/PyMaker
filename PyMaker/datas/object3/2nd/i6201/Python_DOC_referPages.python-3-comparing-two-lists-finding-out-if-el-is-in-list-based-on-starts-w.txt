I have two lists:I want to find out if an element is present on both lists based on the FEW CHARACTERS AT THE BEGINNING, and delete the element from things_to_tweet if a match is found.The final output should be things_to_tweet = ['Playmobil is a toy']Any idea how I can do this?Thank youPS/ I tried, but I cannot do an "==" comparison because each el is different in every list, even if they start the same, so they're not seen as equal by Python.I also tried a loop inside a loop but I don't know how to compare one element with ALL the elements of another list only IF the strings start in the same manner.I also checked other SO threads but they seem to refer to comparisons between lists when elements are exactly the same, which is not what I need.
To keep things simple and readable, I would make use of a helper function (I named it ). Without this function we would have two nested loops, which is needlessly confusing. Checking whether a string is a prefix of another string is done with the str.startswith function.I also opted to create a new list instead of removing strings from , because removing things from a list you're iterating over will often cause unexpected results.A veteran would do this with much less code, but this should be a lot easier to understand.
