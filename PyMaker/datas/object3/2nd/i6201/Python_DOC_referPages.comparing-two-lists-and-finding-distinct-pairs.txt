I am trying to compare two lists ( which contain different sizes of sublists) and finding pair (enclosed in round bracket) that's not present in the other list. Here is the code:The above-mentioned code is not giving distinct pair that is present in s2 but not in s1.Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks!
Flatten your lists into  objects and the set-operations they impelement, in this case, you want the difference between  and , Note, you may actually want the symmetric difference between the two, i.e. the items that are not in both:
Assuming the nested structure is not relevant and the lists can be flattened:
if you are finding items of s2 which are not present in s1 then use simply:One linedetailed:That list comprehension is same as :output:
