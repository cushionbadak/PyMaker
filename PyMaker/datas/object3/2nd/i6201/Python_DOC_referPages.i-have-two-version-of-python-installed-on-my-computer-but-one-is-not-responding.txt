I have two version of python installed on my computer one is  Anaconda and another one is . Now on 3.6.3 I can not run or import any library like  or  on IDLE. I use windows 10. I can work on 3.6 version [Anaconda]. I tried to change the version through command prompt by  but since both the version are in 3 + so it didn't work.
Remove the Anaconda Python  python path from your  environment variables.Instead, add the Python  path to your  variable.Now use your normal command prompt for Python  version.Use the command  in command prompt When you need Python  version.
If you have two versions of Python 3 on the same machine you should use virtual environments.This will keep them separate and allow you to use the one you want and install the modules you want on that version.You can learn to do this here: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html
