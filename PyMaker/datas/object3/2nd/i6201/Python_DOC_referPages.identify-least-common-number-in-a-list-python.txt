With a list of numbers, each number can appear multiple times, i need to find the least common number in the list. If different numbers have the same lowest frequency, the result is the one occurring last in the list. An example, the least common integer in [1, 7, 2, 1, 2] is 7 (not 2, as originally said). And the list needs to stay unsortedI have the following but it always sets the last entry to leastCommonAny help would be greatly appreciated
It is the simplest way come in my mind right now:and in two least items it will return the last occurrence one.
Using the Counter:
This answer is based on @offtoffel to incorporate multiple items of the same number of occurrences while choosing the last occurring one:Edit: I noticed that thereâ€™s a even simpler solution, that is efficient and effective (just reverse the list in the beginning and min will keep the last value that has the minimum count):
Short but inefficient:Efficient version using collections.Counter:
Edit: sorry, this does not always take the last list item with least occurancy, as demanded by the user...it works on the example, but not for every instance.
