This question already has an answer here:Making a string out of a string and an integer in Python [duplicate]                    6 answers                I want to create string using integer appended to it, in a for loop.  Like this:But it returns an error:What's the best way to concatenate the String and Integer?
NOTE:The method used in this answer (backticks) is deprecated in later versions of Python 2, and removed in Python 3. Use the  function instead.You can use :It will print .To get  you can use this as @YOU suggestedUpdate as per Python3You can use :It will print .To get  you can use this as @YOU suggested
To get , you could do like

That is, I replaced a string with a string and an incremental number that follow it. 
Concatenation of a string and integer is simple:just use
