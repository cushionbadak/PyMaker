For my programming class, we have to create a function that takes in a string argument and returns the rot13 equivalent of the string. When I try running my function, it says that count can't equal str[i] because string indices have to be integers. I'm honestly lost and what else I could do to make the function work. Any help would be lovely    
In Python,  will loop through every character in the string , with  set to that character (which you already know, since you're doing ). (Don't use  as a name, by the way:  is the Python name for the string type.)  is treating the character in  as an index. You don't need to (or should) do that. It doesn't make much sense.
