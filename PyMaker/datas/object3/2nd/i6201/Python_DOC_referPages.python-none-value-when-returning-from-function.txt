I'm writing a program that stores 3 players and their scores in a list and then prints them out at the end. Simple stuff really, however I'm trying to call the value for the player score from a function called playerscore() which prevents you from entering a score >5.this works fine when you run through it with the correct value, but if you input an incorrect value > 5 then it begins the playerscore function again and allows for a new value to be entered but returns "None"for example, these are the inputs and outputs:I feel like there's something obvious that i'm missing. Can anyone point me in the right direction?
You are missing a return statement in the if block (when the score is greater than 5):Output:From official documentation:In fact, even functions without a return statement do return a value, albeit a rather boring one. This value is called None (itâ€™s a built-in name).
When you are doing this:    you call  function without  statement. This produces  value.
The type of recursion you're trying to do with your code will work with a small correction on your code... which follows:You can notice that this time, we returned . As it seems like you're learning the basics, I'd like to propose a slightly different approach, as you'll get a ValueError exception if the player types a string (some letters) instead of a number. You can keep using your recursive function in the exception catch, and use a while loop to make the player to keep the number within your desired range. Here follows my suggestion to prevent the ValueError exception:I hope that helps. Regards. 
When function doesn't return anything, value will be .So you should check your code for the case where  is larger than 5. (Compare it to the case where score is not larger than five.)
