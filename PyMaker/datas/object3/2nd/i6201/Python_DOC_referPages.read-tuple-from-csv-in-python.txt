I am trying to read a row in a csv, which I have previously written. That written row looks like this when is read:  and like this:  (converts the tuple in a string).I need to read each item from the tuple to operate with the ints, but I can't if it is read like a string because if I do something like this: , what I get is:  -the first character of the string tuple-Maybe this is a question about how I write and read the rows, which actually is this way:What I want is to read that tuple for row, not like a string, but like a tuple to operate with each item after.Is it possible?
You need to use  on you tuple string as:Because currently the list you got after reading the file at index 1 is holding the valid string of the tuple format.  will convert your tuple string to the  object and then you can access the tuple based on the index.
since you're producing the file yourself, why not making it right from the start:the first line writes each item of  but tries to convert each item as .  gets converted, where selecting another format could avoid this.which explains the need to evaluate it afterwards.The second write line writes 3 elements (now 3 columns), but preserves the data (except for the  part which is converted to  anyway)in that case, a simple string to integer conversion on rows does the job.Note that  isn't the best way to serialize mixed data. Better use  for that.
