In Python 3.6.1, I've tried wrapping a tempfile.SpooledTemporaryFile in an io.TextIOWrapper:The line  gives me an error:If I create a simple class like this, I can bypass the error (I get similar errors for  and ):Is there a good reason why tempfile.SpooledTemporaryFile doesn't already have these attributes?
 actually uses 2 different  implementations under the hood - initially an  Buffer ( or ), until it rolls over and creates a "file-like object" via  (for example, when  is exceeded). requires a  base class/interface, which is provided by  and , but not necessarily by the object returned by  (though in my testing on OSX,  returned an  object, which had the desired interface, my theory is this may depend on platform).So, I would expect your  wrapper to possibly fail on some platforms after rollover.
