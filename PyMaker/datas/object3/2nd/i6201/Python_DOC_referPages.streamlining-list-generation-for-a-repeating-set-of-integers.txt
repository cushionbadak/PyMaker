Ok, so I am working on a model which simulates forest growth. The growth is defined by a complicated function, which is based on the age of the forest in years. The forest is periodically cut down every  years, and restarts growth at year 1 (felling is assumed to be instantaneous). The model begins in year  (a standing forest)if  and the limit of the modelled timescales ()  the following code will return a list of values from 1 to r which cycles until it exceeds the limit, it is then truncated to remove any values beyond This code works, but it seems like an unnecessarily cumbersome way of going about things. Can anybody suggest a more elegant solution?
Such cyclic repetitions are elegantly replicated with :You could skip the advancement part and just factor it into the final slicing step so slicing starts at  and ends at :
You can use below code:
