I want to redirect all the output of my django (1.10.4) app to a fileFirstly, I tried:But it doesn't redirect the output of the print command.For example, in my code there is a statement:using command:I can see that 'query_content:' is printed out on the screen.But with :In the test.log, there are only something like this:One solution is:But sometimes it is impossible to change the python code, is there any solution?update:I found that if the log file already exists, then everything is fine.But if I specify a new file name, then the output of python "print ..." statement cannot save the log file.
I believe that  writes to the file  whatever gets logged to console from Django.  is not getting logged, therefore is not part of Django output.You need to create a logger for your application:In  add:Add the following were you want to log something:Although the above solves your immediate problem, you can take it a step further:Add a file handler in your  configuration:On handlers add:On  update the handlers:You can customize the above even further, but that is another subject:More info on python and django logging:https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.htmlhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/topics/logging/
I think this shell command maybe can output the result.
TL;DR: if you have a loop in the end of a file you are feeding to  add two newlines in the end.In my case the reason s were not present in the stdout was because they were never really executed in the first place. They were in a  loop that was at the end of file without two newlines or a newline and any other line (with a comment) after it. This way the shell was left waiting for a  loop code to be finished and it never was.
