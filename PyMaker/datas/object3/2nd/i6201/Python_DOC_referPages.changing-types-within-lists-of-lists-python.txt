so I have a function which takes a list of lists and changes the type of each value depending on what the value represents:I've only posted part of the code, I feel as though once I can get that sorted I can apply a similar method in other if/elif/else to be able to get it all straight. My problem is when I apply this sort of method and then call x again the list is still returned as strings instead of ints or floats or bools.ie if I called x after executing this function I would get:instead of what is in the example code in the function.I'm not sure what's going wrong, any advice would be helpful.
Because when you do :Yes you are changing the type but where are you storing changed stuff ??For that, you have to tell the list to change at that index and for that, you can use enumerate :Second thing you are using isdigit() on float which will not work :str.isdigit() will only return true if all characters in the string  are digits. . and -  are punctuation, not a digit.So you can use try these two methods :First Method :output:or if you want you can convert all int to float :Second Method:You can define your own  function :Then one line solution :Detailed Solution:output:
you need to change the list element itself, not the local reference  or :
You're not updating the list. You're just assigning the value another value, which does, umm..nothing. Use an  function and the index value it provides and then change the value using the index.Better still, since you're wanting to generate a new list based on the current list, it would be better to go for a 
Currently you are using the value of of the list, but not updating it. You therefore need to enumerate it, and change the list element directly by referencing to it. The correct code would look something like this:
 and  will not work since '-456' contains  and '4.5' contains '.' Instead do:    OUTPUT
First: isdigit return false for negative value, that's whay you are not getting the integer in XSecond:You are not replacing the updating the variable  in Working Example will be like:
