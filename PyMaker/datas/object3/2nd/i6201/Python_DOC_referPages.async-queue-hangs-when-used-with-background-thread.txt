It seems  only can be pushed by the same thread reading it? For instance:only printsand then hangs. What am I missing?
You can't call asyncio methods from another thread directly.Either use loop.call_soon_threadsafe:Or asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe:where  is the loop returned by  in your main thread.
You could take a look on janusThe library provides a queue with two faces: one for async event loop and other for classic threaded code.I believe README describes the library pretty well.
