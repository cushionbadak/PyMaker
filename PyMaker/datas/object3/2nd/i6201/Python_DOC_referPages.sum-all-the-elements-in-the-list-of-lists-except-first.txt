Add all the elements in the list of lists except the first element and make a new list. Output should look like Eg:  -1083.88 of the output list is = -604.5+(-141.38)+(-338.0)=-1083.88I've tried like this   Thanks in advanced.
Going by your expected output, I believe you're looking for a transposition and sum on the columns. You can use  for that.Alternatively, convert the transposal to a  and you can avoid the  check (this is similar to MaximTitarenko's answer, so credit to them as well).Or, if you'd prefer,Which is a little less elegant.
You can try this:
To use all python flavour you need to use  since in Python  returns iterator and you cannot just  subscript  object.To include  in the begging as cᴏʟᴅsᴘᴇᴇᴅ kindly noted in comments
If you want to be really efficient about it, you could use itertools' isliceEdit: sorry, didn't read the entire context the first time around :)
