Natural Text
I have a function that should return the number of words that contain each vowel (all lowercase), but I keep getting a key error. I'd appreciate any help in figuring it out. Thank you.

That's because  keeps the words from the previous vowels. Once you reach "like" for "i", it already exists since it was added for "e". This means that it tries to add to the value for key "i" in , which doesn't exist (it would get added the first time a word is found that hasn't been added for another vowel).Since (judging by the last line) you want every vowel to be in the resulting dict, you can just create the dict with all the vowels as keys and the values as zero, and you don't even have to check if a key exists. Just increase the value by one if the word contains the vowel.The resulting code would be something like this:Roy Orbison singing for the lonely; hey, that's me and I want you only
