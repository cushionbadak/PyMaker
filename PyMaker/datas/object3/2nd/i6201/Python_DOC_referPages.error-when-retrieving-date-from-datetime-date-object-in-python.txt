Thanks in advance.
 is a instance method of  objects, not a separate function:The error message is trying to tell you that you're calling the uninstanced method (descriptor) from the  class directly, without passing an instance as first parameter.For more info check date objects documentation.
It's a datetime.date object. It has a str() method which will solve your problem.will result as '2009-05-01'
