I have a .pkl file that I'm writing with pickle, with key-value pairs and that works.However I was wondering how can I access the key-value pairs once I read from this file using pickle.load. is a dictionary (). If I do:What I want to do is instead something like:but if I do that, I get:E       ValueError: too many values to unpack
The solution is:thanks @Jose, @roganjosh and @timgeb for your help via comments.
when doing:you actually iterate through keys and not values.to reach value just usejust saying, but I think @ShinDarth 's answer is better
