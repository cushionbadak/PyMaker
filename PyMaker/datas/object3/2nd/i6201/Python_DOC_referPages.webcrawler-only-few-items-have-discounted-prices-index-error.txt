I am new to programming and am trying to build my first little web crawler in python. Goal: Crawling a product list page - scraping brand name, article name, original price and new price - saving in CSV fileStatus: I've managed to get the brand name, article name as well as original price and put them into correct order into a list (e.g. 10 products). As there is a brand name, description and price for all items, my code get them in correct order into the csv.  Code:Problem: I am struggling with getting the discounted prices into my csv at the right place. Not every item has a discount and I currently see two issues with my code: I use .findAll to look for the information on the website - as there are less discounted products then total products, my new_Prices contains fewer prices (e.g. 3 prices for 10 products). If i would be able to add them to the list, I assume they would show up in the first 3 rows. How can i make sure to add the new_Prices to the right prodcuts?I am getting "Index Error: list index out of range" Error, which i assume is caused by the fact that i am looping through 10 products, however for new_Prices i am reaching the end quicker then for my other lists? Does that make sense and is that my assumption correct? I am very much appreciating any help. Thank, Thorsten
Since some items don't have a  tag you can't use the list index reliably.However you can select all the container tags () and use  to select tags on each item.  If you want to get more than 24 items per page you have to use a client that runs js, like .  Footnotes:The naming conventions for functions and variables is lowercase with underscores.When reading  or writting csv files it's best to use the  lib.When handling files you can use the  statement.
