Writing a program to check if a word that the user inputs is in a pre-existing set; no matter what word I input the program returns "False" (even when it's a word I know is in the set).  Code is below:
Assuming there is one word per line in the file, e.g.You can use this, which adds every line to :Printing an output of:Edit: a much shorter way for the actual task:
Assuming your file looks like this:Let's create that file:Now let's run a sample code:     Typing: 
The right way is to use a generator for this:
For first, it's better to open files usingyou could read about this herehttps://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.htmlAlso you try to add file into set, but you need to add words.So this is working (and more pythonic) code:
There are a few things going on here which I'm not sure you're totally clear on:First, F is a file. I'm going to guess that you're intention here is that you're trying to check whether a word is in a file of words (like a dictionary). To do this however you'll need to do something like this:The second issue is that you're using a function but you're mistaking your parameters as the same variables you've declared in your main flow. Eg.
