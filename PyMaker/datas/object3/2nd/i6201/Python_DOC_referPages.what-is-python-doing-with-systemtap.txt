I noticed on CentOS-7 distro that the python-2 and python-3 RPM installs both have some "systemtap" scripts installed at .What is python doing with  scripts?I read a little about what is  and the description[1] I read sounds like to me that  is a kernel debugging/instrumentation tool.[1] from the stackoverflow.com tag description:Systemtap is tool to probe or trace a running linux system,  supporting visibility into both kernel- (its initial focus)   and  user-space.   It uses dynamically loaded probes to gather performance   and tracing data about the whole system or just selected processes.
SystemTap can inspect python. Reference: https://docs.python.org/3/howto/instrumentation.htmlSo the scripts you see in /usr/share/systemtap may include some helper functions for SystemTap to trace python code.
