This question already has an answer here:How do I list all files of a directory?                    27 answers                I am trying to get a list of strings with the file path and the file name. At the moment I only get the file names into the list. Code:Output: I would want an output similar to this:
Since you have access to the directory path you could just do:or simplerWhere  will join your directory path with the filenames inside it.
If you're on Python 3.5 or higher, skip  in favor of , which is both more efficient and does the work for you ( is an attribute of the result objects):This also lets you cheaply filter ( includes some file info for free, without -ing the file), e.g. to keep only files (no directories or special file-system objects):If you're on 3.4 or below, you may want to look at the PyPI  module (which provides the same API on earlier Python).Also note: I used a raw string for the path; while  happens to work without it, you should always use raw strings for Windows path literals, or you'll get a nasty shock when you try to use  (where  is the ASCII form feed character), while  works just fine (because the  prefix prevents backslash interpolation of anything but the quote character).
