i'm trying to extract the latest 'apple','pear' and other .csv stored in a directory in python. The new files get stored with the same prefix but with different frequency (e.g, apple_gets an update every 5 days or so).  Looking at something like  but category ? specific - so i'd pull the only melon_ csv if there is one even though it was saved months ago. stuck here, not sure how to proceed, maybe pandas? 
No need for pandas, you can use itertools groupby:while get you a dictionary of category to the latest file.Note: You can get this in a single pass with a for loop:
No need for pandas. You could simply put those filenames in a dict of lists:For each category, you now have list which you can sort by .
