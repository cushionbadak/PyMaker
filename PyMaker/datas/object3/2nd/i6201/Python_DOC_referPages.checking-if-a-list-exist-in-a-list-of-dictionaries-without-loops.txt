How can I check if a list exists as a value in a dictionary which is a member of a list (list of dictionaries)?A one-liner such as this (though this one doesn't work for obvious reasons). I want to avoid loops.Context:Example  =  Note: Total list keeps growing because every time redList is not in the totalList, I add a new dictionary to the toalList based on predefined criteria. 
Or with operator.itemgetter:Edit: Or just a generator expression (similar to Leandro's, but more space-efficient and perhaps more time-efficient as well, since it stops at the first finding):
Try with this
If you often need this check, it might be worth it to  convert your lists to tuples. This way, they become hashable and can be saved in a :You only need to iterate once in order to create the set. Every check will be fast and won't require any loop.If you want to get the corresponding score, you could save the tuples in a dict:
You can use :
