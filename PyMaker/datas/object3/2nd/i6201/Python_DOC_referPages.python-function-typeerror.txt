I need help fixing my code error when running the codethe error is I need to develop a Python program to display the menuA.  Calculate additionB.  Calculate subtractionC.  Calculate divisionD.  Calculate multiplicationQ. QuitPlease enter your selection:    •In your program, you need to write five functions.•   Based on the selection, two numbers will be asked to enter from keyboard.Executing the program, the result will be displayed.•Program will be terminated until ‘Q’ is hit.
"num1+num2" results in only a value, which also, is a  because you're writing it between "" (quotes). Don't do that to anything but strings.Your function requires two parameters (a and b), so you have to input those two parameters separated so the function can do his work, which would be to effectuate the operation.You have to do this:Function:So, this is more or less what you have right now. However, it would give the following output:This happens because you didn't specify what kind of input you were assigning to num1 and num2, so it's threating them like strings.So, your function is actually concatenating those strings, that's why the result is 53, instead of 8.To avoid that, change this:Into this:Apply that to the rest of your code and it should be working properly now :)Correct output:
Just like the error has stated:Your mentioned that the implementation of your addition function is:This function, accepts two parameters  and .However, when you call this function, it only accepts one parameter: is a string, it is not even a variable, so it counts as one parameter.i think you mean to pass the variables to the function, you should do Everything inside the quote is string, do not do that with variables. I bet you will run into the similar problem with rest of your function calls, so change them accordingly as well.
