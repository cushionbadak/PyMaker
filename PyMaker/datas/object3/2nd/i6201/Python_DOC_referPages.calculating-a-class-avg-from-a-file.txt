Can anyone please help me fix this?I want to go through the columns and have something like this.

How do I do that and then calculate the average?I want to have [99, 88, 77, 66][11, 22, 33, 44][78, 58, 68, 88]into [99, 11, 78][88, 22, 58][77, 33, 68][66, 44, 88]for item in range(grades_list[4:]):  builtins.TypeError: 'list' object cannot be interpreted as an integer Here is the file for my function.
