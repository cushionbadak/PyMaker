How would i do this?There is no error, it just finds the position of the word "usernameask" wich isnt in the database.
You want to use a parameterised query. You put placeholders in your query where your data has to go, and leave it to the database driver to put your data and the query together.Parameterised queries let you avoid a common security pitfall, the SQL injection attack, where an attacker can 'augment' your database query by putting in more commands than you originally anticipated. Query parameters always make sure your data is only ever handled as data, not as commands.A parameterised query us usually also faster, as it lets the database avoid having to parse your query every time if you use it more than once, and it can also reuse query plans.The  database library uses  for positional parameters; put a  where ever you need to use data from your code, and put the parameter values in a sequence (like a tuple or a list) in the second argument to :Note that  is a tuple with one element. You could also use .This executes your  query using the string value that  references in the  filter. The driver takes care of quoting your value properly.You could also use named parameters, these take the form of , (where you can pick your own names), and then you use a dictionary for the second argument to , mapping names to values:Here the placeholder is named , and the dictionary maps that to the  value.
