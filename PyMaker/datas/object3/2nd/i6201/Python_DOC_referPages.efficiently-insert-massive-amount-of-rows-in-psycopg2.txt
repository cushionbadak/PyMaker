I need to efficiently insert about 500k (give or take 100k) rows of data into my PostgreSQL database. After a generous amount of google-ing, I've gotten to this solution, averaging about 150 (wall-clock) seconds.Is there a faster way?
Based on the answers given here, COPY is the fastest method.  reads from a file or file-like object. Since memory I/O is many orders of magnitude faster than disk I/O, it is faster to write the data to a  file-like object than to write to an actual file.The psycopg docs show an example of calling  with a   as input.Therefore, you could use something like:
I don't know whether  can accept generator, but can u try something like:It might be faster.
