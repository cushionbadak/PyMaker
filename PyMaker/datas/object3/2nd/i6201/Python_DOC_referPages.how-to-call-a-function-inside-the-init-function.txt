My professor wanted us to add a new function to this program called . This function uses a loop to load temperatures in the temperature file (filename) to a list and return the list to the caller. she also wants us to modify the  function:Modify  function to add one more data attribute . Inside  function, call  function and assign the returned value to .Modify  function to use the data attribute  to calculate average temperature. Main function remains unchanged. I keep getting this error:This is my code:my original code is at the bottom im not sure what she wanted or if I attempted to do this correctly
Here's the modified code:Notes:I stripped a lot of the old (unused) codeThe commented  line from  is the simplified form of the 4 lines below it. You can decomment it and delete the 4 following linesIn , instead of having , , ... you could create a list: , and then iterate over it: , . It's more elegant, and if you want to add another temperature, you just add a new element in the listOutput:
You modified  to take 2 arguments (not counting ); as the error says, you are only calling it with 1.
You don't need to include the  parameter to your constructor - you're going to assign the return value of  to it regardless of the value of that parameter, so you can discard it entirely.On an unrelated note, I think you want to assign the return value of  to  so it'd look something like Also, your  is defined inside another function - so this code won't work if your class actually looks like the one you've included in the question.
Your constructor is declared with 2 arguments, while you are creating an object with one argument.You can remove second argument :
