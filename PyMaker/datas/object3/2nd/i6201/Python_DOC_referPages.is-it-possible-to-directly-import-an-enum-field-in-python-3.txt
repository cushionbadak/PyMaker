Let's say I have the following enum:Is it possible to somehow directly import fields from this enum ?Eg:The only workaround I could think of is declaring all enums fields as module variables:Is there a more elegant way to do this ?
No. With  can only ever add references in the current namespace pointing to the module object itself, or to the top-level names in the module. Enum values are not top-level names in the module unless you explicitly put them there, like in your workaround.You can automate assigning those names to globals, by adding all information from the  attribute to your module globals:The  function gives you a reference to the namespace of the current module, letting you add names to that namespace dynamically. The  attribute is a a mapping of name to value (including aliases), so the above adds all names to the global namespace:If you don't want aliases included in that, use a  loop, iterating over the  object. That only gives you the member objects, from which you can then pull the name:
