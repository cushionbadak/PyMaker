I have an image sequence path that is as follows : In a pythonic way, is it possible for me to code and have it read the first file based on the above file path given?If not, can I have it list the entire sequence of the sequence but only of that naming? Assuming that there is another sequence called in the same directoryFor #2, if I used , it will be listing out files of the both image sequences
Try using . Something like:
The simplest solution seems to be to use several functions.1) To get ALL of the full filepaths, use2) To choose only those of a certain kind, use a filter.
read the first file based on the above file path given?With effective  (if you need the name/path of the 1st found file): - Return an iterator which yields the same values as   without actually storing them all simultaneously.
