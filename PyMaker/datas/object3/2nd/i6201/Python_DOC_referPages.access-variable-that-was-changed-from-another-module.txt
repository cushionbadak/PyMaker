Natural Text
I'm studying Python and creating a simple chat bot. Consider I have a module with main function:And consider there is an another module where i want to access  from bot module, but function from this module gets invoked some time after  module got invoked:And when I try to access  that should be in  object I get and error saying there is no  in . But if I run in debug mode over  module I can clearly see that  contains object. But when  function from  is invoked it doesn't know that there were a  in . The problem here in my opinion is that var  from  gets initialized after  and  had finished working but module itself gets imported into  before that.What am I doing wrong (probably missing something about variable scope) and how can I get my  initialized in when  is invoked?Thanks in advance!
You could use a property, so that the  attribute is automatically initialised when it is first accessed:
