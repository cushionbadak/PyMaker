I am writing a program that prompts for the name of the directory and then saves all the file names in a list. How can I get a path to a specific directory obly knowing its name?I tried  but it would only show me my current dir, where the file with the program is, not the searchable dir.
 is a special variable in python that includes the current file's path. If understand your question correctly, then all you need is to pass the variable where you have stored user input from the prompt in place of . So you will have something like:This is good as a learning exercise, but note that to get a list of files in a directory the preferred method would be to use os.listdir.
