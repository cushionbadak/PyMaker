Looking at your code, it looks like an error occurs inside of your . Unfortunately, I can only assume at the moment, that the error happens during the  call.Your  is always execute, even if an error occurred.To diagnose this further: Can you add a  to your  and print the error?If you see an error like , then you probably named your python script . Rename it and delete the 'curses.pyc' file.
