I am trying to dig deeper and climbing higher in learning Python.In attempting to learn everything about the  module, I am having problems exploring every corner of it.In the online documentation and in , it introduces 9 specialized container datatypes, see8.3. collections â€” Container datatypes:Compared to that list, there are 26 others not specified in the documentation and with only very limited detail in the  output:Is it necessary to invest time to explore the other 26?
You are looking at the  exported list of globals of the module. This list is larger than just the documented objects for two reasons. The first is that it includes submodules; in this case  is listed here as .The second is that there are objects added for backwards compatibility; the extra names come from the  submodule. Once upon a time that module didn't exist and those objects lived in  itself before being moved. Names from that module are imported into  to accommodate code that still imports from the old location. This is documented on the page you linked:Changed in version 3.3: Moved Collections Abstract Base Classes to the  module. For backwards compatibility, they continue to be visible in this module as well.So of those 26, one is a submodule of , , and the remaining 25 objects are explicitly there to support backwards compatibility of names moved to the  module.If you want to learn about the other objects, then you'll find they are documented in their own location. Use  or the  module documentation.
