I'm trying to test if a simple list of urls exists, the code works when I'm just testing one url, but when I try add a array of urls, it's breaks. Any idea what i'm doing wrong? Single URL CodeBroken Array Code
The problem is not that you do it as an array, it is that one of your urls (www.fakeniallweb.com) has a different problem than your other urls.I think because the DNS cannot be resolved, you cannot request the HEAD as you do. So you need an additional check other than just checking for response code 200.Maybe you could do something like this:Honestly I suspect you will find other cases where a website returns different status codes. For example a website might return something in the 3xx range for a redirect, or a 403 if you cannot access it. That does not mean the website does not exist.Hope this helps you on your way!
@Dries De RydtThanks for your help , it was a unresolved dns error causing it to crash out. I ended up Lib/socket.pysolutionThanks for all the help.
