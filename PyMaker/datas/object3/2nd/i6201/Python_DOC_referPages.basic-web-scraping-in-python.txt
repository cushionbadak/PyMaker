I only get the first day. This is my first project and I am stuck.The URL I have:https://crossfit.com/workout/2017/11/04The URL I am trying to get:https://crossfit.com/workout/2017/11/03And so on.Here is my actual code:
The easiest way to scrape this site involves  math. If you need more resources, Google and the documentation are your friends.
I would recommend taking a look at the BeautifulSoup python library. You must install the module on your computer, but it is probably the most widely used and most user-friendly web scraping library. Additionally it has a large amount of documentation as well, and plenty of examples since so many people use it.Hope it helps. good luck.
