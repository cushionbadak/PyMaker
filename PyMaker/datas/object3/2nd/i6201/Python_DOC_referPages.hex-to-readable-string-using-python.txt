Natural Text
When I'm executing the following query:It gives me below result:When I modified my query like this I'm getting the result as shown in the picture:used this URL for conversion: https://codebeautify.org/hex-string-converterThe above URL does not give me correct desired result. So I used, Python.This is my python code to convert to a readable format:I'm getting the result as:How can I make the string readable ( I wanted to read plain English chars)?
You mangled the bytes value by passing it to .By passing your  object through  here, you produced a representation of the bytes object. That a representation is a string too is coincidental.You can, at best, decode the bytes to text with the decode method:I used Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1) to decode the data, because it is probably not ASCII data. Most ASCII text doesn't use NULL or SI (shift-in) bytes, to begin with. ASCII will work too, but as soon as you have any data outside of the 0x00-0x7F range you'll get an error instead.The hex string converter you found includes the NULL and SI bytes too, but they are not printable so your browser doesn't show them. If you use  then most likely your terminal won't show them either:
Try :Of course, you could also change your query to not hex encode the field:which seems a better solution.
