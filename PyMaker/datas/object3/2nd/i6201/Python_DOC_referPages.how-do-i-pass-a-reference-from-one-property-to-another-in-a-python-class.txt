This'd seem like a fit for a descriptor, which the field  is also:which is why it returns an  when accessed through a  instance instead of the field itself. Start by defining one suitable for your use case:or justThen define your original class:Test:For extra credit and if you're using a recent enough version of Python you can use  to remove the need to duplicate the name, without having to resort to a meta class:and then define C as:
