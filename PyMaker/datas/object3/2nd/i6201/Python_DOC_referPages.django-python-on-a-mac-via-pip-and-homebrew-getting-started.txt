I am trying to get started with  Web Programming with , so I installed  first (via ) and now the latest version of , but the following happens, which I have no idea what is wrong or what I should do next. Could someone please help me understand what is going on + what I need to do + what commands I should issue to resolve this, etc...?
This is probably because your user account doesn't have some permissions regarding the  folder.Use Alternative wayYou might also use which installs Django following the user installation scheme. This page says: This scheme is designed to be the most convenient solution for users that don’t have write permission to the global site-packages directory or don’t want to install into it... Files will be installed into subdirectories of site.USER_BASE.However, I think that what you are doing isn't considered best practices.
