I have the following code snippet. What i need to code that when i click the button i need the frame color to change one by one from the list of colors defined. 
You can use the  iterator from itertools for this.One thing I need to mention: please avoid doing "star" imports. When you doit puts 135 Tkinter names into your namespace; in Python 2 you get 175 names. This creates needless clutter in the namespace and it can cause name collisions: if you accidentally name one of your variables with one of the imported names that can lead to mysterious bugs. It's even worse when you do star imports with multiple modules since they can stomp over each others' names. Also, star imports make the code harder to read since you have to remember which names are defined locally and which are imported.
I would change your app to a class so you can store variables and access them easily, also I bound the enter key to the entry widget so that works too. This way when you create an  of  it is an  of a  root, but you don't have to call it root
@PM 2Rings answer is cleaner but since I was working on this I thought I'd still post it incase you wanted to implement it manually
