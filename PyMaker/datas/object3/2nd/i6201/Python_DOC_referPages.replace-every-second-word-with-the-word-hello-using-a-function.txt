Im new to python and programming. I have been given a task to complete that asks the following question:Create your own function that takes in a sentence and replaces every second word with the word “Hello”my approach was to separate the sentence into odd and even lists of words and then print the odd list with the word hello following it.I attempted this and all I can manage to do is to separate every second character and not every second word.any thoughts or suggestions on my code.
Although Jan's answer is beautiful and succinct and is what should be used, here is an example using the same approach you attempted.
Use a list comprehension:The key point here is to use the  function and the modulo operator ().As @darksky points out in the comment section, this might be hard to grasp when trying to learn . Instead you could very well use a longer function likeWhich prints out exactly the same.
You might find this easier to understand. You can simply create a new sentence object and populate it with words.
Take in the sentence. Use the split method to create a list. Then loop over the list with using enumerate which creates a counter. If the remainder of the counter (generated from enumerate) is 0 then replace the word at that index.You'll need to join the list again after the function and print it out 
Two simple changes will save your given code.  First, you want to step through the words of the input sentence, rather than the individual elements (characters).  Drop the line , because this divides your input into characters.  Instead,  the list at spaces (the default).This will give you output like:Now, just add spaces to your  command:To get:Now, you still have one problem: you're missing a final "hello" for sentences with an even number of words.  I'll let you deal with that, since you already know how to use the modulus command.  You might want to recover your original input saving withAlso note that you can drop  entirely; you're wasting effort, since you never use it.  You can ignore those words.
