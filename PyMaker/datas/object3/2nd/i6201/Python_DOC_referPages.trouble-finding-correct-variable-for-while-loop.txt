so im looking for the correct variable that will end the while loop once the loop reaches the end of the file. Here is my code so far:Lets say that my file that i opened looks like this:I need the loop to end as soon as it reads the last line, heres some pseudocode:Hopefully thats clear, i appreciate your help.
Use a for loop instead:From the Tutorial - Reading and Writing FilesIf you are forced to use a while loop: will return an empty string when it reaches the end of the file so you can make the sentinel an empty string.Before the while loop read a lineUse  in the while loop conditionAt the bottom of the loop, read another line.Even though there may be empty lines in the file, those lines should still contain an end-of-line character like  so it won't be an empty string.
As stated above, a for loop is the simplest and best way to read from a file. Unlike Java or C, where you could easily craft a condition for a while loop that remains true only while there is still content left to be read from the file, it is more awkward to do so in Python. Files in Python expose an iterator, thus you can iterate over them using a for loop (most natural). You could also use the built-in next() method, as such: 
Of course this isn't optimal but to use a while loop use the Function I have in the comments:
