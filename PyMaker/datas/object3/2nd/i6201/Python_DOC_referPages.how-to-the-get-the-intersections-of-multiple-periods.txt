Psudo code: and  represent datetime objectsThis "picture" shows after "Intersection" the values I need to calculate:How do I calculate these intersections?I'm coding in python, but answers in any programming language are welcome,as I only need to understand the algorithm
Step 0: Make a  class for convenience:Step 1: Make a function that calculates the intersection between two ranges. This function will work for anything that consists of two comparable points:Step 2: Make a function that finds all intersections of two sets of ranges, by just trying all possible combinations.Step 3:  a list of sets of ranges using :I'm using integers for simplicity, but it should work just as good with  objects:
I'm coding in python, but answers in any programming language are welcome, as I only need to understand the algorithmIf you just want the pseudocode, one algorithm would be:For implementing intersections, there are a few different methods. One is to use set function, although you have to convert to sets, and then if you don't want a set as output you have to convert back: . Another method is list comprehension:
