I have the following program: With the output: My objective is to combine the elements gene (binary vector), from the binary_list with the last two elements of each item in the random_pool list, so the correct outcome would be: I know there is something wrong with the loops, but I tried many things already and I couldn't get the result I wanted. Can anyone tell what am I doing wrong or hot to fix it?Thank you! 
This is the version of your function that will give the expected results:In your original code the loop iterates ones through  for every element in  - that was not necessary and produced the repeated outcome. Note that the variables , , and  are redundant here - you could achieve the same result without creating them. Do you need them for something else?
A more pythonic solution would be to zip the lists, so that you can iterate over the  and  at the same time and don't have to use indexes. You can also unpack the pool in this way: . The  will unpack the first items into the variable  which is often used for unneeded values, and the last two are unpacked into the variables  and .With a list comprehension or a generator expression, you can reduce the function even more.
