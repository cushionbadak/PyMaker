You can use os.listdir(path) to get all the files in a directory, and os.path.join(directory, fileName) to get the entire path to a file. Then use a loop like "for fileName in os.listdir(directory):" to loop through all the file in the directory. You may want to add a check to ensure you are only operating on JPG files. Inside the loop, use your already written code as a start. I wouldn't overwrite the existing images, unless you have them backed up somewhere.
To iterate through the files matching a specific pattern you can use globs in pathlib. Here's an example that identifies all of the files with a  extension in all sub directories.
