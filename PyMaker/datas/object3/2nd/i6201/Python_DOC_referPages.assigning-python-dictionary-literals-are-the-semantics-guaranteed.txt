Simple question:So it seems that if I assign a dictionary literal with a duplicate key to a variable it is the second key/pair that is used, at least for this particular python version.Is this behaviour guaranteed?
From the Dictionary displays documentation:If a comma-separated sequence of key/datum pairs is given, they are evaluated from left to right to define the entries of the dictionary: each key object is used as a key into the dictionary to store the corresponding datum. This means that you can specify the same key multiple times in the key/datum list, and the final dictionaryâ€™s value for that key will be the last one given.(Bold emphasis mine).So yes, that is guaranteed. All Python implementations must adhere to this, deviation from the above specification would be a bug.Older Python version documentation have not always included that last sentence, but the order of evaluation has always been explicit.
