Natural Text
I'm trying to make a code that checks if there is a path in a maze from the first coordinate to the last represented by a matrix. I'm also trying to use queues. Here is the code I have so far:What can I add to the end in order to get an output of "Yes" (if there is a path) and "No" if there isn't one?Here is a sample of the text file containing a matrix.I tried adding this at the end. I run my code and it says "'int' object is not iterable" 
There are a couple of problems with your code.Firstly, you need to put (row, col) tuples into the queue.Secondly, you need to change the order of the logic in your `if tests. First test that the new row or column index is inside the matrix, and then test if that location contains "0".Once the whole matrix is mapped, you just need to test if the last location in the matrix is equal to "0".Here's a repaired version of your code.outputNow see if you can print the path through the maze.Hint: start at  and work backwards.BTW, you should probably use a  for this task instead of a , which is normally used when your program uses threading.
