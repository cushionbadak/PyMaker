If I have string "axplpett" I would like to return true, because a substring of it "axplpe" contains all of the letters of apple. I was thinking of using the set method, but apple has repeating characters.
Simply this?

Maybe this:-
You can easily do this with a Counter.We subtract the count of letters in the target string 'apple' from the count of letters in the test string 'axplpett'. Any letters in the target string that aren't in the test string will result in negative counts for those letters. We then negate that result, which strips off positive or zero counts, the resulting counter will be empty if the target string is contained within the test string.output
