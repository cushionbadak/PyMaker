What I would like to do is to parse an expression such this one:Where A and B are columns of a dataframe. So I would have to parse the expresion like this in order to get the result:Where  is the dataframe.I have tried with  but it would be good only to replace the column variables (not the functions) like this:So, my questions are:Is there a python library to do this? If not, how can I achieve this in a simple way?Creating a recursive function could be the solution?If I use the "reverse polish notation" could simplify the parsing?Would I have to use the  module?
Pandas DataFrames do have an  function. Using your example equation:
Following the example provided by @uuazed, a faster way would be using numexprnumexpr may also have more supported operations
