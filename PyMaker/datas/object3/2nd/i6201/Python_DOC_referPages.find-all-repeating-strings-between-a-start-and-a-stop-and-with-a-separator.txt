Natural Text
I'm trying to get one or more substring from a string like this :"theSTART:param1:param2:paramN:theEND"or"theSTART:param1:theEND"or any number of parameter saparated by ":" and delimited by "theSTART:" and ":theEND".I'm using Python3 regex but I can't find the right pattern to match a variable number of items:works only for 3 items.And if I try :doesn't work as expected.
re.findall might be a solution if you want to use regular expressions instead of splitting. findall returns a list of all occurrences of a pattern. returns the list .You probably won't (or can't) find a pattern to match any number of parameters. According to the Python re module documentation is only the last match accessible, if a group matches multiple times.
Well, if your data always starts with 'theStart', ends with 'theEnd' and all fields are ':' delimited then why even fool with regex for the problem? Why not just:
Capturing everything using '.' then splitting on the delimiter should simplify things a bit. 
You can use  with a :See a demo on The link above will explain very well what each part of the  below does in detail, but if you are still not sure, try reading the  as it is very useful.which gives a  of the :N.B. there are two different smiley faces  in this which is pretty cool
