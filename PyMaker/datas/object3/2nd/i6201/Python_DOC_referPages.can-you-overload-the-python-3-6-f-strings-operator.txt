In Python 3.6, you can use f-strings like:I want to overload the method receiving the  above. Can it be done? For example, if I wanted to write a dumb wrapper around , I might expect this overloading to look something like:
Yes, but by using , not .-strings were not an overhaul of the previous methods to format strings. Instead, it built on the protocols already in place. From PEP 0498 that introduced them, in Code equivalence:The exact code used to implement f-strings is not specified. However, it is guaranteed that any embedded value that is converted to a string will use that value's  method. This is the same mechanism that  uses to convert values to strings.and then again, in Format Specifiers:Once expressions in a format specifier are evaluated (if necessary), format specifiers are not interpreted by the f-string evaluator. Just as in , they are merely passed in to the  method of the object being formatted.So, there's no new special method for them. You need to define a  method that takes the spec and returns an appropriately formatted string. As the docs on  also describe:Called by the  built-in function, and by extension, evaluation of formatted string literals and the  method, to produce a “formatted” string representation of an object.
