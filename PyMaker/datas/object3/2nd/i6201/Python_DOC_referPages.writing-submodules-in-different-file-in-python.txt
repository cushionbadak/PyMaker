I am kind of stuck in the a middle of a personal project that I am doing. I have a scenario which is just not making any sense to me nor do I know what to "call it" so I am also not finding the right answers from internet. If you can give a solution for me for the following example I would really appreciate it. I am trying to do the following:I have two classes/modules in different file(later maybe also adding inside sub directory as well). client.pyfoo.pyNow I want to call foo() by initiating client() class first. So my test.py file should look like this and it should print those values I have given when initiating client class.test.pyis this possible?
You can make this within one class, while not creating both:Then you instantiate it in tests:and call the needed method :which should return you:user1 sdf234sdf13 USA, New YorkUPDATE:In In foo.py:Now you can import your class Client somewhere in tests.Make instance:call  and it should print out what you need, but this is so weird though
To initialise a child class based on one of its parents, you can call the  methodMethod 1: in the  methodMethod 2: on specific object creationCheck out the docs for details.
