I wrote the following code:I saved the code as a file named bigger.py.Then I executed the file using the following code in the Python interpreter (Python 3.6):Python returns the following error message:As you can see, it says the file name is , while what I entered in the code is . This is so weird!
You just tried to open a file named: The  escape code is converted to an ASCII backspace character, so of course your file load has issues. This is why you always use raw strings for Windows paths (and regular expressions), to avoid this pitfall when the  precedes a character that represents an escape code (e.g. , , , , , , , , , possibly a few others I'm forgetting off-hand). Using the string  for your file (note the preceding  before the open quote) will fix the problem; in a raw string, the only escapes interpreted are when they precede the quote character itself; otherwise, backslashes are just normal characters, not escapes.
