This question already has an answer here:Python: access class property from string [duplicate]                    4 answers                I'm still a bit new to python, I'm trying to use a variable to call a a specific attribute of a class. However, I think I might be missing something. I've included an example below. Thank you for your help!
Try using :This is from the documentation:Return the value of the named attribute of object. name must be a  string. If the string is the name of one of the objectâ€™s attributes,  the result is the value of that attribute. For example, getattr(x,  'foobar') is equivalent to x.foobar. If the named attribute does not  exist, default is returned if provided, otherwise AttributeError is  raised.
