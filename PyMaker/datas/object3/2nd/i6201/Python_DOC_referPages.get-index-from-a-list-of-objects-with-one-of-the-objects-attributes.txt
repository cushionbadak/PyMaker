I have a list of objects and I'm trying to get one object's index in that list from an attribute of the object I have (e.g. name). Similar to something like the example below:Now I'm trying to get the index of 'Emp1' in the list self.employees (here '0'). I tried this here: but he tells me that 'ValueError: < filter object at 0xblabla > is not in list'. What do I have to change or is there a better option to handle this?
Well don't search for the filter itself, search for what the filter finds. For example,  instead of .But really better just use :Or you could create a list of names and ask that for the index:It's less efficient, though.
Because  returns a filter object, an approach would be converting it to a list and take the element with index 0:But, the best approach would be using :Output:
