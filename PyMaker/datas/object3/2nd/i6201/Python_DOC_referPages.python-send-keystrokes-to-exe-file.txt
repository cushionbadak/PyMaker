I need to send keystrokes to an exe using python. I can run the exe using python from subprocess asbut how can I keep the connection and keep sending keys. I don't want to read back from the exe just to send some keystrokes any suggestions 
Use  and :Interact with process: Send data to stdin. Read data from stdout and  stderr, until end-of-file is reached. Wait for process to terminate.  The optional input argument should be data to be sent to the child  process, or None, if no data should be sent to the child. If streams  were opened in text mode, input must be a string. Otherwise, it must  be bytes.communicate() returns a tuple (stdout_data, stderr_data). The data  will be strings if streams were opened in text mode; otherwise, bytes.Note that if you want to send data to the processâ€™s stdin, you need to  create the Popen object with stdin=PIPE. Similarly, to get anything  other than None in the result tuple, you need to give stdout=PIPE  and/or stderr=PIPE too.
