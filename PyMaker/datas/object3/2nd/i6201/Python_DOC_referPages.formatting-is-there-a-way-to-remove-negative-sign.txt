I understand that there is approximation when it comes to trigonometric functions. But is there any way to remove the negative sign for sin of 360.The sin x column is the middle one. I don't want to create a special case for when degrees = 360 and tell it to print 0.0000 for sin(360).My code
What's happened is that  is returning a very small, negative float value (). To format a small negative float as positive 0, you can first round it to exactly negative 0, then add 0 so it becomes positive 0:Output
 will do the trick. It returns the absolute value of a number.More about built in functions and abs():https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#abs
