I have a dictionary of items, where the list is formatted to be {(x,y): z, (x,y):z...} where x and y are coordinates and z is a probability. I need to perform operations using the probability. How can I access those?I tried things like However, that only returned the y coordinate. Attempting to print item[2] returned the error "Need more than 2 values to unpack"
As you are using a dictionary, python can retrieve both names and values individually. For example for:Therefore for you to perform calculations on the probabilities you need to do:each item will output the values of your dictionary in sequence.
First, you do not have a lit, that is a dict, so you can access z by using coordinates as key:In a for loop:I recommend you do not use the name list for this cause it is a built-in
For item in list is getting one item at a time. So how can you access second item. Here is an example I made for you. Let say here is your dictionary d where coordinates 10,20 has prob 0.1 and 20,30 has prob 0.2 
You can use this:or this: But you may be better off using a true   instead of a . It's also best to avoid giving your variables names that match built-in Python components like . So then you'd have something like this:
If what you present us here is indeed your data structure  then you should iterate and unpack it in another fashion than you do:See DocumentationIf you want a list of tuples, you could transform it easily with In your version, you unpack the keys of the dictionary, which are a  of an  and a  coordinate.  references the  coordinate (python has -based indexing), which is not, what you want.
