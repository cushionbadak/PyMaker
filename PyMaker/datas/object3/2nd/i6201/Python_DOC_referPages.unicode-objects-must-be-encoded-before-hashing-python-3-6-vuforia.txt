I'm trying to get my targets from vuforia's API, but I can't pass the last value of the header "Authorization" which is an encoded data, the error that I'm getting is this:Unicode-objects must be encoded before hashingthis is in try snippet of the code, I'm following the vuforia's documentation but still, something is wrong with my code and I don't have a clue what it is
Looking into your  function, this particular call is the cause:Since that is the  function from the  library, that requires the input to be byte instead of string/unicode (check out the documentation on hmac which refers to hashlib for its  signature).So it seems like the fix is simply:Note that you'll need to change the return value of  () to string again since you're concatenating it with a string in .(I'm assuming a Python 3 code even though you have a check for Python 2 in your code by the way, since you've tagged this Python 3).
