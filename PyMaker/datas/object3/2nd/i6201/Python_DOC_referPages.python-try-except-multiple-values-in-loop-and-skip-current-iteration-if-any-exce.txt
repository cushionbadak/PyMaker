I'm converting values to float from multiple columns in a dataset concurrently in a loop, where I try to skip bad rows with a ValueError exceptionMy data has been loaded with a structure that enables me to loop over it as suchI want the exception to encompass both A and B, so that if any of them contains a bad row, all of them will be skipped for this i, so that . Right now, I can only figure out how to skip bad rows on an individual-column basis, but then I end up with floated columns of different lengths.How can this be done?
If I understand you correctly, you want to gather 'good' (floated) rows in data structures  and  respectively during iteration through . If so, try putting the former data structures outside the loop, and check whether values can be converted into floats before putting them into lists. Otherwise, value A may be convertible while value B not, which would result in different lengths of  and . To sum it up, try the following code:
Use can use the  clause which runs if no exception occurs.  and convert, don't do any appending there and, if no errors occur, you append in the  clause:I removed the parentheses around the  since they aren't necessary.
