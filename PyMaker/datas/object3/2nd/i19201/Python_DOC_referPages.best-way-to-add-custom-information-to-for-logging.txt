I've been reading the Python logging documentation, and its certainly has a lot of functionality...for everything.The problem I'm facing is that I'm not Dutch and so I'm not sure what the right way to do this is.I am running events in a simulator, and I would like to prefix every log message with the timestamp of the simulated time (probably with a length formatter too, just to keep it looking good). I could change this in a subclass of  or , but I don't think that is the right way.I think the right way is to use a  or a . Is this right, and if so, which one should I prefer?
Surely if you just need to prefix every log message with the timestamp, all you need to do is provide an appropriate format string for a formatter? As mentioned here in the documentation.Update: A  would be more appropriate for situations where contextual information is moderately long-lived. For example, in a network server application which handles multiple client connections, the connection details (e.g. client IP address) might be useful context, so you would create a  instance when a new client connection was created. This doesn't sound like your simulation scenario.A , on the other hand, could be used if you could use it to get the simulation time, e.g.and then add  in your 's format string.Alternatively, if you know the simulation time whenever you make a logging call, you could just do e.g.and likewise have  in your 's format string.
