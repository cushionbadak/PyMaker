I have been reviewing the tutorial for file management in Python 3 but it doesn't mention how to create a file if one doesn't exist. How can I do that?
Just open the file in write mode:Note that this will clobber an existing file. The safest approach is to use append mode:As mentioned in this answer, it's generally better to use a  statement to ensure that the file is closed when you have finished with it.
Just  the file in  mode, and it will be created it.If you want to open an existing file if possible, but create a new file otherwise (and don't want to truncate an existing file), read the paragraph in your link that lists the modes. Or, for complete details, see the  reference docs. For example, if you want to append to the end instead of overwriting from the start, use .
A new file is only created in write or append modes.In shell:
Of course.
There are two types of files you can make. a text and a binary.to make a text file just use .to make a binary file you first , then to put data (like lists numbers ect..) in them you will need to use 'wb' and  to take out you will need to use 'rb' and  and give that a variable becuase that is how you refrence the data.Here is a exaple:note that if such a file exists it will be writen over.
