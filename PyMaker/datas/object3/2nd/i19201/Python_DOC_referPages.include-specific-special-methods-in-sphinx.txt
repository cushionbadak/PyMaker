I have a bunch of classes which use "special-methods":now I would like to generate html documentation for this using Sphinx and autodoc.  How do I tell Sphinx to document ?  I tried adding to , but that also included  which I definitely don't want.  Currently, the relevant portions of the  file look like:edit adding does add documentation of that method, but in a separate section -- Not as part of the  class documentation.
You can add:To the  file in order to show special members, except  and 
What worked for me is adding the ".. automethod:: methodName"directive in the docstring of the class, instead of doing it in the .rst file.So, you can change "Foo docstring" to
The special-members option now takes arguments (this is a new feature in Sphinx 1.2). So this should work:
I'm currently not 100% thrilled with this solution, so I hope someone can come along an improve it.  However, the way I've solved this problem is to do the following:Here I actually need to tell  to avoid documenting the class attributes (automatically) and then I need to add them back on explicitly.  The reason is because apparently when you explicitly nest commands, the explicit ones come first.  If I only explicitly say to add , then it shows up before the attributes which I didn't like.
