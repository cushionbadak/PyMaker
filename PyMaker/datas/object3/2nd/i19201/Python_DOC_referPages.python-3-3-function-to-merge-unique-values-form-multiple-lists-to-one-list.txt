I am pretty new to Python..I am trying to write a function that will merge unique values in separate lists into one list.  I keep getting a result of a tuple of lists.  Ultimately I would like to have one list of unique values from my three lists -a,b,c.  Can anyone give me a hand with this?I am getting a Tuple of Lists
You may just need sets:
If you don't care about them being in the original order, the easiest and likely fasted way is to use set functions:If you do care about the original order (sets happen to preserve it in this case, but aren't guaranteed to), then you can fix your original attempt by realising that the argument  contains a tuple of all of the original lists you passed in. This means that iterating over it gets you each of those lists one at a time, rather than the elements in them - you can fix this by using the itertools module:Also, you would want  to start out as an empty list rather than a copy of the input lists.

Handling a Dynamically Generated List of ListsA common use case is generating a list of lists dynamically, with each child list sometimes having an arbitrary length:If you're working with a list of lists, simply summing them as proposed by g.d.d.c. doesn't work. That is:The hiccup comes from the fact that you have to specifically reference the lists , , and . The answer by Ivc is really nice and gets us closer:But again, you have to explicitly reference your lists.The SolutionTo get the unique values from a list of lists with arbitrary lengths, you can use positional expansion:Which will return the appropriate values unordered (e.g. )
