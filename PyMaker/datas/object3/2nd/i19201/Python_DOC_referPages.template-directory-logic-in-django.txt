I've been fooling around with templates for some time now, and I am loving every moment of the django experience. However, since django is such a big fan loose coupling, I wanted to know, why not have this piece of code:instead of:Would not the first example follow the philosophy of loose coupling better than the second (which I believe it does), and if so, why does django default to the second code example and not the first?
You ask, "why does django default to the second code example?" but in Django 1.5, when I runI find that  contains:so I am not sure where your example code is coming from: it's not Django's default.On non-Windows systems it would be very rare to find backslashes in directory names, so your second example is likely to work in all practical cases. If I had to bullet-proof it I would write:(Using the names  and  to make it clear what I intend.)
