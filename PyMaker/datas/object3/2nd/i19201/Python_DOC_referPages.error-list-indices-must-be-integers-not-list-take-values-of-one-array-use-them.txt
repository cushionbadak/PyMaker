The above is my code. What I want to do is to create an array  which takes in the indice of any item with  in.It does get all the values I want i.e all the indices with the value  but when I try to delete the values from a different array with the indices, it returns the error list indices must be integers, not list.  is the array I want to get the index values contains strings of numbers contains is a list of strings which I want to use the values taken from  and use the values as indexes to delete those values in  Where have I gone wrong?I'm guessing its something at
You are right.The error is because, in is a . As  is , the value will always be a .This can be verified by:As for your algorithm, try this, an easier to understand version.To get the indexes, just do:Which will return a list of indexes if  exists, else it returns an empty list.
Your intuition is right.Here each  is one of the values in the  dictionary you've been populating in the above loop. But what are these values? Well,  would indicate that each one of these values is a .Therefore this code breaks due to your not keeping track of your types:
From what I can tell,  is a list, or a collection at least that can be enumerated, in which case, you can possibly convert it to a  which is all you need to do to remove duplicates.However, if this is not the case (I can not tell since you have not provided that segment of code) then you could go about the whole thing in a better way:From your updated Question, I think that you are trying to do something else than what it seems your question is about. I think you are trying to delete every index in  where the corresponding index in  has a value of  if this is the case:
