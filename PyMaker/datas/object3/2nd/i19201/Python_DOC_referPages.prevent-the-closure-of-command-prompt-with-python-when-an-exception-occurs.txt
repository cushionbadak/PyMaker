The INPUT data is a text file where the delimiter need to be valid following this function:When the delimiter is not valid (ex: a dot) i am looking for two solution in a Python elegant way:Until the right INPUT data is not load you can not pass to OUTFILEorThe script break the code, show the error, but the windows (when is a*.exe) doesn't close immediately leaving the user without an explanationwith this solution (break) the Window of my *.exe file close leaving the user without an explanation
You are not really searching for a delimiter, just a character in a string. You should really use the CSV module for this.
You can hook the exception handler for uncaught exceptions using , and have it call  (or  in 3.x) as per this answer.For a quick example:Just modify that to have whatever output or whatever you want (I suggest looking into the  module).But if you want it more specific to your code, then just put  in the solution you already have, and it should be fine. The above should provide a more general solution.
