Is there a reference somewhere defining precisely when enclosing tuples with parentheses is or is not required?  Here is an example that surprised me recently:
The combining of expressions to create a tuple using the comma token is termed an .  The rules of operator precedence do not cover expression lists; this is because expression lists are not themselves expressions; they become expressions when enclosed in parentheses.So, an unenclosed  is allowed anywhere in Python that it is specifically allowed by the language grammar, but not where an  as such is required.For example, the grammar of the if statement is as follows:Because the production  is referenced, unenclosed s are not allowed as the subject of the  statement.  However, the for statement accepts an :So the following is allowed:
Anywhere you are allowed to use the  term, you do not need to use parenthesis.The  statement requires an , and does not support an .Examples of syntax that does allow :The  statement expressionsassignment(including augmented assignment)The  statement.Grepping the Expressions, Simple and Compound statements documentation for  will tell you all locations that  is used in the Python grammar.
Parentheses are also required when you want to avoid ambiguity.The following are two different expressions... just because something is an 'expression list', doesn't result in the expression list you might expect :)
