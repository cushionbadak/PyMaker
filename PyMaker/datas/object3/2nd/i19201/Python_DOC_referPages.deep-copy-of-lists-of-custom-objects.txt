Say I have a list of applications, described as a custom object.  I decided to do a deepcopy of the original application list, so that I could have one list that acts like a pool of available applications.  To assign applications, I randomly select a subset of the pool, and then find those applications in the original list, so that I can update their info. Then, assigned applications are removed from the pool.  But, for some reason, the applications can never be found in the original list:The above code will actually return a ValueError that a item in selected_apps can't be found.  Is the error due to the fact that I'm making deep copies of lists that contain objects that aren't native to Python, or something else?
When using  it uses comparison operator () to check whether the items are the same, which in turn uses  method, from documentation:User-defined classes have  and  methods by default; with them, all objects compare unequal (except with themselves) and  returns an appropriate value such that  implies both that  and .You can demonstrate this by:In CPython  returns memory address of an object, so  returns true if ids match:So you just need to implement  method and :There are no implied relationships among the comparison operators. The truth of  does not imply that  is false. Accordingly, when defining , one should also define  so that the operators will behave as expected.Also notice this:If a class does not define an  method it should not define a  operation either; if it defines  but not , its instances will not be usable as items in hashable collections.
