I have been set a simple task:Write a program for a game where the computer generates arandom starting number between 20 and 30.The player and the computer can remove 1,2 or 3 from the numberin turns. Something like this...Starting number : 25How many do you want to remove? 322 leftComputer removes 220 leftThe player who has to remove the last value to bring the numberdown to 0 is the loser.1 leftComputer removes 1You win!I am trying to create it so that the player can only enter numbers 1, 2 or 3 to remove.I get the syntax error of invalid syntax where the if statement is:Any help would be greatly appreciated, I am only a beginner to python as you can probably tell.
 should be
You need to re-order those statements:python's  operator requires an object or expression on both the left and the right.  As you've written it, you have another operator on the right which is illegal.  also,  isn't a python operator.  It is .
  is not a legal expression. Use:This makes use of chained comparison operators; it roughly means the same as:but  is evaluated only once, and we made it clearer that the number is outside the range 1 - 3.You probably wanted to use a  loop instead, to keep asking for a correct number:
your  statement only needs sligthly tweaking. Try:Hope that helps
There are several errors:Your instructions are inconsistent. The only whole integer that is Between 1 and 3 is 2. But surely that is not what you meant. You meant Enter either 1, 2 or 3. You have the syntax of the greater than backward. It should be  read personremove is greater than 3.You cannot just add on  after the , you must again state what variable should be related to . This will work  if personremove < 1 or personremove > 3:There are also better ways to code this in general. Putting this section into a loop, for example.
