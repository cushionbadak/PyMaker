I'm trying to connect to a SQL Server 2012 database using SQLAlchemy (with pyodbc) on Python 3.3 (Windows 7-64-bit).  I am able to connect using straight pyodbc but have been unsuccessful at connecting using SQLAlchemy.  I have dsn file setup for the database access.I successfully connect using straight pyodbc like this:For sqlalchemy I have tried:The  method doesn't actually set up the connection and succeeds, butiIf I try something that causes sqlalchemy to actually setup the connection (like ), it takes a while but then returns this error:I'm not sure where thing are going wrong are how to see what connection string is actually being passed to pyodbc by sqlalchemy.  I have successfully using the same sqlalchemy classes with SQLite and MySQL.Thanks in advance!
The file-based DSN string is being interpreted by SQLAlchemy as server name = , database name = .I prefer connecting without using DSNs, it's one less configuration task to deal with during code migrations.This syntax works using Windows Authentication:Or with SQL Authentication:SQLAlchemy has a thorough explanation of the different connection string options here.
I have an update info about the connection to MSSQL Server without using DSNs and using Windows Authentication. In my example I have next options:My local server name is "(localdb)\ProjectsV12". Local server name I see from database properties (I am using Windows 10 / Visual Studio 2015).My db name is "MainTest1"It is needed to specify driver in connection.You may find your client version in:control panel>Systems and Security>Administrative Tools.>ODBC Data  Sources>System DSN tab>AddLook on SQL Native client version from the list.
In Python 3 you can use function  from module  to create parameters for connection:In order to use Windows Authentication, you want to use Trusted_Connection as parameter:In Python 2 you should use function  from library  instead:
Just want to add some latest information here:If you are connecting using DSN connections:If you are connecting using Hostname connections:For more details, please refer to the "Official Document"
