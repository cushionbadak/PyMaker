I am working with python. I want to know whether or not any method is existed or not in same module. I think  does this but I couldn't do. Here is sample code saying what really I want to do with.My main task is to dynamically call defined method. If it is not defined, just skip operations with that method and continue. I have a dictionary of data from which on the basis of keys I define some necessary methods to operate on corresponding values. for e.g. data is  . Now I define a method called  which I wanted to know dynamically it really exists or not.

You can use dir,
