I'm confused by the following Python 2.7 and Python 3.3 behavior in String formatting. This is a nitpicky detail question about how the comma operator interacts with string presentation types.What's confusing me is why the  variant works, the one with no explicit string presentation type. The docs say that if you omit the type, it's "The same as ." And yet here it is acting differently from .I'd dismiss this as just a wrinkle / corner case, but this syntax is used as an example in the docs: . Are there other "special" behaviors hidden in Python when the string presentation type is omitted? Maybe instead of "same as s" what the code is really doing is inspecting the type of the thing being formatted?
In your example, you aren't interacting with string presentation types; you are interacting with  presentation types.  Objects can supply their own formatting behavior by defining a  method.  As noted in PEP 3101:Presentation type  is understandably not implemented by  objects (see the lists of documented presentation types per object type here). The exception message is somewhat misleading. Without the , the problem is clearer:
Refer PEP 378 -- Format Specifier for Thousands Separator The ',' option is defined as shown above for types 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g',  'E', 'G', '%', 'F' and ''. To allow future extensions, it is undefined  for other types: binary, octal, hex, character, etc
