My question is about coding style: When I want to apply a procedure to several variables, like:These are 20 lines of almost the same code.Is there a way to write the conversions (  ) in fewer lines?Putting them in an iterable does not work:
Do you really need them to be in separate variables to begin with? That's usually a code smell. I'd keep them in a list, or a dict if the names are significant, and update that:
This will run a list comprehension on the  tuple, which contains your parameters to the  function. For each parameter in that tuple, the result of the  function is passed to the  function. The results are collected in a list.So  corresponds to the result for the parameter value  etc.In your code it didnâ€™t work because you were locally overwriting the  variable within the loop. This will not change the item in the original list. If you wanted to create a (new) list from those results, you could use :
