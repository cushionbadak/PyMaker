here's my code from python2 which needs to be ported:with above code, I can get the whole exception with the problematic input file by checking whether an exception has 'filename' attribute.however python3's raise has been changed. this is what 2to3 gave me for above code:which gives me another error and I don't think filename attribute is preserved: What I just want is passing exceptions transparently with some information to track the input file. I miss python2's  - How can I do this in python3?
You can set the  attribute:or call  directly on the old instance:However, the traceback is already automatically attached, there is no need to re-attach it, really.See the  statement documentation:A traceback object is normally created automatically when an exception is raised and attached to it as the  attribute, which is writable. In this specific case, perhaps you wanted a different exception instead, with context?This would create a chained exception, where both exceptions would be printed if uncaught, and the original exception is available as .
You don't need to do anything; in Python 3 re-raised exceptions automatically have a full traceback from where they were originally raised.This works because  sets the  attribute appropriately on catching an exception in an  statement; see http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3134/.
