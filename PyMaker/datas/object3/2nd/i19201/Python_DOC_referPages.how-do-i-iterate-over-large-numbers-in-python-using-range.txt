This question already has an answer here:range and xrange for 13-digit numbers in Python?                    9 answers                I want to iterate a large number such as 600851475143 using the range() function in Python. But whenever I run the program it gives me an OverflowError.I have used the following code - I have tried it many times but it is not working!
Use  if your indices are long numbers:Python 3's  can handle python longs as well. Simplified to your case:
Although  seems to achieve what you want, it can't handle numbers that large. You may need to use this recipe from hereCPython implementation detail: xrange() is intended to be simple and fast. Implementations may impose restrictions to achieve this. The C implementation of Python restricts all arguments to native C longs (“short” Python integers), and also requires that the number of elements fit in a native C long. If a larger range is needed, an alternate version can be crafted using the itertools module: .
don't use for, use while
