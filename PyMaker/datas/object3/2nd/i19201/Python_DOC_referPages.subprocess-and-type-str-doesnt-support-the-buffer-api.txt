You are reading binary data, not , so you need to decode the output first. If you set the  argument to , then  is automatically decoded using the result of the  method (same as for opening text files):If you use Python 3.6 or newer, you can use an explicit  argument for to the  call to specify a different codec to use, like, for example, UTF-8:If you need to use a different codec in Python 3.5 or earlier, don't use , just decode text from bytes explicitly.You were trying to split a  value using a  argument:By decoding you avoid that problem, and your  call will not have to prepend the output with  either.However, you probably just want to use the  module instead to get filesystem information:
A simpler solution of the first part of Martijn Pieters's answer is to pass the  argument to the  call.I would even simplify this to:NOTE: If file or directory names contain spaces, use  as suggested in Martijn Pieters's answer or something like the following:
Better use binascii.b2a_uu that converts binary data to a line of ASCII characters
