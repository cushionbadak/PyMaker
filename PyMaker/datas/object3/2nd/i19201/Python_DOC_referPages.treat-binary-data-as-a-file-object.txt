Here is the important part of some existing code that I'm trying to adapt for my own uses. The notable part is that  leads to a massive file and  is binary data extracted (painfully) from this giant file.  The existing code extracts the contents of an archive-like file to disk, but I need to only read these stored files from this archive (if that makes any sense).I need to use Pygame to read a few hundred mbs of data from this file, mostly as images, using methods such as .  Rather than having this code write all of the file's contents to disk and then re-reading it again in "not-binary", I'd like to directly do something like .  Does anyone know of something like this?
This is what  (in Python 2) and  in (in Python 3) are for.
