I am trying to create a hashing function with user interaction.The idea is that the user chooses which hash he/she wants (i.e. md5, sha1 and so forth) and the program does the rest. My code: is from a dictionary containing (lets say md5 is chosen)  so the string from  is .I get the error: , the error points me to the obvious:  is a string (as i declared it), my question goes: How do i convert or in other way make it useable as it is intended?
You could use :Note that the input must not contain dots or parentheses. If you want to allow the user to input  or so, you'll have to strip the parentheses first.
