At face value, the C-API function  and  obviously creates a new module object.  The official Python Documentation provides the following explanation for :Return a new module object with the name attribute set to name.  Only the moduleâ€™s doc and name attributes are filled in; the  caller is responsible for providing a file attribute. does the same thing, except it accepts a C string () as an argument for the module name, instead of a  string.Okay, so this is pretty straightforward, but...  My question is: what is the use of calling the API function ? Sure, theoretically it would be great for a situation where you want to dynamically create a new module.  But the problem is that, in practice, after creating a new module object, the only way to do anything useful to it would be to add objects (like methods, classes, variables, etc.) to the module's  attribute.  This way users of the module could import it and actually do something with it.  The problem is that the  attribute of a module is read-only:So, in practice, there's really no way to do anything useful with a dynamically created module, as far as I can see.  So what then, is the purpose of the C API function ?
The  is the constructor for module objects. It's exposed to pure Python code too, as the  method of the  class.It probably is pretty rare for user code to need to use either of those, since you usually get modules by importing them. However, the machinery used by the Python interpreter uses  to make the module objects when an import is requested.You can see this in  in the Python source:As for how to set values in a new module object, you can use regular attribute access. In Python code (rather than C), that's simple:Note that a module created this way can't be imported anywhere else unless you do some additional work. For instance, you can add it to the modules lookup dictionary, :Now other modules can import  by name.
