Use:to see how separator looks on a current OS.In your code you can use:
You can use os.sep:
 should also be mentioned as it converts  path separators into  separators on Windows. It also collapses redundant uplevel references... i.e.,  and  and  all become .  And if you are Windows, these all become .
Some useful links that will help you:os.sepos.pathos.pathsep
If you are fortunate enough to be running Python 3.4+, you can use :or, equivalently,
Do a  and then use 
You can use "os.sep "
