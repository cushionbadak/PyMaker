In Python is there a way to use the  function with file compression set to ? (that is, uncompressed)The document shows that there are many optional parameters, but none of them sets the file compression:
No, there is no way to do this with .If the lack of a relevant flag in the docs isn't sufficient evidence, you can look at the source.In particular, at line 683 you can see that it explicitly passes  if your Python has the  module, while the fallback code at line 634 doesn't pass any arguments besides  and  to the  command-line tool.This is meant to be a high-level function that makes trivial cases easier; if you want to do anything ///-specific, you can, and should, use the underlying libraries.Of course if you need this frequently, you can write your own -like wrapper (just copy the relevant code out of  and modify your copy).
