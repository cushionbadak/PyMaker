I get an error when  trying to bind a class method to a function. Why?Also, if I am unable  to modify , can I do this adaptation from within the class definition?
A simple way to do it is to wrap the function in a  inside A:
A class method in python always takes at least one argument, usually called . This example is taken from the official Python tutorial:Note that both methods, regardless of whether they are defined outside or inside of the class, take  as an argument.Edit: If you really can't change your  function, then you can do something like this:
When you call a class method this way you pass the class instance as the first parameter.When you call  what in fact happens is more like . You pass an argument to the method.
Class methods all have a first argument of the instance of the class.  So add a parameter to your function and it would work.
The initial def creates a function object named . Since it's outside any class, it's just a function that takes no arguments. The assignment  just gives the new name  to that same function object. The call , however, assumes that bar is a class method, and passes the object  as the first argument to the method (the one that you would normally call ). You could call it as a static method with  and not get the error. 
Remember that when a python class calls one of it's methods it will pass in a  argument. You need to account for that in your code:You can read all about classes in the Python DocumentationThe easiest workaround to not passing in a  that I can think of is:
