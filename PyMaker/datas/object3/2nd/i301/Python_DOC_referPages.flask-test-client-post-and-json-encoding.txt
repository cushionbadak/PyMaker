I am writing test cases for JSON endpoints in a Flask app.Just to understand what's happening, do both ways of sending a  message in the code above make sense? In particular, am I double-JSON encoding in the first case?Or, briefly, what is the difference between  and ? Is there any?
You are not double-encoding JSON, no, because  doesn't encode anything to JSON.  posts JSON,  does not.Starting from Flask 1.0, the Flask test client supports posting JSON directly, via the  keyword argument, use it to cut down on boilerplate code here:See the Testing JSON APIs section of the Flask Testing documentation chapter:Passing the  argument in the test client methods sets the request data to the JSON-serialized object and sets the content type to .Passing a dictionary to  produces a different kind of request, a  encoded request just like a  form would produce from your browser, and the  and  values would have to be accessed via the  object. Do not use it when posting JSON is needed.
