I have a csv file that looks like the following:I need to convert this into a list of dictionaries that looks like the following:I also have this CSV file of "connections" between each user based on their ids:I have been trying for hours to get this to just be a simple list of tuples that look like the following:I have tried every way of importing csv files I know, but I've never dealt with one that wants me to make a new dictionary for every entry, and i dont think ive ever dealt with one without headers like this. While I wish I could just add headers and my my life easier, it must look like the example I gave above for the rest of my code to work. Please let me know if you have any idea how to do this. Thank you!I completed this entire project of mine, but had to hardcode the mentioned dictionary and list because I simply do not know how to handle having no headers in a CSV and making them look like this. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Let's look at using the standard python  module for parsing your files.Similarly for friends,
