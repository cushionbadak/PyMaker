What would be the more pythonic way to find the largest number multiple of  but lower than an upperbound ?Practical example: is the nearest.I would do a  loop till I don't go over . What are nicer alternatives?
The simplest way is probably using :If the number has to be strictly less than , use  instead:The expression  is the floor division of  by , discarding any remainder.
You could use the modulo operationIf the upper bound has to be strictly lower than x use
This works too:
The most pythonic way I could think of would be for either python 2 or 3:
