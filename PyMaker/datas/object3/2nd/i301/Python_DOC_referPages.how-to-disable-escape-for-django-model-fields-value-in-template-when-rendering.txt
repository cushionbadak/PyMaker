I am working on one of my colleague's Django (Django 2.1.4) projects. I spent a couple of days to try to figure out how to disable auto escape for Form field's value when rendering it manually in a template.   all don't work.Here are some relative codes. Form.pyviews.py    appinfo.htmlSome tests here:LastName's value is test1: add  at the top of the template and  at the bottomresult1:  displays correctly -- Åžhaha, but input textbox shows run result -- html pagetest2: delete autoescape tag and add  filterresult2: get the same result, looks like that  filter only worked on form.field.valueAny suggestion?Thank you. 
Add the answer to here in case someone gets the same problem. Create a function to unescape all HTML entities. and then
