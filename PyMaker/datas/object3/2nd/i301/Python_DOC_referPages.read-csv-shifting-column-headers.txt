Natural Text
I am trying to read in a comma separated text file into Python with . However, Python is taking the header and shifting it over to the right by one.Data file example with less columns than I actually have: (example file with more data: https://www.dropbox.com/s/5glujwqux6d0msh/test.txt?dl=0)If I try the following (where  is the above txt file):I get this below. As you can see,  is actually above what should be the column. (Note that the value in the  column comes from data I have in the larger dataset which isn't shown in the sample subset above)I also tried , and though it does create a new index (as I'd like it to do), it also moves the  column over and names it  instead of  as it should.I've also tried the following, but still got the same result (shifted headers) How can I fix this? I just want to read in the text file and have Python set up a new index and keep the headers as is.
without fiddling with the options, like pandas just does the right thing, see the  in the doc of read_csv and csv.Sniffer.
As file.txt beeing your file that you want to read.Using:Read the file:If you take a look at your , it will be something like this:Use regular expressions to remove blank spaces:If you try to call your  now, the result will be:So, your  will be somthing like this:Just like the others, for example: 
Setting index to False solves this issue.
