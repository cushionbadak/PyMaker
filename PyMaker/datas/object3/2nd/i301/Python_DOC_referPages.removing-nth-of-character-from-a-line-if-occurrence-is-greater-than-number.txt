I take in a CSV which can have more delimiters than desired(problem with the source the CSV is downloaded from and I cannot change that)If the number of delimiters is greater than 13 (amount of columns i later print out) then I need to delete 4th delimiter(otherwise my script will give an error and printed out version is all messed up, 4th is the location extra delimiters are located)Code so far is this, I get the count, but cannot delete it. What am I doing wrong?f is one csv file out of many in a for loopThanks in advance!Raidar
The  method returns the replaced string, rather than replacing the string in-place. You should assign the returning value from  back to the  variable.Change:to:
str.replace does not modify the string.Change toFrom the docs:str.replace(old, new[, count])Return a copy of the string with all occurrences of substring old replaced by new. If the optional argument count is given, only the first count occurrences are replaced.
