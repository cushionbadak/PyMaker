I am getting a syntax error when trying to change the following code to List comprehension Initial Code:Change to List comprehension:
I assume you want to extract unique elements from 'a'. If this is what you try to do, the code below does it.Output
Your code:  does not work for two reasons:You can have only an if statement. You should combine the with a logical operator: .You cannot use  inside the list comprehesion, as you are not defined it yet, as is the result of the list comprehension you are creating. Even if you correct it as in the previous bullet, it will raise a NameError .If you want to use a list comprehension you could use set().The list comprehension collects all the elements of  which are in .  removes duplicates.  converts it back to a list.
