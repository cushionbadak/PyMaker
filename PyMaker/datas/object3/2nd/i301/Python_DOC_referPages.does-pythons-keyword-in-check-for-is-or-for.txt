What exactly does the keyword  check for in python, generally? equality, identity, something else?Example:Suppose I have two classes X and Y with different  operatorsNow I can doThis suggests a check for identity to me.But I can also dowhich suggests a check for equality. The only theory I came up with is that it first checks for identity, and if this is not the case, then check for equality. Is that correct?
Checking containment on a list is equivalent to looking for identity or equality on each element.From the documentation:For container types such as list, tuple, set, frozenset, dict, or collections.deque,  the expression  is equivalent to (With the caveat that the objects in a hash-based container, like a set, must have a hash implementation that is consistent with their definition of equality.)For user-defined container types, the behaviour of  is determined by the  method.
The true answer is that by itself,  doesn't do any test - it's up to the container (the object after  in your expression) implementation.  will actually invoke either   if it's defined, else , and return the result. How the container implements the test (identity, equality, arcane algorithm based on the moon's phase and the captain's birthdate) is the container's concerns.
