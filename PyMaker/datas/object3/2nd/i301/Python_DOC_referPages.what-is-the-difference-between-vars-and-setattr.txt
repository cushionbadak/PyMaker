After failing to use vars to change db.Model(flask-sqlalchemy) value I solved it by using  instead, but after reading doc still don't get the difference between  and . Here is what I have triedFailed in Code works fine in initing a  object , but failed in ( didn't change).Log/TestAnd I tried to print the  before , it did be modified!outputBUT When I checked in mysql, it did not workSuccessed in Then I changed to  in function .it works good in both init and modification, and the output of  is the same!
From the docs for :Objects such as modules and instances have an updateable dict attribute; however, other objects may have write restrictions on their dict attributes (for example, classes use a types.MappingProxyType to prevent direct dictionary updates).Looking through the SQLAlchemy source code (for instance, here), it is a common pattern to return a copy of  when accessed, rather than returning the  itself. So you are likely updating a copy rather than the original. Otherwise, it's possible that the dict is getting overwritten by the attributes themselves, even if the dict changes. is the correct pattern, and is more explicit.
