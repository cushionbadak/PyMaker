Natural Text
I have a string which includes encoded bytes inside it:I want to decode it, but I can't since it has become a string. Therefore I want to ask whether there is any way I can convert it into Here  is a  object which I can decode easily using to get the final result:
A simple way is to assume that all  the characters of the initial strings are in the [0,256) range and map to the same Unicode value, which means that it is a Latin1 encoded string.The conversion is then trivial:
You could use :
Based on the SyntaxError mentioned in your comments, you may be having a testing issue when attempting to print due to the fact that  is set to  in your console (and you may also find that your console does not support some of the characters you may be trying to print). You can try something like the following to set  to  and see what your console will print (just using string slice and  below to get bytes rather than the  approach that has already been suggested):
Finally I have found an answer where i use a function to cast a string to bytes without encoding.Given stringnow i take only actual encoded text inside of it and pass this to the function which convert the string to bytes without encoding its valuesSo, calling the function would convert it to bytes which then is decodedwill give the correct output
