I have a string like this  and I would like to extract  only using regular expressions. I can't find the appropriate pattern to look for.I have tried but it returns    ["'", '"', 'c', 'm']Thanks for helping!
too many unrequired and harmful symbols in your expression.Using surrounding  made  match individual characters, which explains the output you're getting.This needs a full rethink: escape the parentheses, use  to match one or more digits, and explicit  and spaces.create a group to match only digits+unit, use  to find the group and display it.
where  is:
With regular expressions:Without regular expressions: 
You could  use a capturing group which will be returned by findall:That will match: match  and 0+ times a whitespace char Capturing group Match 1+ a digit, 0+ times a whitespace char and 1+ times a-z (or use  instead of  if you want to match that literally) Close capturing group Match 0+ times a whitespace charregex101 demo | Python demoFor example:
