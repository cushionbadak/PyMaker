Natural Text
I was trying to add the parameter  (which will take an integer) with the instance variable  and wanted to print that final payment with the worker's name. But, I could not print that added total paymentI want to call the method  instead of returning anything from it, but I am confused how I can call that and pass an integer number.

I tried with below code. I updated def rise(self,int(bonus)): to def rise(self,bonus):
