See the pics belowï¼šhtml codepython output and codeThe table/array format can be easily changed when export, is there any solution to keep the table/array format intact?Part of the python code:
First, read data in from the table. You can use regular expressions or  or some other method to separate  into its component parts (e.g. a python dict or 2D list).Then, you can use python's  library to output that 2D list as a csv file, or you can look into the several python libraries that interface with MS Excel to output an Excel spreadsheet with that same data.
