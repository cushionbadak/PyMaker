Natural Text
I have a question w.r.t extracting a string, with varied len, from individual line breaks that are only demarcated by '|' and spaces. Take a look at the following linkhttp://ftp.nasdaqtrader.com/dynamic/SymDir/nasdaqlisted.txtI am trying to extract all the company symbols under the first column of the above link. However, I cant think of a logic loop that will do that and store it in a way that is easy for extraction in the future. I was hoping any pr0s may have an opinion!EDIT:Hi I understand some of your reservations. I would be very satisfied with how to think about the solution logically. 
I hope this helps your case where you directly scrape data off the text page:You can skip the first and last line of the  since they are not associated with the  you are looking for. Also,  creates a list of lines for you and you can use list index to skip the first and last lines.
Have a look at the python csv module:You just need to change the delimiter to  and it works out of the box.
