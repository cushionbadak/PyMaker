Take the list  as shown below.I have the variable  and I need to check if its value is already contained in the list. If not, an integer will be concatenated to the end of it.Examples: Now, I know I can do this with something like this, but it would only check for the first 'level' of duplicate names.Question: How can I handle all duplications in a similar manner?
Maybe is a bit elaborate, but you could use a custom child class of a list. To give you an idea:Now you could do:Apart the new  and  methods,  has all the methods of a list, and works exactly as a list. Don't bother about the counter attribute, it's there to keep track of the usernames inputed and add the correct number in case of repetitions.To have something more consistent you may need to override other methods: i'm just giving you an idea, far from writing a full working code here.You may have a look at the docs for more details on which methods you may need to override.
