Is there a way to apply the same property logic to a set of attributes in a class? For example, I want to apply the same  decorator to , , and  without having to define the property for each attribute.
Just create your own descriptor for this:Now, in action:See the Descriptor HOWTO and some more relevant documentationNote, I incorporated the possibility of  in your setter logic (your code would have raised a  on initialization of an instance, because the setter checks if ). Also note, you probably don't want to be using double-underscore name-mangling (which doesn't mean private), so I used the conventional single-underscore to denote a variable not part of the public api. Using double-underscore name-mangling complicates things here.
You could override the  and  to behave the way you want them. This way you don't need to define any private variables nor initialize any of the member variables either.
