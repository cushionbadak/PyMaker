I want to construct a class inheriting from the numpy.ndarray, so that it can do normal operations as a numpy array(+, -, *, /,...). The only thing I want to change is that the way we access the items in our Data. For example:Can anyone help me solve this? Thanks and kind regards
You are going to want to override the __getitem__ method. Here is another question which may provide some intuition: Understanding __getitem__ method. Link to the docs: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getitem__If you want to change you you set the values, you override __setitem__An example:
I think you would be better off writing your class from scratch, rather than by extending My reasons:Since you will be working with non-numeric indices, you are probably going to restrict yourself to 1-dimensional structures. Which means you will be completely ignoring all the multi-dimensional capabilities of s. comes with some restrictions such as the fact that the elements must all be of uniform byte-size. Those restrictions may not suit you.Also, you you might want to take a look at structured arrays of numpy, as they can also be indexed with non-numeric indexes (well, in a certain limited sense, actually -- please go through the examples given there).Just curious about your desired functionality and semantics: In numpy, if  and  are two 1d numpy arrays of the same length, you are allowed to compare them with . On the other hand, if  and  are two of your arrays, having the same length of , they might still be indexed differently.  might be indexed with the index values , , and , while  might be indexed with values , , . In both cases, the number of valid indices is , so, in a sense, both  and  are of the same length of 3. But then, would you consider it valid to compare them with ? What about the array of booleans resulting from the comparison? Would you index the boolean array with , , and , or with , , ?
