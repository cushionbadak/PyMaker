I need to created a randomly ordered list of numbers from 0 to 9999So here is my approach to do this:However this fails with the error pop index out of rangeThis is because the print statemente at a given point in the iteration gives:7288 from list of size 7288So... How can this be possible? According to the documentations randint should give me a number between 0 and len(order) -1.What am I doing wrong?
You are wrong here: "According to the documentations randint should give me a number between 0 and len(order) -1."The doc says: "random.randint(a, b). Return a random integer N such that a <= N <= b. Alias for randrange(a, b+1)."See it here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.randint
I recommend using shuffle from module random. I think this is what you need:Keep in mind that shuffle does not return the shuffled list. It is shuffeling the list you gave to it.
