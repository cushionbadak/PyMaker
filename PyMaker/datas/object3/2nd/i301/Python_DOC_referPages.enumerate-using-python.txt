I'm a new coder and am currently trying to write a piece of code that, from an opened txt document, will print out the line number that each piece of information is on. I've opened the file and striped it of all it's commas. I found online that you can use a function called enumerate() to get the line number. However when I run the code instead of getting numbers like 1, 2, 3 I get information like: 0x113a2cff0. Any idea of how to fix this problem/what the actual problem is? The code for how I used enumerate is below.
First of all, start by opening the document and already reading its content, and it's a good practice to use , as it closes the document after the use. The  function gathers all the lines (this assumes the  file is in the same folder as your  one:After, use enumerate to add index to the lines, so you can read them, use them, or even save the indexes:As last point, if you have breaklines on your , the lines will contain a , and you can remove them with the , if you need. The full code would be:
Taking your problem statement:trying to write a piece of code that, from an opened txt document, will print out the line number that each piece of information is onYou're using  incorrectly as @roganjosh was trying to explain:
The way you're doing it now, you're not removing the commas. The  method without arguments only deletes whitespaces leading and trailing the line. If you only want the data, this would work:
You can use the  function to enumerate a list. This will return a list of tuples containing the index first, then the line string. Like this:Your  is a list of the lines, so it might be a good idea to name it accordingly.
