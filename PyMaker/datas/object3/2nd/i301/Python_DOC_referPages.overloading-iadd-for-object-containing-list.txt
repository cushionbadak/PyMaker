The following is a class which is designed to hold a list, and add to the list any new values that are provided to it (as well as being able to print the list):The function  is only present for testing purposes.This issue that this was presenting was that the two functions of the object,  and  did not behave the same. Or so I thought...In reality, the two functions mentioned above do produce the same result, but  and  produce different results.Example run:As you can see, the  operation turns the  instance of  into a , thus (obviously) removing the value contained within.It was my understanding that  and the  operator should behave the same, but it would seem not. Can  be implemented here to update the behaviour of  appropriately here, or is there an issue with this type of operation?
 must return the updated object (which can be ):You didn't return anything, so , the default return value, was used instead.From the  documentation:These methods should attempt to do the operation in-place (modifying self) and return the result (which could be, but does not have to be, self). [...]  For instance, if  is an instance of a class with an  method,  is equivalent to .Bold emphasis mine; note the  equivalence.
