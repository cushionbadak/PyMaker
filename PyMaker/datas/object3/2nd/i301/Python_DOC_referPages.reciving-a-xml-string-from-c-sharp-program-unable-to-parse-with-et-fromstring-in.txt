I have a C# program that sends an XML string as this:But when I receive it in my Python program it looks like this I'm sending it to a server with this code C#And receiving with this code on the Python(Version 3.5) end Then when I try to parse it using this codeI get the error: Any advice on where I'm going wrong or what I could try to fix this. 
It looks as if you are calling  on a  instance somewhere in your code.Consider this xml fragment:If it is being sent across the network it will must be encoded as bytes.ElementTree will accept the UTF-8 encoded bytes as is, or you can decode them before passing them to ElementTree: However if you call  on the bytes, you'll get the repr of the bytes, which will include the leading :ElementTree will not accept this input:To fix this, you need to look at how  is being constructed.  Make sure that you are calling  on the bytes that you receive, rather than .
