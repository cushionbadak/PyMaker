Natural Text
I have a  with data I need to parse to an  that should then be put in a . The  file i huge but here's a sample:It's all in one chunk, separated with semicolons. The sample consists of two objects with ,  and I have created a  that looks like this:The main part looks like this, with opening the file and trying to parse it:So, the problem is, I don't know how to access the specific parts of the  file, separated by the semicolons. Obviously "item_first_semicolon_part" won't work. But how do I access the first part of the text file so that I do get the  number and nothing else (and then the start and end times)? Is there an elegant way of doing this or simply a matter of using .Thanks in advance. I have looked through similar questions, but don't think there was anything that could help me through this.UPDATEI got a great answer from @Alderven that worked, but I just noticed that the parsed object cuts away a part of the id. I simplified the id for the sake of this question. Full id (with the rest of the data) looks like this:  The part:  seems to be missing. Perhaps because it is on the same row as the first object. The last part of the  is still there: How do I get the full id?
Actually it is CSV format with  delimiter. Basically:If you want to parse data to your  class, then:
you can split a row using  to get turn it into a list.you could also parse it as a csv into an array using csvreader or pandas, but that is a separate approach.if the order is right you can unpack that directly into an employee object using 
You need to split the line by  using :You can shorten this by removing the last  from the line and assigning multiple values at once:
You can use the  method with  as the delimiter, but slice only the first 3 items of each row since you have a redundant trailing  on each line of the input:
