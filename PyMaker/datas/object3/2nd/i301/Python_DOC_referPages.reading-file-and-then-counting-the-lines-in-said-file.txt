I'm trying to create a program where the program asks the user for a file. The program then should then print the contents of the file and then count the lines. The issue when I run the program is I get this error: . Isn't the count supposed to be an integer and not a string? I'd like to use keep using .
Read the docs for file manipulation and loops. i is the index in the line list.  return the list of lines, each one is an str

You can use this for while loop:
