Here is my code:I'm trying to swap  with  (i.e.  in this case), so the result I expect is:The result I get is , which is not what I want.if I simplify  to , it works.How can I make this swap inside a list work like  does? 
That assignment's doing quite a lot. Let's break everything down …Ok, that's the easy bit. Next:The first thing that happens in any assignment is that the right hand side is evaluated, so: reduces to , which evaluates to .Then, each assignment target in turn gets one of those items from the right hand side assigned to it:Now that's done,  looks like this:Now we'll do the second assignment:But wait!  is now , so this reduces toAnd, lo and behold, if we look at  again, it's ended up as:What you've discovered is that although Python claims to be able to swap two values simultaneously with e.g. , that isn't really true. It almost always works in practice, but if one of the values is part of the description of the other one – in this case,  is part of the description of  – the implementation details can trip you up.The way to fix this is to store the initial value of  before you start reassigning things:After which,  looks the way you'd expect:
python system lib  module may help. The  module supports the analysis of CPython bytecode by disassembling it. you can disassembling it to see how the swap works internally.https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html
