I want to convert a bytearray type or a list of binary strings in python to a signed short list. In fact, I am getting a byte stream from Ethernet and I want to convert them in signed short; however, the only way I found in Python is using  which seems to be slow since it requires a format string to determine the type of each byte.This format requirement slows in two steps:1) Required to make a long string for a long array of bytes2) Required to search one-by-one in the array.In C++, the following simple code does the job on the entire memory block contained by InBuf:This skips doing the format search within the byte array as well as the format string construction. Does anyone know a better way to do so in Python? 
If you're using Python > 3.2 you could use :
