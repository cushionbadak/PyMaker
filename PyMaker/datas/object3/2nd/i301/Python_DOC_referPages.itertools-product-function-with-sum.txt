I have a single dataframe A with several columns and I would like to sum all those columns "with themselves" to get a dataframe B.and B should look like:Basically, the philosophy behind this operation is exactly what is embedded in the itertools.product() function, that yields a cartesian product.itertools.product('ABCD', 'xy') --> Ax Ay Bx By Cx Cy Dx DyI just need to apply the same principle and get :function_smg('ABCD', 'xy') --> A+x A+y B+x B+y C+x C+y D+x D+yMy dataframe is huge so I can't afford for loops and I need an iterator or a generator. If there's no function that does the trick, how can I build a generator to do so?Thanks a lot
Here's one approach. You can start by getting all the length 2 combinations from the existing columns using :And then add the values in each tuples zipped together with:Or if  is also an option:
There's actually something more precise than an itertools product for this problem. Try itertools combinations
