i am rather new to python and i have the following problem (just an example):returns the path in the form:I:\Folder1\Folder2which is normally ok for meHowever "I:\" is one of our servers at work and for further processing (html stuff) i would need the exact address in such a formfile://///Servername/Subfolder/Folder1/Folder2Edit: In other words:My program may be used locally or on different servers - it just depends on the user.  Rather stupidly said I need a function that returns what in win10 goes like this: "right click on a folder --> Path Copy --> file:////....". And I only know that this path on my computer is called "I:\Folder1" ..but "I:\Folder1" is the server nameEdit 2: Solved (see comments)

This can then be all rejoined with a  prefix using the  command. For example:
