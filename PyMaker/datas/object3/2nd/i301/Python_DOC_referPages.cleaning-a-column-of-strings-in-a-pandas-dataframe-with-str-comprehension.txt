I have a dataframe (df1) constructed from a survey in which participants entered their gender as a string and so there is a gender column that looks like: etc.I've been usingfor example, but this is really clunky and involves knowing the exact format of each response to fix it.I've been trying to use various string comprehensions and string operations in Pandas, such as .split(), .replace(), and .capitalize(), with np.where() to try to get: I'm sure there must be a way to use regex to do this but I can't seem to get the code right. I know that it is probably a multi-step process of removing " ", then capitalising the entry, then replacing the capitalised values. Any guidance would be much appreciated pythonistas!Kev
Adapt the code in my comment to replace every record that starts with an f with the word Female:Similarly for F with M in the pattern and replace with Male for Male.Relevant regex docsRegex help
