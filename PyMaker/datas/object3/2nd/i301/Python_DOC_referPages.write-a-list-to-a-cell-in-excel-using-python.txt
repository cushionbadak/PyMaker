I would like to write a list of lists :  - to a cell in a Python excel sheet.My code:I have tried:which causes the contents the list  to be written in separate cells (B1, C1, D1..).Doing:  causes the cotnents of cell B1 to have strings like - Is there any way in which I can write a list to a cell such that cell B1 looks like ? Is there any other module in Python that can facilitate this?
You can use the built-in function  which gives a string representation of the list object:At python prompt you can see how it works:In the case of your simple list structure, you could just cast it to a string as well like  but repr is probably better for this case.
You can take care of this by converting your list of list to string. For exampleNow when you save it in a comma separated format,each element will be treated as a string. When you read this back from file, you can use  to convert it back into a list of lists.Hope this answers your question.
