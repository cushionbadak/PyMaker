I have a problem with pyinstaller; i have python file (Main_w_PyQt5.py), which uses three pictures (kepler.png; keplerII.png and kepler.ico). I used pyinstaller with these arguments:The .exe file works great, until i want to close it by calling exit function, window saying "Fail to execute Main_w_PyQt5.py" pops out.What's the problem with it?
Making an answer from my (confirmed) comment:Don't use . It's intended solely for use in the interactive interpreter (it's not even guaranteed to exist since the  module is optional), per the docs:[These functions/constants] are useful for the interactive interpreter shell and should not be used in programs.Use , which is the correct way to signal your intent to exit a script.People get lazy and use  because it happens to work in most simple script environments, but PyInstaller is not simple in the least, and using it is causing you problems.
