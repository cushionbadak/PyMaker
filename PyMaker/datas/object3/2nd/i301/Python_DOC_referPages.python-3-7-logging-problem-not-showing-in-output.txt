I know this question been asked twice now in StackOverflow, but nobody answers yet the question.Here's my code:Output console is EMPTY. Only the logfile.log has the log strings. But when I remove the filename attribute, it started showing the console. I want to show in console and write in my log file. What do I miss? Please answer with code. I read the documentation twice or thrice already. Thank you.
Just get a handle to the logger and add the StreamHandler and the FileHandler
