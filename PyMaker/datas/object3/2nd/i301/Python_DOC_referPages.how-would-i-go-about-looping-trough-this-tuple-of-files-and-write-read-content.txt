Natural Text
So i have this code which checks for certain file extensions. When i run it it works fine and i get a list with all the files containing the extensions that are in the tuple. Now i want to loop trough this tuple and write something in all these files. I have tried everything i can think of but for some reason i keep getting strange errors like this (when reading):  Sorry for the bad structure in my code and the many loops, i am a beginner. 
Try this. I made it only operate on .txt files in a directory I didn't care about. It will crudely append something to each .txt file and then print all the lines in each file.
