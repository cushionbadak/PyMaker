this code works but i need to know how lambdas work in this context i know that it take an argument then return the result which is the expression,so my question is what the argument which in this example lambda takes 'x' ,and does this argument change also or not .I mean does min function change it when it runs.so when min is called for first time what is the value of x.thanks in advance.
From https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/min: min(iterable, *iterables[, key, default])iterable - sequence (tuple, string), collection (set, dictionary) or an iterator object whose smallest element is to be found*iterables (Optional) - any number of iterables whose smallest is to be foundkey (Optional) - key function where the iterables are passed and comparison is performed based on its return valuedefault (Optional) - default value if the given iterable is emptyThe call  is finding the smallest element in , by comparing the results of the function , which is just an anonymous function that returns the value of the stock for a given key. So the call to  returns the stock with the smallest value.See also Get the key corresponding to the minimum value within a dictionary and http://www.aroseartist.com/python-dictionary-max-min/
Your min() function gets an iterable as first argument (in this case 'stocks' dict). The second argument, which is 'key = lambda x: stocks[x]', is a function that specifies based on what minimum should be evaluated. Basically x takes the following values ('BMW' 'FB' 'whatsapp' 'Apple') and lambda function returns the values (40 90 100 30). 30 is the lowest value and thus your min() function will return the 'key' for that value, which is 'Apple' (not to be confused with the 'key', which is an argument in min() function)
