I have a program written in python which goes as follows:The fact is the program running time increases exponentially(we observed it using )So what I need is run the program for 10 min and then re run the program.But I just need to change the i in for loop to the number at which it is stopped.I can do a cron job, but what should I do to change  value?
You could use (https://docs.python.org/3/library/marshal.html) to save the value when stopping the program, and then loading it via  when starting.Honestly, I think it would be a much better approach to fix the root cause of the problem, i.e. solving the exponential run time.
If each iteration (each  value) in the loop is independent with each other, you can parallelize it with :This requires Python3.
Consider using a generator:Where  will remember the iteration it's on and continue the next time you call .  
Here my solution:The idea behind this code is simple:Create a tmp_file.txt where you want, and write in them the number of iteration that you need in the for.Create a timer that sleep for X minutes and after that set a flag that terminate the for loop.After that save in the tmp_file.txt the new calculated iteration numberEach time that the cron run the program it will load the new iteration value. Obviously when the iteration are finished in the file the 0 is written, so no more iteration were performed.
