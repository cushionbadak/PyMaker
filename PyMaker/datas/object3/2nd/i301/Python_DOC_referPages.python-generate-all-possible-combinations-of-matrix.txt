I need to generate all combinations of a matrix in Python. The input will be two integers n and m, and I need to generate all possible states of that matrix with 1 and 0 as possible values.For example:Is there a clean and efficient way to do this given I will not know the values for n and m until runtime? The highest value used will be n = 16  m = 16.
One way is by generating all binary sequences of length  in a list comprehension, and reshaping them into a  shaped nested list on each iteration. A simple way to generate all sequences is by taking the cartesian product of  with  repeats, which will be produce  combinations: Output 
If you want all matrices at once, just produce flat lists using  and  them:With the output for 2x2:Note that for  there are  combinations, which is about , so much too large to fit into memory. In that case you probably have to process each matrix on its own:Which you can use like this:
