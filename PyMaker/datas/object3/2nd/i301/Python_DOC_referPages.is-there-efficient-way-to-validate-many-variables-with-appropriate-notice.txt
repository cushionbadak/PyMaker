This is my code:It's seems like too much repeated pattern. The issue is that I can't find a way to make it simpler and compact.Any ideas?
Assuming you still want to validate all arguments, here is a solution using  as suggested above:
I wouldn't advocate for getting really fancy trying to eliminate all redundancy. Your code is easy to understand. Doing something clever with  or whatnot to avoid repeating each variable name twice will turn a simple set of  statement into something significantly more complicated.That said, this is one of the rare times where compacting the code is worth it:You could extract an exception raising method out of it; particularly valuable if you do this type of validation in many other places.
