I have functions using glob to identify files for removal. In the first function, the recursive toggle works as intended. In the second function, the recursive toggle is somewhat working... Here's a sample of my code below.This function works as intended.This function somewhat works. Whether  is set to  or , it still goes into the first level of subdirectories and deletes files  . It does not go into the second level of subdirectories unless  is set to .Note: Recursive is set to a  named  used in a Checkbutton in a tkinter widget.Thank you in advance.
With ,is equivalent toorHowever, even with , this pattern explicitly says to search through subdirectories of , not through the contents of  itself. A pattern saying to search through  would be(Also, building a glob this way is dangerous, because  could contain glob metacharacters. Remember to use  on components you want to match literally, or pick a search mechanism that doesn't need escaping.)
https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html"If recursive is true, the pattern “**” will match any files and zero or more directories and subdirectories. If the pattern is followed by an os.sep, only directories and subdirectories match."So  in  matches exactly one level of subdirectories when recursive is set to false. Because  is  I assume.
I've made a workaround for my issue using an if-statement and repeating the glob under it.If I do not use the if-statement and simply rely on glob's own recursive check, the junk file will be removed from the first level of subdirectories even if .I can probably clean up the code some more to be a bit more if-statement-intuitive, but the problem has been solved. Thank you, @Szellem and @user2357112 for your efforts.
