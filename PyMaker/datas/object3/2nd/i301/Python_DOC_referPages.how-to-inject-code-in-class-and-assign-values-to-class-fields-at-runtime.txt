I have a BatchJob specification file (batch.spec) something like below:I am converting this file to a python dict by using https://github.com/etingof/apacheconfig Now I am converting this python dict to a BatchJobSpec object like below:If I print batchjobspec fields, then I will get something like belowProblem: I want the value of "batchjobspec.exec" to be interpolated when I try to access it, i.e. it should not be "echo %foo()%" but it should be "echo foo: I am p&l_calculator". i.e. somehow in the getter of fields, I want to check if there is "% %" syntax. If yes, and if content inside "% %" contains a callable then I want to call that callable and append the value returned from callable to the value of the corresponding field. I guess I will have to make these callables available in the BatchJobSpec dict as well. 
Comment:  I have foo as well as bar. exec(str) will execute bothIn your  you have definitons of functions like . Therefore  doesn't execute but do define these functions in the local namespace. To execute these functions as a , you have to create a , referencing these local functions, in the  itself.In this example, the function names are known beforhandTo make  visible in the local namespace, define the  dict. the string  results in insert the reference to the functions into . To use these local references, as a  and make it persistent, use .Usage: Different python  syntax, as i using python 3.5Output:Question  I want the value of "batchjobspec.exec" to be interpolated when I try to access itlibrary/functions -   Change your  to:
