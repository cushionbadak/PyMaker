So I've just updated matplotlib to version 3.0.2 . I can import matplotlib just fine, but when I try to , I get : I'm on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, on Jupyter Lab 0.35.4 with python3.6.7.Side information/question : Before installing jupyter lab this morning, I was using jupyter notebook with python3.6.0. Now the kernels says it is using python3.6.7, although I cannot seem to find it anywhere on my system.That being told, when I import anything else that doesn't rely on matplotlib.pyplot, everything works perfectly. If I try seaborn, for example, it returns me to the same attribute error.EDIT In fact, the error happens with the pathlib library. It also happens whether or not I'm in jupyter. To replicate it : and the error is the same as before : 
what about the classic trick of uninstalling matplotlib and installing it again?Also, if you are not doing it already, I strongly suggest you should check using virtual environments (e.g. this guide) as you will have absolute control on which packages you install/modify/uninstall in a particular virtualenv (not affecting your development environment for all your projects).
