You can use  basically you are serializing your python object and save it as bytes in your MySQL db using  as your model field type in Django, as i don't think JSON serialization would work in your case as you have a python object as a value as well in your dict, when you fetch your data from db simpily unpickle it syntax is similar to json library see below.so in your case when you unpickle your object you should get your data in same form as it was before you did pickle.Hope this helps.
Try looking into msgpackhttps://msgpack.org/index.htmlunlike pickle, which is python-specific, msgpack is supported by many languages (so the language you use to write to mysql can be different than the language used to read).There are also some projects out there that integrate these serializer-libraries into Django model fields:Pickle: https://pypi.org/project/django-picklefield/MsgPack: https://github.com/vakorol/django-msgpackfield/blob/master/msgpackfield/msgpackfield.py
