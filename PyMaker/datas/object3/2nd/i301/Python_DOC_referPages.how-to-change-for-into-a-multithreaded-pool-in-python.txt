So I made this program that I want to loop for ever until closed. So at the moment I use this piece of code;But that is pretty slow. How can I multithread this using this (this is my try, it's incorrect ofcourse);I tried that code, with . And it just gave nothing. Could anyone help me with this?==== EDIT ====Start function;Check function;I hope this helps a bit
