i have python dictionary like this:where I read cells from .xls file. Is there any good idea to check if eg. a8 exist and there is no NoneType and if so, put 0? Thanks for any respo. 'Kit' - that's the name of spreadsheet
Have a look at  - it let's you use a dictionary like normal, but any attempt to access a key that isn't in the dictionary causes that key to be created with a default value you specify.You could make the default be a float, which will default to 0.0 because that's what floats do, or you could create a "magic" value and use that for your default:If you're actually trying to implement a spreadsheet, though, I'd suggest that you think about how you'll handle cycles of cells referencing other cells. It's not a totally trivial problem, and the answer to that question will inform how you store your cells.The most basic solution would be to store everything unresolved, then iterate through the cells doing a "depth-first" evaluation: if a cell references another cell, go resolve that one then come back. You'd mark the cells resolved as you did them, so that your iteration and your recursion didn't collide. An easy approach might be to evaluate them into a separate dictionary. You might even use a  where the factory function actually did the recursive evaluation for you!
One primitive way to do it:It is easier to ask for forgiveness than permission in Python.
