I've converted a older Python script with the Python 2to3 tool to make it compatible with Blender. The script makes communication possible between Blender3D and a OMRON PLC. However after conversion the script gives the following error in the Blender 3D console:This occurs in the following lines:I've searched the problem using google and it seems its a problem that occurs when you convert or use an older script for Python 3+. Adding .encode() and .decode() to the objects where the problems occur has not helped either. This gives a different kind of error:The script was not made by me, I'm simply using it for a school project to make communication possible between software (Blender3D) and hardware (PLC).Help would be much appreciated, thanks.I've put the converted version of the script here.
Bytes-only operations like  needs to be encoded correctly. Use either  or However, since your classes like  is actually operating bytes stream instead of unicode literals, I'd suggest to just stick to bytes (append  in front of any affected string constants, like  instead of  around an item of a  instance (for example, if  is a  instance,  is the item) should be removed, since retrieving one element from bytes in Python 3.x is already a  instance. If you are not 100% sure what's inside your ord() call, try this (dirty) workaround:And replace corresponding  with  in python 3 returns a , but if you need  instead, try this: (from this stackoverflow question)And replace corresponding  with Division  is resulting in a float by default, so if you want to retain the old behavior, double the symbol: A full list of porting guide can be found on the official python docs site, consult this if you need to do the porting work in the future :)
