I want to unpack array of 2760 bytes, to new array of 920 24-bit integers. Unlike e.g. 16 bit integers, where would  do the thing, you can't use 'repeat count' syntax with 24 bit integers:This gives the following error: 'bad count in struct format'. So what's the syntax for 24 bit integers? I can't find anything in the documentation.
 does not natively support 24-bit integers.If these are unsigned integers, on trick you could use is to use the  type to read the data as bytes, then process these per 3:or you could use  to read the data from a file input as needed:Adjust as needed for byte order (swap the  and  references).If these are signed 24-bit integers, you may have to stick to , and pad the least significant side with a null-byte, then right-shift the result by 8. That way you don't have to worry about negative vs. positive numbers and how to pad either type on the most-significant side:for big-endian, and for little-endian signed 24-bit integers.If you are using Python 3.2 or newer, you can read the data 3 bytes at a time and convert to integers with , which gives you more flexibility over endianess and if you are parsing signed or unsigned integers.
