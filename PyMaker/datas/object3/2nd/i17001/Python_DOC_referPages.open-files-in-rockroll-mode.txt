I'm wondering what is going on with the file  mode validation (Python2.7):So, I cannot open the file in  mode, but I can open it in  mode. What mode is actually used for opening the file in this case? Note that on python3 I cannot use both  and :And, this is confusing, why the behavior is different for python3.x? 
The Python 2.x  function essentially delegates its work to the C library  function. On my system, the documentation for  contains:The argument  points to a string beginning with one of the following sequences (Additional characters may follow these sequences.):Your  is considered "additional characters".In Python 3, the allowed open modes are more restricted (essentially, only valid strings are permitted).
The previous traceback explains it nicely:"ValueError: mode string must begin with one of 'r', 'w', 'a' or 'U'""rock&roll" begins with , so it's apparently legal.
