I just started self teaching Python, and I need a little help with this script:I want to get it so .
You're almost there. You're trying to modify a global variable so you have to add the  statement:If you run the following version, you'll see what happened in your version:output:The way you ran it, you ended up trying to modify the function's local variables in , which is basically undefined behavior. See the warning in the  docs:Note: The default locals act as described for function  below: modifications to the default locals dictionary should not be attempted. Pass an explicit locals dictionary if you need to see effects of the code on locals after function  returns.and the related warning on :Note: The contents of this dictionary should not be modified; changes may not affect the values of local and free variables used by the interpreter.
As an alternative way of having  update your global variables from inside a function is to pass  into it. Unlike , updating the  dictionary is expected always to update the corresponding global variable, and vice versa.
