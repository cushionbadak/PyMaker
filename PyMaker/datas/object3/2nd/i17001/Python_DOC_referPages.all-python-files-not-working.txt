A week ago all my py files were working just fine, but now everything has gone haywire. All python files/games don't work, with most errors being "Traceback error" and that same code used to work just fine before. Here's an example of code that doesn't work:It says hello, then when I press enter, it just says "traceback error". Most problems are associated with the enter key (with inputs). Also tkinter doesn't work. I use:  and it says . I tried again with a capital T, and that magically worked for some reason, though, but that shouldn't be the case. Right now I'm using python 3.3.5, and I had python 2.7.6 previously installed, but I deleted all of that. Please help!
In the above example you forgot to put  in quotes, but this is not the wider issue. There were significant (including many syntactic) changes between Python 2 and 3, such as using  (it is now a function rather than a statement) and the name of the  library.You need to port all of your code to make it work, or better still just leave your old Python  installed and then run such programs in that interpreter.If you are insistent on moving on to another version, then you should convert all of your scripts using the built-in  tool. For future Python 3 programs, see what is new in Python 3.EDIT:To convert Python 3 code to Python 2, see the  tool. It is not built-in, but it should make your life easier.
