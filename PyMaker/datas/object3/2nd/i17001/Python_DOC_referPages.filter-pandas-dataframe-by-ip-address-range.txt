I need to filter a pandas  by the range of ip addresses. Is it possible with out regular expressions?
Strings are orderable in python, so you should be able to get away with just that:Either boolean mask:or take a slice (if ip were the index):
I have an approach using ipaddress.For example, I want to know if  belongs to any of the following networks .Now, in order to get together this approach with Pandas, one shall do the following: create a function and apply it to each row of the DF.You later on apply it to the DF.This will create a new column  where each row will be either  or  , depending on whether the IP address belongs to either network of your interest.
Assuming you have the following DF:let's find all IPs falling between (but not including)  and :if we will compare IPs as strings - it will be compared lexicographically so it won't work properly as @adele has pointed out:We can use numerical IP representation:Explanation:PS here is a bit faster (vectorized) function which will return numerical IP representation:Demo:check:
