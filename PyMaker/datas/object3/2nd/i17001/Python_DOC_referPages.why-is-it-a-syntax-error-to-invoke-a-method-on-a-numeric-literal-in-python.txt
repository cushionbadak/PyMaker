I can invoke methods on numbers only when I bind them to a name:I can invoke methods on string literals:But I cannot invoke methods on numeric literals:This raises a . Is there a practical reason for that, or is it historic?Edit Just found this related question that shows workarounds (that have already been suggested here as well). I guess this also answers the main question - with simple workarounds available, there probably wasn't enough benefit to making the grammar more complex (and harder to parse) to make this work.
The floating point numbers are parsed as per the following rules, quoting from the docs,When Python sees , it thinks that the grammar follows  rule. So, it picks up the next character and finds that it doesn't match the  rule. That is why the syntax error is thrown.You can get around that byOr enclosing that in brackets like this
Actually thefourtheye is slightly mistaken in that the reason for syntax error is not that the  rule is not matched.The reason for the syntax error is that that this rule is used to parse it as a floating point:The number matches the second form, that has integer part followed by a  -  is a valid literal for floating point, and the token stream produced by  produces 2 tokens:  (that is, float )  and ; a floating point literal followed by a name is syntax error in python. It is actually possible to call a float method however, with 2 dots:To call the  method, you need to separate the  from  to make them parsed as separate tokens.
