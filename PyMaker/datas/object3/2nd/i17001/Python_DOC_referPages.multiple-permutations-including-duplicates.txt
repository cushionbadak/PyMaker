I have a list of 6 elements  and would like to generate all possible 4 letter combinations - including duplicate values.i.e  as well as  and , etc.So far I have been using . (Python 2.7.6)However, this is only giving me the 360 unique combinations, rather than the 1296 that I want.Thanks!!
This is a cartesian product of 4 copies of the list. You want :
One can solve this in at least 3 ways.Using nested loopUsing list comprehensions Using itertools.product()Let's see how to use these and deep into the time performance of these:Output:So, comparing the ways we see that  is simpler and effective than the others.N.B.: The code is run in https://codepad.remoteinterview.io/. Performance may vary.
