 Should return  if every element in left set is in right set. But  are not in the right list. Even if I put the numbers in sets like sohttps://docs.python.org/2/library/sets.html
You are using lists and tuples, not sets. Use  for set literals:or use  or . Set literal syntax is only available in Python 2.7 and 3.x.Lists and tuples don't support set operations. Instead, , ,  and  comparisons follow lexicographical ordering conventions; the contents are compaired pairwise and the outcome is based on the first value that differs between the two sequences.Lexicographically sorted, your left-hand list sorts before the right-hand (, then ) so the outcome for sequences is entirely correct.
