Natural Text
Several times here on SO I've seen people using  and  modes for reading and writing files.For example:I don't see the modes documented, but since  doesn't throw an error - looks like it's pretty much legal to use.What is it for and is there any difference between using  vs  and   vs ?
 refers to the text mode.  There is no difference between  and  or  and  since text mode is the default.Documented here:The default mode is  (open for reading text, synonym of ).
The  indicates text mode, meaning that  characters will be translated to the host OS line endings when writing to a file, and back again when reading. The flag is basically just noise, since text mode is the default.Other than , those mode flags come directly from the standard C library's  function, a fact that is documented in the sixth paragraph of the python2 documentation for .As far as I know,  is not and has never been part of the C standard, so although many implementations of the C library accept it anyway, there's no guarantee that they all will, and therefore no guarantee that it will work on every build of python. That explains why the python2 docs didn't list it, and why it generally worked anyway. The python3 docs make it official.
The 'r' is for reading, 'w' for writing and 'a' is for appending.The 't' represents text mode as apposed to binary mode.Several times here on SO I've seen people using rt and wt modes for reading and writing files.Edit: Are you sure you saw rt and not rb?These functions generally wrap the fopen function which is described here:http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/fopen/As you can see it mentions the use of b to open the file in binary mode.The document link you provided also makes reference to this b mode:Appending 'b' is useful even on systems that donâ€™t treat binary and text files differently, where it serves as documentation.
 indicates for https://docs.python.org/release/3.1.5/library/functions.html#openon linux, there's no difference between text mode and binary mode,however, in windows, they converts  to  when text mode.http://www.cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/using-textbinary.html
