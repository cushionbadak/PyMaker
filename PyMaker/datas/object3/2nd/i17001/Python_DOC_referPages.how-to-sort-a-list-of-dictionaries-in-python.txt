Input data:Output has to be sorted like below, grouping by  in ascending order:What is pythonic way to do this?
You are grouping; this is easiest with a  object: is a dictionary and these are not ordered; if you need to access job ids in ascending order, sort the keys as you list them:
You can use  to group the  by their :The result is a dictionary, i.e. it has no particular order. If you want to iterate the values in ascending order, you can just do something like this:Update: as Martijn points out, this requires the  list to be sorted by the s (as it is in your example), otherwise entries might be lost.
Assuming you really didn't want the the job_id in the newresult:I don't really see a way to do this with a dictionary comprehension, but I'm sure there's someone out there with more experience in doing that sort of thing who could pull it off.  This is pretty straightforward, though.
