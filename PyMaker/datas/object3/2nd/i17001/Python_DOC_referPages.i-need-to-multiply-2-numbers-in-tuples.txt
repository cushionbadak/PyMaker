I need to write a program that takes as data a tuple of two-element tuples, such as:This and/or similar data should be hard-coded (no need for user input).  Then, loop over the tuple and print out the results of multiplying the two numbers together, and use string formatting to display nicely.I would really appreciate if you explain to me, in detail, what to do and how.update:i did Thank you all for help. 
Simplest way to do it:Computing  like above one-liner is the same as doing: The one line computation most of the answers mentioned is called list comprehension. Since i wrapped  in a round brackets and not square brackets, it instructs the interpreter to return a generator and not a list. Which is why I have to use  to print it as a list. This may be a overkill for smaller input array lengths like above but returning generators is a good practice when dealing with larger lists.Not sure what you meant by a string formatting to print the results nicely, but this is one way:Documentation on 
This is best accomplished with a list comprehension:You can read this backwards to establish how it works. The comprehension "[...]" iterates through , unpacks each tuple into variables  and , and multiplies them together producing a new list containing the products.
This is the simplest way- you can just unpack the each  within the list and then multiply them together within a list comprehension:
