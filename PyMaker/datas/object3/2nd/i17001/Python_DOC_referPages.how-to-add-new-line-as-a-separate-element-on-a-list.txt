I'm printing a variable my app is receiving and I get something like:I want to add this to a list as [dog,cat,monkey,cow] but I'm unsure how to get this as a list as its just all in a string variable(so when I do a for item in string:...I just get each letter sperately and not the word). Is there a way to add each item to a list based on the fact that each item is a new line?Thanks
There's a built-in method of strings for this exact purpose called .Now of course you can just append to it:Want it back as a multi-line string? Use .
I believe you are looking for :From the docs:Return a list of the lines in the string, breaking at line boundaries. This method uses the universal newlines approach to  splitting lines. Line breaks are not included in the resulting list  unless  is given and true.
