For a research project similar to this one i want to extract all "documentation units" out of the python documentation. A documentation unit in the python documentation can be (as html-meta tag): a method (dl class: method)a class  (dl class: class)a section (div class: section)And as you might guess, these should be nested like this: A section contains several classes, which contains several methods. But in fact that is very irregular. Example1: If a section contains several classes and methods: I want to get each method alone and each class without the methods (which i already got) and the section without the classes (which i already have in that case) and without the methods (which i also already have) but with the rest of the it (as there is a lot of additional stuff in there)Example2: If a method or a class has no section in which they appear, i also want them as mentioned above and must not forget them. Note: Doesn't make it easier but i would like to get all of them in a list which has the same order as in the original documenation.I tried it with BeautifulSoup but i guess for that purpose i need to search "from leaf to root" to get the deepest elements first- which is (afaik) not supported by BeautifulSoup4. First i thought the problem is to avoid duplicates but in fact that is not the main problem. I appreciate your hints. 
Seems that this is not possible.So what i did to solve this problem is to iterate over the elements (which i got using .descendants) again and again and then i replaced the nested-elements with a placeholder to make that change visible (using replace_with).As i used .descendants before, the nested elements are stored anyway.
