Natural Text
The argparse module "automatically generates help and usage messages". I can give Non-English names to the arguments and provide Non-English help texts; but the help output then becomes a mixture of at least two languages, because terms like , ,  and  are automatically generated in English.How can I replace this English output with translations?Preferably, I would like to provide the translations within the script, so that the script generates the same output wherever it is started.Edit: Based on the answer by Jon-Eric, here an example with his solution:saved as  gives with  the following help output:
One way, from this post by Peter Otten:I don't know much about gettext, but the following suggests that most  strings in argparse are properly wrapped:The workaround for the "-V" option would be to add the help message  explicitlyYou still have to provide all translations yourself.
 uses the  API inspired by GNU gettext.You can use this API to integrate your translation of  in a relatively clean manner.To do so, call the following code before  outputs any text (but possibly after ):In order for this solution to work, your translation of  must be located at  where  is the code of the current language (for example ; can be configured for example by setting the environment variable ).How do you generate the  file?Use the actual location of Creates the file Use an actual language code instead of Fill in the missing translation strings in See  documentation for details about creating  file.I have published these instructions in more detail in README.md of my Czech translation of .
Here is a solution with French translation, where one creates a conversion dict that holds the translation for the encountered English keywords
