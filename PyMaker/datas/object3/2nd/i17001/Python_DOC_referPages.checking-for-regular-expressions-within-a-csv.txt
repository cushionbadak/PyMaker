I'm currently trying to run through my csv file and identify the rows in a column.The output should be something like "This column contains alpha characters only".My code currently:Within a method I have: is the csv file in list format. &  are the total rows and total columns respectively which has been calculated earlier within the program. has been imported from a file and the method looks like:This currently works, however I am unable to add my other regex checks such as alpha, numeric etcI have tried to duplicate the if statement with a different regex check but it doesn't work.I've also tried to do the counts in the regex.py file however the count stops at '1' and returns the wrong information..I thought creating a class in the regex.py file would help however no avail.Summary: I would like to run multiple regex checks against my csv file and have them ordered via columns.Thanks in advance.
From the code above, the first line of the CSV contains the column names. This means you could make a dictionary to contain your result where the keys are the column names.Now you have a dictionary called 'results' which has the output from the regex checks stored by column name. You can then output statistics. Or you could save the rows as you read them in a list and once you decide on an order you can go back and output rows to a new CSV file by outputting the items in each dictionary using the keys in the new order.Admittedly this is a bit of a sketch but it should get you going.
