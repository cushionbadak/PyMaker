I've been playing around with Python for making one-line solutions for some competition problems, and I've run into the following issue. My solution can be written as  (where  is some simple expression), which looks great, but when  is large it ends up constructing a list before finding its maximum, which exceeds the memory limit. Is there a way to find the maximum without actually constructing the list, while still keeping it down to one line? I know the following works, but if I wanted that I'd just use a different language:
 takes a generator also:This saves you from having to build the entire list.Thanks to @DanielRoseman for pointing out that in Python 2.x you should be using  instead of . Recall that  returns a list in Python 2.x, whereas  returns an  (a constant-memory iterable).
