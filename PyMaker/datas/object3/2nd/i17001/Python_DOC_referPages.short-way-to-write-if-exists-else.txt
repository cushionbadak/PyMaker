What I want to do is : And avoiding if possible, ternary expressions. Is there something like : I was thinking of creating my own function such as : But I would be surprised to hear that python doesn't have a shortcut for this.Synthesis : I tried both of solutions and here's the result : Thanks for your answers ! 
6.11. Conditional expressions
This will set  to  if  is  and  if it a proper object.The evaluation on the right-hand side is only performed if required for the value, see Python Docs, which say:In the case of and, if the left-hand side is equivalent to False, the  right-hand side is not evaluated, and the left-hand value is returned.This is the same pattern as the  null-coalsecing operator that C# has, see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms173224.aspx.Note that this will not work well if you have a boolean operator on your object. If so, you need to use .
Cool way (even w/out ternary expressions): returns a new featureless object (quoting the documentation). will return  if  is empty.Logic:
At best you can do:
If you really insist on doing things in strange, convoluted and tricky way, you could try:which is the old (and quite controversial) pre-ternary-expression idiom. Note that this will NOT work as expected if  evals to  (which will be the case for most empty containers, empty strings, numeric zeros and quite a few non-builtin types).TL;DR : use the ternary expression, that's what it's for.
What you suggested yourself, but slightly different:If  is  it will ignore it and put  in
