Here is my starting point. This works as is.If I want to expand it to use all three lists, I can do this:However, I 'solved' the issue of receiving any number of input iterables using*args, but my item assignment is still manual.I want to be able to say:To allow me to unpack any number of input variables into *items, but I get this error:    I don't want to say .  I want to have *items receive any number of input variables.If I have six lists I don't want to say item1, item2, ..., item6, followed by the same number of yields.That really isn't very scalable.Is there a way to do what I am after?
For Python prior to 3.3, use a nested for loop.For Python 3.3+ you can use  for generator delegation which is syntactical sugar for the above.Or finally, if you need a more general solution that permits lists of different lengths, use the  function from the itertools recipes.
A nested loop?
