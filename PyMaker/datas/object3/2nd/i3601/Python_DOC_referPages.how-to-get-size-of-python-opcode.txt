I am parsing python bytecodes (co_code). For some operation I want to know the length of python opcodes in bytes. Where can I find the length of python opcodes? 
All CPython bytecode opcodes are 1 byte long. On CPython 3.6+, all opcodes additionally take a 1-byte argument, for a total of 2 bytes per instruction. On previous versions, opcodes less than the special value HAVE_ARGUMENT take no argument, and opcodes greater than that value take a 2-byte argument, for a total of 1 or 3 bytes per instruction.
