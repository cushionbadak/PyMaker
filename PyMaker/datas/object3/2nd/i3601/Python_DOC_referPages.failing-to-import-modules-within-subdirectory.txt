I've got a package I'm trying to import certain modules from, but am failing at. The way my directory is structured is:  foo.py imports utils.py just fine whenever I run it, however, if I run main_script.py, foo.py will fail to import utils.py by giving me a ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'utils.py'  The way I'm importing foo.py in main_script.py is: The way I'm importing utils.py into foo.py is: If I import, say, numpy into foo.py instead of importing utils and run main_script.py it will import and run just fine, however, if foo.py contains utils then running main_script.py will fail.Any idea on how to fix this without putting my main_script.py into middle/?
It would be helpful if you could share how you are importing in main_script. Your import should be: Or 
Try this:main_script.pyfoo.pyutils.pyTo know more about it, just check the docs
