I'm trying to connect and to read data in a MongoDB database, to learn Python. I'm using Pymongo and I have this error : This is my database.ini : And my code using it : Could you help me with this problem ? I think quote_plus() or even dbco = mongoClient.mongollection is what makes this error occurs. But I'm not 100% sure and I don't see, even with the documentation, how could I resolve this.Thank you.
I'm reading your code. I see in the beginning of the program, you create the  variable to point to an empty string:following after that, I see you define a couple functions, then you call  on that string:You're passing  (empty dict) as parameter to the method... but as you can see in the documentation here, this method needs another string as first parameter. That causes the error you see.Now I'm not entirely sure how to fix it because I don't know what you mean. Maybe you mean to use the  variable, since that is the one that gets the results of the  function:
I made it again and changed some little things. Now, it works. Here is the code, for people who'd need it in the future.The problems were :  - about global variables in and out of functions - the database variable empty (because of that) - a first call of MongoClient()
