So I am trying to create two functions (the use of additional functions is allowed). One that creates an entire right triangle by calling a recursive function, and then the recursive function itself is suppose to be able to grab the last X amount of lines of the complete right triangle and display them. The only thing is, the first function (triangle()) cannot be changed.Here are the two functions (at least this is what I have so far for the recursive function):So for example, when working properly:would giveand would give me the last 3 lines of a right triangle of base and height 6 (above triangle) like so:I'm not sure how to use the relationship between n and k in a recursive method to implement the proper spacing required.
If I understand you correctly,  should show a 6-lines tall triangle. This, I presume, also means that  should show a 3-lines tall triangle, just as you presented in your example so there is no need to change anything (in the setup), you just need to write the  function properly to subtract  from  before sending it to another function to do the actual printing.However, what I think you want is to still consider the 'whole' triangle, but just not print the higher lines, i.e. instead of:you want:Notice the extra indentation as if the 'triangle' was printed but was missing the first 3 lines. In that case, you can use  to do the justification for you, e.g.:Now if you call  you'll get exactly what you're after (and it will also properly print deferred calls from ).UPDATE: If you want to return a string instead of printing, store the results in a  and then concatenate with new lines, i.e.:
I think this is what you want.
