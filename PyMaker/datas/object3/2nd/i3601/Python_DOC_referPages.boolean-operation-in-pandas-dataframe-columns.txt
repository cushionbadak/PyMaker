I'm trying to find out whether a specific column exists in my DataFrame columns or not, but I have some problems.What I do: Using boolean operation "not in" (I've tried any(), all(), "in") to find the specific column header and it seems it's not working properly!let's say my DataFrame column headers are:and I'm trying to see if all of 'M1', 'M2', ... 'M20' and 'TM1' are there. If one or more is missing code will not work.So I say:Now, let's say df has all the asked columns headers, the if statement still shows the "Incomplete dataset' message!! I have tried "all() not in" too but same result!! I also have tried: orStill prints incomplete dataset!!Now for a truly incomplete dataset I get the same results too!!
You have a fundamental misunderstanding of how  and  work. I suggest going back and having a look at the documentation I've linked to on those.You want:Alternatively (and this is really just for minimal performance gain), you can use the set difference (returns all values than are in  but not in ):
