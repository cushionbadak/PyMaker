I know *-operator in Python is used to unpack iterable, such as unpack a list.However, in practice, we also use *-operator to unpack iterator, but I haven't found document explaining it. See example:unpack iterableunpack iterator
This works because , applied to an iterator, returns the same iterator:  Return the iterator object itself. This is  required to allow both containers and iterators to be used with the  for and in statements. This method corresponds to the tp_iter slot of  the type structure for Python objects in the Python/C API.Using an object in an expression list already results in the creation of an iterator. So  has the same effect as , assuming the iterable/iterator protocols have been correctly implemented.
