This question already has an answer here:What are the rules for comparing numpy arrays using ==?                    2 answers                Understanding == applied to a NumPy array                    2 answers                Following statement passes in my tests. One type is  other is  and my assumption was that this test will fail but it passes.Following statement prints Debugging further shows that  ends up invoking  which checks equality using :Can someone explain why and how test  passes?Edit: How  works in case you compare an array of one value with a variable and where is this behaviour documented?
As explained in the numpy docs about ndarrays:Arithmetic and comparison operations on ndarrays are defined as  element-wise operations, and generally yield ndarray objects as  results. The  operation on ndarrays returns another ndarray, not a single boolean  or . This is useful for data processing, but it's different from almost every other python object, is which  would return a simple boolean.
In  one can add several  methods on a specific type, to make it comparable with another. Probably some kind of that is done with .In that case when  is checked then it translates to . And if type for  has implemented  method comparison for 's type they can be compared with .Source: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.eq
