File systems rarely allow files to be arbitrary numbers of bytes long, instead preferring to pad them to fit in a certain number of blocks. Python's os.path.getsize() is documented to return a size in units of bytes, but I am not sure whether or not it is rounded by the OS (linux, in my case) or filesystem, to a block size. For my application it is necessary that I know the exact number of bytes that I will be able to read out of a large file (~1GB). What guarantees are made about this? 
No guarantees are made by Python. The  function returns the   field of a  call. This is a direct call to the  system call.All the documentation for  simply names  as the file size, in bytes.On my Debian test system  gives true filesizes:
