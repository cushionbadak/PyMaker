I'm building a blackjack command line game and I've run into a snag. The shuffle feature on my deck class object keeps coming up with IndexError: list index out of range on line 29.  It is a sporadic bug, id say about 50% of the time it comes up. Here is the code:
You're calling :Return a random integer N such that . Alias for .If it's not obvious why this is a problem, let's use a much smaller example:This is why Python usually uses half-open ranges, where , instead of . And why you normally want to use  instead of .Or, even more often, when you find yourself reaching for  or , there's a good chance you wanted  (which will randomly reorder the whole list in one go), or  (which will pick a value out of a list, without needing to first pick an index), etc., so skim through the docs to see if what you want is already written.
