I have the following code where I want to measure time performance.  When I run it returns How can I return result of the function together with time performance please? What am I missing here?
if you want the function itself to return the time, you have to remember that this is a recursive function that calls itself, so you have to account for (and probably discard) the inner calls timing results. Also you have to edit all  statements:Another approach would be to measure the time outside the function, that way you don't have to modify the function at all:
 and  are results of your function, you're returning a tuple... Just time the main fibonacci call from outside the function, in a function wrapper for instance:and fixed fibonacci itself (without the clocking):
