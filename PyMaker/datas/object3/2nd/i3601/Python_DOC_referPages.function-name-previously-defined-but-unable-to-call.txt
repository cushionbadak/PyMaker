I am fairly new to Python, though I understand what I need to know. Except this part. I have been trying to test my program on my Raspberry Pi 2B for a while, but no matter what I try to do, it keeps returning this error:I have no idea of how to fix it, purely because it says that "grab" has not been defined, but it was defined as a function earlier in the code. Here is the code for those of you willing to help me:I seriously hope someone can help me. I have tried putting self in front of everything, only putting self on variables, not putting self on anything. I really am at a loss. If any of you can help me, that would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!
