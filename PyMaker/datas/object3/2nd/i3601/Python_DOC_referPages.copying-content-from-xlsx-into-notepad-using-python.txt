I am currently using Excel 2010. I want to parse through all the excel files under a specified path in my system for a specific string (for eg: address).I want to copy all the rows which contain the word address in any of its cells into a notepad.Should I use openpyxl or pandas? Please help with a basic outline on how I need to go about with this.Thanks in advance.
Sorry, I can't comment so I'm posting as an answer. I used the following code for a very similar application. Hope this is right for you. Note: I didn't understand whether you wanted to print an entire row containing keyword 'address' or just the cell containing the keyword. This code is for the latter. Also for iterating over different excel files in a folder, I don't have much idea. I read online that maybe glob module could help you.
