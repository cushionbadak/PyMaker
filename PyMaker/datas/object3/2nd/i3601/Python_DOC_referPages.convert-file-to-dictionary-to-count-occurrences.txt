Natural Text
I have a file where the content looks as follows:I want to count the number of occurrences of each word in every language. For this purpose i want to read the file in a dict. This is my attempt:This gives me a dict with the right keys but only the last of the words for example for english:
Well each time you assign an empty list as value:As a result, the old list containing the previous occurrence is lost. You should only create a list if no such element exists already, like:Since this pattern is rather common, you can use a  as well:A  is a subclass of  that uses a factory (here ) in case a key is missing. So each time a key is queried that is not in the dictionary, we construct a .You can later convert such  to a  with .Furthermore if you  files, you better do this with a  block. Since if an exception for example arises, then the file is still properly closed.
a simple approach using dict where keys are lang and values are counters of word occurrences outputKeep in mind the line  can cause an error or unexpected behaviour if the lines in the file aren't in exact  format, a exception and check is suggested 
Another workaround would be using . It returns a count of numbers of words under each category:To get count of each word under each category:
Similar solution to @shahaf's, but using  instead of .I also use  to make the logic clearer.
