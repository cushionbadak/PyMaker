I am trying to iterate over a multiprocess query to website using python 3.  I used a modified version of the example code from https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html example 17.4.2.1.

ThreadPoolExecutor ExampleInstead of mapping to thread to url, I want to have a process number attached because I am querying the same the url in different processes.I get the following error:

So, whats happening is instead of calling the function inside the executor, the function gets called in the main thread and  probably returns an integer which actually gets passed to the executor. The executor then tries to call that integer thinking its a function. This happens because python supports duck typing and the executor expects the first argument to be a function object.So change your second line to:
