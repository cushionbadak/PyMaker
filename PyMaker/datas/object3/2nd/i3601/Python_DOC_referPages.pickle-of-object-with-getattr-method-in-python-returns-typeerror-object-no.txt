I wanted to define a class that returns  for unknown attributes with  method.After doing that, I am trying to dump an object of that class to a Pickle.However, I got the errorWithout defining , it works fine, but I would like to keep this function.Here is my code: how to make it work with ?Thanks
The problem is that pickle tries to check if your object has a  method, which can be used to customize how objects are pickled. Because your class doesn't define a  method, your  method ends up being called and it returns . Pickle tries to call this  value and that produces the exception you got.There are two ways to fix this:Define a  and corresponding  method in your class:Rewrite your  method to handle dunder-attributes better (i.e. throwing an AttributeError instead of returning a nonsense value):
If you override , you have tell how exactly your object can be pickled by implementing the  and  methodsHave a look at here for more info
