This question already has an answer here:Searching array reports “not found” even though it's found                    1 answer                I have just started to learn Python and I have a question regarding the FOR LOOP and how to make it loop until he finds a specific element in a list and then make it stop without iterating through the other list's elements :I created two python file: 1) Database.py 2) App.pyIn "Database.py" I have the following code:In "App.py" I have this code:When I have more than 1 book (2 or more) in my  list, the function I wrote does not work as I expected.Example:I want to "mark as READ" only the book with name "Fight Club".So I input the name "Fight Club".The  variable becomes: The function runs correctly and changes the  to HOWEVERSince I am in the for loop, it keeps iterating and it also prints:"Sorry but the book Homo Deus is not in the database"(My understanding of the problem is the following: since we are in a for loop, the program checks one by one all the elements of the list to find if they match with the input the user wrote. Thus I need a way to stop the for loop once the matching element has been found).What I would like is the following:-Once the  matches with the element of the dictionary, the for loop has to stop without iterating the others list' elements-If the  does to match with any element in the dictionary, I want to print 
add a  once the book has been found, and declare a  or  to a variable that detects if it's been found:EDIT: i just edited my answer since i misread the last part. now it will only print the "Sorry but..." if it wasn't found.
