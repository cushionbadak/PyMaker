I am a beginner python learner, tkinter in particular. I want to make a 'loading screen' of a simple python script and closes after the script ends.But making a window requires a  function which means that it will loops infinitely or wait for a user interaction(or so i think) and it will eliminate the idea of a 'loading' screen. I tried something but ends up with (Put Loading Screen) -> (Loading screen still have ) -> (Can't Run Script because of waiting)What i wanted in detail was (Put Loading Script) -> (Run Script) -> (Script ends) -> (Loading Screen destroy)I got a lot of experience in other languages especially Java but java can just declare a frame -> run other things afterwards -> call a  and that's just it. Any tips or suggestions for a learner?EDIT: The script actually is a image processing algorithm that connects to a database and I can't just put a timed wait or sleep since the database can be expanded and it might be take longer than the allocated time.
Something along these lines might work for you. This creates the window , and defines a function  which destroys  as the last thing it does. In this example,  just sleeps for two seconds, but you'd replace that  call with whatever code you want to run.You put the  function into the main loop event queue with . This means the code will first create the  window, wait 200 milliseconds, then call , which sleeps for two seconds and destroys the window. At least for this example you need the 200 millisecond delay so that the main loop has enough time to draw the window before the  call halts everything (the number might be different for you; increase it if the window doesn't draw properly).Edit: Added a comment to the code.
