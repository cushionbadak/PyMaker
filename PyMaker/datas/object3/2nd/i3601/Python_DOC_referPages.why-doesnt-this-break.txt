Natural Text
I wrote some code I have to submit to an online programming class. The code is intended to: Import and open a fileAppend data to said fileRead from said file to display each city name and month average high temperature in Celsius.The output is supposed to look like this:When the code is run it goes into an infinity loop and I don't understand why. I thought that when the file pointer got to the end of the file, the code would break because the read would equal ""(empty string) and that is Falsey so it would stop.I know that it would be better to write the code without keyword "while" but in my class that keyword is required to be in the code. I got the code to work perfectly with a for/in keyword.Any help is greatly appreciated.The code:In case it helps, I wrote the code in Microsoft Azure Notebooks.
You've created  as a list of all of the lines (but the first) in the file:You never modify that list anywhere inside the loop. So if it's non-empty (and therefore truthy) the first time, it'll be non-empty over and over again, forever.It's not clear what you actually wanted to do with that loop. You already have an inner loop that goes through every line in the file:… which seems to be the only loop you need. So, just get rid of the outer  loop.:While we're at it, you don't need  here. That reads all of the remaining lines into a list so you can loop over it—but the file itself is an iterator over the same lines, so you can loop over that just as well, and without wasting time, memory, and a line of code making a list:Finally, this might be easier with the  module:
