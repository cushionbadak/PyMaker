This question already has an answer here:Boolean keys with other data types in dictionary                    3 answers                When I do:I receive an output of:It's not only that some of my keys are deleted but also the value it was holding changed. Why is True given priority over another bool keys?
The three keys True, 1 and 1.0 compare equal to each other and all have the same hash (try ,  and  in the Python REPL), so they all correspond to the same slot in the dictionary. The last value to be set wins - 'maybe' in this case.Note that if the keys weren't equal, they would be stored separately even if they hashed to the same slot in the dictionary.
