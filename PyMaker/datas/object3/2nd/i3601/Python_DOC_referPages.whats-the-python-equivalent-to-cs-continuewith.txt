What's the Python equivalent of this code?I assume that it'd use the asyncio library.  I know how to create a task in Python, but I can't find a simple example of something that does the same thing as C#'s ContinueWith()
You could use the  callback registration function to do the same; echoing the lambda function support would be:So this:Creates a task for Registers a callback on this to be called when the task is done.The callback receives the task object, and passes that task object as the first argument to a lambda that creates a  coroutine from this. The result of the lambda is then scheduled as a new task to be run.Then schedules the  task; when that task completes the  callback is called to run .Demo:
