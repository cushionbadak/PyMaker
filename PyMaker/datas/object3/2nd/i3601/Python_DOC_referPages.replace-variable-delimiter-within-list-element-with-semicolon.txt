Natural Text
Given list: Note: I'm getting a dynamic list every time and there may be a different delimiter in the list elements every time. Expected list:Tried with the following code, which works fine for string type.
If you know the set of possible delimiters to be  and  (from comments), just use those in  and replace all with .Note that some of those have special meaning in regex, e.g. if you put  in the beginning, the  will be inverted. When in doubt, you can escape them as  etc., but in this order is should be fine, too.
Using Regex.Demo:Output:
If the position of delimiter is fixed, then the worst solution may be the best:Other wise, above solution by @Rakesh is good enough
