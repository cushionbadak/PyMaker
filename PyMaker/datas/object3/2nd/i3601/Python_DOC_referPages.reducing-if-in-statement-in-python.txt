I have a list of strings and want to use various different operators to to pick out the string that satisfies my conditions.The example code below gives me the answer I'm looking for:However, this code requires me to write out 'in string' multiple times, which looks messy and takes time when referencing a number of conditions.I want to know if there's a way to condense the code down to show that everything operator is searching -in string-I would imagine the syntax looks something like:but when I try this I get a SyntaxError.Is there a pythonic way to condense the code?
The most Pythonic approach is to make your code as readable and expressive as possible. In your case, I would use two  statements:
You can use eval() to evaluate expression like this one:
You could use functions to make the if statement more easily read. As long as you keep the function definitions near the if statement readability should be ok. 

You can use regular expressions, but it is not so readable:
