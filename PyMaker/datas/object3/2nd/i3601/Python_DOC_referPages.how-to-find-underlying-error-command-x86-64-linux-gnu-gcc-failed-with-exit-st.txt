I am quite desperate because I have been trying to install svmlight for python3 for hours now but I always get the same error message.I have already read Q&As about the similar topic and I installed all kind of packages like but it still doesn't work. Is there a way I can find out which package is missing or is this error message just a complete black-box?I am very thankful for any help!
use python2 and OR if you're really keen on getting it working using python.see : Compiler can't find Py_InitModule() .. is it deprecated and if so what should I use?and something like :related:https://docs.python.org/3/howto/cporting.html
