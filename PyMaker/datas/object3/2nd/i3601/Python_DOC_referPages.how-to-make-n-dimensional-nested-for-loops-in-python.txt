This question already has an answer here:Avoiding nested for loops                    2 answers                Iterating over an unknown number of nested loops in python                    2 answers                I have the following situation:How to convert this to a mechanism in which I only tell python to make n nested loops where the variable name is x1, x2, x3, x4, ...? I don't want to write every possibility manually of course, since there might be very many dimensions.
What you want to do is iterate over a product. Use .ExampleOutput
Recommended: itertools is an awesome package for everything related to iteration:givesCreate a cross-product function yourself
You could also use  to achieve what you are looking for:Thats especially useful when you are already using numpy for something else in your script. You would have to add the 'starting point' (i.e. x1, x2, ...) to each dimension though (if it's not 0).
Use multiprocessing!Now you can run your function while also taking advantage of the full capacity of your machine!
