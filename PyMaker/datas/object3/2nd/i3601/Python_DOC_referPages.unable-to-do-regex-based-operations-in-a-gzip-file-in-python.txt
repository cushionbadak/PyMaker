Natural Text
I have .gz file that contains several strings. My requirement is that I have to do several regex based operations in the data that is contained in the .gz fileI get the error when I use a  in the lines of data extractedI have tried opening with option "r" with the same result. Do I have to decompress this file first and then do the regex operations or is there a way to address this ?Data contains several text lines, an example line is listed below:
I was able to fix this issue by reading the file using gzip.open()with gzip.open(file,"rb") as f:        binFile = f.readlines()After this file is read, each line in the file is converted to 'ascii'. Subsequently all regex operations like re.search() and re.findall() work fine.for line in binFile:  # go over each line        line = line.strip().decode('ascii')
