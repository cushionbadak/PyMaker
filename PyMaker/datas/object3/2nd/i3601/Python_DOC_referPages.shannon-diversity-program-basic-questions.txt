I am a biology student trying to get into programming and have some issue with a basic index calculator I am trying to write for a research project. I need a program that will prompt the user to input data points one at a time, perform the proper calculation () on each data point, and enter that new calculated value into an array. Once the user inputs , I would like the program to sum the array values and return that index value.This is what I have. I am very new so apologies for any blaring mistakes. Any points in the right direction are very appreciated.
There are a huge number of problms here.You need to get your variables straight.You're trying to use  to mean both the list of values, and the input string. It can't mean both things at once.You're trying to use  without defining it anywhere. Presumably it's supposed to be the float value of the input string? If so, you have to say that.You're trying to use  to define  before  even exists. But it's not clear what  is even useful for, since you never use it.You also need to get your control flow straight.What code is supposed to run in that  case? Either it has to include the , or you need some other way to break out of the loop.You also need to get your types straight.  is going to give you a list with one element, the input string. It's hard to imagine what that would be useful for. You can't compare that list to , or convert it to a float. What you want is just the input string itself.You can't just guess at what functions might exist. There's no function named . Look at the docs for Built-in Functions, the  module, and anything else that looks like it might be relevant to find the function you need. is not a number, but a tuple of three numbers.You can write , or just .But it's not clear why you need a limit in the first place. Why not just loop forever until the enter ?You've defined a function, but you never call it, so it doesn't do any good.So, let's sort out these problems:There are still many ways you could improve this:Add some error handling, so if the user typos  or , it tells them to try again instead of bailing out on the whole thing.You don't actually need to build a list, just keep a running total.If you reverse the sense of the / it will probably be more readable.You're not actually calculating the Shannon diversity index. That's not the sum of , it's the sum of  where each  is the proportion of . To handle that, you need to keep all the raw  values in a list, so you can convert that to a list of  values, so you can sum those.
=================================================This is the simplified form of your code, since you are new to python. This might help you get the values stored in a list and calculate it until you type done.
