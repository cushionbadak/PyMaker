I'm still a bit unsure about when to use  and I was wondering if this is a situation where I would want/need it.Consider the following codeThis prints:The async code runs as expected and prints out in the expected order but the  doesn't give me access to the underlying results because the  object doesn't seem to have a way to get to the results.I can fix that by changing the method as followsBy calling  I make sure to get s back where I can call  on.I wonder, is that the right way to handle it? Do I need to use  if I care about the result of that coroutine or is there another way that I'm not aware of?
 and  are only coroutines in that example, not  objects, therefore no result attribute. When you use   and  are now  objects, which is why you can access the result attribute.  works the same in both cases and the results in both codes are equally generated, it's just that your function hadn't return the correct objects.If you want to modify your first example, the  objects that you wanted are returned as the first item by .
Your code is quite good - it works exactly as it should, and I think asyncio still doesn't have some strong standards being developed. But if you just want to run coroutines in parallel, there is another way, and it is seen more frequently.It is asyncio.gather().Gather's doc is quite self-explanatory, it returns future with list of results, and here is an example of your code with it:
