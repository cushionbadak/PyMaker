If I have the following list of items for a shopping store:So I have several dicts within a list. I want to find out how to get the item dict knowing the item. For example:What's the shortest, most efficient way to do this?
If you intend to lookup entries by their , then you should consider having a  which keys are the  instead of a  of .In particular, this makes the lookup O(1) instead of the O(n) required for traversing the .If you cannot update the code that generated the original , then you can transform the already existing data with a dict-comprehension.
Then, you can call this function as:
You can try iterating through the list and just extract the dict that matches your shop item:Which works as follows:The above uses  with a generator expression to iterate though the list until the condition is met, and returns  if item is not found. 
You can try this:This will return the list item if found and if the result is not found an  will be returned.
