Is it possible to create a iterator/generator which will decide on the next value based on some result on the previous iteration?i.e.I would like the logic of choosing the next  to depend on the calculation result allowing different logic for different results, much like in a search problem.I also want to keep the how to choose the next  and the calculation on  as separate as possible.
Did you that you can send to a generator using ? So yes, you can have a generator to change its behaviour based on feedback from the outside world. From the doc:.send(value)Resumes the execution and “sends” a value into the generator function.  The value argument becomes the result of the current yield expression.  The  method returns the next value yielded by the generator  [...]ExampleHere is a counter that will increment only if told to do so.UsageSince iteration with a for-loop does not allow to use , you have to use a  while-loop.OutputMake it work in a for-loopYou can make the above work in a for-loop by crafting a  class.Usage
It's possible but confusing. If you want to keep the sequence of  values and the calculations on  separate, you should do this explicitly by not involving  with an iterator.If you want the loop to execute exactly  times, then use a  loop:
