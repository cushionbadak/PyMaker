My question is about the fact that I have a simulated dataset, that contains two vectors. Hence, I have a vector vX and a vector vY. The problem I give is an example that resembles my issues, since my main code is too long. It is written as a function, as that is what I need in the end. The problem at hand is that my vectors are ordered. So the element vX[0] should correspond to vY[0], and so on. The idea is that I need all the elements of vX that belong in a certain interval, acquire their index number and fill a new vector with the corresponding vY values. Thus far I have written this:In this case the if-statement only holds true for vX = 3, 4 and 5. Then I want to have the corresponding values for vY in the vN vector, i.e. vN = [25, 12, 3].Hopefully someone understand the problem and is able to help me. Thank you in advance.
