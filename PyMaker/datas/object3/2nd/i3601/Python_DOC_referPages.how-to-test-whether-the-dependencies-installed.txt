I've been learning  for deep learning recently.Using anaconda I found some problems when I ran the program.For example, I encountered the following import error"no module named kiwisolver"when my program imported . It is fixed, but such error is very frustrating. The program runs for a long time.Is there any way to check whether all the required dependencies are installed?
Depending on how your program is structured...Many Python programs use the  idiom so that they don't immediately execute code.  This lets you import the code without it immediately running.For example, if you have my_py_torch.py, then if you run  to launch the Python interpreter in interactive mode, you can import your code:Importing your code will process any imports, execute any top-level code, and define any functions and classes, but, as long as you use the  idiom, it won't actually run the (long-running) code.  That's typically enough to let you know if you have major issues like syntax errors, bad imports, or missing dependencies.Code can still circumvent this: you may have functions or methods that only import modules locally (when they're actually run), or code may wrap imports in  /  blocks to handle missing dependencies then later throw an error if the dependency is used.  So it's not foolproof, but it can be a useful test.
