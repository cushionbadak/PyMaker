How do i join two absolute paths in Python?e.g.The desired result is: I tried  but it neglects the first path because it detects it's an absolute path. So what's the best way to join paths like this in Python?Thank you!
On Windows, I would use  combined with a strip of the separatorresult:(if the second path is a relative path, it also works)The  line allows to be compatible with systems with no alternate separators (Linux). This solution works on Windows & Linux,  is a dummy on Linux (returning a tuple with empty first element)
Use the  module to make the 2nd path relative and join it with the first one:To visualize what's happening, let's look at some intermediate output. gives you the drive letter (or  on linux) of an absolute path. If the path is relative, it returns the empty string:We can use this with  to turn  into a relative path. If it was already relative, it won't be affected by this operation:Finally, now that we have a relative path, it can trivially be combined with  with the  operator.
