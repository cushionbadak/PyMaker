This question already has an answer here:What is Truthy and Falsy in python? How is it different from True and False?                    4 answers                I have multiple quantity input fields, which only allows positive integer values, on a web page.My first code looks like this:After reviewing my code, I found a shorter version:Will this always work? Does every integer evaluate to  except ?
Generally, yes.Unless specially defined, most objects in python are considered True.See source & exceptions below:4. Built-in Types (Python 3 documentation)4.1. Truth Value TestingAny object can be tested for truth value, for use in an if or while condition or as operand of the Boolean operations below.By default, an object is considered true unless its class defines either a bool() method that returns False or a len() method that returns zero, when called with the object. Here are most of the built-in objects considered false:Constants defined to be false: None and False.zero of any numeric type: 0, 0.0, 0j, Decimal(0), Fraction(0, 1)empty sequences and collections: '', (), [], {}, set(), range(0)Operations and built-in functions that have a Boolean result always return 0 or False for false and 1 or True for true, unless otherwise stated. (Important exception: the Boolean operations or and and always return one of their operands.)
Given integers (s) as your domain, the answer is yes. The only falsy integer value in Python is . All other integers are  when evaluated as a .
