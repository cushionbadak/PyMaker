And, unless your strings all happen to include  characters, Python will render them with single quotes:If you want to get the valid JSON encoding of a list of strings, don't try to trick  into giving you valid JSON by accident, just use the  module:But, even more simply, you shouldn't be trying to figure out how to construct JSON strings in the first place. Just create a dict and  the whole thing:Being able to do this is pretty much the whole point of JSON: it's a simple way to automatically serialize all of the types that are common to all the major scripting languages.Or, even better, let  do it for you by passing a  argument instead of a  argument:This also automatically takes care of setting the  header to  for you. You weren't doing thatâ€”and, while many servers will accept your input without it, it's illegal, and some servers will not allow it.For more details, see the section More complicated POST requests in the  docs.
