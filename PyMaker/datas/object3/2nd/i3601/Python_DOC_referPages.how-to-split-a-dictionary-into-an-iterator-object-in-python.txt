I'm scraping some info from the Yahoo Finance API. I'm currently getting all dividends from a time period for a certain company. I created the following class to model a company:Dividends is always a dictionary of the following form:I'd like to create a csv file from this in which each row looks like this:But instead I'm getting this from running the script:This is the code I use to write into the csv file:What can I do to achieve the previously stated?
Use  to flatten your dict items into a regular iterator, then use that to build an iterator that includes the symbol
Dictionaries have method  that return its values as an iterator, so you can do . However, that very likely will not line up dividends from the same date in the same column in your csv. I recommend using pandas. You can create a dataframe, then fill it with each row being dividends from a company.
