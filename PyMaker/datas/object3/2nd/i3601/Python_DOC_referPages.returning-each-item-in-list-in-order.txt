Try using :
I think you're looking for a method called popEach time that you run list.pop(0), it pops the first element in the list, so if you run it multiple times it will returning each element one by one   
You could use a counter variable.Working example: https://repl.it/@LukasBach/VoluminousFrozenHexadecimal
Maybe this would help you, you can get the next item by  and reset to the first item by . Just initialize the object with , as you would with a list.I didn't really know what to call it so for the sake of time just chose .
you are missing  after 2, this may work for you:
