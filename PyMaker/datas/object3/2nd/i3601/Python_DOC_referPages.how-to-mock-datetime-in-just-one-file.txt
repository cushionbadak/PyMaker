I have two files in which I use . Is there a way to mock it in just one file and not the other? Following is an example of where I'm seeing a weird behavior.File: test_file_one.pyFile: test_file_two.pyFile: main.pyOutputAs you see, both return the same datetime which was mocked. Why are both mocked? How to limit the mock to just one file?
You can just add as many results you calls you want to do to 
I'd suggest you to reduce the scope of your mocking.Now you are applying your mock to the whole method by using the decorator Instead you could try something like:As an alternative, you could use  method from  library.Then your approach would be something like:I didn't test if my suggestions work, but I've been using  a lot in the last 1,5 year and seems to be very handful on issues like this.
