theres problems with the code you provided... however ill assume it actually works for you somehow and rather than copy paste you manually typed ityou are recieveing the first message hereYou then have the message which does not match , and  so it goes back into your loop and checks if  it doesnt so it repeats ... but you never get the next message instead try something like this second message but even then you are going to have problems because your server continues to write so you will get something like  or something .... basically you need to work out a better message passing scheme than
