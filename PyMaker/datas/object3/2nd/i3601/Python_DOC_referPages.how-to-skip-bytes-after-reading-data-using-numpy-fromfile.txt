I'm trying to read noncontiguous fields from a binary file in Python using numpy fromfile function. It's based on this Matlab code using fread:8 indicates the number of bytes I want to skip after reading each value. I was wondering if there was a similar option in fromfile, or if there is another way of reading specific values from a binary file in Python. Thanks for your help.Henrik
