Why does running this code in the interactive console print output?I would expect no output. Where is this behaviour documented?
In interactive mode, the result of any expression-statement is printed if it is not . As stated in the doc.Expression statements are used (mostly interactively) to compute and write a value [...]In interactive mode, if the value is not , it is converted to a  string using the built-in  function and the resulting string is  written to standard outputExample:This is true for a expression statement in a loop as well.Although, this is specific to the interactive shell. If you run you code as a script, nothing will be printed.
If you use the console/interactive prompt/IDLE/shell/Python shell/potato, the values returned would be printed, and no  required. This is why you can do  in the shell and it will say , even though if you create a program with  it will run with no errors or output.And a little detail: the value is not printed, its  is. This is why in the shell this happens:You can do a quick test of this:
This behaviour is documented here; you are running the Python shell in interactive mode.Note, quoted below for posterity:All error messages are written to the standard error stream; normal output from executed commands is written to standard output.
