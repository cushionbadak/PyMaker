I've been trying to figure out how I can loop through a root directory with sub directories and search for a file. If a specific file exists then run a script.File structure example:Root--Folder 1----TEST.txt--Folder 2----[no files]--Folder 3----TEST.txtWhat I am trying to achieve is having the .py file in Root. When run it will loop over each folder in Root, if the file TEST.txt then do some processing.Notes:There will always be folders in RootWhere processing is needed there will be a file called TEST.txtThere will definitely be some folders that do not have TEST.txtPseudo code:From Root open Folder 1. If TEST.txt is there then do some cool stuff and then 'cd ../' and repeat process but look in Folder 2.Stop looping when all Folders have been checked. 
This code should be able to search all folders and sub folders for a file.Joining 'root' and the file name should be able to give you access to that file if you want to execute or analyze it somehow.
