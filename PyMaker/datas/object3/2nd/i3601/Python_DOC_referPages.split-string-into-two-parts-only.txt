This question already has an answer here:Split a string only by first space in python                    3 answers                I have a string I want to split any string in only two parts at the first occurrence of a whitespace. i.e.  and If I use  it gives me an error because there are too many values to unpack.
You could use .The second argument  is the maximum number of splits that would be done.For more information on the string split function, see  in the manual. 
From the Python docsstr.split(sep=None, maxsplit=-1)Return a list of the words in the string, using sep as the delimiter  string. If maxsplit is given, at most maxsplit splits are done (thus,  the list will have at most maxsplit+1 elements). If maxsplit is not  specified or -1, then there is no limit on the number of splits (all  possible splits are made).
You can use a standard string method  which searches for a given separator and returns a 3-tuple consisting of string part before it, the separator itself, and the part after it.
You're missing one more parameter in your split, the number of occurrences, try this;
You can solve this problem by using python "star expression". "first" takes the first element of the list and " *second" takes the remaining elements. 
Try this:Output:Or:Output:Or even better split also for tabs and newlines:Output:
So, there's a second parameter you can pass as many have pointed out:but nobody's pointing this out:You don't want to be using this because it's unsafe unless you're guaranteed to have a string that has only the one space in it. It's better to split it and then check for how many splits you've got and then unpack them:
1.You can split the string like this.2.or you can do:3.
