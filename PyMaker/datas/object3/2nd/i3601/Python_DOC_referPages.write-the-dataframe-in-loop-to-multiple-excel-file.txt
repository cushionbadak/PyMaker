I have 500 excel files, from each file I have to skip starting 4 rows and select few columns. Either I can create new excel file for each file with particular columns, or i can push the data in SQL Server. I need to create one function that can read all files and do the required process and give me output either in excel or SQL.
It's convenient to use  library for working with the file system.The function  is from your code with minor changes. The function  applies  to all file in the  directory (which is in my code 'os.getcwd` [current working directory]):
