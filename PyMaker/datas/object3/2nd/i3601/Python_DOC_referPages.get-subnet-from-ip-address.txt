I am trying to get subnet for IP address I have.Eg :1Subnet mask : Input : Output : 2Subnet mask : Input : Output : Currently, the way I do it (for subnet 255.255.255.0)I see python has ipaddress library. However I could not find a method that could do the above task.Bonus : Since ipaddress supports IPv4 and IPv6, if the same function could be used for both.
The  function can take any of the string formats that  and  can take, including the  format.Since you're not actually passing the network address, but an address within that network with host bits set, you need to use .So:Alternatively, you can use  and extract the network from there:Which of the two you want depends on what exactly you're trying to represent. Notice that the Interface types are subclasses of the Address types, and of course they remember the original address that was used to construct them, while the Network classes remember the network address; one of those two is usually the deciding factor.Both of them will, of course, work just as well with IPv6:
 is simply a binary mask that must be 'ed bitwise with the IP address. You can apply the mask yourself:This solution works only for IPv4 addresses.
