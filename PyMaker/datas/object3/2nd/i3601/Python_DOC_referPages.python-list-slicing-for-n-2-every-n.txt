If I have a list and I want to get the last 3 numbers every 5 numbers such that I get a list that looks like:Is there a way to do this with list slicing? I can do it with a modulo function likeBut I'm wondering if there is a way to do this with list slicing? Thanks
Use the filter function:
If ordering does not matter, you can try the following:Or more generally speaking
Yes, but I very much doubt it will be faster than a simple list comprehension:Basically, this approach gets the list slices that represents each the index  such that .  It then uses  and  to flatten those into the output.Edit:  A simpler wayWhere we get the slices of the adjacent elements we want, then  those together.
I propose this solution:Testing with , it is faster than filter and comprehension list (at least on my pc).Here the code to carry out an execution time comparison:The previous code produce the following results:I hope this can help :)
