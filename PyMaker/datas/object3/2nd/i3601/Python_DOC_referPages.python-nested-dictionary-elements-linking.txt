I am trying to input marks of n students and find the average of a particular student. I am using nested dictionary items and trying to take input in a single line of code. The marks range from 0 to 100 only and i need to do this before linking to keys of dictionary. Below is my code,I am failing the condition of range (0 to 100). Please help.
Instead of , you should use  or as @mata suggested you could use . returns  only when  is an integer and lies between 0 and 100 (inclusive).   
@Mahantesh, as I read and understood from your code, I've tried to implement your problem in my way. I have taken varible names same as you've taken. I've also used  module for pretty printing the dictionary.Please check the below code and let me know if you need any changes.Don't forget to check the output.» Output1» Output2
