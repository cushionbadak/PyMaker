I am new to python so apologies for the naive question. I have a list and another list of tuples I want to output a list  of size  that compares the value of  to the first co-ordinates of  and stores the second co-ordinate if the first co-ordinate is found in , else stores 0.output : I tired to do a for loop like:but this doesn't work. It gives the error which is obvious as  is shorter than .

I would always use Ajax1234's solution instead, but I wanted to illustrate how I would approach it using a for-loop, as you intended: An alternate approach would be using  and a list comprehension instead of  and a for-loop. This one is far more efficient and readable:
