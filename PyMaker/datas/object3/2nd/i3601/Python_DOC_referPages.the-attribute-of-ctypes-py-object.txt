I am trying to creating a python array and have problems with the following codeIn the initialization, it uses ctypes to create an array and I don't really understand the last two columns. I tried to change them into one lineBut it doesn't work and gives me the errorCould anyone explain it for me?
 is a type is a type is an instance of a typeWhat you want to do is take the  type first, and then instantiate it:Although you probably want to go with a Python list, I'm not sure you need a ctypes array. Example:
you want to mutiple with  simple remove parentheses and it will work
