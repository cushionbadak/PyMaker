I read file from disk and in case if its size less than 256 bytes I need to extend it. Some think like:But since bytes is immutable type there is no anything like resize method.I don't need to modify original file, I need len(data) to be not less than 256 for further processing.
If you want to extend it with spaces:
You can use  for str and bytes alike:Note: If your data length is already 256 (or whatever value you use) or more,  will return the original object.Docs: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes.zfill
