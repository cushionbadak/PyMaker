Given the following example:The base class  has a method named  that raises a  if  equals to . I also have a function named  that accepts an argument , it returns a subclass of  and overrides the  method so that no  will be raised if  is non Falsey. I'm trying to type hint the return value for the  function. If I do ,  is undefined. If I do , type  isn't exactly . If I do , using future hinting,  is still not defined since it's in a local scope. Is there anyway to type hint this? If not, is there a better way to rewrite my code?
Here's what I could think of from a quick scan of the docs. This isn't a good solution at all (I think), but it should do the job for you.There's something called  (docs). Its basically a generic type. So what you could possibly do is:At the global level (after defining class A) define:Now in the function signature of  you can say:Then inside the function you can continue to create a new class with the name B and return it.I'm not even sure if this would work properly in all cases. If you find any problems with it, definitely correct me and post here.
