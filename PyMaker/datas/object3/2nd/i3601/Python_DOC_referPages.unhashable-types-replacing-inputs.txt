The goal is simple: show a dialog with options, then when a option is selected it will automatically replace some values (to decrease the possibility of making an error while typing the values manually). The following code is part of a larger code, but this is the most important part. The larger piece of code was written by someone else. I wrote the following block:The code works fine until it reads the second line, and gives the following error: My experience with programming is limited, but I understand that the things I put in that second line do not fit together. However, I was thinking of splitting them piece by piece but I do not think that will work, like in the following:The full code:Any suggestions? 
So this is interpreted as , a 3-tuple of slice objects.  is a dictionary, and only takes hashable types andraises the errorbecause, well, they aren't hashable. It's very, very weird to use strings in slices like that so I don't think you are inputting the key in the correct way. I think what you are trying to do is update the dictionary. To do this you want:(note the whitespace I put in to make it more readable. I'd advise reading PEP8 before going any further with python since you throw the style guide out the window).
