Data for revenue and expenses are already given using which we have to calculate the rest of the quantities.This is a code dealing with the financial analysis of a given organisation using the basic concepts of list in python.
You are printing it wrong.so, you are iterating using for loop. after the , you are directly using  which will be last index. so, what you need to do is, get the index where the best_month is True and print that index. so, you need to do the following 
You dont even need to index back in your data, you can simply print the min and max value:Also consider storing the min/max value in a variable to avoid recomputation - not sure if python optimizes the calculation of this max/min or recomputes it for every iteration:should beThat said, if you use list comprehensions you can shorten your code a bit. Other errors: You should include  months either in  or , currently they are in neither list your  calculation does not use the  but the one before taxes:  - hence all other values afterwards are skewed - see comments:Output:Link to zip() - dokumentation - it is handy if you operate on same-lenght lists and have to do things to pairwise values of it - for non-equal lengthy lists you can use itertoools.zip_longest() instead where you can provide default values for the values of the shorter list.
