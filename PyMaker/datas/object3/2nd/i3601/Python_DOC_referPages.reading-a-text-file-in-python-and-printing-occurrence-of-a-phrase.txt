Natural Text
I'm struggling to get my code to work. I've been supplied with some variables to work with: The variable P is my file path, designated as content/textfiles/empty.txt; while the variable S is my string, designated as parrot. The end goal is to find out how many times Parrot (S) appears in my text file (P). The following is the variables and information I have been supplied with, and immediately following is my crude code that is attempting to complete my task:The primary issue is that I am supposed to have a return of 3 for output, but my code is only counting 1 occurrence, but I have no idea why.
