pretty new to python so this might be pretty simple.I'm working with PIL and I have generated a list of pixel information using Image.getdata(). My goal is to find all dark pixels in the red channel of the image and create a list of where they occur in the overall list of pixels. Here is what I have.So my goal is to fill the list "dposition" with the locations of all of the dark pixels within the list "pixels", but I am totally stumped on how to do so! So far the list "dark" works in showing the value of all pixels with a red value of <100. Any help is appreciated, thank you!
You created a 1d array so most the other answers will give you the position in that 1d array. Here's what you can if you need the  and the  position: Convert to a 2d numpy array.
Change your for loop to this:Essentially what this does is allow us to access both the pixel red channel data AND the index of that pixel in the list, so that every time we append something to the list of dark pixels, we append itâ€™s index to the dposition list.
What you need is a way to determine the index position as you iterate through the list. You can create a simple counter than increments as you go through the list:Or you can use Python's built in  function to generate the position as you iterate through it:
If you are only interested in the positions of the dark pixels,  + list comprehension gives you a one-liner:BTW, according to the doc of , it returns all bands by default. You might want to use  instead for red band.
