My problem is, after calling the function  in the ,even though the function evaluates false(I've checked so this is thecase), I assign this false value to  inside the loop,however the game loop  conditional still evaluates trueand keeps going. 
The issue is that you are using  statements when you mean to use . See the docs.However, what you probably want to do is  at those points since that would allow the function to exit early and you would have to worry that  gets set back to  by later  statements.
