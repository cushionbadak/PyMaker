As far as I know the in operator in python can't be chained or at least I couldn't find any info on it, here is my problemHere is the codeWhat I don't understand is the first print, I know in the second the first in returns True and then it check if True is in arr, but what about the first one? Does it check if 'a' is in arr and then if arr is in arr?
The premise is false; the  operator can be chained. See Comparisons in the docs:So, just as with any other chained comparison,  is equivalent to  (except that  is only evaluated once.The reason  is false is that  is false. The only time  is true is if x is type that does substring comparisons for  (like  or ), or if it's a container that actually contains itself (like ).
