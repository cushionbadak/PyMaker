Natural Text
I'm working on a game but i don't quite understand how the event handling works. I want to make it so when the player inputs the correct first number of 6-digit number the, keyboard focus will be on the input box to the right, but i have a very limited understanding of Pygame and i have been scratching my head and searching for a solution for a while. i'd be very grateful if someone could help.here is where my problem is!!
