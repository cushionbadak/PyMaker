how to do this list/dict comprehension turn this into  thisI know how to do it in a for loop, can I use just one line to do the work?
A simple approach is to use a simple  of lists:Which creates:Note: If you want the final result to be a normal dictionary, you can just wrap . If you really want a one liner, you could use  in a dict comprehension:Which can also be written more cleanly as:The above solution has  complexity due to sorting, a requirement if you want to group similar items together. This is less efficient than  The first  solution, which is , since you only need to iterate the list once. The first solution would be more preferable, since its easier to read, efficient and maintainable. 
Personally, I think using a loop is a simple option here, but for the sake of demonstration, you can define a custom class here that inherits from  to accomplish your goal.This initializes a  from your input values, so instead of overwriting a key it appends to it.  In action, you can simply call the class constructor on your array of tuples:Or if you want something more similar to a dictionary comprehension:
