When I run this code I get the error AttributeError: '_io.TextIOWrapper' object has no attribute 'split'Any Help would be appreciated
You have not read your file to return a string you have a file object. To read a file’s contents, call f.read(size), which reads some quantity of data and returns it as a string (in text mode) or bytes object (in binary mode). size is an optional numeric argument. When size is omitted or negative, the entire contents of the file will be read and returned; it’s your problem if the file is twice as large as your machine’s memory. Otherwise, at most size bytes are read and returned. If the end of the file has been reached, f.read() will return an empty string ('').See this pageYou just need to read it and it should work:Don't forget to close your file:Or better practice:This will automatically close the file for you. is what is returned when you open a file (but have not read/written in it).  You can test this by using the interactive interpreter:You can determine three things from this:The name of the file.The encoding.the mode that  has been set in.Here is a tutorial from the documentation on reading files.
