I'm writing my compiler project, but now i'm stuck with python import conflicts. In gen.py, I want to import some function for code generation, like After some investigation, I've learned that "parser" is reserved for python internal parser. But I cannot change the directory name "parser",  since it has been used everywhere. How can I solve the problem?
To be accepted as a Python package, a directory must have an  file.Variables declared in this file can be access as if the package is a regular module. It can also be empty.  tl;dr: Add an empty  file to the directory and it should work.
python have a module parser , and you want to import  that it doesn't have, if you wiil try to and you will see that  module is not your  module.Simple rename your  folder and every thing will be all rightUpdatecan you try to import with  for example:
Assuming your project is actually contained in a project directory like so, ...   in gen.py:in the parent directory of my_package,you can run .  This should run exactly as expected without the name conflicts.  With similar import statements in your tests, if you run your test modules in the same way, it should work just fine.  I tested this with the following. In  I have a directory called .  It has the following structure.import_test_a:import_test_b:test_imports.py:in :run:  - output = run: output:.
