Natural Text
I am trying to create a python script that can read a text file of numbers and set every other number into a list of x coordinates and does the same thing for y. then i am trying to create a loop that can move the mouse using the x and y list. I am fairly new to python and i keep getting supplied sequence must have 2 element errors. I don't know if their is anything that i am doing wrong.the list of numbers looks like this:1 2 3 4and my code is thisTraceback (most recent call last):   File "C:\Users\Kade  Hugh\Desktop\python stuff\MousePlayback.py", line 20, in       pyautogui.moveTo(xlist[temp],ylist[temp])   File "C:\Users\Kade Hugh\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36\lib\site-packages\pyautogui__init__.py",  line 611, in moveTo      x, y = _unpackXY(x, y)   File "C:\Users\Kade Hugh\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36\lib\site-packages\pyautogui__init__.py",  line 180, in _unpackXY      raise ValueError('The supplied sequence must have exactly 2 elements ({0} were received).'.format(len(x))) ValueError: The  supplied sequence must have exactly 2 elements (3 were received).
With your example,  is a list of 4 numbers, and  and  are lists of 2 numbers.You loop over the four elements in , adding 1 to  each time. So, you're looking up , then , then , then . But there is no , , , or , so of course you're going to get an error if you try to access them.What you want to do is loop 2 times, not 4â€”or, more generally, loop over the number of elements in  and , not the number of elements in .The cleanest way to do this is to just loop over the lists directly, instead of trying to figure out a number to loop over. The only tricky bit is that you have two separate lists, which you want to loop over in lock-step with each other. But that's exactly what  is for:
