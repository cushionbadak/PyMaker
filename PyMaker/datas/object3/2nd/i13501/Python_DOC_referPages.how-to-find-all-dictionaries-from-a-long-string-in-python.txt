I am trying to retrieve all JSON like dictionaries from a long string. For example, I want to get  and  as result. Is there a way to do this through regex in python?
Probably the "nicest" way to do this is to let a real JSON decoder do the work, not using horrible regexes. Find all open braces as "possible object start points", then try to parse them with 's  method (which returns the object parsed and number of characters consumed on success making it possible to skip successfully parsed objects efficiently). For example:This is a generator function, so you can either iterate the objects one by one e.g.  or if you need them all at once for indexing, iterating multiple times or the like, .
