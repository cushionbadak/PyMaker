I try to wire a little script in order to find if a directory file was created in the las 24 hoursSo i trying with "datetime" and .timedelta to perform the maths, but i not able to get the creation time from the directory.Thanks for your time :D
Here's one solution
 returns "seconds since epoch" (Unix time). To compare it with the current time, use : returns the creation time for  on Windows but on other systems (Unix) it may return the time of the last metadata change.See also, Find if 24 hrs have passed between datetimes - Python.
