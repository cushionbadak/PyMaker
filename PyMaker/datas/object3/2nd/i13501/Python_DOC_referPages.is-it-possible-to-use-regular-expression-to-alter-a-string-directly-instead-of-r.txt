Natural Text
I'm trying to directly edit an XML file's text. I'd prefer to find and remove a certain phrase potentially by using the "sub" function. For particular reasons I'd prefer not to return the edited strings and then find a way to replace the existing XML file test. Is there an easy way to do this? Thanks for any help. 
No, in Python you can not change strings in place as Python strings are immutable.
