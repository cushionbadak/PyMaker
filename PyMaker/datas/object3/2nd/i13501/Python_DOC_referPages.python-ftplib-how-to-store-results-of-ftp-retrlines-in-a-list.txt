I'd like to retrieve files' name of a directory and I use the method .It prints all files' names in the directory . But I want to store those files' names in a container, e.g., a list, instead of printing them in the console. How to do that ?  
The second (optional) argument to the  is a .You can use it like:See also Creating list from retrlines in Python.
You can use FTP.nlst() method. It returns the file names as a list.
