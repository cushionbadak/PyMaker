In python, I have the line:It gives me the error:I'm stumped.  The command works fine in the shell.  Why is python complaining?EDIT:  usinginstead yields the outputin the terminal.  This suggests that babel is now working but babel is taking in NOTHING as its input and OUTPUTTING to the terminal.
You should pass the shell command as a single string to . The documentation about this function actually gives an example that does just that. In your case, it would look like this:The documentation on Popen states: On POSIX with , the shell defaults to . If  is a string, the string specifies the command to execute through the shell. This means that the string must be formatted exactly as it would be when typed at the shell prompt. This includes, for example, quoting or backslash escaping filenames with spaces in them. If  is a sequence, the first item specifies the command string, and any additional items will be treated as additional arguments to the shell itself. That is to say, Popen does the equivalent of: with  interprets its arguments in the same way as described above.If you are using the shell only for redirection, I would suggest to instead do this:This will save the output in the file you want without having to spawn a shell.
I suspect that you need to enter the full path to  instead of just , but you can try the following and see if it makes a difference:EDIT: In reference to your edit, instead of using , let's use :
As already explained, you would need to use shell=True, passing a single string to make your code work, a simpler solution would be to use , passing a file object to stdout:If you are just worried about redirecting the output then I don't see the need for  or any other means of storing any output, you might want to wrap the code in a try/except though and catch any non zero exit status. You can also set the :
