I'm just going to post what I have so far and try to describe the problem.The script bellow tracks a transform object with custom attributes. It creates an interface to easily  and  to a maya node's attributes. This makes it easy to save attribute values into a scene that can load with the scene in the future. In the script I was using OpenMaya to track a dagObject, but simplified to try to work through the problem first. If you want to use this code, look into MDagPath and MSelectionList.Now.. need to be declared outside of  to work correctly. as they are now, require a Transform() at creation.If I create a  outside of an  in the , the resulting  instance will reference whatever latest  was created by this method (image)Can't post image without reputation, so descriptively:three clips called _new_anim_, _new_anim_1, _new_anim_2.When script bellow runs, the output from the list is all _new_anim_2, which is the last transform that was initialized. happens after the Attributes are created.I need to pass a   instance to an already initialized Attribute instance.How?Saying  doesn't seem to replace the reference to . I need a way to pass a class instance to a class variables that are initialized outside of the .
If I am understanding your question correctly, it looks like you want the  variable in your  class to be a instance-specific value, but you're having problems because it needs to be accessed by the  descriptors you're also adding to , which need to be declared as class variables.I think the solution to this is to have the  class's  and  methods look for  on the  they are passed in, rather than on .Try this:
