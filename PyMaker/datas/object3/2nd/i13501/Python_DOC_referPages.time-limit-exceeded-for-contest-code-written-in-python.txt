I wrote some code for a contest in python. The test case limit is 1 <= n <= 10^9.It shows an error of time limit exceeded, but when I did the same in C, it worked fine. My C code is:Can someone explain this difference?
Python is a very simple and powerful language, but it is slow as compared to C language for a variety of reasons like:1.It is dynamically typed2.It is interpreted rather than compiled3.Some of its memory access models are inefficient.So some of the Python programs may be as slow as 20 times than a similar C program.
