Natural Text
So I have tried used both shutil.copy and os.remove and I keep getting error when this runs. Any suggestions? I am trying to get it to go through a folder "Downloads" and sort all the files by type into separate folders. 
Lines 7~9 are probably from some other cartoon. :-)Here is your code pythonified, you'll probably spot mistakes more easily.
