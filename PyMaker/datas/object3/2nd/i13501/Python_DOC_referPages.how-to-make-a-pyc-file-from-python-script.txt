This question already has an answer here:How can I manually generate a .pyc file from a .py file                    7 answers                I know that when Python script is imported in other python script, then a .pyc script is created. Is there any other way to create .pyc file by using linux bash terminal? 
You could use the  module. Run it from command line ( option):When this module is run as a script, the main() is used to compile all  the files named on the command line.Example: provides similar functionality, to use it you'd do something likeWhere  are files to compile or directories that contain source files, traversed recursively.Another option is to import the module: is different from , because the former won't execute the  block in module.py.
Use the following command:This will create  file in the same directory.You can pass directory also as :This will create .pyc files for all .py files in the directoryOther way is to create another script asIt also create the your_script.pyc file. You can take file name as command line argument
