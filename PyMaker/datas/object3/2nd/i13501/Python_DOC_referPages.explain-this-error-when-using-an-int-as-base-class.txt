I know that it is wrong to do this, but I try to understand what is going on behind the scenes (and if you could potentially duck-type a class for extending it). The code is as follows:I'm trying to understand why  would be called in this example. It is the type of  but I don't get why that is important here.
You are trying to inherit from an instance object, an integer object. Python treats  as the metatype. The metatype is passed the class name, a tuple of the baseclasses and the body of the class as a dictionary; it is expected to produce the new class object.In this case, that means  is called:Normally, that'd be the  object itself:where I used  as a base class instead.See What is a metaclass in Python? for everything you didn't want to know about how metaclasses work in Python.
You are basically doing this:As far as I am aware, you cannot inherit from an instance of object in this fashion.You want to do:OR
