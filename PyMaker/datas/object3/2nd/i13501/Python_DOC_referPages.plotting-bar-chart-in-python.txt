I am new to Python programming. I am learning Python.The below code helped me plot a bar chart. I am trying to understand the code.I could not understand the lines 5,6,7 and 8. i.e.,Also, why are we taking  while plotting x axis labels?And, how to bring a small width at the start of the graph before House Theft? The bar usually starts with 0. I am not sure how to bring a small width before the start of the first bar. I tried, but it is not coming properly.The full program is as follows.
Multiple assignment, tuple/sequence packing/unpacking: will offset the ticks on the x axis by on-half of the width.  Not sure why it was done, except maybe for the visual effect.
The value of  is now the length of the array . In your case, the length of  is .The value of  is now , see this example from the doc:The value of  is . iterates the values of .Since the values of  have two parts , for each loop  takes the value of the first part ( for the first loop) and  the value of the second part ( for the first loop). Since you only want the numbers (the second part),  only takes the  and your array is then filled with these since the expression is between brackets .It creates an array from the "result" of the expression .Same as before but with the strings instead of the value.I still have confusions with nomenclature (array, tuple, listâ€¦), if someone could check my answer I'd appreciate it as it'd help both the author and me to learn the correct Python vocabulary!
