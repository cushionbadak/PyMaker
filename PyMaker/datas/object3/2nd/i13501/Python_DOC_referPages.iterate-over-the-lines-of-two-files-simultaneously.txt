I am trying to concatenate pieces specific lines together between two files. Such that I want to add something from line 2 in file2 onto line 2 of file1. Then from line 6 from file2 onto line 6 of file 1 and so on. Is there a way to simultaneously iterate through these two files to do this?  (It might be helpful to know that the input files are about 15GB each).Here is a simplified example:File 1:File 2:Output file:
Python3:Importantly, bf1 and bf2 will not read the entire file in at once. They are iterators which know how to produce one line at a time. works fine with iterators and will produce an interator itself, in this case pairs of lines for you to process.Using  ensures the files will be closed afterwards.Python 2.x Python 2.x can't use zip the same way - it'll produce a list instead of an iterable, eating all of your system memory with those 15GB files. We need to use a special iterable version of zip.
You can use the  built-in to loop over multiple iterables at once.ExampleThe output will look like this:The same principle will work for your files.Your output will be the concatenation of the matching lines from either file separated by a single space.
You could use zip function. Below you have sample usage.
