Natural Text
I come from a Twisted background, so I have a solid understanding of protocols and factories, as implemented by Twisted.  However, I am in the midst of switching over to asyncio, and I'm having a bit of trouble understanding how factories integrate into this particular framework.In the official documentation, we have an example of a server's  class definition.  It does not have a user-defined  function, so we can simply call .What happens if our  needs to implement some initialization logic?  For instance, consider this example which sets a maximum buffer size:In Twisted, you'd create a  class to hold all of the configuration values, which you would then pass to the function initializing the connection.  Asyncio seems to work in the same way, but I cannot find any documentation.I could use , but what is the correct way of handling this case?
The documentation has an example where they use a lambda for this, so my guess is that functools.partial is fine. They also state that  can be any callable. So to have something like Twisted's Factorys, you'll just need to implement  on a class the way you'd implement  in Twisted.
