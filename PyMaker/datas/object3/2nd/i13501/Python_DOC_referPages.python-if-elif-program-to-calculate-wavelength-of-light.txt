I am a beginner programmer who is learning Python as a starting language(just started a week ago). Here's the code I have been working on. Can someone please kindly help me with the code?UPDATE:I have improvised some on the code.Ben, thank you for your input. I have improvised on the code per the given requirement. Here it is.
