What is the pythonic way to set a maximum length paramter?Let's say I want to restrict a list of strings to a certain maximum size:And I want to functionalize it and allow different maxlen but if no maxlen is given, it should return the full list:And I want to set the maxlen to the max length of element in alist, so I tried but I am torn between using ,  or .If I use , it would be hard to cast the type later on:And I might get this as the function builds on:If I use -1, it sort of resolve the  issues but it's also sort of weird since length should never be negative. If I use 0, I face the problem when I really need to return an empty list and set  but then again, if I really need an empty list then I don't even need a function to create one.(Note: the ultimate task is NOT to filter a list, i.e.  but it's an example to ask about the pythonic way to set an integer variable that sets a maximum)
Let's say I want to restrict a list of strings to a certain maximum  size:And I want to functionalize it and allow different maxlen but if no  maxlen is given, it should return the full list:And I want to set the maxlen to the max length of element in alistTo address all these requests, the best answer I can think of is something like this...edit:If it is important to handle negative maximum length (who knows why) or 0 length, then a function like this can be used. (Though I am against duck-typing)
How about the following approach, this avoids the need to use :Giving you the output:
What about some tricks?.. Operator  returns first value, if both values are . And, if first value is  and second is ,  returns second value.I think it's just what you need. :-)Ough... I forget about  and . Result will be the same:
As you said: "I want to allow different s but if no  is given, it should return the full list".An approach would be a definition of a  function which uses Pythons default argument values:Examples, using :Note: In my opinion it would be better to ask about a way to set an optional length parameter to list elments .
