Is there a programmatic way to get a list of all exceptions a function could raise?I know for example that  can raise  (and maybe others), but the documentation only mentions . (This is just an example - maybe even a bad one; I am not especially interested in this function - more in the problem in general).Is there a programmatic way to find all the possible exceptions when they are not/poorly documented? This may be especially useful in 3rd-party libraries and libraries that do not ship with Python source code.The solution presented in "Python: How can I know which exceptions might be thrown from a method call" does not work in Python 3; there is no  package.
You can't get reliable results for some (if not most) functions. Some examples:functions that execute arbitrary code (e.g.  raises )functions that aren't written in Pythonfunctions that call other functions that can propagate errors to the callerfunctions re-raising active exceptions in the  blockUnfortunately, this list is incomplete.E.g.  is written in Python and you can see its source:Bare  re-raises the last active exception ( or one of its subclasses). Here's the class hierarchy for :To get the exact exception types you'll need to look into , functions it calls, functions those functions call etc. So, getting possible exceptions without running the function is very hard and you really should not do it.However for simple cases likea combination of  module functionality and  (to get exception classes, was introduced in Python 3.3) can produce quite accurate results:printsKeep in mind that this code only works for functions written in Python.
Finding Exception in non built-in source code:As said in the topic Python: How can I know which exceptions might be thrown from a method call, you can get the Abstract Syntax Tree and search for raised exceptions.This method works for every piece of code that you have written.Finding Exception in Built-in methodsYou cannot parse built-in function like .Two alternatives:You can have a look at the tests included in your python distribution (ex with cpython)and if your target method offers python source code, you can parse it like previously (the code would be in /usr/lib/python3/*.py) For all native C methods, you are stuck with the documentation and should trust it. When  says it only returns , it is true, since  and  exceptions  are subclasses of .To find Errors programmatically for built-in you can use this example:It catches all exceptions with a name ending with 'Error', it surely can be extended to find all standard exceptions.
