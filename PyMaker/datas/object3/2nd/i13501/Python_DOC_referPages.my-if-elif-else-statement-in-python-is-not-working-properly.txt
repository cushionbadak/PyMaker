Here is my code:When I run this function, and input any of the 4 options (1,2,3,4), the function always skips the 4 if/elif statements and executes the else statement. I can't figure out what is wrong with the code that I posted above. I have tried printing the values of the variables "direction" and "distance" after they have been inputted, and they both printed as the correct values. Directly after that, despite running through the if and elif statements, the else statements was still executed. Any help would be appreciated. 
Two issues here. The first, as noted by the other answers, is that you're comparing an  to a string. So, wrap your s with . The second is that you had  in the last assignment, so even if it got to that case, it would not update the value of . This code should work:
It's because of that  returns a string, thus you need to convert the input to integer to compare with that numbers or just compare with string numbers, Also note that you need to convert the  to integer before putting it in calculation :Note that when you convert an input to an  it can raise an values error so for handling this issue you can use a try-except expression.
That's because the input is a string, but the values in your if loop are integers.Bad:Good:
