I have three lists:How do I make a nested list where ,  and ?
It's not clear what you are asking... but if you just want a list of lists, just append them.If you want all the values put into one list, just concatenate them.If you need something different, you need to make your question more clear.]EDIT based on comment:If you know that all the lists are the same length:
You can use the built-in  function to join multiple iterables together into tuples:Note: please don't use "hungarian notation" for your variable names (, , etc.) -- they're just clutter, specially in a dynamic language like Python.If you need to keep related data grouped together, it's more readable to create a simple container type for it.  is great for this:Now you can refer to stuff by name -- for example,  -- instead of needing to remember the index positions of each attribute.
