Natural Text
I wrote python code to write to a file like this:The list1 is of type (char,int)The problem here is that when I execute this, file doesn't get separated by "\n" as expected. Any idea what is the problem here ? I think it is because of the Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance.(I am using Python 3.4 with "Python Tools for Visual Studio" version 2.2)
If you are on windows the  doesn't terminate a line.Honestly, I'm surprised you are having a problem, by default any file opened in text mode would automatically convert the  to . I have no idea what  is but it must be opening the file in binary mode.Given that is the case you need to explicitly add :Obviously you have to  somewhere.
Figured it out, from here:How would I specify a new line in Python?I had to use "\r\n" as in Windows, "\r\n" will work.
Per 's documentation,  opens the underlying file in binary mode, without line ending conversion. Frankly,  is semi-deprecated; in Python 2.7 and onwards,  (which is the same thing as the builtin  function in Python 3.x) handles 99% of the cases people used to use , but better (faster, and without stupid issues like line endings). If you're reliably running on Python 3, just use plain ; if you need to run on Python 2.7 as well, import  and use .
If you are on windows, try '\r\n'. Or open it with an editor that recognizes unix style new lines.
