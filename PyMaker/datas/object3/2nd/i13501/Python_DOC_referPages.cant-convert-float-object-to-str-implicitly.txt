The problem I am having is that I do not know how to fix this part of my code where I get the I am running python 3.4.3If anyone knows what modules I can import for standard deviation or mean that would be helpful
One or more of your variables, at the very least , but extending to , , etc., is a string object. You cannot add a floating point number to the string:You could just use the  module to calculate a mean and standard deviation, however; there is both a  and a  function available. Just make sure all your variables are proper floats:Note that it'll be much easier to deal with one variable holding a list of those values rather than use 12 separate variables.
I have made the same mistake myself many times. Just remember: You can't add different data types together. Here is a great way to combine them though:Hope this helps!
