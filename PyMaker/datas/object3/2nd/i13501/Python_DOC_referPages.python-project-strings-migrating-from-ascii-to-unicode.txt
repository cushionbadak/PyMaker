Ive got some lazy trouble about pythons strings.I have a project with python 2.x and all strings we have there are .Now we want to move this strings to unicode without taking extra libraries like   or moving to  or using .And i have to click this all through project to change  to . But not all strings i need to change, for example fields of object i do not want to change: A question: is there a way to make it automatic? And i have stacked with a next problem my regex  catches  middle section which are not a string. For now i have next replacements:  --> 
is there a way to make it automatic?If you mean -- is there a program that may decide what type of string (Unicode (), bytestring (), or native ()) should be used in a specific place in an arbitrary program -- then no: there is no such program -- you should inspect each and every case very carefully.
