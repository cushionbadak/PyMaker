i wrote a bash script that is basicly a wrapper for the commands nsupdate/rndc.  It checks the status of dns servers, querys them, then add/remove records,cname,reverse, etc.Problem is.... it's a big pile of shell commands that is going everywhere.  It's not too pretty and a nightmare to maintain.I've come across the dnsupdate python library (http://www.dnspython.org/) which to me does everything i'm doing but better.  So i would like to recode everything in python.I'm fairly new in python (I know the language structure but just never did a big project like this) and i'm stubbling right from the start with the command line opts.I've read the argparse python doc but not sure it's the way to go.  In shell a simple getopt and a case does the trick but how does python handle cmd line options?With some opt values being forward or reverse or the dreaded --force at the end to bypass all the dns query checks.Now this is my try with getopt but that doesn't seem to be a very good start:Simply put:  How do you guys handle a long list of args + values at the command line?
In the The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python there is a page dedicated to libraries for helping you with building console applications. I recommend you use Click and the author does a good job explaining why.
