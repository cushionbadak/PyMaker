I have MAC address that I want to send to dpkt as raw data. dpkt package expect me to pass the data as hex stings.So, assuming I have the following mac address:    , written as:     and I want to encode in to something like     and the backward translation will provide the original data.On Python 2, I found couple of ways to do that using     and decode('hex').However this solution isn't working for Python 3. I'm haveng some trouble finding a code-snippet to support that on both versions.I'd appriciate help on this.Thanks
 module works on both Python 2 and 3:
On python3 encoding between arbitrary codecs must be done using the  module:This will only work with , not with  (unicode) objects. It will also work in python2.7, where  is  and the -prefix does nothing.
