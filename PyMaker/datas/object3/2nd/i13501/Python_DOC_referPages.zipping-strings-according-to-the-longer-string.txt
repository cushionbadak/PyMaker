Given 2 strings:I'd like to have a result of  So far I've tried 2 ways and both of them are returning only 4 items  Map approach:result:Zip approach:result:Map method looks closer to what I'm looking for
You can use  which accepts a  argument :If you want to do this without importing a library you can have a look at  source code.And you might note that this is the most pythonic way to do such task.By the way you can use another approaches which are not pythonic and efficient, for example you can use  to fill the  with a special character and makes its size equal to  then zip them and use a list comprehension to get the expected output :
No imports is a strange request, however:orimporting itertools is a far better solution
Program declares two variables a and b.Declares an empty listStarts a for loop assuming variable (a) is longer (you can always write an if statement to check which one is longer if need be) increases integer i from 0 to the length of (a)Then add the letters at the same position in (a) and (b) and append to the empty list you created. returns the part of the string between the start and the end-1 position.
