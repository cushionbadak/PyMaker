I'm going over other people's code in CoderByte exercises. I was just reviewing the first exercise to review a string. Here is the code:I printed ar after the first line and just got the string back so I'm unclear how the bytearray helped. I also still didn't understand it after reading the documentation here: https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#bytearraySo what is a bytearray? Did it make sense to use it in this example?  
As the doc says,Return a new array of bytes. ... is a mutable sequence of integers in the range 0 <= x < 256For example,and  is the ASCII side of .Class  has the method , but  doesn't. In order to reverse the string, this code first gets its bytes array, and then reserves, finally gets the reversed string by .In addition, you can use  to reverse a string.
The difference between a str and a bytearray is that a  is a sequence of Unicode code points, whereas a  is a sequence of bytes. A single Unicode String may be represented by multiple different s, depending on the encoding format (e.g. there would be different s for the UTF-8 representation and the UTF-16 representation of the same ). In addition,  is intended to represent text; by contrast,  may be used to represent arbitrary byte sequences that do not correspond to text at all (e.g. sequences of bytes that are not valid Unicode in any standard encoding format and that will, in fact, be interpreted as something completely different from text altogether such as integer sequences, serialized objects, extended precision integers, or anything else you would want to represent as a sequence of bytes).In addition to this distinction,  is immutable whereas  is mutable. This means that transformations on  necessarily perform copying operations; by contrast, the contents of a  may be updated / modified in place.In this particular example, there really is no reason to use a  (and in fact, doing that is more dangerous than using a reversed slice of , because  reverses the underlying bytes... for characters that are encoded by more than one byte, this may result in totally invalid Unicode sequences when interpreting back into Unicode code points). However, if you want to examine or manipulate the encoded form of a string or perform something that is totally unrelated to raw text (like populate the bytes of a datagram packet), that would be a use case for .
I don't see how it helped personally. You can do this type of reversal natively with a string by just slicing it with a step size of -1:I timed the bytearray version and this version using Python 2.7.10 and didn't see one being faster than the other.So I guess it is a different approach, but I don't see it as a better approach.The only advantage I could see is if the string were unicode and you are using Python 2.x instead of 3.x (because Python 2.x strings were not natively unicode). However, to pull a unicode string into a bytearray, you need to specify the encoding, which wasn't done here. So it must not have been for that purpose.
