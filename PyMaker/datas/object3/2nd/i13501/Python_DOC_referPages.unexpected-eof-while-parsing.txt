So i was trying to create a simple calculator and i thought that there isn't anything wrong with this code but when i ran the code, it said that there's SyntaxError : unexpected EOF while parsing ([string], line 1)  and i tried several changes but i still can't see the mistake, please help me??  
Your line is valid, both in Python 2 and 3 but it makes sense in Python 3 only.There has been a change in the behavior of input between versions.In Python 2 you have to use  instead:Read the docs at https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/functions.html#input and https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input for details.
You need to use  for python versions < 3.0. You may want to check behavior of input
