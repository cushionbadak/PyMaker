I have a nested list as:[[A,B,A,A],[C,C,B,B],[A,C,B,B]]..... so onI need to print number of A's, B's and C's in each nested list. And also print total number of elements in each nested list:Can anyone please tell me how to code this in python?
You can use :
A simple, easy to understand way to do it would be to just check for A, B, and C and add 1 to a counter. Happy coding, and best of luck!
Using collections.Counter seems to be a cleanest way.However, you can try this, the idea is to use a dictionary to keep track of number of times each element appears. (untested code though).
