I have a TypeClass to make Class:but when use it :raise Error :if Change it like :it will works okey ! where is problem ?
The  method is passed 3 positional arguments in ; the class name, the baseclasses and the class body. The  argument is bound to the metaclass, so  here.You are adding another name to that sequence; drop the name, or remove the first argument from :orThe  argument is the metaclass object however, so unless you want all your classes to be called  I'd stick with the first option.See the Customizing class creation section of the Python data model:These steps will have to be performed in the metaclass’s  method –  can then be called from this method to create a class with different properties. This example adds a new element to the class dictionary before creating the class:and the  documentation: is a static method (special-cased so you need not declare it as such) that takes the class of which an instance was requested as its first argument. The remaining arguments are those passed to the object constructor expression (the call to the class).where class of which an instance was requested is your metaclass (producing a class object).Demo:
