For example, I have a string like . And now I want to match . So I write a script like this:And the output is this:I don't understand, doesn't  not greedy?
The round brackets in a regex pattern must be escaped with  to match literal round brackets:See demoA "raw" string literal does not mean that you do not have to escape special regex characters but it means you can use just one backslash to escape them, not two.See this excerpt from 6.2.5.8. Raw String Notation:Raw string notation  keeps regular expressions sane. Without it, every backslash () in a regular expression would have to be prefixed with another one to escape it. For example, the two following lines of code are functionally identical:The docs say usually, but it does not mean you have to use raw string literals every time.It is true that  is a lazy pattern, it means match 1 or more characters other than a newline, but as few as possible.
You need to escape  and  like this:  and this The first one will match until it finds the last possible , the other one i non-greedy and will stop at the first  
The dialect of regular expressions used in the  module can't support arbitrary nested parentheses therefore  that matches everything except parentheses is always valid here.Note: you don't need to escape  inside  that defines a set of characters.
