I'm using a library that returns a generator.  Is there a way to start at a particular iteration without using multiple next () statement?In a simple for loop, I could do the following.In a generator, I couldn't do as shown above.  Instead I'll have to use multiple next () statements to start at the 3rd index.  When attempting to do the same as the for loop, I get an error that said, "generator is not scriptable."
 does this, but in reality, it's just invoking  for you over and over (though at the C layer in CPython, so it's faster than doing it manually).
Yes, you can use  , which can slice the generator as you want -Please note, though you are not manually doing the multiple  , it is being internally done by  . You cannot reach at the required index until you iterate till it (islice just does that for you , instead of you have to write multiple  , etc).The signature of  is -itertools.islice(iterable, stop)  itertools.islice(iterable, start, stop[, step])The first argument is always the iterable, then if you pass in only 2 arguments, second argument is interpreted as the  index (exclusive, meaning it does not return the  index element).If there are 3 or 4 arguments to it , second argument is treated as the start index (index) , third argument as the  (exclusive) , and if fourth argument is specified its treated as the  value.
