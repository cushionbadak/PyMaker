a simple example:run with error when do  in :if I change a variable name:it get the right result:and I tried many variable name, some ok, some error.Why different instance name, will cause multiprocessing module be None in ?
The code raises if the global variable  is deleted before  gets deleted.In general, the order in which objects are deleted is not predictable. However, per the docs:Starting with version 1.5, Python guarantees that globals whose name begins with a single underscore are deleted from their module before other globals are deleted; if no other references to such globals exist, this may help in assuring that imported modules are still available at the time when the  method is called.Therefore, if you name the instance  (with an underscore), then you can be assured that its  will be called before  is deleted:yieldsOther methods of ensuring a  method is called before the module is deleted include using using a context managersaving a reference to the module as an attribute of .
