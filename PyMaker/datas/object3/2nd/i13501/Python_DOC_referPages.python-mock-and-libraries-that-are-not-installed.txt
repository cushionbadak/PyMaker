I am working on software for a robot, which is normally run on the Raspberry Pi. Let's consider the imports of two files: (runs the motors):and  (communicates with the server and relays commands to the motors):Both files are in a directory called , which contains a  and a . The  package cannot be installed on non-RPi devices. However, I still want to test the functionality of .Originally, I tried  at LocA, but that failed because it tried to import Motor, and then import GPIO from RPi, which doesn't exist. I also tried  at LocB (including adding  after , and imported  at LocC, but that failed as well. I tried mocking  at LocA, too, but it didn't work either.How do you mock out a library that is not installed on your system?
You can use  to patch  and mock  module as showed in pointed documentation.Use follow code at the top of your test module:In Python3 you have same behavior. In your specific case use  is little bit overkill; maybe you aren't interested in patch context and original state recover. So you can simplify it by set  directly:
