It's trivial to turn this into eliminating all repeating elements:Note: you can use  (py2) or  (py3) if  as a filler causes an issue.
My previous answer was a dud so here's another attempt using . This is reasonably efficient with O(n) time complexity:Output
Kind of complicated, but it works and it's being done in a single loop:
