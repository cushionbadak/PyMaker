Taken from the "logging cookbook":And you're good to go.P.S. Make sure to read the logging HOWTO as well.
I prefer to use a configuration file. It allows me to switch logging levels, locations, etc without changing code when I go from development to release. I simply package a different config file with the same name, and with the same defined loggers.Here is my code for the log config file
