Note: This is Python 3, there is no urllib2.  Also, I've tried using json.loads(), and I get this error: I get this error if I use json.loads() and remove the .read() from response:>Does not work... I have no idea why.
Try this:
Use  not .( loads from a file-like object,  from a string. So you could just as well omit the  call instead.)
I'm not familiar with python 3 yet, but it seems like urllib.request.urlopen().read() returns a byte object rather than string.You might try to feed it into a StringIO object, or even do a str(response).
I got the same error {AttributeError: 'bytes' object has no attribute 'read'} in python3.This worked for me later without using json:
