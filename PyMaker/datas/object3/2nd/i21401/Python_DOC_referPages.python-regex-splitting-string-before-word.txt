I am trying to split a string in python before a specific word. For example, I would like to split the following string before . split string before input: output: I have tried This does not split the string anywhere. The trouble is that the values after  will never be known to specify the whole word. Does anyone know how to do this?
using a regular expression to split your string seems a bit overkill: the string  method may be just what you need.anyway, if you really need to match a regular expression in order to split your string, you should use the  method, which splits a string upon a regular expression match.also, use a correct regular expression for splitting:the  group is a lookahead assertion: the expression matches a space (note the space at the start of the expression) which is followed by the string , without consuming what follows the space.
You could do  instead of using a regex. (note that we skip first match, that has no "path:" prefix.

This can be done without regular expressons.  Given a string:We can temporarily replace the desired word with a placeholder. The placeholder is a single character, which we use to split by:Now that the string is split, we can rejoin the original word to each sub-string using a list comprehension:
