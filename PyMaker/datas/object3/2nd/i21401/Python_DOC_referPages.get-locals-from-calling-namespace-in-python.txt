I want to retrieve the local variables from Python from a called function. Is there any way to do this? I realize this isn't right for most programming, but I am basically building a debugger. For example:What do I put in the body of ? If I have to modify the calling statement, what is the minimal modification I can make?Note: this must work when  is in a different module to its caller.
If you're writing a debugger, you'll want to make heavy use of the  module:
You use the python builtin, dir() or vars():vars(object)For examples using dir(), see: this postExamples using vars:A potentially problematic fact: New style classes not return the same resultAlso: for an instantiated class (new and old style), if you add a variable after instantiating, vars will return the object's dict like this:See:  http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#vars
