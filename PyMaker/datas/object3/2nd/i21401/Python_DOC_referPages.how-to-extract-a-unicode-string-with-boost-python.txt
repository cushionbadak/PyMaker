It seems that the code will crash when I do  Anyone know how to solve this?
This compiles and works for me, with your example string and using Python 2.x:You can write a specific from-python converter, if you wish to auto-convert  (@Python2.x) to  or to a type from ICU (that seems to be the common recommendation for dealing with Unicode on C++).If you want full support to unicode characters which are not in the ASCII range (for example, accented characters such as ,  or , you will need to write the from-python converter. Note this will have to be done separately for Python 2.x and 3.x, if you wish to support both. For Python 3.x, the PyUnicode type was deprecated and now the string type works as  used to for Python 2.x. Nothing that a couple of  cannot handle.[edit]The above comment was wrong. Note that, since Python 3.x treats unicode strings as normal strings,  will wrap that into  objects. I have not verified how those are handled w.r.t. unicode translation in this case.
