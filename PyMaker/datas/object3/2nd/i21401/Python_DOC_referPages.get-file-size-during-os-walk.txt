I am using  to compare two folders, and see if they contain the exact same files.  However, this only checks the file names.  I want to ensure the file sizes are the same, and if they're different report back.  Can you get the file size from ?
The same way you get file size without using , with . You just need to remember to join with the root:
os.path.getsize(path) can give you the filesize of the file, but having two files the same size does not always mean they are identical. You could read the content of the file and have an MD5 or Hash of it to compare against.
As others have said: you can get the size with . However for doing comparisons between dirs you can use dircmp.
FYI, there is a more efficient solution in Python 3:See os.DirEntry for more details about the variable . Note that the above is not recursive (subfolders will not be explored). In order to get an -like behaviour, you might want to use something like:and use it as
