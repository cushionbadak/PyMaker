I'm using python dictionary to calculate time between two events happening, however based on my approach I'm getting output duplicated.  Here is my input data (note the most recent, the first row will not be in output as cannot calc time after as there is not another event):I take the data and create a dictionary here by users activity:Here is my code:Here is the output (notice repeated values):
You should use  and  to get unique values 
Learn how to step through code; it's one of the most important skills for an early developer to learn.  Tools like pdb can help, but this is something you can and should do with paper and pencil first.Let's evaluate what will happen inside the code you posted:Good.  Based on the detail you showed us, we'll at some point be evaluating Ok, this isn't bad, either.  In the case of , this should give us , and that means  will go from 0 through 2, inclusive.This is where things get really questionable.  When  == 0, you then get the following, (assuming what you showed us of  is accurate):when a == 1:and when a == 2:And that's all the output you should have, if you posted the accurate code.  If you're getting a fourth value, it's not from this loop, but I'm sure you can see how using the invalid ranges is causing problems, and this is likely the cause of what happens when you run with the real data.  Note that indexing on a negative number is not bad; list[-1] returns the last item in the list and list[-2] returns the second from last item in the list.  In this case, though, it's certainly not the behavior you want.To solve this, change the way you look ahead.  You're already checking that the length should be greater than 1.  Take advantage of that the proper way:
