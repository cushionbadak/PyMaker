I have a simple question here: gives us:in other words, why and how is the escape character  turning into ?Is there some purpose here? Is this some encoding thing?Why does python return one representation over another?
So  have special meanings, and  is a character which is hex value .  The following (and others) are equivalent:This is because a tab is encoded as 9, etc.  And in general, Python will show you the most general representation, which is the hexadecimal value for a character, if it can not show you the character itself.(String Literal Docs)
