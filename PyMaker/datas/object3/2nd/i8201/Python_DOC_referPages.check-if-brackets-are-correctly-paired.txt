I have lists of brackets, like How can I compare the first element with the last element, then the next element with the next last, using a for loop?My solution is like but this returns the wrong result for .
You are doing 3 things wrong in your code:you are always returning for the first check; you need to postpone judgement until you tested all pairs.you are not using the  counter, so your loop only ever tests the very first and very last elementyou need to map left brackets to right brackets;  is never going to be true, but the pairing is correct.I wouldn't bother with a counter, use  and  to pair up elements from the start and end; you only need to test the first half of :Demo:Testing for a single dimension of nesting is usually not enough however. Most real-world situations will contain multiple groupings, like  (note the ,  and ,  pairs are not nested!). If you need to match such a situation, you'll need to use a stack:This then still correctly detects your cases, *but also returns  for my counter example:
Your mistakes here are:Using index 0 and -1 instead of i.Comparing the opening to closing bracketsSo, here's my solution:I use stack for opening bracket and if it find a closing bracket, it will pop the stack. At last, check whether the stack is cleared out or not.Test results using your test case
