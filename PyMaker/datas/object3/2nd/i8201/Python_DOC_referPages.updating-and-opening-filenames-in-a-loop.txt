Basically, the problem I'm have is trying to open multiple files in a for loop. The filename has this format:With '20160104' being the date, which I know how to update in the loop. The problem is that the '18' attached at the end isn't constant for every file, and I don't know how it changes, unlike the dates. I was wondering is there is a way to update the number, and check if the file exists in my directory.As always, any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
You can use the  function with a suitable filename pattern to get a list of files (that exist) which match the pattern.For example:
Checks if the file exists and if it does you can load it and save it how ever you want else it will print the the file doesn't exist
