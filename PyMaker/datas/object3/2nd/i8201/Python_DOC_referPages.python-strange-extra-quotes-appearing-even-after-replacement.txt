So basically I'm working on File/IO practice with some dictionary shenanigans and whenever I have a string inside my returning tuple value in my dictionary entry it has extra quotes even if I use .replace. It gets a little weird in the middle because in the file has a bunch of Pokemon and "stats" separated by commas and sometimes the names have a comma so I made it operate by how long the list was after the split by comma
Python  is immutable;  returns a new string, it doesn't change the existing string. Replaced, then threw away the result.You need to assign the result for the quotes to be stripped, e.g. replacing:with:Note: If you're just trying to strip leading and trailing quotes, I'd suggest  which is specialized for removing characters from the ends (without checking the middle).
