I'm trying to dynamically add some data to a dictionary in python which I then convert to a json formatted string.the id and power need to be added dynamically how would I achieve this with python? How would I read the same json format as well?
that's an invalid construct in both JSON and Pythonit should be something likegrouping all the dicts {_id: ..., power: ...} in a listtaken care of that, converting from JSON to dict and vice-versa one could use the  and  methods from the  or  packages
