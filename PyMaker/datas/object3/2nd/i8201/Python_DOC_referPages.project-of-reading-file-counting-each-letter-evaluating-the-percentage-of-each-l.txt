I tried these codes but they are \ not working properly.It is showing the file in vertical lines and not showing the percentages properly what do I have to do for it?I just did what our teacher asked us but its not working.
So here's how I would actually write this program:As you can see, I'm not writing  and  statements for every letter, but rather using loops to minimize the code required.Most lines are commented, but if you have any questions let me know. Also I wrote this in Python3 and converted it back to Python2.* (which I believe is what you're using), so their might be slight errors.
