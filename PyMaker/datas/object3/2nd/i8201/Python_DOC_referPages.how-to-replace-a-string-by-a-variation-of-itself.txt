Natural Text
The idea is to replace numbers with themselves, but with any commas () in them removed from a text where there are also commas for separating sentences.From -> To -> 
We look for commas  who are directly preceded and followed by a digit (). We don't want to capture the digits in the group that will be replaced, so we use:(?<=...)  Matches if the current position in the string is preceded by  a match for ... that ends at the current position.This is called a  positive lookbehind assertion.and(?=...)  Matches if ... matches next, but doesnâ€™t consume any of the  string. This is called a lookahead assertion.See Regular expression syntax for reference.
