I try to read subprocess line by line:It works, yet at some point I get error:Is there any way to add/specify encoding for stdout of subprocess? I would like to add error "ignoring".Is there any other way to fix this?
You could just set the  keyword argument to  to . From the documentation:If encoding or errors are specified, or universal_newlines is true, the file objects stdin, stdout and stderr will be opened in text mode using the encoding and errors specified in the call or the defaults for .However, it is clear your process doesn't use UTF-8 to encode its output. You may want to figure out if a) it can be configured to produce a different encoding, or b) what encoding is used and configure that instead (using the  keyword argument to ).
