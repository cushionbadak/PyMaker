How do you kill PDB and the program it's running, similar to LLDB's  or  commands?Ctrl+D isn't working and all the questions I see on here are how to exit while keeping the program running. However, I'm sitting in a PDB session and I found a bug that is causing an endless loop, and while there are indeed other things I can do to kill the program I figured I'd ask what the PDB command is to do it.
The pdb command to kill the program is , or . Quoting the docs:q(uit)  Quit from the debugger.
