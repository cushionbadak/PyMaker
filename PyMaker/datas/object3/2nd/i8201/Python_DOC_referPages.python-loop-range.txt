Can someone explain to me how to fix this program?I'm trying to make a temperature table in increments of 10 degrees celsius converted to fahrenheit, but the two columns are misaligned (32°F should correspond to 0°C, not 10°C).I'm very new to programming so I didn't know what to search up when I came across this problem.
As noted in a comment by TemporalWolf, you calculate  for a given  value, but print the  increased by 10.One solution would be to print the two values first, and then add 10 to the Celsius value.But a better approach would be not to "manually" increment  and instead deriving it from the loop variable :Another way would be to generate the  values directly using the optional step parameter of :(You need to choose a stop value higher than 110 so that 110 is included in the range.)
I actually wrote a calculation program sort of like this for a class so maybe I can help. It's hard to tell what exactly you are trying to fix without you explaining but here are some problems I see.First off your equation to calculate Celsius is fine in this situation but just for safe measures I'd advise putting parenthesis around the multiplication especially for when you start writing more complicated formulas it makes sure python does the operations in the correct order you want.Secondly, you should flip the print statement and the Celsius statement. You are telling python to add 10 for the next loop before it prints what Celsius degree you converted into Fahrenheit. Also to make it simpler use  instead of Besides that the rest looks good. Good job far keep it up and soon you won't believe what you can do with programming!
