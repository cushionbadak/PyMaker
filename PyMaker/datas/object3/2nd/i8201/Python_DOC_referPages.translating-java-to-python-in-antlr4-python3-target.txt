I used antlr4 to generate a python target using the Python3.g4 grammar file from the antlr grammars repo. The generated Python3Lexer.py file contained Java code which I needed to translate to python. Here are the two java segments it outputted, you can find them both inside the python3 grammar file here also and I translated these myself to:andand this is my python script to run the antlr output with the python inside instead of the java snippets. Ran with the command It errors and print the following tracethe input file looks like:I'm not sure if I translated the python incorrectly or the recursive algorithm is simply too much for python, but I also can't figure out how to change the algorithm for the nextToken method to be iterative since it is not tail recursive. Maybe someone could figure that out? Or is there some other problem with what I'm doing?
I'm working exactly on the same topic from a couple of days.This is not as easy. The Python runtime has not exactly the same API than the java one. Python runtime is less used and quite incomplete. I had to use some workarounds, but it seems to work. Here is my code :And for the NEWLINE lexer part :You also have to replace in the whole file the lexer id "str" by "string" (for instance) because str is a keyword in python.
Your python code saysBut your java code says:Note that  is not the same as  You probably mean something like:
I had the same problem.  I couldn't quite get Alexandre's code working under python3.  I had to modify it a bit:You can also move all of the imports into the lexer's header:
