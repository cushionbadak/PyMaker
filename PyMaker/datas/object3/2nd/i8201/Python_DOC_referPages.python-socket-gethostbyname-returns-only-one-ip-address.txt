Friends, I'm doing some simple experiments using python socket, where I've a HOSTNAME which resolves with two IP addresses but when I use,      I'm getting only one IP address. why it's showing that way? is there any other way I can get multiple IP addresses? Please guide me.Thanks in Advance!EDIT - 1I Got it guys, Instead of  I tried   It gives the result as i expected.Thanks to All
From the documentation it is visible that:gethostbyname returns only a single IPv4 address. And to cite: See gethostbyname_ex() for a more complete interface.gethostbyname_ex will return multiple IPv4 address, but check out the usage. And to cite: gethostbyname_ex() does not support IPv6 name resolution, and getaddrinfo() should be used instead for IPv4/v6 dual stack support.getaddrinfo will return all IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, but check out the usage.
