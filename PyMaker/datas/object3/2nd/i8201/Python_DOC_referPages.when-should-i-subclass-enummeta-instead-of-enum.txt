In this article Nick Coghlan talks about some of the design decisions that went in to the PEP 435  type, and how  can be subclassed to provide a different  experience.However, the advice I give (and I am the primary stdlib  author) about using a metaclass is it should not be done without a really good reason -- such as not being able to accomplish what you need with a class decorator, or a dedicated function to hide any ugliness; and in my own work I've been able to do whatever I needed simply by using , , and/or normal class/instance methods when creating the  class: with attributesHandling missing membersclass constants that are not  membersAnd then there is this cautionary tale of being careful when delving into , with and without metaclass subclassing:Is it possible to override  in an enum to parse strings to an instance?Given all that, when would I need to fiddle with  itself?
The best (and only) cases I have seen so far for subclassing  comes from these two questions:A more pythonic way to define an enum with dynamic membersPython enum prevent invalid attribute assignmentWe'll examine the dynamic member case further here.First, a look at the code needed when not subclassing :The stdlib wayThe  way 1 2The above code is fine for a one-off enumeration -- but what if creating Enums from JSON files was common for you?  Imagine if you could do this instead:As you can see: is the name of the json file to use is the path to whatever should be used for the name is a dictionary mapping paths to values3 specifies the attribute names for the different value components (if using )The JSON data is taken from https://github.com/lukes/ISO-3166-Countries-with-Regional-Codes -- here is a short excerpt:[{"name":"Afghanistan","alpha-2":"AF","country-code":"004"},{"name":"Ã…land Islands","alpha-2":"AX","country-code":"248"},{"name":"Albania","alpha-2":"AL","country-code":"008"},{"name":"Algeria","alpha-2":"DZ","country-code":"012"}]Here is the  class:A few notes: returns a normal  is used to get an instance of  -- this is the proper way to get onekeys with a leading underscore are passed to the real  first as they may be needed when processing the enum membersEnum members are in the same order as they were in the file1 Disclosure:  I am the author of the Python stdlib , the  backport, and the Advanced Enumeration ()  library.2 This requires .3 The keys are numeric to keep multiple values in order should your  need more than one.
