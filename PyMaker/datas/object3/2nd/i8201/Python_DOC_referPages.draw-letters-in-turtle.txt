I just started learning turtle in python.I am tried to write my name "Idan" (capital letters), but I am stuck on "D".This is my code so far:But when I run it it gives me a small half circle.Is there a way to make it do a half circle that will create a "D"
The main issue you have is that your half-circle starts when the turtle is facing up, rather than to the right. Add a  call just before the  loop and you'll be closer to what you want (you'll get something like a ).After that, you'll need to adjust the  calls inside the loop to make the circle the size you want (or as martineau suggested in a comment, use  instead of your own loop). You might need to do some calculations to figure out the right distances (e.g. multiply your desired diameter by  to get a circumference, then divide by the number of segments you're using to construct it).
Not perfect, made by try and error, but it writes the name:
I would suggest the following in solving a problem like this:Plan out your block font carefully ahead, on paper if needed.  Thesimpler your design, the easier it will be to code.Separate your letters logically in your code -- if not into functionsat this point, at least into separate commented blocks.Have each letter start with the turtle pointing the same directionand adjust as necessary, don't count on the resulting state of the previousletter.Use a virtual coordinate system to simplify your drawing logic andallow the letters to appear in different size windows.  If not with afunction like  then simply via multipliers forthe height and width.Assume in your design that you'll want to add more letters later.Consider what would happen if you wanted to spell "DIAN" instead --how much code would you have to change and how can you keep this to aminimum.My example below uses features you've probably not learned yet and is not meant as a solution for you to use -- it's meant to illustrate the above ideas.  I.e. try changing the window size, the border size, the width and height, rearrange the leters, etc. and see how the results change but still work:OUTPUT
You can use this code instead:`
This might work:It works for me
