I have a class or extension type written in  like this:I created a python module from this  file (which its name is ) using  , then I import this in  and used it to create and train a model , but when I want to save my model using  it gives me this err :TypeError: can't pickle som.Self_Organized_Map objectswhat is wrong with pickle or my code ? does pickle cant save extension object ?
Since Cython 0.26 (released July 2017), cdef classes can automatically be pickled, as long as they do not contain pointers or unions. For classes containing structs, automatic pickling can be enabled with the  decorator. It is disabled by default due to high code overhead an other reasons.More information can be found in the changelog and on the website of Stefan Behnel.
Cython classes aren't pickleable by default, so you need to implement the Pickle interface yourself. There's a number of different levels you can do this on but  and  is the most user-friendly level so it's a good place to start unless you have good reasons otherwise.Where the contents of the class are pickleable it's as easy as returning a tuple of them in  and the reverse operation in . Memoryviews themselves aren't pickleable, but have a  attribute that may be.If your class holds a C or C++ object then it's much more complicated. For simple types good places to start are just copy the memory into a bytearray or to take advantage of Cython's default  interconversion. However if the class contains pointers then this won't work and you need to implement a reliable load/save mechanism for it in C/C++.
