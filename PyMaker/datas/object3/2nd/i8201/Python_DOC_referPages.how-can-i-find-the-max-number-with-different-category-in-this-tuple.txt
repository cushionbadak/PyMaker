You could iterate over your  and derive the min and max values using an . At the end you can re-create the string as I show, but actually you might be better off keeping the dictionary data structure (depends what you want to do next):Example:
A  with a list as default value could help you a lot:It's probably what you wanted to write with  and multiple loops.  is a standard structure and should be fast enough, even with many values.Here's a beginning of a solution with this data structure:For each letter in , you now have a list of corresponding values. It shouldn't be too hard to extract  and  and write the desired list.
you can try this:['A,1,5', 'B,2,5', 'C,2,200']
You can achieve what you intented to do using  from  module and using  like this example:Output:
Might not be the fastest but I think this is easy to read. Can't offer formatting since I'm using Python 3.4.
Basic idea is to split the list on the basis of it's headers i.e. A, B, C...and find the min and max for each of them. Below is one way to do so:
