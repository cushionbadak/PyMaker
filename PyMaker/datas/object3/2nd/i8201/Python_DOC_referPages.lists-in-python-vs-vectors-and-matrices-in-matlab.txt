Coming from Matlab I am unable to even think of singular datapoints / variables. Anything I deal with is a matrix / array. After one week of searching and insuccesful trial and error I realise, that I ABSOLUTELY do NOT get the concept of dealing with matrices in (plain) Python. I createdTrying to extract the vectors in the matrix along the two dimensions: 'surprisingly' gives the same! No way to get a specific column (of course, except with one by one iteration).Consequently, I am unable to manage merging matrix A with another vector, i.e. extending A with another column. Matlab style approach obviously is odd:Results in something nested, not an extension of A. Same for Ok, more Python-like:This easily adds a row. But is there a similar way to add a column??(The frustrating thing is that Python doc gives all kinds of fancy examples but apparently these focus on demonstrating 'pythonic' solutions for one-dimensional lists.)
Coming from MATLAB myself, I understand your point.The problem is that Python lists are not designed to serve as matrices. When indexing a list, you always work on the top level list elements, e.g.  returns all the () three list elements, namely ,  and . Then you select the second () element from those, i.e. .  does the same, just the other way round.This being said, you can still use nested lists for simple indexing tasks, as  gives the expected result (8). However, if you are planing to migrate your whole MATLAB code to Python or work on non-trivial matrix problems, you should definitely consider using NumPy. There is even a NumPy guide for former MATLAB users.
