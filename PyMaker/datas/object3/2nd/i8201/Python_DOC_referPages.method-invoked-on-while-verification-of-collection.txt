Suppose I have a list . In the following code:in the  statement, what method of the list  is invoked? Is it the  method? 
In Python 3.x, it's  or :Called to implement truth value testing and the built-in operation  ; should return  or . When this method is not  defined,  is called, if it is defined, and the object is  considered true if its result is nonzero. If a class defines neither   nor , all its instances are considered true.In 2.x it was named ; see what's new in 3.0.
From python's documentation:Any object can be tested for truth value, for use in an  or  condition or as operand of the Boolean operations below. The following values are considered false:(...)any empty sequence, for example, , , .(...)instances of user-defined classes, if the class defines a  or  method, when that method returns the integer zero or  value . [Additional information on these special methods may be found in the Python Reference Manual (Basic customization).]All other values are considered true â€” so objects of many types are always true.Operations and built-in functions that have a Boolean result always return  or  for false and  or  for true, unless otherwise stated. (Important exception: the Boolean operations  and  always return one of their operands.)
Yes,  does get called in this case.Let's see this code snippet:Output:But, if I remove the method,  the code will run just fine, but won't print anything. So yes,  does get called.
