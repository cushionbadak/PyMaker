I want to write a custom logger for a set of tests without making any significant changes to the tests. I would like to use something like a fixture that I can just pass to the test method and the fixture runs in the background during the entire duration of the test capturing stdout and stderr and changing it to custom messages. How can this be done ?What I want is
You can't capture the stdout from within the module without redefining either  or . Redefining print is easier, as it is a function already. And to catch the failed s, just catch s.But, s don't really give much helpful information. I would use an actual test library, like .An alternative would be to run it as a subprocess.
