Natural Text
I am attempting to open two files and check if the first word in file_1 is in any line in file_2. If the first word in a line from file_1 matches the first word in a line in file_2 I'd like to print both lines out. However, with the below code I am not getting any result. I will be dealing with very large files so I'd like to avoid putting the files in to memory using a list or dictionary. I can only use the built in functions in Python3.3. Any advice would be appreciated? Also if there is a better way please also advise.Steps I am trying to perform:1.) Open file_12.) Open file_23.) Check if the first Word is in ANY line of file_2.4.) If the first word in both files match print the line from both file_1 and file_2.Contents of files:Code Attempt:Desired Output:

I would actually heavily suggest against storing data in 1GB sized text files and not in some sort of database/standard data storage file format. If your data were more complex, I'd suggest CSV or some sort of delimited format at minimum. If you can split and store the data in much smaller chunks, maybe a markup language like XML, HTML, or JSON (which would make navigation and extraction of data easy) which are far more organized and already optimized to handle what you're trying to do (locating matching keys and returning their values).That said, you could use the "readline" method found in section 7.2.1 of the Python 3 docs to efficiently do what you're trying to do: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-file.Or, you could just iterate over the file:This is not really the best/most efficient way to go about this: ALL matches are saved to a list object in memoryThere is no handling of duplicatesNo speed optimizationIteration over file 'b' occurs 'n' times, where 'n' is the number of lines in file 'a'. Ideally, you would only iterate over each file once.Even only using base Python, I'm sure there is a better way to go about it.For the Gist: https://gist.github.com/MetaJoker/a63f8596d1084b0868e1bdb5bdfb5f16I think the Gist also has a link to the repl.it I used to write and test the code if you want a copy to play with in your browser.
