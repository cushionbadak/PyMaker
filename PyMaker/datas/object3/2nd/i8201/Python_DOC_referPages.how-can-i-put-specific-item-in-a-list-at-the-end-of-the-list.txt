I have a list like below:  and I want to push all zeroes to the beginning of that list. The result must be like below.  How to do it in Python 2?
You could sort the list:The  function tells Python to sort values by wether or not they are .  is sorted before , and values are then sorted based on their original relative position.For ,  is returned, sorting all those values first. For the rest  is returned, leaving sort to put them last but leave their relative positions untouched.Demo:
This can be done without sorting. SolutionsInitialization: and Same as before, but without , , , Same as the previous one, but without BenchmarksFor small lists:For large lists:As you can see, in some cases -based solutions tend to be slower, because of the big number of function calls.
Here are some better timings, with two new methods:First the sorting:Then frostnational's methods:Then methods more directly working from lists:And again with larger sized input:Sorting:frostnational's:New:That said, despite being relatively slow, Martijn Pieters' decision to use sorting is actually pretty competitive for reasonably-sized lists and premature optimisation is the root of all evil.FWIW, here are some timings for very long lists:
Try this simple process:-
