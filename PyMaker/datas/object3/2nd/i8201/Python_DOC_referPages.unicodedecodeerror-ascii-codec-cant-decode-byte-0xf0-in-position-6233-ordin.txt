I'm working on a new project but I can't fix the error in the title.Here's the code:
The error occurred because of .encode which works on a unicode object. So we need to convert the byte string to unicode string using       So the code will be:
Try this
The error message is self explainatory: there is a byte 0xf0 in an input string that is expected to be an ascii string.You should have given the exact error message and on what line it happened, but I can guess that is happened on , because  expects either a unicode string or an ascii byte string.The first question is why you call  on data coming from youtube, because the doc for the Python Standart Library says:Parse a query string given as a string argument (data of type application/x-www-form-urlencoded). Data are returned as a dictionary. The dictionary keys are the unique query variable names and the values are lists of values for each name.So you are going to parse this on  and  character to interpret it as a query string in the form  to give .If you know why you want that, you should first decode the byte string into a unicode string, using the proper encoding, or if unsure  which is able to accept any byte:
This code is rather weird indeed. You are using query parser to parse contents of a web page.So instead of using parse_qs you should be using something like this.
