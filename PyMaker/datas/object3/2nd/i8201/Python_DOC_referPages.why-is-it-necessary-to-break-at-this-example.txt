Natural Text
I was trying to make my own way to solve finding product of a,b,c for a+b+c = 1000 and a^2 + b^2 = c^2.I did end up finding the method by myself, however it lead me to another question about how this thing is working.My first attempt didn't includeFor some reason, my code won't finish and run forever. so I just decided to add it at the end it worked. That is great. but, I'm wondering why a break is necessary there. Doesn't first break stops the loop after finding the answer? why is it necessary to put second break with the same condition?. even without the break, isn't it suppose to end naturally when a becomes > 333?I just started learning python yesterday, please help me improve :).
From the docs: terminates the nearest enclosing loop, skipping the optional else clauseThis means only your inner  loop gets aborted, your outer while loop would continue endlessly.Regarding your question:even without the break, isn't it suppose to end naturally when a becomes > 333?The problem is, when you  out of the inner loop, the  part does not get executed, so your  stays the same. On the next run of the outer loop, the solution is found again, breaking the inner loop, not incrementing ...
 breaks the inner loop, it's like saying: we found what we need, stop calculating more values.. The outer  loop will continue looping after exiting the inner  loop. If the condition of  is false inside the inner loop, then deduct 1 from  and . This deduction will continue up until the condition:  is satisfied (true) and hence  gets executed or the condition in the inner  loop header becomes false. Clearly, whenever  is greater than 0, break the outer loop.
