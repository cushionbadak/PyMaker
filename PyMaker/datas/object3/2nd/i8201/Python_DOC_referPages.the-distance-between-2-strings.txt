Hi this is from a previous test and i was wondering how to do itthank youWe can define the distance between two strings as the number of positions at which the correspondingcharacters are different. For example, the distance between the strings “find” and “fund” is 1 since only theWrite a program that will input two strings from the user and will determine and output the distancebetween the strings i.e. how many characters, in corresponding positions of each string,are the different. Your program must output only the distance as defined above.“karolin” “kathrin” distance 3 positions 2,3,4“karolin” “Kerstin” distance 3 positions 1,3,4 etc“1011101” “1001001” 2  2,4“2173896” “2233796” 3  1,2,4“ABCD” “ABCDEF” 2  4,5“efghi” “efg” 2  3,4“The quick!” “the Quick?” 1  9
A simple solution would be as follows:  and  define the strings that you will be working with. You can get these from the user using input() and raw_input for Python3 and 2 respectively. Now for the brunt of the code in :Zip() will 'zip' the inputs together, grouping corresponding elements from each together. In this case,  would give us .  will iterate through these pairings, assigning  to the first entry and  to second. We then compare them with an  statement, . We use  to convert the character to lower case; otherwise, 'k' and 'K' would not be considered equal. (You could also just call  on the strings immediately after they are entered.)All of this inside the square brackets  is called a list comprehension. Since you now understand the subparts, as a whole, it is saying 'insert a  into a list for every x, y pair in the zipped list if x and y are not the same letter'. This gives us a list containing a bunch of the integer , in this case, [1, 1, 1].  for every difference in corresponding character. So, to get the total number of differences, we simply sum all of these values, by calling  on the entire list.
