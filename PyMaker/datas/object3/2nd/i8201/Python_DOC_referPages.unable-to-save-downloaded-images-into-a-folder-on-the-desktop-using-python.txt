I have made a scraper which is at this moment parsing image links and saving downloaded images into python directory by default. The only thing i wanna do now is choose a folder on the desktop to save those images within but can't. Here is what I'm up to:Upon execution the above code throws an error showing: "join() argument must be str or bytes, not 'tuple'"
you can download images with  of python. You can see the official documentation of python here urllib documentation for python 2.7 . If you want to use python 3 then follow this documentation urllib for python 3 
You could use urllib.request, BytesIO from io and PIL Image.(if you have a direct url to the image)
The images are dynamic now. So, I thought to update this post:
This is the code to download the html file from the webThis is the code for downloading any html file from the internet just you have to provide the link in the function.As in your case you have told that you have retrieved the  images links from the web page So you can change the extension from ".html" to compatible type, but the problem is that the image can be of different extension may be ".jpg" , ".png" etc. So what you can do is you can match the ending of the link using if else with string matching and then assign the extension in the end. Here is the example for the illustrationYou can use multiple if else for the various type of the extension.If it helps for your situation have a Thumbs up buddy.
