From Python's source code of , I think  is just a normal function.Why can  we use it like below?Since is neither implements  nor , nor uses  decorator.
You are not using the  function as a context manager. It is the result of the  call expression that is the context manager.  returns a file object, and it is that object that has  and  methods; see the  documentation:IOBase is also a context manager and therefore supports the with statement.You can read the  statement like this:Note that it is the return value of  that ends up being assigned to  here. For file objects,  returns , so you can get access to the same object that way.As a side-note; you got the wrong  function. The actual definition of the  built-in is an alias for , see the  source code. The alias is set in  in  (where  is itself an alias for ). And yes, the documentation states the alias points the other way for end-user ease.
