I have functions like thisCan I make flags for these functions using  like Rightnow I have tried with this codeCan I add flags in the same code??
The end of https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#sub-commands has an example like yours, but with expressions like  (using the actual function instead of the name).  This lets them replace the  stack with .But if you want to use the flagged/optionals style of input rather than subparsers, I'd suggest the following:producesIf the '-a' flag already means , you don't need to include the extra string.  I also used  instead of the separate 'x','y' arguments required by the subparser.  The  or  is a handy way of testing whether a flagged value has been provided.  The user can't enter , so testing for this default default is foolproof.
