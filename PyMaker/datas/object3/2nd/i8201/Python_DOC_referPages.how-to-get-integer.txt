As a new python programmer. I try to create and solve problems myself. I use Python 3.Here's the code:I want to convert the value to integer and print "Nice, you're not greedy, you win" if the number is 50. otherwise print "Nice, you're not greedy, you win".I inspired to create above code based on this code:
You just need add int() to convert to integer, and change '=' (assignment) to '=='(comparing)
if you want to find out if a variable is a an int you can just do this:(works on python 2.7, check on 3..)
