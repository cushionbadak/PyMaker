I have seen the following cases:Why does this difference occur?
All objects1 in Python have a truth value:Any object can be tested for truth value, for use in an  or  condition or as operand of the Boolean operations below. The following values are considered false:zero of any numeric type, for example, , , .any empty sequence, for example, , , .any empty mapping, for example, .instances of user-defined classes, if the class defines a  or  method, when that method returns the integer zero or bool value .All other values are considered true — so objects of many types are always true.1 … unless they have a  method which raises an exception, or returns a value other than  or . The former is unusual, but sometimes reasonable behaviour (for example, see the comment by user2357112 below); the latter is not.
When you type , it is equivalent to . So it doesn't mean that , only that 's representation as a boolean value is .Generally speaking  is a subclass of , where  and .
