i need to ask the user for an input (what problem do you have?)i created a file that has the possible problems as well as possible solutions to these problems.the program should print out the solution if the user input mathces the keyword in the file. here is the code:it works when i use one word keywords. for examplebut it doesnt work if i put a full sentence.for examplei feel like this is happening because i am using a dictonary. although i know this is the rerason , idont know how to fix it. can someone help me pls.here is the file just in case you need it:also i am a newbie at python. so you will have to bear with me with your explanations
You're calling a key directly from the user input. You need to search for the keyword before you try to call the key or you can put in a try except clause to catch exceptions where the key they're calling isn't in the dictionary.
The problem is that your dictionary has an entry for  (or , I'm not sure judging by your code), but not for any complete sentence.You need to identify the keywords that indicate problems in the user input first, then print the solutions stored by your dictionary.Here is a simple demo that should get the point across.(I am assuming that you are using Python 3, if you are using Python 2 use  instead of .)
I'm guessing that your record file looks like:the error might lie in here:The  just split a whole sentence into words, and the  only stores those words as keys.for example:In your code, the datadict is like :which is not what you want
