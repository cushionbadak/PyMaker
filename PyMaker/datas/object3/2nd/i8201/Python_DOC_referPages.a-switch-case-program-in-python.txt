i am struggling to get a switch case program in python,when i run the script i want to display three options Enter your choice : 1.Insert Records 2.Update Records 3.Display Recordsand after seeing these,the user should be able to enter his choice.Since am new to python i googled and found that there is no switch case in python.This is what i tried but its of no use, because it needs to enter choice at the time of running the script(eg. )
Instead of switch/case, you can use a dict, like this: If you want to catch a default case, you can add something like this:Hope this helps. 
Look at the description of sys.argv. It is not used for input in runtime. Rather it is used to pass arguments to script when it is called. So this script:When called with  would print If you want to get user input on executiopn of the program you should use input. Look carefully at the details such as returned value etc.The next issue as makred by Martijn is that python does not have switch-case. You should use  constrcution.
 is a list of strings. You are trying to compare one of those to integers, and that won't work without conversion.In this case, you don't need to convert, just compare to strings instead:You can still convert the string to an integer first, allowing you to do more complex checks:If you are building an interactive menu, then perhaps the command line options are not the best choice here. Use the  function instead so you print prompts and use a series of exchanges. See Asking the user for input until they give a valid response.
It sounds like you want to prompt the user for input. In python 2.x, use  for that. Users enter strings, so I changed what you are looking for. And used  to end the compares after you find a match.
