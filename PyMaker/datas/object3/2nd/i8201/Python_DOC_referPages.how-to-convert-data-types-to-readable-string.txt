I was wondering because I haven't found a working answer to convert data types to readable format.
You should take a look at adding str and repr methods to your data types. strCalled by the str() built-in function and by the print statement to  compute the "informal" string representation of an object.reprCalled by the repr() built-in function and by string conversions  (reverse quotes) to compute the "official" string representation of an  object. If at all possible, this should look like a valid Python  expression that could be used to recreate an object with the same  value (given an appropriate environment).By example:
