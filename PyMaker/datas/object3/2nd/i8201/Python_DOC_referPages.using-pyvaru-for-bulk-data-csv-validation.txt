Am looking for a generic validator module to assist in sanitizing data and importantly, giving back an error log stating why data has been rejected. Am working primarily with CSV files each with an average of 40 columns and with about 40,000 rows. A CSV file would have a mixture of Personal Identifying Information, Contact Information and details about the Account they hold with us wE.g.I need to validate basic stuff like , , , ,  etc. Also there are conditional validations e.g. if an  value has been provided, then the  must also be provided. If it hasn't then I raise an error.Pyvaru provides some basic validation classes. Is it possible to implement both this scenarios of basic validation plus conditional validation with pyvaru? If yes, how would I structure the validations. Must I create objects e.g. Identifier Objects, then Account Objects for me to use pyvaru?
Pyvaru validates python objects (class instances and collections like dictionaries, lists and so on), so starting from a CSV I would convert each record into a dictionary using the DictReader.So, given a CSV like:The validation code would be something like:The example above is just a dumb example of what you can do, specifically it checks that "statecode" column has a max length of 2 and that "eq_site_limit" has a max value of 40k.You can implement your own rules by subclassing the abstract class  and implementing the  method:It's also possible to negate rules using bitwise operators... for example by using the previous custom rule which checks that a string mst contain "hello" you can write:and thus the rule will be valid only if the string DOES NOT contains the "hello" string.It would also possible to validate CSV records, without dictionary conversion by validating each line using a  with a validation regex... but of course you won't know which column value is invalid.
