You can use a regex.  will identify all 6-digit and 3-digit gray hex colors.ExplanationIdentifying 'grey'All grey hex color codes have 3 sets of 2 digits or 3 identical digits. e.g. , , , , , ..... and this is how we can identify them as grey. Determining if string meets 'grey' formatTherefore I would use a regex. The following regular expression will match all strings, that start with a , and contain 3 identical consecutive sets of 2 digit alpha-numeric characters. Hence match all greys.Applying with PythonSee the Python documentation on regular expressions: https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.htmlReferences:http://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/gray-color.htmHow to find 3 or more consecutive characters?Check if string matches patternhttp://www.xcprod.com/titan/XCSB-DOC/hex.htmlBlender's comment about 3-digit hex codes
You could possibly do something likeYou could probably make the code smaller and more efficient, but that's a simple answer, I guess.(This does include only strictly grey colour. It does not allow for slight variations.)
