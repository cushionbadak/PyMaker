What is proper method to replace digits to alphabet which are similar to alphabet in Python? Example: -> 
First you need to either precisely define a mapping of digits which you believe are similar to characters, or, if you want to do it a hard way, develop a learning algorithm to find similarities, and then substitute them. Computers aren't really good at understanding abstract concepts.Once you have a mapping, it can easily be done -
This calls for :Notice that this will not distinguish between lower and upper characters, since that information is not available in leetspeak.Doing some small tests the  scales better when the dictionary grows, since you iterate over the whole string for each mapping with the other  solutions.
You should use , e.g (edit after @Dmitry's remark):Output: NB: They are probably more efficient way (without the for)
