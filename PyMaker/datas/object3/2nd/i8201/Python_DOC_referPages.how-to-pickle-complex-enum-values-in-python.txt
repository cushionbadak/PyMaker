When I try to unpickle pickled complex enum instance, I always get "ValueError: BLUE is not a valid Colors".Is there any way how to pickle and unpickle?I am using Python 2.7.
Don't use a custom class as the enum values; there is no need here.  Your specific example doesn't need a separate class at all, you could just use:This has better  and  behaviour; your code requires  to be applied to  rather than directly to .For other custom methods and attributes, put those directly on the  subclass and they'll be part of the enum members too. If you need more values per entry, set a tuple and pull that tuple apart in a  method. The documentation has an excellent Planet example that illustrates this further.Demo:
The issue here is basic equality:So when  is trying to find a match for the unpickled value of  it is failing.The solution is simple:  add the  and  methods to `ColorType':NB I agree with @MartijnPieters that in most cases you should just add the needed functionality to the  itself.
