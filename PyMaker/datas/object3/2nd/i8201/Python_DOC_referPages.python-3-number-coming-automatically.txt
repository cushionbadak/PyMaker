You are printing the return value of . That method returns the number of characters written. From the  documenatation:Write the string s to the stream and return the number of characters written.The 13 indicates you wrote 13 characters to a file. If you se 26, then you wrote twice as much information to the file. If you didn't want to print that, simply remove the  call, and only call .
