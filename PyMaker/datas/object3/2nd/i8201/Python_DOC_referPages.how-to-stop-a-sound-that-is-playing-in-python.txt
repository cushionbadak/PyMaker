So I have code that looks like this:So right now if I press the 'q' key, it plays the corresponding sound like it should. However if I keep pressing the 'q' key before the current sound is done playing, it will play after the current sound is finished. How would I have it so upon pressing the 'q' button, it would stop the current noise and play the next one?
Edit:Having looked further into it (Win7, Python3.6.1), Eswcvlads answer is the way to go. When using the  flag, you can immediately play another sound and the currently playing sound stops.-> plays seven_11-> seven_11 stops and seven_12 starts playingHowever, to stop all playback, my original approach is still valid:From the docs: ... If the sound parameter is , any currently playing waveform sound is stopped.So including that before calling PlaySound for the next one should stop the playback before starting the next.
If the sound parameter is None, any currently playing waveform sound is stopped. So do that before every sound file played.
Judging by the docs, by default, PlaySound is synchronous, so it returns only after the sound has been fully played. So the script processes the next key only when the sound ended. To make it async use the  flag like this:
