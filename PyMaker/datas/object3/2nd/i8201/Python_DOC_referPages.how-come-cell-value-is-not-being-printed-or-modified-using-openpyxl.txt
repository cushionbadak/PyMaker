Here is my code. path2 is the path of the new file that is created and being modified.  There are indeed cells inside the .xlsx file that contain "4/1/2017"
You are comparing the cell value against the string , but it is likely that the cell actually contains a date value that is formatted by Excel to look like openpyxldatetime` object and you need to test the cell value against a datetime with the correct value.The  for a date is a  value, which is the way that Excel stores dates. If you want to test this, you'll need to compare it against the float representation of the date.If you have a string specifying a date and you can use  to convert the string into a datetime object for comparing with the cell contents.
