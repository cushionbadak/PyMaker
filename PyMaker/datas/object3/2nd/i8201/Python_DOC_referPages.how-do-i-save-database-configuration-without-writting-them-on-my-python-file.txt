I have a python application that requires database credentials, the code looks something like this. As you can see, I am hard-coding the sensitive data, and when I push this code to github I have to remove it, and when I run it in the server, I have to modify it. So, basically I have to edit this file for prod/dev environment. I know we can store variables in Linux as  and later  to retrieve the value, but how do I use this in my python application? 
You can use envparse module. It allows you to use environment variables and cast them to the proper types.You can add variables for each value, as database name, database host, or create a postprocessor and define the variable as an URL:
you mean envirnment variables?you can access them like this:
What I have been doing in similar cases is to keep a separate module with all config settings, declared as "constant" variables, like this:Then you import everything from that module whenever you need to use those constants. You can create a separate version of that file whitout sensitive info in order to upload to public Git servers.Now, take care in case your application will be deployed in an environment where the user should not be able to access the database itself, or if it will be accessing the database through a non encrypted connection. You may need more security measures in those cases, like connection through SSL, or having a server-side application creating an API.
There is a module  in python to create .ini file and save credentials and read when you required them.https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html
