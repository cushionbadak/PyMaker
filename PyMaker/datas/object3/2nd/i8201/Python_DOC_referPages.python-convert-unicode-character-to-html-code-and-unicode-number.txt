Natural Text
Here is what I ultimately want:A dictionary that holds unicode chars as keys and html code + unicode number as list values. How can this be achieved if only the key is given?I think of something like this:If find a lot of methods for converting the other way round, but not for what I am looking for.
All that the notations contain is the hexadecimal and decimal value for the Unicode codepoint of the character. That value can easily be obtained by using the  function, then formatting the resulting integer:or as a function:The function returns a tuple rather than a list; presumably this doesn't need to be mutable after all. You probably want to consider using a  class so you can also use attribute access.Demo:
