This is the default string representation of a datetime:What is the correct format string to parse that with ?  That is, what goes in place of the '???' to see the following result:
Note that  is documented as being equivalent to . This starts with  (), but then:Either has nothing or  for microseconds; andEither has nothing or an offset with a colon, which doesn't match . doesn't have support for optional parts, therefore there isn't a single  parameter that can match all of these possible outputs, and doesn't support the colon in the offset, so some can't be handled at all.
It is not possible using , as has been explained here.  Upgrade to Python 3.7, and use the  method.Contributed by Paul Ganssle in issue15873.
