I have this  file and I want to extract the values associated with certain specific elements. More specifically what I want is when the element value is  then check if next element value is (They are towards the end of the in the sample xml I have shown below ). If it is then extract/print these two tags and next 3 tags(which would be Minimum,Maximum, and Mean values):Currently I have this code where I am using  as to parse the xml file but it is not producing any output(it doesn't print anything).I am trying to look for  and  but don't know how to do that. How can I modify my current code to use  and  to parse the  file and get the output I want?
Here is a way to extract the wanted information with ElementTree:Output:The default namespace is , and the elements you are interested in are in this namespace. That's why we need to use the  dictionary. See https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html#parsing-xml-with-namespaces.
