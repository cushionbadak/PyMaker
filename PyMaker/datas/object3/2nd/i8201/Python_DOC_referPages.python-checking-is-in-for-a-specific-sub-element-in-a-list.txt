I have a list of tuples of the following format: Is it possible to construct an  statement that only checks if  is specifically in one of the  slots?For example, given the following list:I want to be able to check  in such a way that it will be true if  but NOT true if  since it's only checking a specific position in each tuple.
You can use:(p.s: don't name your variable  since you override the built-in type)
You can use the built-in :It short-circuits once a match is found so you don't need to iterate over the entire list.Can be extended to Python 2 (since extended unpacking will not work):
You can use the following trick to get a list of all the var1 values, a list of all var2 values, and a list of all var3 values:Then you simply check .
