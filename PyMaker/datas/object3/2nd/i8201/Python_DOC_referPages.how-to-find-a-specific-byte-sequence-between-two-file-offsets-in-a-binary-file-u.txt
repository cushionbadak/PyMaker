How to find a specific byte sequence between two file offsets in a binary file using Python?I want to open a binary file to search for a specific byte sequence  between two file offsets  and .My idea is to open the file using  and then set the file position to  using . Then for each position in the file, I read 16 bytes and compare them to the sequence above (16 bytes in length).However, there must be an easier way to do this?
You didn't say it was a large file, so let's assume it fits easily into memory.  fseek to the start position, then read end-start bytes. You'll have a bytestring, then you can use .index to find your sequence:
