I'm trying to create a python virtualenv using anaconda python3.6 in ubuntu 16.04. Following https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html , I've triedoperating from the miniconda directory at ~/miniconda3/bin (screenshot). How can I this working?edit:
If you are using anaconda, you should be using conda environments.For more information, see Managing Environments.EDIT In response to OP wanting to use virtualenvs.The error is with python not being able to find . You can get around this by installing it manually.At this point you will have a basic virtualenv with pip installed.
