Below is simplified example of a larger program i'm working on that is meant to create a single number from some inputs and then compare the two numbers, by saying which one is bigger. In this case is a computer and all its parts have a number and all those numbers added together form an overall number that I want to used to compare computers. Can someone suggest what would be the best method to do this?I am looking for a way to compare the resulting numbers of computer1 and computer2 to tell which is bigger.Sorry for the noob question as I'm sure there is a simple solution i'm overlooking. Thank you in advance for your guidance.
I recommend adding a gt and lt method to your class that operates on an instance variable that you generate. Like this:You can read about these methods here: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html
