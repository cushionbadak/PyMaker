Say I have a function  where x and y are numbers and f is a string specifying a function such as .I wish to use this function  a lot, say a few million times, and the values of  and  change between each use.Therefore calling  takes a significant amount of time as opposed to just calculating the value of the function each time. (About 50x, in my measured case.)Is there any way to save this function  so that I would only have to call  once?PS. Please do not discuss the (un)safety of using  here, I am aware of it, but this code isn't going anywhere where a 3rd party will run it, nor is it relevant to my question.
You could  the , so you just evaluate it once, and after that it's a function that you can use:I get , but I can change  and  as many times I need without evaluating the expression again.
If Jean_Francois' solution still isn't fast enough, you can take a look at numba. , and then probably also @jit the function that calls f_numba so that f_numba is inlined into the caller. Depends on your application.
