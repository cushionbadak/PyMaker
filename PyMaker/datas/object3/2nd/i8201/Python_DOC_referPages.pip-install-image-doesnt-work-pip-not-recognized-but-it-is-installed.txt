I have python 36. The path is already declared, yet when I enternothing happens, and I am told that pip does not exist. I have install openpyxl before via pip, so I know I have it....but I can't remember how I got it to work.I recall it being an alternative way of typing it into the CMD that finally made it work.Typing in a path to the python36 or python .exe file instead of python, the CMD still does not recognize pip
