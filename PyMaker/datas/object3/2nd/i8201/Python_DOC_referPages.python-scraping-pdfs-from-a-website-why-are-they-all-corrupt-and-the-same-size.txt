Hopefully this one will be an easy one. I am trying to do some webscraping where I download all the pdf files from a page. Currently I am scraping files from a sports page for practice. I used Automatetheboringstuff + a post from another user (retrieve links from web page using python and BeautifulSoup)  to come up with this code.The files that are output to the directory I specify are all there which is great, but the filesize is the same for all of them and when I open up AdobePro to look at them I get an error that says:"Adobe Acrobat could not open "FILENAMEHERE" because it is either not a supported filetype or because the file has been damaged (for example, it was sent as an email attachment and wasn't correctly decoded)."A little hint that clued me in to something going wrong with the write process was that after running image_file.write(chunk) it outputs the same numbers for each file. Here is what the pdfs look like in the folder:I am thinking I just need to add a parameter somewhere during the writing process for it to work correctly, but I have no idea what it would be. I did some Google searching for an answer and also searched a bit on here but cannot find the answer.Thanks!
Hmmm. After doing some more research it seems like I figured out the problem. I do not understand exactly why this works, but I'll take a stab at it. I modified my code such that each link(['href']) becomes a response object. Then I wrote those to my directory and it worked.
