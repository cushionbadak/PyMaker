I have a list in dictionary form looking like this:Goes on like this for a while. The first numbers are really important.Now I want to find values '0', '2' and '3' and look which values are connected to this.What I want ultimately is to look up the different values and save all the values connected in a list.For 0:I can't really find out how to do it.
The solution using dict.setdefault() function(for all values):The output:
You have a rather strange data structure, but as it is written, it can be modified with the following code:Note that this code does not assume every dict in the list to have only a single key, as in the general case it could be possible for each dict to contain multiple entries. Further, the code does not assume each list element to be unique, in which case a set might have been more appropriate.
Why can't you store them like this?
Well the format of that data is kind of strange, but this will probably work. I would suggest putting that data into a better structure than that though. 
Here is a nice function to do it:Which gives the following output:
Here is the simple logical code for your problem: Hope you will find your own way out after this; Will just work perfectly in python(3)
(k,v) (0,[3]))(k,v) (2,[1, 13, 15])
