below is some code written to open a CSV file. Its values are stored like this:This is just a snippet of code I use in a real time plotting program, which fully works but the fact that the array is getting so big is unclean. Normally new values get added to the CSV while the program is running and the length of the arrays is very high. Is there a way to not have exploding arrays like this?Just run the program, you will have to make a CSV with those values too and you will see my problem.This is the output I get:Any help is appreciated.
You can use Python's  if you also want to limit the total number of entries you wish to keep. It produces a list which features a maximum length. Once the list is full, any new entries push the oldest entry off the start.The reason your list is growing is that you need to re-read your file up to the point of you last entry before continuing to add new entries. Assuming your timestamps are unique, you could use  to help you do this, which reads entries until a condition is met.Also, it is easier to work with the entries using Python's built in  library to read each of the values into a list for each row. As you have a header row, read this in using  before starting the loop.
