Does this do what I think it does?I couldn't find any reference to this in the docs but I saw it in a high rep answer.It seems to work but it could be luck, like the leftmost resolves to , then  is used in the other.I did a few tests and it always work as expected, but I'd like to find a source (a doc) stating explicitly that it is intended.This rules out the "leftmost first" hypothesis:
This is documented in detail in the Expressions chapter:Comparisons can be chained arbitrarily, e.g.,  is equivalent  to  and , except that  is evaluated only once (but in both  cases  is not evaluated at all when  is found to be false).Formally, if a, b, c, ..., y, z are expressions and op1, op2, ..., opN  are comparison operators, then  is equivalent  to , except that each expression is  evaluated at most once.Note that  doesnâ€™t imply any kind of comparison between a  and c, so that, e.g.,  is perfectly legal (though perhaps not  pretty).
