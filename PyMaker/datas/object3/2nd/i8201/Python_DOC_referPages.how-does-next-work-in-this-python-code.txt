I found some code I needed in this answer https://stackoverflow.com/a/37401376/1727657. But I don't understand what  does in this context.  Could someone explain?Here's a short test script I made to understand it.  The idea is to see whether the test string  contains any of the strings in  and, if so, which one.  It works but I don't know why.My next question will be to ask whether  will give me the index of  (or do I need to do  on )? 
To explain how next is used in detail here.This will return the first/next value (in this case the actual word that matched) created by the generator expression passed in the first argument. If the generator expression is empty, then  will be returned instead.Whoever wrote the code was probably only interested in the first match, so  was used.We could just use:and just use  to determine the number of hits.To show some plain usage of :Outputs:The example above will trigger a  exception if we try to call  when the list/generator is empty because we don't use the second argument to override what should be returned when the generator is empty.What  is really doing under the hood is called the type's  method. This is important to keep mind when making classes.If anything is unclear, do not hesitate to commend and I'll elaborate. Also remember that  is your friend when you don't understand what is going on.
