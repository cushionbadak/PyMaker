Is it possible in python to recreate an object from already instatiated object, with all it's arguments passed into  method?Something similar to , but for class instances.For example:
No, it is not possible, because the arguments of the  method might have been discarded, used to compute other values, or saved in a multitude of different manners which would be impossible to create a generic method to retrieve. However, you can achieve flexible object initialization from preset configurable parameters by using the Factory pattern, and you can copy existing objects using . (However, be aware that there are edge cases to deepcopy, so be careful when using it and be sure to read the docs)
