It is almost same as this question: Python: get string representation of PyObject?, but for Python3. With original solution, I got  error.
Both  and  return a unicode  representation of the object. If your terminal doesn't use UTF-8, you probably want the ASCII escaped representation. Get the multibyte string with  or .
