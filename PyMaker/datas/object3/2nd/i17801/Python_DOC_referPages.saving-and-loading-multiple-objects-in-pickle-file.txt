I have a class that serves players in a game, creates them and other things. I need to save these player objects in a file to use it later.  I've tried the pickle module but I don't know how to save multiple objects and again loading them? Is there a way to do that or should I use other classes such as lists and save and load my objects in a list? Is there a better way?
Using a list, tuple, or dict is by far the most common way to do this:That prints:However, a pickle file can contain any number of pickles.  Here's code producing the same output.  But note that it's harder to write and to understand:If you do this, you're responsible for knowing how many pickles are in the file you write out.  The code above does that by pickling the number of list objects first.
Two additions to Tim Peters' accepted answer.First, you need not store the number of items you pickled separately if you stop loading when you hit the end of the file:This assumes the file contains only pickles; if there's anything else in there, the generator will try to treat whatever else is in there as pickles too, which could be dangerous.Second, this way, you do not get a list but rather a generator.This will load only one item into memory at a time, which is usefulif the dumped data is very large -- one possible reason why you may have wanted to pickle multiple items separately in the first place.You can still iterate over  with a  loop as if it werea list.
Try this:
I will give an object-oriented demo using  to store and restore one or multi :output:
It's easy if you use , which gives you the ability to transparently store objects in files or databases.  It uses a dict API, and allows you to  and/or  specific entries from an archive (in the case below, serialized objects stored one entry per file in a directory called ).
