I would like to check if a script is running with a specific command line argument within a python script.For example I would like to check if:Is running. Is there any way I can achieve this?Thanks in advance
You can use the  list:For more complex argument parsing, it is recommended to use .If instead you are looking to search through the current process list for that, you should use a library such as  to ensure maximum platform compatiblity.
You can use the  library.This will work on almost any OS and with python 2.4 up to 3.3.
Here is my take of it:Now if you print this list L out:The list contains the command line parameters of every running process whose name starts with 'py'. That would include python.exe and py.exe. The condition is necessary otherwise you may run into some AccessDenied error if you try to poke on every running Windows process, like some smss.exe.Once you have this list, finding out what you want is a no brainer:
