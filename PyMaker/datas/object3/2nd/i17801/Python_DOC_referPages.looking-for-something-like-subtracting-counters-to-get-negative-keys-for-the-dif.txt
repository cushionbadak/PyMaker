I've recently started learning python, and I am attempting to optimize a scrabble solving program to practice.  I have written a working program but, after adding the ability to take into account blank tiles, I realized I was doing it wrong, and it was taking ages to run.  I was building a giant list of possible racks, then running my program against each possible rack.  Now, to optimize things, I am looking to build a list of available letters, and then once I have a list of possible words, score them against the rack (to account for blanks).What I was doing before was:I was wondering if there was a way to simplify this using Counter()What I would want to do, is subtract  from  and if any items are negative...which is probably not possible with Counter(), say that it can't be a valid word.Is there a data type that would work better here?  Or is there a method I am just not seeing?Thanks.
Your question is not quite clear to me - posting at least some examples inputs and outputs might help (ie : "given this and this as input, I'd like to get this as output").It's indeed possible to substract a  from another one but that doesn't yield the expected result. Now you can still substract values for specific keys, ie  
In Python 3.2 and higher,  has a  method which does exactly what you want, preserving 0 and negative values the way the actual  operator does not. It operates in place, so you'd do:
