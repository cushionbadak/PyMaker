just doing a reveiw of my python class and noticed that I forgot how to do this. I know it's super simple and I'm overlooking something but I'd appreciate some help!I'm getting this error:middle1 = lst.pop((len(lst) / 2) - 1)TypeError: integer argument expected, got floatWhat am I doing wrong?
When you upgraded to Python 3, the '' operator changed from giving you integer division to real division.  Switch to '' operator.
You can use  operator:
The other answers explained why you are getting the error.  You need to use  instead of  (also, just for the record, you need to give  integers, not lists).However, I'd like to suggest a different approach that uses Explain Python's slice notation:This method should be significantly faster than using and .As proof, I made the below script to compare the two methods with :The results were as follows:As you can see, my proposed method was ~2 seconds faster.  However, you can run more tests if you would like to validate mine.
Using  and  (especially inserting at positions 0 and 1) can be fairly slow with Python lists.  Since the underlying storage for the list is an array, inserting at position 0 means that the element at position  has to be moved to position , then the element at  has to be moved to  and so on.  has to do the same in reverse. So imagine in your little method how many element moves must be done. Roughly:So approximately  moves are done in this code.Breaking the list into 3 slices and reassembling a new list may be more optimal:Plus you won't run into any weird issues by  changing the length of the list between the first and second call to . And the slices implicitly guard against index errors when you get a list that is shorter than 2 characters.
