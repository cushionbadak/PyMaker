I'm new to Python and Programming as well. I know from Google's python class how to run external command using: (status, output) = commands.getstatusoutput(cmd)   if status:    ## Error case, print the command's output to stderr and exit     sys.stderr.write(output)     sys.exit(1)But I perceive that commands module is going obsolete. I want the status and the output, so I can print the output using sys.stderr.write() if there is any error. So, is there any equivalent command in subprocess module? I'm currently using:subprocess.call(args,shell=False) now.Thanks!
There is  in Python 3 that could be implemented as:Both return  that is different from the original . See Python Issue: Document & unittest the subprocess.getstatusoutput() status value.
It's also possible to do this, with a bit less code
Popen is a nice and easy way to do it:
What  does is gather both  and  output interleaved in one variable. This will quite closely replicate the actual behaviour of  on those where it does not exist ( and the whole  module was removed on Python 3 completely), excepting the newline behaviour. The resulting data is in .This function returns  on Python 3 on purpose, as the Python 2 version returns
