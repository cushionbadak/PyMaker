Natural Text
here is the code that I am having a problem with(simplified to make it clearer). It is for a text based game just to help learn things.I would like to know how I can make  rather than being equal to the output of  in this block of code. So that everytime i run it in a while loop it will re-evaluate the output of Punch() rather than evaluating  once and assigning that to the 0th index of .
You could assign a function to  instead of its result (using ):Then later, in your  loop, just call it: calls  function with  parameter set to  (its value at the time of  call).It works because functions, methods are first class citizens in Python. You can pass them as parameters to other functions, return from functions, bind to a different name, append to a list, etc.
