Attempting to use the  argument as seen here yields the following error.No matter what/where I search, I can't seem to find a solution to my problem. 
You're looking at the docs for Python 3.3 but running Python 3.2.  In Python 3.2 the  initializer doesn't have a  argument: http://docs.python.org/3.2/library/urllib.request.html#urllib.request.RequestFWIW depending on what kind of request you make (for example if the request includes a body)  will automatically use the appropriate method (i.e. POST).  If you need to make a more specialized type of request such as  you need to dig a little deeper.  There are other answers on SO that help with that.
