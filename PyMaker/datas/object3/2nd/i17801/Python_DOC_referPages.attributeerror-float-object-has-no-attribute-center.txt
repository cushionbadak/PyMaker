I am just learning Python and I can't figure out how to solve an error. The Python code below writes some messages on the Raspberry Pi 16x2 Screen. On the 3rd set of messages #AVG SPEED if I use print  it works correctly but when I output it to the screen I get this error Traceback:Someone can help me with this?Thanks
Clearly at some point you're calling  with something that's not a string, but a float. So, when it does this:… that fails, because  objects have no  method.The fact that it's failing in the  case means it must be one of the places where you call . My first guess would be , because  sure sounds like something that would be a float rather than a string.(Now that you've posted the traceback, it tells you directly what I had to guess. The line that fails is exactly the one I said it would be, and the line that called it is exactly the one I suspected would be calling it. And this is why you should always look at the tracebacks, and paste them to your SO questions—otherwise, you have to scan the code and guess.)The reason it seems to work if you replace that with just  is that the  command automatically stringifies its arguments, so even if you pass it a , it will print out that .If you want your  function to work the same way, you can do that pretty easily by adding one line to the start of it:Alternatively, change your code to never call  with anything else. So:… or, if you want more control over the formatting, something like this:Since any developer is bound to screw that up sometimes (at least I would, and you obviously would too), and you have a hard time debugging those screwups yourself, you might want to add a line at the top of the function to give you better error messages, like:
