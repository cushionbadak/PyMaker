I have the following codeand I ran it with python 2.7 and python 3.3. With python 2.7 an exception is thrown when I try to write to stdin. With python 3.3 this code prints 4. What is the difference between python 2.7 subprocess module and python 3.3?
The difference is in the default value for . It is  (unbuffered) in Python 2.7 therefore  causes  error. Pipes are fully buffered in Python 3.2+ i.e., until you flush the buffer, no error is detected. From ' docs:Changed in version 3.3.1:  now defaults to  to enable  buffering by default to match the behavior that most code expects. In  versions prior to Python 3.2.4 and 3.3.1 it incorrectly defaulted to   which was unbuffered and allowed short reads. This was unintentional  and did not match the behavior of Python 2 as most code expected.
