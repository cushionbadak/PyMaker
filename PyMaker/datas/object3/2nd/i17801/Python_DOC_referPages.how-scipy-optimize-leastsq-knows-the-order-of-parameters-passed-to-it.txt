I want to model a data with gaussian with parameters  and pass initial parameters . I am wondering  how does the optimizer knows the order of parameters. I could have taken the parameters as (mu,height,sig) or in any other order.Edit:Gaussian model (mu=1,sig=1.5,height=0.8)Initial parameters passed x0=(0.8,0.8,0.8)How can I be sure that the optimizer understands it as (mu,sig,height) and not as (sig,mu,height)?
Function parameters have a positional behavior by default and you need to inform them in the same order of the definition.If you want you can pass the arguments without a specific order but you will have to use thier name example:For more information please refer these link
Check the function's help:help(function)Read the sourceRead up on Python's Call semantics: http://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#calls
The order in which function parameters are passed is only ever not known when the function is defined with  (unnamed keyword arguments -- the function then has a dict called  that contains them, obviously unordered).When the function is defined with named parameters, though, the  syntax does not create a dict -- it simply assigns the values to the corresponding named parameters within the function.
