Natural Text
I have columns in a data table that I need to join. One column consists of values and the other of corresponding error values, for example:What I'd like to do is, for each row join the columns along with a +/-, but the clean unicode character (U+00B1). I've never tried to use unicode characters in python before, so I'm sorta stumped.If my  looks likehow exactly do I let python know I want to use a unicode character.

Byte strings will be coerced to unicode for you, with the ASCII codec.It'd be better to explicitly turn your values into unicode strings, that way you can control what encoding is used.Demo with  values:
