how to find if there is even number of elements or odd number of elements in a arbitrary list.I tried list.index() to get all the indexes... but I still dont know how I can tell the program that what is even and what is odd number.
You can use the built in function  for this.Python Doc -- len()Gets the length (# of elements) of any arbitrary list.Define function that returns a bool (true or false).The modulus operator  gives the remainder.EX:    7 % 2 = 1Closest number to 7 that 2 will divide evenly is 6Which is 1 away from 7.Thus, remainder of 1 for 7 % 2.EX:   4 % 2 = 0Any even number n will give 0 as the remainder when n % 2Because n has divided evenly by 2
All you need isWhich will give you the length.I guess you could also do this then



Even numbers are divisible by 2. Odd numbers are not. will get the lenght of If the length of  is divisible by 2, then it is an Even numberIf the lenght of  is not divisible by 2 then it is an Odd Number returns the "remainder" of a division problemfor example  will return  which is NOT zero, ( because 5 divided by 2 is 2 with a remainder of 1) therefore it is not even.Same thing as  which would return a , because 6 divided by 4 is 1 with a remainder of 2.so  where  is your list, will return either a 1, indicating it is Odd, or a 0 indiciating it is Even.
Using the modulus operator -  gives the remainder. To get if even, you need to divide by 2, for example:The most pythonic way to do it is:
