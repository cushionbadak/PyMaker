I've been trying the following date&time operations: a-b works super, but a/b crashes: TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'datetime.datetime' and 'datetime.datetime'Any ideas on how I can calculate relations between date&time-values? Do I need to explicitly first calculate the seconds in each variable a and b, or is there a shorter short cut?And if I need to calculate seconds. How do I do it? I've tried(I'm using Python 3.3)
The datetime.timedelta support divide operate as shown in the manualSo, I think you should do is:Minuse the datetime.datetime.min , Start calculate:  and I hope this can help you
You  have to make the difference between  (which is an actual date and time, for example "1899-12-30 19:45:00") and  (which is a period, for example "1 hour"). Note that your    substraction of two datetimes will result in a timedelta.If you're calculating race times, you have to specify the start time of the race (how would you know, anyway, how long the race lasted). Then you can doDivision is not defined for datetimes. But timedelta objects have  which give you a number (the length of period in seconds), and you can divide numbers.
Number of seconds from zero date:
