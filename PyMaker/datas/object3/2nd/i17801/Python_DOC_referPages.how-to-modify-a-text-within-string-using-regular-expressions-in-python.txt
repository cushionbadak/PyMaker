I'm trying to change a file containing strings like: to (to make it into a correct JSON format). The part of code that I'm having problems with is:And I don't know what to put instead of ??? so that it reads the (\d+) part that matched the pattern. 
First, your pattern doesn't actually match your data in the first place:That's because your data has a space between the digits and the colon. You need to fix that. While we're at it, I have no idea why you're putting a group around the preceding whitespace, so let's not do that. So we get:Now, your only capturing group is the . So that will be group 1. Which you can include in the substitution as . So:That still isn't valid JSON, but it's what you wanted, right?If you read the docs,  explains that "Backreferences, such as , are replaced with the substring matched by group 6 in the pattern." For full details on back references for both  groups and  groups, look them up in the Regular Expression Syntax. You should also read the Regular Expression HOWTO, which explains all of this in a more novice-friendly way.Notice that I made the substitution a raw string just like the pattern, so I didn't have to escape the , and I also used single instead of double quotes, so I didn't have to escape the  characters.
