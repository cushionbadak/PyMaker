I am writing a little Python script that parses the input from a QR reader (which is seen as a keyboard by the system).At the moment I am using  but this function waits for an EOF/end-of-line symbol in order to submit the received string to the program.I am wondering if there is a way to continuously parse the input string and not just in chunks limited by a line end.In practice:- is there a way in python to asynchronously and continuously parse a console input ?- is there a way to change  (or an equivalent function) to look for another character in order to submit the string read into the program?
It seems like you're generally trying to solve two problems:Read input in chunksParse that input asynchronouslyFor the first part, it will vary greatly based on the specifics of the input function your calling, but for standard input you could use something like As for parsing asynchronously, there are a number of approaches you could take. Python is synchronous, so you will necessarily have to involve some subprocess calls. Manually spawning a function using the subprocess library is one option. You could also use something like Redis or some lightweight job queue to pop input chunks on and have them read and processed by another background script. Finally, gevent is a very popular coroutine based library for spawning asynchronous processes. Using gevent, this whole set up would look something like this:
