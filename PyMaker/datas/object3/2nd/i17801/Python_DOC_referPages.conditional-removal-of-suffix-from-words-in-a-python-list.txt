Natural Text
The task that I have to perform is as follows :Say I have a list of words (Just an example...the list can have any word): I have to create a new list of words from which words having the suffix  are added after removing the suffix (i.e yeasting is added to the new list as yeast) and the remaining words are added as it isNow as far as insertion of string ending with  is concerned, i wrote the following code and it works fineBut how to add the remaining words to the list?? How do I add an  clause to the above if statement? I was unable to find suitable documentation for the above. I did came across several questions on SO regarding the shorthand if else statement, but simply adding the else statement at the end of the above code doesn't work. How do I go about it??Secondly, if I have to extend the above regular expression for multiple suffixes say as follows:How do I perform the "trim" operation to remove the suffix accordingly and simultaneously add the word to the new list??Please Help.
First, what makes you think you need a regexp at all? There are easier ways to strip suffixes.Second, if you want to use regexps, why not just  instead of trying to use regexps and slicing together? For example:Then you don't need to work out how much to slice off (which would require you to keep track of the result of  so you can get the length of the group, instead of just turning it into a bool).But if you really want to do things your way, just replace your  filter with a conditional expression, as in iCodez's answer.Finally, if you're stuck on how to fit something into a one-liner, just take it out of the one-liner. It should be easy to write a  function that returns the suffix-stripped string (which is the original string if there was no suffix). Then you can just write:
Regarding your first question, you can use a ternary placed just before the :Regarding your second, well, the best answer in my opinion is to use  as @abarnert demonstrated.  However, you could also make a slight adaption to your use of :Finally, here is a link for more information on comprehensions.
