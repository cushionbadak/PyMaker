I am working on my game, and have made a level class, but  my parselevel() method will not let me parse the level, because of "Block" not being a global variable (Block is my block class).How would I do this? Could I just pass Block and Player to the parseLevel method?My code:
The traceback shows that you have a circular import problem. When you have a statement , Python has to finish loading  right away (so that it can work out all the imported names). But this means that:since  executes ,  must be loaded before ;since  executes ,  must be loaded before ;since  executes ,  must be loaded before .Obviously this can't work!What you really ought to do is reorganize your code so that each module doesn't need to know about all the others. (For example, why do  need to know about ?)But if you are having trouble with that, you can get things working by breaking the circle, for example by writing  instead of . Obviously you'll then have to write  instead of , but that should be easy.(This works because  doesn't need  to have finished loading yet.)See this entry in the Python FAQ for more about circular imports.
