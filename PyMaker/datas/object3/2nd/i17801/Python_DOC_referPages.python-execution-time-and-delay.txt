Before the  loop, get the current time, as .After the  loop, get the current time again, as .Then, if , .There are a few different choices of time objects you can use.  is the simplest (especially if you need to debug this later—print out a  and it's immediately readable to a human), if you don't need the highest precision. When you subtract two  objects, you get a  object. So:If you need better precision, there are functions in the  module that let you use better clocks that your platform supports, especially if you're on 3.3+. See the  function in 3.3+: may not be the best clock for your platform—e.g., if you have  or  they will almost always be better. So, read the docs and then check what you have.In earlier versions (including all 2.x versions), you will have to choose between , , , or , which all have different tradeoffs, and the tradeoffs are even different on different platforms (and  will already be at least as good as ), so no one can tell you "always use this one".
