I've been scouring the internet for a solution and everything i've come across hasn't helped. So now i turn to you.I have two files cardreader.py & ATRdb.py---ATRdb.py has this setup---cardreader.py has this setupi get the error at the "If ATR.checkPerms():" part. Any help would be appreciated (first python project)
Your problem is circular imports.In , you do this:That starts importing , but a few lines into the code, it hits this:The exact sequence from here depends on whether  is your main script or not, and on whether your top-level code that calls  is protected by an  guard (and assuming that top-level code is in  rather than elsewhere). Rather than try to explain all the possibilities in detail (or wait for you to tell us which one matches your actual code), let's look at what we know is true based on the behavior:In some way, you're calling  before finishing the import of .This means that, at this point,  has nothing in it but , , and  (and a handful of special attributes that every module gets automatically). In particular, it hasn't gotten to the definition of  yet, so no such attribute exists in the module yet.Of course eventually it's going to finish importing the rest of , but at that point it's too late; you've already called  and it tried to call  and that failed.While there are various complicated ways to make circular imports work (see the official FAQ for some), the easiest and cleanest solution is to just not do it. If  needs some functions that are in , you should probably factor those out into a third module, like , that both  and  can import.
