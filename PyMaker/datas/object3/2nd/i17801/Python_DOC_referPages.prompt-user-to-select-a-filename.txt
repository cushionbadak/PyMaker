How can I change the code below to prompt the user for the column number and csv filename instead of stating it in the code?
You could use the  function:or you could accept a command-line argument;  gives you a list of command-line parameters, where index  is the script name, and anything beyond that are values the user put on the command line:The Python standard library includes a  module to make handling command line interfaces more flexible and powerful.
