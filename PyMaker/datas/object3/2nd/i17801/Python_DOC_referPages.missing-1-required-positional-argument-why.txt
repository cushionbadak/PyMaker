I have written this code:But when I run the code, I have this error:Why? I have written all the arguments of lambda...
The  key function is only ever passed one argument, yet your  wants to have 2 arguments. The key function used for  or  is not a  function.Just use  as your key function here:Python then sorts the list based on the values returned by the key function. Under the hood Python will 'decorate' your values with the key function, sort the values, then undecorate again.If you do have a complex  function and you don't quite know how to translate it to a key function, you can use the  utility function to wrap the  function for you:but do note that the built-in  function has been removed from Python 3 altogether.
