I have to make an HTTPS request in Python, and I am using the requests module to try to make my life easier. The request needs to have a header and 3 FORM parameters URL encoded. This is what I am doing: When I try to return the  or  of the , I get an empty string. However, when I print the actual  object, it says it is a , but if this were actually a 200 OK then the server I am POSTing too should go to the redirect_uri I have specified and I would get a notification there. This is not happening, and I am mystified as to why.
Your code is fighting the Requests library: you're doing a lot of stuff yourself that Requests will do for you.Firstly, don't form-encode your data yourself, let Requests do it by providing a dictionary to , like @flyer's answer suggested.When you do this, Requests will also correctly set the Content-Type header, so you don't have to. Also, please don't send a  header: Requests will manage it for you. The same applies to  headers: sending a  header can only cause problems.Finally, don't set the Authorization header yourself, let Requests do it by providing it with your authentication credentials. The idiomatic Requests code would be:If that doesn't work, then I would suspect your payload data is bad.
It seems that there are two mistakes.The first one:When you want to post data, the data format should be like this:The second: could verify SSL certificates for https requests automatically and it sets  as default. You set  and that means that you want to ignore the ssl verification. That maybe not what you want. Here is the doc
