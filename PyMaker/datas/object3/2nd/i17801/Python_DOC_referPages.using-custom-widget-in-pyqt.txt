I followed this example (PyQT4) to create a "custom widget" in PyQT5 and ended up with following code:progress.pynew_ui.pymain.pyThe above runs without any errors, but the following code fails to add any list item (custom widget), the  gets correctly populated with retrieved data - what am I missing here?
You should only ever update GUI elements from within the main GUI thread.The worker thread should emit a signal when it's done, or perhaps do so periodically so that pending GUI events can be processed (i.e. by calling ).If the worker thread generates data, use a Queue so that it can be accessed safely from the main thread.UPDATE:Here is a basic example (python3 only) of how to use QThread with a worker object. All communication between the GUI thread and the worker thread is done using signals and slots (see "Signals and Slots Across Threads" in the Qt docs for more on this).
