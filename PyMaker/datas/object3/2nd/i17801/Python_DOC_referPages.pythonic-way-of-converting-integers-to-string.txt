Which is the more Pythonic way of converting integers to strings? I have always been using the first method but I now find the second method more readable. Is there a practical difference?
String conversions using backticks are a shorthand notation for calling  on a value. For integers, the resulting output of  and  happens to be the same, but it is not the same operation:The backticks syntax was removed from Python 3; I wouldn't use it, as an explicit  or  call is far clearer in its intent.Note that you have more options to convert integers to strings; you can use  or old style string formatting operations to interpolate an integer into a larger string:which is much more powerful than using string concatenation.
