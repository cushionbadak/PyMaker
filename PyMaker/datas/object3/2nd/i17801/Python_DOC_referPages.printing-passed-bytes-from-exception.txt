This seems to be the code for the poplib.error_proto.It just passes the bytes from the POP response in the exception.  What I would like to do is catch any exception, take those bytes, use .decode('ascii') on them, and print them as a string.  I've written my own test setup like so:I've tried replacing the last line with:But to no avail.  Is this possible and if so, how would I implement this?UPDATE:  Though, as falsetru points out, the documentation says results are returned as strings, this is not the case:
According to  documentation:Exception raised on any errors from this module (errors from socket module are not caught). The reason for the exception is passed to the constructor as a string.So, you don't need to decode it.UPDATE It seems like the documentation does not match the actual implementation.You can access the arguments passed to the exception constructor using  attribute.
