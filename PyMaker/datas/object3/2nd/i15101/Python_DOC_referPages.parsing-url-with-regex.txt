I'm trying to combine if else inside my regular expression, basically if some patterns exists in the string, capture one pattern, if not, capture another.The string is:'https://www.searchpage.com/searchcompany.aspx?companyId=41490234&page=0&leftlink=true" and I want to extract staff around the '?"So if '?' is detected inside the string, the regular expression should capture everything after the '?' mark; if not, then just capture from the beginning.I used:But it didn't work...Any suggestion?Thanks!
This regex:captures: everything, if there's no , or everything after the , if there is oneHowever, you should look into  (Python 3) or  (Python 2) if you're working with URLs.
regex might not be the best solution to this problem ...why not just if that is truly all you wish to door as others have suggested
Use urlparse:The last line is a dictionary of key/value pairs.
