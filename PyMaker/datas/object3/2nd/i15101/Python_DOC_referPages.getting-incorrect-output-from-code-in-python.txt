For this function I am supposed to read a file with 12 random numbers. Then I am supposed to output the numbers 1 per line and finally the program is supposed to separate the even numbers and the odds then add them up and display their totals. The problem here is that even though I am getting printing of the numbers fine, the total function in the end is messing up and giving incorrect totals. Here's are the contents from the fileI am only getting 0 for both the totals somehow. Can someone help with this?
The file object returned by  maintains a pointer to where you are currently in a file.  Each time you call  it is advancing that pointer to the next line.Because in the process of testing your code you're reading each line (and printing it) in advance, when you get to the later code that counts the values of the lines your file has already reached the end and will not magically go back to the beginning of the file.You can either reopen the file, or more simply use  to return the file pointer to the beginning of the file.
You have two errors in your code,first you read your file line by line, reaching the end of file, and later you try to read further... that's impossible, you have to rewind your file, as explained in Iguananaut's answer.your approach is, well, unusual...Â in general files are not read so explicitly, , , etc --- you want to be more generic so that your solution of a programming problem results more general.Of course there are a number of things you don't know about the manner Python deals with files, as the only thing you appear to know is the  method, that you abused a little. One really important thing about files is that file objects (what is returned by a ) are iterables, that is you can use them in a  loop (e.g., line 5 below), and the object that you have to deal with in every iteration is a line of text. That said, you can organize your code as follows
You should learn to use list comprehensions or loops instead...You should be able to do the rest with the code you have, however note that  returns !
@Iguananaut provided you with an answer to your issue. Here's a solution to the problem stated in the question, to show how it can be done.For this function I am supposed to read a file with 12 random numbers. Then I am supposed to output the numbers 1 per line and finally the program is supposed to separate the even numbers and the odds then add them up and display their totals.
