Natural Text
I want to go through a text file and create a dictionary that has keywords and the number of times they pop up.I want it to sort of look like this:right now I get something that looks like this:I can print every keyword in my dictionary as it loops through though so I know it's trying something. I also know that more of these keywords should pop up and they should have instances in the text file. My code:What am I missing here?
Joran is right that a  is a better fit for what you're doing than a . Here's an alternative solution:inputfile.txtcount.pyThis finds the number of matches against  in each line, and adds them to the running counter  as it goes along.EDIT: As pointed out by Blckknght in the comments, the previous solution missed cases where a keyword appears more than once in a line. The edited version of the code uses a slightly different method than before to overcome that problem.
should do that ... and much simpler in its current state there is too much to do to your original method to make it work and still be recognizable
You are already reading everything in the file at the first iteration of  so for the next key, there isn't anything left to read.I'd recommend you to swap those  loops.By the way, I'd strongly recommend you to go with Joran Beasley's one line solution as it is much easier to read and understand for anyone who will look at your code in the future.
