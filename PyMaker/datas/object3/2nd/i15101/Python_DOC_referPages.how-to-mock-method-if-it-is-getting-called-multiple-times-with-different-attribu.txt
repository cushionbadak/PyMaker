I am writing unit tests for my  and  based code. I have following method which in turn calls  method of Fabric API multiple times with different arguments. I would like to know how to call assert on mock  object. Can anyone please help me here?I have written test file as below :Above test fails because mocked object remembers only last call. that is, if I write   then test fails.Can anyone please tell how can I assert both the calls to ?
Try  which asserts whether there has been any call, not just the most recent one.Or, you can use  to get the list of args the mock has been called with.
assert_has_calls will do the job for you.assert_has_calls : assert the mock has been called with the specified calls. The mock_calls list is checked for the calls.  If any_order is true then the calls can be in any order, but they must all appear in mock_calls.
