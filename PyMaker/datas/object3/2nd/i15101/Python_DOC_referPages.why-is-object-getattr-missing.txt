Why does  seem not to have a  method?  It defines both  and .  Doesn't it need all three?
Indeed,  does not have a  method.Instead, it has . explains why:Called unconditionally to implement attribute accesses for instances of the class. If the class also defines , the latter will not be called unless  either calls it explicitly or raises an .In other words, if you have , it doesn't make sense to also define .Historically,  came first, and  was introduced with "new-style classes" in Python 2.3 (iirc).  Python 3 only has new-style classes but seems to have preserved both hooks anyway (perhaps because it can be convenient to have a hook that is only called if "normal attribute access" fails).
 is a method that runs only after . Since  has the latter, there is technically no need for the former. But in general, you shouldnâ€™t expect  to have all the things that other objects (deriving from it) have. Since  is implemented in native code, it may behave a bit differently.
