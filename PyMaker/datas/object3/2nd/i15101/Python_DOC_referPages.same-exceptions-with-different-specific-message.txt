I tried to write a code that can distinguish the following four different errors.: The first parameter is not an integer;: The second parameter is not a string;: The value of the first parameter is not in the range of  to ; or: The value of the second parameter is not one of the strings in the set .However, I only can get the first one to work but not the other three errors. I tried different ways to make it work, but still can't figure out what's wrong.I know maybe it is due to that I have same  and . Therefore, Python can't distinguish the second  which I hit  is different from the first . So, I only get the message that  when I have .
You are trying to distinguish between the error sources in completely the wrong place. By the time the error gets out of , there is no way to tell why e.g. a  was thrown. For each error class (, ) only the first  will ever be triggered:Instead, you should provide the specific error messages inside , when you actually  the error and already know what the reason is:Then you can handle them much more simply:If you have a particular need to distinguish between different errors of the same class, you can either explicitly check the message:or create your own, more specific  sub-classes, so you can have separate  blocks:(this is just an example, they are too specific in your particular case).It's probably worth having a read through the documentation on exceptions and the tutorial on using them.
