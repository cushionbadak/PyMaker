I'm trying to get used to iterators. Why if I typeIt will give me a reversed list, butwon't give me a reversed string?
In Python,  actually returns a reverse iterator. So,  applied on the iterator will give you the list object.In the first case, input was also a list, so the result of  applied on the  iterator seemed appropriate to you.In the second case,  applied on the returned iterator object will actually give you the string representation of it.Instead, you need to iterate the values in the iterator and join them all with  function, like this
another way by extend slice method. more detailsby string to list --> list reverse  --> join list
