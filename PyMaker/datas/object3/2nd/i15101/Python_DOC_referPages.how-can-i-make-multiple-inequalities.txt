How can I make multiple inequalities in python? for example.
 will always evaluate to  because  will always be either not equal to  or not equal to .  You should be using  in your while-loop condtion instead of :That, or you could use :
As @iCodez just said, you want to iterate again if the  is something different from , and something different from  and something different from . And as he said, this is better expressed with something like . That expression is simpler, easier to read and less error-prone.After you change the 's condition, there are still two things that I'd fix in your code. First, if the condition is true, that is, the user typed a wrong value for , a proper action should be taken: The user must be asked to type a new value, until he/she types a correct one. Second, you should use  instead of . The difference is the first one is better suited for strings, while the second one is problematic, and in this cases actually requires the user to type the  around the input value.The resulting could be something like this:
