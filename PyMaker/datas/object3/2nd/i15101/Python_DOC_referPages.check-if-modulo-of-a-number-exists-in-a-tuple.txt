I'm trying to check modulo of a number against a tuple of numbers, if the modulo is equals to one of the values in the tuple I want to return True else return False.This is what I had tried so far:It always returns false.
This is always returning false as only first item is checked. If first item is a match then it will return true. For example, if  is 32 then it will return true. You need to return false after checking all values, i.e. outside of for loop. Or a better solution is to use  operator. 
It always returns false because this code:returns true or false based only on the first item in the array, because it returns in both possible code paths. Either  and it returns true, or  and it returns false.If you want to use this loop-based solution, you need to check every item in the array, returning true immediately if it matches, otherwise returning false only after the list is exhausted, something like (using the  variant of the loop since the index is irrelevant here):The full program is thus:with the first call producing true as  (in the list) but the second giving false because  (not in the list).Of course, there's a far more Pythonic way to achieve this:That basically finds any element in  for which that element is equal to . See this link for more information on the Python  operation, and you'll see instantly the equivalent code given is remarkably similar to your loop:But, of course, it turns out to be unnecessary to use  in this particular case as  is effectively a fixed value in the context of searching through the list. Instead, you can opt for the much simpler:leaving the  variant for more complex comparisons not easily doable, such as only checking even numbers from the list:
You can accomplish this with a generator expression inside :This builds an iterator of booleans that is true for all elements of k that are divisors of .
