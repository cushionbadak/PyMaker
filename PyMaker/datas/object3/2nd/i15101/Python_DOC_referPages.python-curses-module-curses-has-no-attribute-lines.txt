I am looking at some source-code from a book and noticed that some of the code does not seem to be in the current Python2.7 API. The module  is, according to this code, supposed to have a constant variable called  and another called . I opened a Python interactive terminal and saw that there is no  or  variable or method.My question is: How does this code even work? 
I found that  exists in Python2 & Python3, but you have to call  before using it, or you will get AttributeError.you can also use [1] https://docs.python.org/2/library/curses.html#curses.window.getmaxyx
That code is written for Python 3.  You can see  is now in that API, though it was not in Python 2.7:https://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.htmlIf you need to get the terminal width and height in Python 2, see here: How to get Linux console window width in Python
