In Python 2 I could do the following:In Python 3 it does not work anymore:How do I get the old behaviour (converting the  results to  array)?Edit: As @jonrsharpe pointed out in his answer this could be fixed if I converted  to a list first:but I would prefer to avoid the extra call to .
One more alternative, other than the valid solutions @jonrsharpe already pointed out is to use :
Although you refer to it as , the  object in Python 3 is not a sequence (it's an iterator, see what's new in Python 3).  needs a sequence so the  can be determined and the appropriate amount of memory reserved; it won't consume an iterator. For example, the  object, which does support most sequence operations, can be passed directly;To restore the previous behaviour, as you're aware, you can explicitly convert the  object back to a sequence (e.g. list or tuple):However, as the documentation puts it:a quick fix is to wrap  in , e.g. , but a better fix is often to use a list comprehension (especially when the original code uses )So another option would be:or just:Alternatively, actually use  from the start:
