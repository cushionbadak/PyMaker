All signs seem to indicate that my script is fully operational within a Linux environment and as far as I can tell, the only thing keeping it from working in Windows is my usage of sh, which is pretty straightforward:This translates to a bash line:where the  and  variables are any given resolution or quality.Running this in Windows of course raises an error because 'sh' is completely non-functional in Windows :( I tried replacing 'sh' with the deprecated pbs, but am not having any luck. This is what I've got so far:The error being raised is:Question:How do I successfully pass these ImageMagick commands from my script while in a Windows environment?
Following Kevin Brotcke's answer, this is the hack we went with:
 error message is because pbs does not have a  method. Instead you need to use the  method:Now you can use it similar to :
Sub process is your best bet. While, as you said it isn't the easiest to learn, it is really useful. I would look at this indepth tutorial. Of course, read the docs too. As to your specific problem,  has been around longer than pbs, so it almost certainly has more functions. Looking through the source (), I found no function named . Also, you changed the arguments you called from  to  (you didn't put an ). Finally, there is no function named  in  from the git repo, so I suspect you are confusing it with convert from something else.Beyond that, you should be able to use  and  in conjunction.
You could use stdlib's  module, to run the command on Windows:It is important to provide the full path with the file extension otherwise a different  command may be chosen. raises an exception if  exits with non-zero status. You could use  and check the status manually instead.
