I am fairly new to programming, and I am having trouble figuring out how to take a specific number from a list like:How could I take the integers and use them, like if I wanted to multiply 12 and 4 or 12 and 3? I am trying to find the first differences of the numbers, so for example 12 - 3 and then 3 - 4.Note: I am just using those numbers as an example, I need the program to do any integers that the user inputs.Thanks!
