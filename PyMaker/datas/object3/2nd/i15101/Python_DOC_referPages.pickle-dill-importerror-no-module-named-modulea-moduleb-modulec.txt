I have a problem with  from a file. Dump and load is done in :dill_read_write.pySaving object  data to pickle file is done when the PyQt application (project) is running. Function  is called in :moduleC.pyThe object is saved and pickle file is created. But when I run only the file  to read (load) object data from pickle file I get the following error:I searched a bit and found that  can perform better than  with classes but I am having problems to implement it. I've also found that I have to implement  in class  in file .contact_geometry.pyBut I am not sure what should return this method? How could I successfully load pickle file from the current situation?Below is the project structure, if it is any help.
You cannot run a python file from within a package like that; it wouldn't find the toplevel package names. I'd propose any of the following:Write a start script in at the top level (where the  is), that imports and runs the  from Instead in the top level directory, where the  is, you can runthat module with .Or, my preferred alternative, write a  for your project and write a script for that utility.
I'm the  author.  It's hard to tell how you are running the code, but it looks like the issue is that one way you are running the code and the module name as in @Antti Haapala's answer.  His suggestions are also good ones to follow.I'll add thisâ€¦ You need to make sure that (1)  is on the , and (2) you are not dumping the module as  and trying to load it as  --  treats  as if it were a module (for the most part).You shouldn't need to add  methods to your classes, however.
