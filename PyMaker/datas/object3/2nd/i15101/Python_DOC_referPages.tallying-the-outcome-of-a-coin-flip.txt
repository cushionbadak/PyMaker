I have written a little piece of code for modelling the outcome of a coin flip, and would like to find a better way of presenting the results than a list of consecutive coin flips. I'm one month into learning Python as part of my physics degree, if that helps provide some context.Here's the code;What options do I have to present this data in an easier to interpret manner?
Instead of using a  loop and printing results to the screen, Python can do the counting and store the results very neatly using , a subclass of the built in dictionary container.For example:When I ran the code, it produced the following tally:We can see that heads was flipped 52 times and tails 48 times.This is already much easier to interpret, but now that you have the data in a data structure you can also plot a simple bar chart. Following the suggestions in a Stack Overflow answer here, you could write:This produces a bar chart which looks like this:
