I am trying to check if an input is a word or a number.This is the code I came up with but sadly doesn't work;I'm new to python and programming in general so I don't know alot of commands,any suggestion would be appreciated ^^
 will take and evaluate your input before handing it over to you. That is, if the user enters , your application will exit. This is undesirable from a standpoint of security. You would want to use  instead. In this case you can expect the returned value to be a string.If you still want to check if the strings content is convertible to a (integer) number, please follow the approach discussed here:How do I check if a string is a number (float) in Python?A short outline: Just try to convert it to a number and see if it fails.Example (untested):For reference:https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#inthttps://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#inputhttps://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#raw_inputNote that the semantics of the  function change with Python 3:https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input
Did you try ?For example:
 would always return for you a string ( type). there are several things you can do with that string to check if it's an you can try casting that string to an int:you can use regular expression to check if the string contains only digits (if your  is decimal, for other bases you'd have to use the appropriate symbols):
To check the variable type you can do the following:For string:Using :
As @paidhima said the  function will always return a string in python 3.x.Example:If i do the following:They are both string because it is not a good idea to have the program decide if it's gonna give us a string or and integer, we want the logic that we build in the program to handle that.In python3.x you example is not gonna work, but you can try this this:Now back to your script using python2.x.As i said above it's not a good practice to use the function , you can use  that works the same in python2.x like  in python3.x .I'm gonna say it again because i don't want to confuse you :Python2.x:Python3.xAttention, in python3.x there is no  .Your code should work just fine, in python2.x, make sure you use the right python, and i hope this helped you in a way or another.
