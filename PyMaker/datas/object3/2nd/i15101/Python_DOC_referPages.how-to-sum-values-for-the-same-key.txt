I have a file And I want to have one number per TLD like:and here is my code:But I get this error:Can anybody help?
To answer the title of your question: "how to sum values for the same key" - well, there is the builtin class called  that is a perfect match for you:then to write back:
Taking a look at the full traceback:The error is telling us that we tried to add something of type  to something of type , which isn't allowed in Python.There's only one object of type , which, unsurprisingly, is  – so we know that we tried to add a string to .The two things we tried to add together in that line were  and , and looking at the documentation for , we see that what it does isReturn the value for key if key is in the dictionary, else default. If default is not given, it defaults to , so that this method never raises a .Since we didn't supply a default,  returned  when it didn't find  in the dictionary, and we got the error attempting to add  to it. So, let's supply a default of  and see what happens:Well, we've still got an error, but now the problem is that we're trying to add a string to an integer, which is also not allowed, because it would be ambiguous.That's happening because  returns a list of strings – so we need to explicitly convert  to an integer:... and now it works:Turning that dictionary back into the file output you want is a separate issue (and not attempted by your code), so I'll leave you to work on that.
