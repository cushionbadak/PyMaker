Is there an  statement or loop in python? This does not work:
The equivalent is a  loop.Thus, your code becomes:
This will run until x == 0
You don't really need to count how many times you're looping unless you're doing something with that variable.  Instead, you can use a  loop that will fire up to 10 times instead:As an aside, don't use  as a variable name, as that masks the actual  method.
Python emulates until loops with the  idiom:I was forced to construct a trivial lambda for demonstration purposes; here a simple  would suffice, as as @Makoto suggested.
