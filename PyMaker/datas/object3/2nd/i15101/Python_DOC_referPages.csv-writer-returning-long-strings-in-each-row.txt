I've been having some more problems. After you've modified my code well into this.I have one aditional question. How do I get each piece of my output to have it's own cell and not have 5 really long rows divided by  signs. Since now my output looks like:I hope you will be able to help me. Thank you in advance. Cheers.
So a csv file (Comma-separated values file) is meant to have commas on really long rows as you indicated. To open the file with each value in a cell, say for excel, if you change the extension of the file to .csv it will likely be taken care of. Otherwise, you may need to import the file and indicate that the separators are commas. If you don't have excel, you can try googling for csv viewer (there are many free versions available). In either case, your output looks correct, I think you just need a bit of help opening the file in your program of choice.
