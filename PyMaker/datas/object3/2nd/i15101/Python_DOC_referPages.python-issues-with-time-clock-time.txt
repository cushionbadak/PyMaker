I wrote a system to exchange crc-checked struct data between an arduino nano and my python script. This is working pretty well but when i let the system run i get unexpected output on my python monitor (using pycharm)print "Took ", (time.time() - timeout), " s" sometimes prints out Took  0.0  s.Usually it prints Took  0.0160000324249  s.Using win7-64bit professional.From time doc : Return the time in seconds since the epoch as a floating point number. Note that even though the time is always returned as a floating point number, not all systems provide time with a better precision than 1 second.IÂ´m looking for something like millis() thats enough precision for my caseCode Python :
Summary: Use  instead of , to measure a short duration.16ms error for  is not surprising on Windows.Currently, Python uses  to implement  on Windows that has  the resolution (precision) of 0.1ms (instead of 's 1ms) and the accuracy is between 0.5 ms and 15 ms (you could change it system-wide using ). See Python bug: Use  to get a resolution of 100 ns on Windows and another SO question: How does python's time.time() method work?A better alternative to measure short time intervals on Windows is to use  that is implemented using  on Windows. For portability, you could use  that is assigned to  on Windows,  on other systems, and it is  since Python3.3. See Python - time.clock() vs. time.time() - accuracy?
