What I'd like to accomplish is to set  to  in the example below:As the comment says, in the  loop, a new class member called  is created, rather than setting the existing  member to .5  
Use  to set attributes dynamically:or update the internal attribute dictionary directly ( will serve as a proxy for the  attribute):The latter approach will fail if an object doesn't have the  attribute (e.g. it was defined with the  attribute).
