There any way to optimize these two functions ?first function:second function:
Yes:The first function basically checks for membership, in which case you could use the  keyword. The second function can be reduced to a list comprehension to filter out elements from  list based on your condition.
For first functionYou can make it in 1 lineFor 2nd, use a list comp like shown in the other answer
What you are doing with your two functions is building the complement as ozgur pointed out.Using sets is the most easy thing hereyour  would be the first list and your  the second list.The only difference is that your new user is only once in the result no matter how often it is in the 
Disclaimer: I assumed  has no duplicate elements. Otherwise, use this solution.What you want is exactly the set complement of  in . As an alternative approach, you can use  to get the difference between two lists and I think it should be much more performant than the naive look up which takes .
