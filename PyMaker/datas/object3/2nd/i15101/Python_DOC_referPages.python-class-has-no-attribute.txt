I'm new to Python and I'm learning about classes and functions and I want to print a class's function but all i get is the error "Class has no attribute"items.py:main.py:The error is
 is not an attribute on the  class, no. It is a subclass, and a global name in its own right. You can import it from your  module:You cannot create an instance of it, because used the wrong name for the  method:Note that the method you created has three underscores in the name. If you fix that:you can create instances of the  class:Now, if you really wanted to create attributes on the  class, you'll have to add those after you created the class:You don't need to create subclasses for that. You could use the  module here though:Here  is an attribute of :
Here's what you're doing wrong: is a subclass of , not an attribute of it. Your error is popping up when you try to do . Gold is accessed entirely separately.You need to instantiate your classes into objects. Once you instantiate an object, you can call your methods on it and access its attributes. Each object stores methods and attributes independently, so one gold coin can have a different name, description, value, or even print its info differently.When trying to access a parent class from within a subclass, you just reference the class name directly rather than using .You have an extra underscore in your  class's So with that in mind, your new  should look like this:And your  will look like this:
You can call functions that are in  from the  class but not the other way around. So your main should be:Please note that if you don't end functions with (), then you'll just get the string representation of the function. But if you do that in your current code it wouldn't work unless you create the object first and then call .
