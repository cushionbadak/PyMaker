I need to create a script to ask a user to input a string containing round numbers separated by a space. Then I need to convert the string to integers.Any pointers on where to start? This is what I've tried:but I keep getting:
You are trying to cast a string representation of a list, just split the contents into a list and use map to cast to ints:This presumes the user always enters two numbers separated by a space.Safer use a while loop and a try/except:If you have an unknown amount of ints entered:Using , map returns a map object so it is an efficient way to assign. will also work but unless you need a list there is no point creating one.
The Lengthy AnswerOversymplifyng the issue, the  builtin (follow the link to know the whole story) requires a single argument, either a numeric literal or a string.Your codeis creating the textual representation of a list, because you use the  builtin that returns a textual representation of a python object:The above is not the textual representation of a number, as required by , but the textual representation of a list, so when you pass it to  it complains What if we omit the call to ?Note that the error message is different: no more a  but a .  We have a list, whose items are strings representing numbers, but we're not allowed to use the list as is as an argument to .Enter list comprehension, the contemporary idiom to manipulate the contents of a list (or of a generic iterable).The syntax is easy,  you have the opening and closing bracket, as you would write when using a list literal, and inside you have an inside-out loop, first the body of the loop and then the  specification.  The results of the evaluation of the body are sequentially stored in a list, that the interpreter outputs for you, as you can see above we have no more strings representing numbers but integers. Assign the result of the list comprehension to a variableand you're done:
After  you have a  of , so you need to convert each of the individual items to .You could use a list comprehensionOr use 
You need to convert each element of the list into int using the following way,  This will give you a list of integers that you could use in your program. In case if it is an invalid integer, then you can use ,
