A small part of a bigger code problem I am working on: I am reading the content from a file: glmfile.glm. I am trying to write each line from glmfile.glm to another file: combined.glm skipping lines meeting certain criteria.The content of glmfile.glm looks like this:Now, I formed an array of  that looks like this:I am comparing the name of glmfile with the elements in the array to see if the object node name is listed in the array :NOTE: The problem I am struggling with is in the above code snippet in  comment.
how about using an extra index and the modulo operator:for example:
Let's talk broad terms first, and specify from there.You have objects that look like:You're trying to write from one file full of these objects to another blank file, only taking such objects thatLet's do this then:That said, if this was something you're going to be doing over and over again, it's probably better to write a parser for this.
