I maintain a benchmark library with gz-compressed files that contain descriptive metadata in the first few lines. By hand, I can decompress a 246MB gz-compressed file (using gunzip), change it, and compress it back (using gzip) in under 2 minutes using the linux terminal. On the same file, the following script takes almost 5 minutes to complete (using Python 2.7.5) and 12+ minutes (using Python 3.4.1) before I killed it. Any suggestions on how to achieve higher performance?
Gzip on the command line defaults to a compression level of 6.  Python, however, defaults to a compression level of 9, which is slower but produces smaller files.  You can either pass  to  if you want larger files sooner, or pass  to  if you want smaller files later.
