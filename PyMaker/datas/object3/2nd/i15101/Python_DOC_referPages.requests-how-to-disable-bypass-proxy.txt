I am getting an url with:As I can see in the 'access.log' of "myserver.com", the client's system proxy is used. But I want to disable using proxies at all with .
The only way I'm currently aware of for disabling proxies entirely is the following:Create a sessionSet  to Create your request using that sessionThis is based on this comment by Lukasa and the (limited) documentation for .Note: Setting  to  also ignores the following:Authentication information from  (code)CA bundles defined in  or  (code)If however you only want to disable proxies for a particular domain (like ), you can use the  environment variable:
You can choose proxies for each request. From the docs:So to disable the proxy, just set each one to None:
requests library respects environment variables.http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/advanced/#proxiesSo try deleting environment variables HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY.
The way to stop requests/urllib from proxying any requests is to set the the  (or ) environment variable to  e.g. in bash:Or from Python:To understand why this works is because the urllib.request.getproxies function first checks for any proxies set in the environment variables (e.g. http_proxy etc) or if none are set then it will check for system configured proxies using platform specific calls (e.g. On MacOS it will check using the system scutil/configd interfaces, and on Windows it will check the Registry). Then when urllib attempts to use any proxies the  function it will check for the presence and setting of the  environment variable - which can either be set to specific hostnames as mentioned above or it can be set the special  value whereby all hosts bypass the proxy.
