I have 5,00,000 urls. and want to get response of each asynchronously.I want 200 connections at a time(concurrent 200), not more than this because when I run this program for 50 urls it works fine, i.e but if I pass whole list, i get this errormay be frequency is too much and server is denying to respond after a limit?
Yes, one can expect a server to stop responding after causing too much traffic (whatever the definition of "too much traffic") to it.One way to limit number of concurrent requests (throttle them) in such cases is to use , similar in use to these used in multithreading: just like there, you create a semaphore and make sure the operation you want to throttle is aquiring that semaphore prior to doing actual work and releasing it afterwards.For your convenience,  implements context manager to make it even easier.Most basic approach:
