I'm trying to add the sssl.SSlContext to a urlopen method but keep getting the error:I'm using python 3 and urllib. This has a context parameter defined - https://docs.python.org/2/library/urllib.html. So I don't understand why it is throwing the error. But either way this is the code:Can someone explain what I am doing wrong?
According to  documentation:Changed in version 3.4.3: context was added.the parameter  will be added in Python 3.4.3. You need to fall back for lower version.In Python 2.x, it's added in Python 2.7.9. (, )
You're looking at the wrong docs. https://docs.python.org/3.0/library/urllib.request.html are the ones you want. You were using Python 2.X documentation.
