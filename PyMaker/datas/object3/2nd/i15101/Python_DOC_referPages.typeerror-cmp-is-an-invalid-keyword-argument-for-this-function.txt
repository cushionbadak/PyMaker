I'm using Python3, but the script is not compatible with this version and I hit some errors. Now I have problem with  parameter. Here is the codeI would really appreciate any help how to deal with this error in Python3.
You should try to rewrite your  function to a key function instead. In this case it looks like you can simply return the  function output for just one element:I took the liberty of replacing the  code with the  function, a far more compact and readable method to sum a series of integers.The above too will first sort by the output of , and by the length of each sorted element in case of a tie.The  function is hugely inefficient however; I'd use a  class here instead:This function will work in both Python 2 and 3:If you cannot, you can use the  utility function to adapt your  argument, but take into account this is not an ideal solution (it affects performance).
