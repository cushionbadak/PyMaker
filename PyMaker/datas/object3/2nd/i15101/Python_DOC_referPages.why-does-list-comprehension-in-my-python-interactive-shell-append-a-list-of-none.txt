This question already has an answer here:Is it Pythonic to use list comprehensions for just side effects?                    7 answers                I'm testing some Django functionality in my interactive shellHere's my attempt to probe these objects, note the list of Nones at the endAnd with a more orthodox list comprehension:Nine Nones, all in a row.Why am I getting that?
Because  returns a value, namely . What it prints and what it returns are two different things.
This is because, you use Python 3.x, in which print function returns None after printing to the console and thus you are getting this output. Whereas, if you have used Python 2.x, you will correctly get a SyntaxError for the print function.A better example will be this(in python 2.x as your example wont work in python 2.x)If you wish to print things AND add it to the list, it should be like this:However, in my view, refrain from using such things as things might get ugly after some period of time.
