You are calling the  method on string .Try 
When you do:Python interprets it as:because the method invocation   has a tighter binding than the  operator.  Meaning, it applies to just the string  and not the combined string .Moreover, calling the  method on the string  is effectively a no-op:So, the string that is written to the file is just  or .To fix the problem, simply include the newline in the format string:
You are currently formatting the \nto format the whole string you need to tell that's the \n is a part of your string.
It's formatting the  (new line) string and then adding the braces.  Try this.
Just use brackets:Or, maybe better:Then the  will be applied to the whole string.
Try the code below:Take a look at this documentation https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-examples to see format examples.Also you forget to use "\n" on each value.Regards,
