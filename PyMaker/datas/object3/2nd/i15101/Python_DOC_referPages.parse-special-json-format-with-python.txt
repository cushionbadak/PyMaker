I want to get GPSLatitude and GPSLongitude value, but I can't use python position because the position is pretty random. I get the value by tag's value, how can I do that?
With the exception of the last comma just before the closing bracket , the entire object returned by the FlickrAPI is valid json. Assuming that that comma is merely a copy-paste error (example evidence suggests this is the case), then the builtin json module still won't be usable as is. That's because even though a string like  is valid json, python's json module will complain with a ValueError because the double quote  isn't sufficiently quoted:The solution is to add another escaping backslash:For your full  response, you could add those extra backslashes with the  module:That quoted response can then be used in a call to  and you can then easily access the required data in the newly generated dictionary structure:
You don't say whether you using one of the Flickr APIs; I assume not because handling JSON responses is trivial if you are using an API such as flickrapi.But continuing with the assumption that you are not using an API, the response format that you are seeing is actually JSONP which is better suited to Javascript than it is Python. You can, however, request a response in JSON representation that does not have the enclosing  function wrapper. Do this by specifying  in the query parameters of the request. Using the requests library makes requesting and parsing the JSON response easy, but this will work just as well with  combined with  if you can't use  e.g.
If looking at the whole string as ,  is a standard JSON string. With  library,  can be converted to python dictionary and then parsed easily.
