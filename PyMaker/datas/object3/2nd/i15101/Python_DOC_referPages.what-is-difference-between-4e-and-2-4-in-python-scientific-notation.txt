I can't quite understand what the difference is between the two print statements below for the number I am trying to express in scientific notation.  I thought the the bottom one is supposed to allow 2 spaces for the printed result, and move the decimal place 4 times, but the result I get does not corroborate that understanding. As far as the first one, What does 4e mean?All help greatly appreciated.
In the first example ,  means, 4 decimal places in scientific notation. You can come to know that by doing In the second example,  , means 4 significant figures. And  means to fit the whole data into 2 charactersTesting with different value of You can learn more from the python documentation on 
If you want to produce a float, you will have to specify the float type:Otherwise, if you don’t specify a type, Python will choose  as the type for which precision will mean the precision based on its significant figures, the digits before and after the decimal point. And since you have a precision of , it will only display 4 digits, falling back to scientific notation so it doesn’t add false precision.The precision is a decimal number indicating how many digits should be displayed after the decimal point for a floating point value formatted with  and , or before and after the decimal point for a floating point value formatted with  or . For non-number types the field indicates the maximum field size - in other words, how many characters will be used from the field content. The precision is not allowed for integer values.(source, emphasis mine)Finally, note that the width (the  in above format string) includes the full width, including digits before the decimal point, digits after it, the decimal point itself, and the components of the scientific notation. The above result would have a width of 12, so in this case, the width of the format string is simply ignored.
