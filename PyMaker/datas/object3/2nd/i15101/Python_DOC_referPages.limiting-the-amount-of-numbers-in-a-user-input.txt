I'm making a 4 digit password guesser in python 3. I want to make sure that you can only put in 4 digit passwords and not 5 or 6 digit passwords. Here is the code I have so far.
Before you cast the input to an int, cast it to a str instead, then you can call the len() builtin method to check the length of the entered string. Check the documentation for details on this method. If it is greater than 4, then you should recall your input call. Something like the following should work:In this condition the loop would not be ran, however if the entered string was not equal to 4, the loop would run until that condition was satisfied.
I hope that helped...
