I am trying to read a dicom header tag in dicom file.  Now, there are two ways to read this dicom header tag. 1) Using pydicom package in python which apparently is not working well on my python installed version(python 3).2) or when i call AFNI function 'dicom_hinfo' through command line, i can get dicom tag value. The syntax to call afni function in terminal is as follows:dicom_hinfo -tag aaaa,bbbb filename.dcmoutput:fgreNow how should i call this dicom-info -tag aaaa,bbbb filename.dcm in python script.I guess subprocess might work but not sure about how to use it in this case. 
To get output from a subprocess, you could use  function: is used to get Unicode text on Python 3 (the data is decoded using user locale's character encoding). assumes that  prints to its standard output stream (stdout). Some utilities may print to stderr or the terminal directly instead. The code could be modified to adapt to that.
Oh this was due to syntax error using Pydicom. I wanted to access 0019, 109c tag. Syntax should be:ds[0x0019,0x109c].value. not ds[aaaa,bbbb].value
