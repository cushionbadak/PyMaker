I am new to Python and got the following data to work with:https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/86876232/6358.csvThe linked file is only a fraction of the entire data (the data should contain a bit over 15000 lists). First of all in what format is this data? And how do I get it from that format into lists so I can slice the volume data out.When I use a module to read the csv data, I get not every list as separate list, but one big list, with every list as a value.And this is how the data looks like: 4;"false";"null";"null";"Osebni avto";"20";"Pobo√Ñje";"5.0";"3-9m3  (velikost osebnega avtomobila)";"3.0";"null";"30";"10";"10";"null";"null";"null";"50";"false";"And if it is better to have it in a dictionary how am I going to do this? There is no key in the data which I can assign to the value. The information consist purely of different values.

Your best bet is to avoid manually reading in csv files and just use one of the default modules python has for reading them in. There's quite a lot of code snippets for using csv around the net so you should have any issues. Also I think you'll be better off with dictionaries than lists.
