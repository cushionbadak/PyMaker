New to mock and patch in python. I have a class which has a method updateNow in another class I have to test the update method and ascertain that the update method calls in update_in method. How do I achieve this ?
You should use  to replace the method with a mock, and then you can assert various things about the mock after calling your  method.
By  from  module you can patch methods, functions, object or attribute of your production code. Now I assume  in  and I will show you some simple way of how to do your test. Now instead of  you can use  and patch the reference of  in the module of your tests. My feel is to use  just when you cannot do otherwise: you must be sure that you are patching the code that will be called by your test and not something else. For instance you have  the use  and now you test a method in  like:Now the reference of  used by  is not the one in your test module. Next test will failIs a good practice take a look to Where to patch session before to start to ride  functions.Just a note about use :  is a real powerful option of  functions family, your patched object will take the signature and the attributes from the original reference and prevent some silly errors in your test. To understand the value of  take a look to the next example:The previous test pass even if you check by the wrong arguments just because  is a standard  return a  object for every attribute you ask or every method you call without raise any exception: in that scenario  will return a .
