I am writing a python script and then using a subprocess to log to the syslog.  The log structure is made up of variables:SensorAlertEach variable is pulled from a database so to get the correct sensor and the correct alert.  My problem is that I can not build the alert because I am messing up the variables as arguments.In my code above the syslog comment is constructed of the "Sensor ID" and then the "Alert Test" so that log entry should read as:I am getting the "Not enough arguments to build a sentence" error.  I suspect I am submitting my arguments incorrectly.

Use  function. Clear and more elegant.
You need pass tuple to string formatting:    
You don't need  module to log to syslog. You could use  module instead:It writes to syslog on my machine:If you want; you can use :Note:  module does not use shell by default therefore you don't need to escape anything. In particular, you don't need the single quotes here.There is also  stdlib module.
