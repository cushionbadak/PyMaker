I'm writing a web app that requires an objective source of time "atomic clock or otherwise" to deal with API rate limits that reset every 15 minutes.Is there a python library out there for this task or should I try scraping a webpage or what?EDIT:  I'm sorry for not being philosophically clear about "objective."  I just meant a website that offers a reasonably accurate source of time, instead of my computer or otherwise, that's accurate within a minute or two.  
Wall time. The API resets once every 15 minutes. Within ~15 seconds accuracy but I'm flexible. You could use :Return the value (in fractional seconds) of a monotonic clock, i.e. a  clock that cannot go backwards. The clock is not affected by system  clock updates. The reference point of the returned value is undefined,  so that only the difference between the results of consecutive calls  is valid.You could call  every 15 minutes. The difference  is the elapsed time measured well within 15 seconds tolerance.PEP 418: Add monotonic time, performance counter, and process time functions mentions what hardware clocks are typically available and the properties of the corresponding OS time functions.You could implement  on Python 2.7 if necessary.
What makes you think that the site you are scraping also uses "objective time"?I suggest you slow your request rate to something like 5% below the stated limit.That should give enough leeway that a low-resolution "non-objective" timer will keep you out of trouble.
