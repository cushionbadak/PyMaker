I have a problem with understanding how data is exchanged between processes (multiprocessing implementation). It behaves as parameters are passed as reference (or copy - depends whether it is mutable or imutable variable). If so, how it is achieved between processes?Below examplary code is understandable for me if it is executed within one process (ConsumerProcess is a thread not a process for instance) but how does it work if it is exercised within 2 separate processes?
The  library either lets you use shared memory, or in the case your  class, using a manager service that coordinates communication between processes.See the Sharing state between processes and Managers sections in the documentation.Managers use Proxy objects to represent state in a process. The  class is such a proxy. State is then shared via d states:An important feature of proxy objects is that they are picklable so they can be passed between processes.
