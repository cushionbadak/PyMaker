For some reason this code does not write newlines to the file, as it would do if I had used the  function instead of .How do I solve this?
not sure what you are talking about ... also showing you how to have a complete runnable examplebased on the comments the real answer is DONT USE NOTEPAD
 does not handle newlines correctly ( mode is deprecated):Underlying encoded files are always opened in binary mode. No  automatic conversion of '\n' is done on reading and writing.Use builtin  function instead. If you want the same code to work on both Python 2 and 3 from the same source; you could use .
