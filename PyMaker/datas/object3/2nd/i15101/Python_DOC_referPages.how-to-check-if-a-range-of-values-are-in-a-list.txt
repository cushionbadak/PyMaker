Since you only have two numbers, simple conditional operators will suffice:Otherwise, if you have more numbers, you can use  and a generator expression:
You can try it this way (using ):The integers can be an iterable of any length, say . It'll check them one at a time to verify if it satisfies the condition that . The first one that does will short-circuit the result to . The code inside the condition then executes successfully.
You might look into using a . 
You could use :If your list is not ordered, you have to add  before proceeding with the use of
