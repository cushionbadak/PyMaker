I am attempting to implement a priority queue in Python. I am following an example that I found online. The  class overrides the  method so that the priority queue can order itself. I am getting a error when I run:I've found several examples online that say as long as you overload the  method the priority queue should be good.I'm currently running Python 3.4.1 on my computer.
 was removed in Python3, you should use the rich comparison dunder methods instead , , , , , .They work as follows:You can also use the the class decorator  which allows you to specify  and any one of  and it will infer the rest of the rich comparison methods.
 and  were only used in Python 2.x; they no longer exist in Python 3.x.  Nowadays, you overload the comparison operators directly by implementing , , , , , and .You can read about this change on the What's New In Python 3.0 page under Ordering Comparisons:The  function should be treated as gone, and the   special method is no longer supported. Use  for sorting,   with , and other rich comparisons as needed.
