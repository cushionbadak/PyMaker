Natural Text
I am consistently getting this error message in python 3.4.2,(I must use this version), this is the accused line of the error:
You are trying to add up integers and a string:You'd normally have to convert to a common type first, like a string:but you can also use string formatting:The latter gives you more flexibility in how the output string is formed.
I'm guessing those vars are not strings
