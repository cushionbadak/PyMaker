I'm writing several functions which accept an argument called , which is allowed only to have certain values (namely,  or ). If it doesn't, I would like a  to be raised.For brevity, I would like to define a decorator for this. So far, I have come up with the following:The problem is that this only works if  is the first positional argument of the function. However, I would like to allow for  to appear at any position.To be specific, here are some (dummy) functions called  and  which accept an argument  at different positions, and some test cases to go with them:Currently all the tests pass except the third one, because the first positional argument  is interpreted as the  rather than as the  as it should be.How can I adapt the  decorator such that all the tests pass?
You can use the  module's  function:
Here is another solution using inspect.getcallargs:It makes all the tests pass.
