However when I try to convert to uppercase it works fine. Here is example code:Here is how it looks when it is corrupted:What's going on here?Some info that might be useful:I'm using Windows 10 cmd promptPython version 3.6.0chcp is set to 65001
It's not corrupted.Turkish has both a dotted lowercase  and a dotless lowercase , and similarly a dotted uppercase  and a dotless uppercase .This presents a challenge when converting the dotted uppercase  to lowercase: how to retain the information that, if it needs to be converted back to uppercase, it should be converted back to the dotted ?Unicode solves this problem as follows: when  is converted to lowercase, it's actually converted to the standard latin  plus the combining character U+0307 "COMBINING DOT ABOVE". What you're seeing is your terminal's inability to properly render (or, more to the point, refrain from rendering) the combining character, and has nothing to do with Python.You can see that this is happening using :... although, in a working and correctly configured terminal, it will render without any problems:As a side note, if you do convert it back to uppercase, it will remain in the decomposed form:… although you can recombine it with :For more information, see:Internationalization for Turkish: Dotted and Dotless Letter "I"What's Wrong With Turkey?
