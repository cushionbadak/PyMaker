Natural Text
Well, i want to receive some bytes from a client to a server in python. So I send some strings from client: OLA, 135 and A.The code lines of server is:I want to write these strings sended by client in a txt file. But after I received all strings in the server I open the txt file created and there are nothing. What is wrong?
In python, open file with  removes previous file.So using "a" to keep existing data.Reference : https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files
