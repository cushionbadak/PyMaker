Natural Text
I'm currently experimenting with some basic Python. I'm trying to import 4 different pieces of information from a .txt document into Python. From there I will split it all up, add it to a record. After that I plan on asking the user whether or not they would like to add another entry to the record. If so, then allow them to enter the required information and save it back to the file, as a new entry.I wrote a piece of code that will ask the user to enter each piece of information individually, but was entering the same thing every time and it got really annoying. It worked perfectly, here it is:The problem I encountered was when I tried to enter multiple, individual strings and integers which I was wanting to add to different arrays, like above. Here's the code for that:I error (line 28) I was getting was: ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: ', Viewforth'Here is the file I was reading from (after "Viewforth" there is a new line):Harris, 16, 5, ViewforthCody, 16, 5, ViewforthWilliam, 16, 5, ViewforthRoss, 17, 6, ViewforthJust to clarify, I want to save everything before the first comma to "names", between comma 1 and 2 to "ages", 2 and 3 to "years" and everything after the third to "schools".Thanks ahead for your help,Harris

Something line the following:
