I would like to pass hex numbers, (example 0xff) into a write function, which takes data in, as a string, example h.write('\xFF') this works.But when I pass hex numbers from a variable and try to use that data in the write function, I'm unable to do that.Below is the code I've tried.I'm actually using a FTDI ft2232h usb to parallel 8 bit converter.there are no error messages as such just that I don't see the output on the oscilloscope screen. Only when I hard code it it works, like Python version = 3.6Os Win7 64bitThank you,Sleeba
If you are reading hex strings from a file and you want to convert them to bytes the simple way is to use binascii.unhexlify. Here's a short demo.outputIf you write  to a file (or file-like object) opened in binary mode then the file will receive the bytes , , , .However, if you are generating numerical data that you wish to convert to bytes, the easy way to do that is to use a  object. Here's an example that synthesizes a single cycle of a sine wave.Here's the hexdump of the contents of 'scope.bin':
