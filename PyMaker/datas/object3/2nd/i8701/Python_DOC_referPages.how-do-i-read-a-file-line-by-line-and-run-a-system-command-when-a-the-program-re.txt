Natural Text
I am trying to make something like a command-line interface. Here is the relevant code:I want to add a command called "run". What it should do is, read a text file line by line and check whether the command in the text file is a valid one and run the command. I have researched a lot about this on the internet but failed to get a proper answer. The closest I could get was to execute the last line in the text file.I do not have much experience with python.Please give me a helping hand.Thank you,Jithin Renji
