I want to check the  package in python. And call the  function:It is puzzling than the different of  and . There is an additional  in . I open the source of , and find there is no function named . There is only :
This shouldn't puzzle you. ed names are visible in the  output since  lists it's attributes.  is an attribute of the module  since importing it brings it in the  module namespace (dictionary).  Looking at 's documentation tells you this:The default  mechanism behaves differently with different types of objects, as it attempts to produce the most relevant, rather than complete, information:If the object is a module object, the list contains the names of the module’s attributes.(emphasis mine) is just an explicit list of names exported when  is used, it can be viewed as the "public API" of a given module.
