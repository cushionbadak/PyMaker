Hopefully the title makes sense as I don't really know how to phrase this well.I'm using Python and am writing something to parse through iTunes weirdly formatted text files that are made when you export playlist data. I used panda to read a csv, and can loop through each column that iTunes made. For reference here is an example on how this file is laid out:I read them in with:The  is how I want to print them out to a file. I want to be able to scan a string and replace the column name in between  with the value in the current row while looping through every row. I also want the user to specify this string, so if the  matches with a column in , then we proceed with converting it to that format.For the example above, this code would use the  to loop through and come out with this text file:
Like this in Python 3.x. This or other tutorial about format string will help you.Also, as for your case (), print like this.
