I'm really new to programming in general, but I'm a fast learner. I've been working on a project. I wanted to make a simple hangman game, but I hit a road block and I'd like to figure it out before continuing.I'm trying to assign correct guesses to an empty variable and print is as they go, but it seems I can't assign "items" to strings. Is there an alternative method I could use?Here's the code
Python strings are immutable, they can't be modified.You can treat your string as a listThen join chars together
There are some other ways, that have been suggested. If you're determined to keep the string answer, try this:This creates a new string by adding (string add is concatenation) together three substrings: first, the substring created by slicing the original string from zero (default: ) up to , non-inclusive. That is, answer[0] ... answer[index_num-1]. Then the , which is a string (or a char, same difference). Finally, another substring, this one from  running up to the end (default: ).
