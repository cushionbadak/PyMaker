I'm following a tutorial on Flask Web Development.I'm trying to build a database, and this is what I should getbut when I try, I don't have the names but this:I've tried to do all the procedure more times to check if I did something different from the tutorial, but the result is still the same. Do you know what's the cause and how can I overcome it?Thanks in advance for helping this newbie.
In the class you define,as Role or User, you should rewrite  function.
