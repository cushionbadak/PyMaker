I would like to convert argument in prent method to filter list result with filter of an local instance object. That is what I would like approximatively for the conceptThis is what i do actualy
We can use  to create a suitable filtering function from the keyword arg name and the associated value.To demonstrate this code I created a simple  object, and a  function.outputHere's a new version that handles multiple keywords. Only items that pass all of the filter tests are returned. I've changed the test object names slightly and added a  call to  to make it easier to see what's going on. This code works on both Python 2 and Python 3. outputNote that this code can handle any number of keywords, not just two.I've also included an experimental function  which returns the objects that pass any of the filters. It uses a set  to accumulate the matching objects, so it doesn't preserve order. Also, putting objects that don't define  and  methods into sets (or using them as  keys) is risky. See the  for details.
