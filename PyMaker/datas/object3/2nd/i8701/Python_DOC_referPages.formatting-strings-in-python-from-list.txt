Here's my program. I'm trying to format the output from the list like this below:If anyone could help me because I find that due to the differing length of each string in the list throws off the alignment so there must be a better way to align the information correctly. Thanks ahead of time.
CODE ON THE ENDI changed a few things in your code. Firstly, since you have no methods that are not accesors i used namedtuple instead of your Employee class. If you really need getters and setters (in class) please read this loudly and make it sink in: If I must have them then I will hide them behind a property.(paraphrased quote from here). By property I mean true pythonic properties.However try not to do this, see : this answerSecondly, you have to check if user gave you good type (hence try-except).Thirdly, I used something called Format Specification Mini-Language (a.k.a. formatspec) . It really helps if it comes to string formatting.This is what I got from main2():If you want to know more about python string formatting here you can find a great tutorial.Also I would like to recommend one of my favourite articles about java vs python python is not java
Using only the relevant portion of your code, and the Format Specification Mini-Language, here's an attempt:Output:Surely it's straightforward enough to modify and get it formatted as you wish.
