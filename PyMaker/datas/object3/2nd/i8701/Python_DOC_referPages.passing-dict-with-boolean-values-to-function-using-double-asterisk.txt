I have something like this:The behavior I'm seeing, using a debugger, is that  in  is equal to this:My obviously mistaken understanding of the double asterisk is that it is supposed to pack and unpack a dictionary of key value pairs, allowing you to pass dictionaries into methods as keyword arguments. However, two things confuse me:Why is the packing nesting the dictionary under a  key?Why is the boolean being dropped?I'd ideally like to avoid both of these behaviors, but am clearly missing something about how the particulars of this double asterisk behavior works.
I'm not sure what the behaviour of your code was, but for me it throws an error. We can get the same error with a smaller example:throws:The problem is simply that this isn't how the  syntax works.  denotes a function that can take an arbitrary number of named variables, like so:printsYou however are passing it the object , in other words you are passing the function one positional variable -- no named variables. Hence the exception.The other distinct syntactical use of  is for unpacking a dictionary of kwargs into a function that has been defined in the usual way to accept named arguments, for example:printsTo get fully to grips with this you should check out the tutorial in the Python docs, here:https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#more-on-defining-functions
