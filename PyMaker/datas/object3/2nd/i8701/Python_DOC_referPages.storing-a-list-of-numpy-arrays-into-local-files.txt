Natural Text
I am currently working on training a neural network and the preprocessing step takes a while to go through, especially when I want to tweak the parameter of my network structure. My input data consist of a list of numpy arrays, stored in 4 different variables. Is possible to store these list of numpys into local files, such that I just could load them and start the training rather than loading the raw files and begin preprocess that. 
You can save numpy arrays using numpy.save (or numpy.savez for multiple arrays at once) and load them again using numpy.load.e.g. saving arrays:e.g. loading arrays
