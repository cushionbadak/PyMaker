I'm creating a program that should create a file with every possible combination of given characters and put them in a file. It will of course go until I stop it or until I run out of memory obviously.Though, my idea is that the code reads the file and iterates over THOSE lines, while making new lines. I do not want it to iterate over the new lines though, which it is doing. Any help?
To form these combinations we can use the  function, which creates the Cartesian product of the iterables you pass it. This function returns an iterator, so you can loop over the tuples it yields without having to store them into a list.Here's a small demo that you can modify for your purposes.This program is very simple, so you will have to hit CtrlC to kill it if you get impatient waiting for it to generate a large password.
