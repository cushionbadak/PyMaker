Say I have a list with mathematical operators in it, like thisAnd I am taking a random operator from here, like thisIf I take two numbers, say 4 and 2, how can I get Python to do the mathematical operation (under the name 'op') with the numbers?
You better do not specify the operators as text. Simply use lambda expressions, or the  module:You can then call the  by calling it with two arguments, like:For example:So as you can see, the  picked the  operator, so it subtracted  from .In case you want to define an function that is not supported by , etc. you can use a lambda-expression, like:So here you specified a function that takes the parameters  and  and calculates  (of course you can define an arbitrary expression yourself).
You can use  if you are absolutely certain that what you are passing to it is safe like so:Just keep in mind that  executes code without running any checks on it so take care. Refer to this for more details on the topic when using  to do a safe evaluation.
