I want to compare two files from two different folders based on when they were created.The files were created at different times, but I get the same time and date as output; why? I would like to compare the timestamps of these two files so that whenever  is changed we make a new copy of it in .
You probably want to use the  or the  methods for getting the last modification or creation timestamp, respectively.From the docs,  returns the time of last access of path. Ref: https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.getatime
