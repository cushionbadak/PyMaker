Okay, the tangent I'm talking about isn't tangent inverse, but the tangent that is able to solve missing angle lengths in a right triangle. So far, I've been able to divide the opposite leg by a adjacent length. For some reason, the program will only use the else statement, and say nope. Please help! THANKS so much in advance. 
You're not updating  after rounding. Note that float objects are immutable and  returns a numeric type; there isn't an in-place update of  after rounding.You need an assignment to rebind the returned float object to :
There are multiple problems here: is a string, so it will never equal a floating point number.  Note that you only assign to tan once. The output of your rounding operations is either printed or discarded but not stored in .  You probably want something like this:You compare against a floating point number with . You should never check equality with floating point numbers! (unless you assign them as literals.) You should instead always check how close two numbers are:Also: Don't convert anything to strings, unless you need to operate on the string (e.g., index it).  Why don't you use Python math functions?
