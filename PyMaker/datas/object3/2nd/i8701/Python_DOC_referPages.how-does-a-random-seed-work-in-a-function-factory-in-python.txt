Suppose I want to generate a bunch of binary number generators given the success probabilities. One concern I have is about the random seed. The random seeds for f1, f2, f3 are their creation time, right? And the seeds are fixed for each function regardless of the random seed in the global namespace, right?
You pass in a seed to the global random object each time you call , because all top-level functions in the  module feed into a singleton object. This means that by the time  is created, the seeds set in  and  have been superseded, the seeds are not independent from the global random object. Importing  again for each  call does not give you a new state, as really only binds names anew each time once the module object itself is loaded (only on the first import).If you want to have a seeded random generator per function, you need to create individual  instances:From the  module documentation:The functions supplied by this module are actually bound methods of a hidden instance of the  class. You can instantiate your own instances of  to get generators that donâ€™t share state.
