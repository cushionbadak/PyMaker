Complete newbie to python, only really looked at it this morning. My question is when defining a function how can I set the "return(variable)" statement as a string. I assumed the below would be the correct method however the syntax is incorrect, struggling to find resources online for this particular way of converting the data type. The result is forming as follows:"The result is:286"By converting it to a string it should form:"The result is: 286"Here is what I thought would work:
A few things:Python spacing matters, so don't forget to indent!Check your  syntax. Everything you're printing should be inside the parens One form of correct syntax would be:
You have to properly indent the code to function, also the return statement ends the function.Also, if you want to convert the result of your computation to a string for printing only, you should not return a string from your function, but rather do the conversion when you want to print the result.
