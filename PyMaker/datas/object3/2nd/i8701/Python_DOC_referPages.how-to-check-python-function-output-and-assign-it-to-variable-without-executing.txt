Let's say I want to do the followingmeanwhile somewhere else in the project:This looks like the heavy function will be called twice, which is really bad. Another option I can imagine:Maybe there is a more elegant way?
The  can help you sometimes:Decorator to wrap a function with a memoizing callable that saves up to the maxsize most recent calls. It can save time when an expensive or I/O bound function is periodically called with the same arguments.That's new in Python 3.2.  Easy to write your own decorator, if you're on old Python.  If you're working with methods/attributes on a class,  is useful.  
In some languages you are able to assign a variable as part of the condition block, but in Python that's not possible (see Can we have assignment in a condition? )
