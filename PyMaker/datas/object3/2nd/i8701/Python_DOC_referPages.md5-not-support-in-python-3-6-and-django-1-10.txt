I want to decrypt response received from CCavenue.In their refrence code they use md5 library but for django 1.10 with python 3.6 not supported.ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'md5'
In python3.x,you should use this:You can now feed this object with bytes-like objects (normally  bytes) using the update() method.e.g.Module name:   md5 .  Rationale:     Replaced by the 'hashlib' module.  Date:          15-May-2007 .  Documentation: Documented as deprecated as of Python 2.5, but listing  in this PEP was neglected.DeprecationWarning raised as of Python 2.6.See more details from hashlib.
