I have compiled from the sources and installed python 3.6 and when I type python3.6 in the console I get:I have read (here https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#environment-variables) that in general I don't need set PYTHONHOME variable (and I don't want set it). I have installed also other python version (2.7 and 3.4) without problem.I understand by  the shared object libraries that loads python like these:If I print sys.path:you can see that python are searching in that directory.When I try to import any dependent library, such as  its works.So, the question is what means  and where is its default path?
If Python 3.6 successfully compiled add  to your  file. Or edit the prefix and exec_prefix on sysconfig file but the former is a simpler solution.
