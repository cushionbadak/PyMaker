I have a scenario where I read file content from url using .However I do not want to actually write the file to disk as I want to continue manipulating the content of  that I downloaded.Is there a way to tell  to never write to disk?
You can use  or  instead of real file object, because they works like file except they write content in memory instead of file.BTW, instead of looping + , you can use : Write a list of lines to the stream. Line separators  are not added, so it is usual for each of the lines provided to have a  line separator at the end.
Simply collect all chunks in a binary object. No need to involve files.Or:
