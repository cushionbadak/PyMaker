A simple way to handle that is to use  which allows you to "safely evaluate an expression node or a string containing ... the following Python literal structures: strings, bytes, numbers, tuples, lists, dicts, sets, booleans, and ":The code can be written on one line like so:For more information about how the asterisk in  works see Unpacking Argument Lists from The Python Tutorial.Note:  Do not be tempted to  in place of .   is really dangerous because it cannot safely handle untrusted input, so you should not get comfortable using it.   
Replace the last line with . splits the string into a list of the three arguments. converts the elements of the list to integers.  the list so that the three elements of the list get passed as parameters.This method relies on your input having the exact format as shown in your example string ( would not work). Steven's response is more robust so I recommend going with that one.
