I have a Python script and I would like to measure the amount of memory that it uses. I have tried  but I could not find the right option for me. I would like something that I can use as:in order to know the amount of memory used during different phases of the program.EDIT:I do not have much experience but I'll try to explain the problem better. I need to deploy my code on a machine where I will have access only to a limited amount of memory (such as 1 GB). As a consequence I need to know how much memory my code will use.  As the code will run incrementally with increasing complexity I need to make sure that the amount of memory used converges to a maximum value. For this reason I need to measure how the amount of memory used changes at different stage of the execution that is in this case represented by a for loop. 
Hmm, if you are using python3.4 and later you can use the tracemalloc module
Im guessing Python3 so try with the "Resource" module. The getrusage function should give you what you need.Start hereexample EDIT:The function returns an object with various properties which you can access (check the docs for every one of them).
