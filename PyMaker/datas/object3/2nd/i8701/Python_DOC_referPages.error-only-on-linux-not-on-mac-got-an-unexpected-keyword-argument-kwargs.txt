I wrote a push notification scheduler in python for research, which will handle sending notifications via NODE .js. It works beautifully on my Mac, no problems. I built a server elsewhere to handle the scheduler, since it's always on. The server runs Debian Wheezy, for reasons I'm not in control of. However, whenever I try to run the code, I get: Still works perfectly on my Mac. I've checked to make sure that all my imported libraries have been downloaded via pip3, but I just can't figure out what my problem is. I've checked out other people with this error on stackoverflow and various other sources, but I wasn't sure that they were having a similar problem to my problem, mostly a class call issue, and I don't think this is that. I've attached the code, although I'm not sure if that helps any. I mean, it's not the cleanest code in the world, but I'm more fluent in mobile dev than python. Any recommendations? UPDATE:Hmm, on further inspection, it looks like the Wheezy system defaults 3.2 and won't accept a request for anything higher than that. Looks like it accepts "argument" but as Klaus suggested, argument also needs notify to be in the same area as the sent notification.So now it looks likeThanks for the assistance with this. 
 only accepts a  argument from Python 3.3 onwards. I guess you are running an older version on your Debian machine.
