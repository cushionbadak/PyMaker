I'm curious, for a small custom python package.If I run the python file that imports and uses function from the package in python2, everything works fine. If I run the file in python3 though it fails importing functions from the package.The functions in the package seem to be python3 compatible, and I used futurize on them just in case. Is the issue to do with some sort of labeling of the package/python version? The package is tiny, 2 .py files of ~8 functions each.Appreciate the help, thanks!
The default dir() mechanism behaves differently with different types  of objects, as it attempts to produce the most relevant, rather than  complete, information.Dir documentationThere are available questions if you want all the available functions.here
