The code I write like this:when I try to run it under python3.6, the error comes:But  I'm just coding under the way the python document shows me:Is there anyone who can please tell me what's wrong with it?
As mentioned in the  docs, you need to pass your comparison function as a  argument not a  argument. So However, using  is much less efficient than , and so  has been deprecated for some time in Python 2, and it has been removed from Python 3.A  function only gets called once for each unique item in the list (or other iterable) that you're sorting. In contrast, a  function must be called every time a comparison is made between two items.It's possible to transform a  function into a  function with , but this is only provided for convenience: it doesn't prevent the inefficiency, it only hides it. So it should only be used as a temporary fix for old code that uses , or in those rare cases where it's not possible to use a  function.For further details, please see the Sorting HOW TO.
It's right in the documentation you show :The  function should only accept one argument : it is called for every single string automatically by . Your function expects 2 arguments, and  doesn't know what  should be.So your code should be :The confusion could come from the fast that in some other languages (e.g. Java), the method expects 2 arguments (see )
In order to use a custom comparator function for Python 3's , you must use , like so:For further information, please refer to the documentation for : https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.cmp_to_key
