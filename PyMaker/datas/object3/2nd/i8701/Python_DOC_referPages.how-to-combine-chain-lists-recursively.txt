For some reason I'm having real trouble wrapping my head around recursive algorithms ...I was wondering if someone could help me come up with a recursive version of the following:I have a list of lists of numbers and I want to get all possible lists of permutations of all the elements.For example, given , I want the output to be:The way I did it is kind ugly:I don't like it ... I feel like recursion might be more elegant.Any thoughts?
You code can be simplified without recursion:For , see Unpacking Argument Lists - Python tutorial.
You can simplify things a bunch. Just pass all the permutation iterators to  and flatten the lists of lists you get out:
