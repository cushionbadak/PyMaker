I have to write a program that will read data from a file, convert it to an integer and total the amount. So far here is what i have. The numbers from the data file "numdata.txt" are: 78,93,85,100,81,76,94,77. When i run the program the first number (78) gets displayed and then one of the exception error messages comes up, the weird thing is that it's different sometimes. If someone could help point me in the right direction I'd appreciate it. I'm still very new to this so please bear with me.I tried and tried but could not get the loop to work correctly so i ended up going this route:main()It's not pretty but it works i guess lol
The exception occurs because you're closing the file immediately after the first iteration, leaving you unable to iterate over the rest of it.Moving  to a finally clause ensures the file is closed no matter what goes wrong.  However, a much better way to read / write files in Python is to use the  keyword, which is a built-in method of ensuring the same thing.
you are closing the file in first iteration  is not indented properly
