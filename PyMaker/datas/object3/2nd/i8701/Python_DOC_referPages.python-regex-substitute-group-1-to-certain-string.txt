I wonder how to substitute group 1 with certain string by regex in python.Question1:Use regex to match str, matched "aaa bbb", and replace group1 "bbb" with "111 bbb 222", and get the result "aaa 111 bbb 222 ccc"Thanks for @RomanPerekhrest and @janos 's lookbehind method.And I wonder how to solve a more general scenario:Question2:target:Ignore the case for substring except of s1 when matching in original string.Question3:target:Ignore the case for substring except of s1 when matching & substituting in original string.Question4:If there is a way to substitute group 1 on original string by regex on python?
To replace sequence  which should be preceded by sequence  use the following approach:The output: - lookbehind positive assertion, ensures that  is preceded by http://www.regular-expressions.info/lookaround.html
You can use the  package, and positive look-behind:This will produce:Notice the changes I did there:The  prefix in the regex is wrapped in . This means, match  if it follows , without including  in the pattern to replace. This is called positive lookbehind. Without this change to your regex, the  would disappear together with Regular expression strings should be written as , to make them raw strings, in order to avoid problems with escape sequencesI renamed the  variable to , because  is a reserved word in Python, as @elena also pointed out.
First of all, don't use  as a variable name. It's a reserved keyword in Python.
