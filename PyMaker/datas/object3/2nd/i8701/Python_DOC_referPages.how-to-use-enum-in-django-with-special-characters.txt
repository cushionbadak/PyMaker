I am using enum34 package like described here.Here is the example used in article:However, in my enum field I would like to have use  (such as ).Is there a way to do this?
Can you be sure that you understand what an enum is? In the example case, freshman is represented by , sophomore by , etc. You cannot use a string, such as  to be the representation in the enum.The names in an enumeration need to be valid Python identifiers. However, there are other means of mapping strings, such as strings with colons, to integers or vice-versa.
I have figured out that I do not need  package and easily do it by hand:
I'm not sure that I have fully understood your question. Would you like to use 16:9 as an attribute in an enum? You can't because : is not a proper character for any attribute. You can't use a variable called 16:9 in your code anywhere. See: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-identifier
