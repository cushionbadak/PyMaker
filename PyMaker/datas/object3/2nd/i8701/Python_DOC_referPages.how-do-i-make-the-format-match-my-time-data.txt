I would like to make some graphs with a dataframe that I read in to python as a  file.  The dates are in the format  but when I try to convert the datetime using the following line:It throws this error:ValueError: time data '1-Jan' does not match format '%d-%MMM' (match)I can't figure out why the data doesn't match the format. Any ideas?
 uses the same string formatting as  (which uses the C's ). You can read about it more hereFormatting directives don't have multiple letters after the .  I think you want 
proper format for 3 letters month in pandas is , thereforeif you don't have the year, it will be added automatically as 1900
