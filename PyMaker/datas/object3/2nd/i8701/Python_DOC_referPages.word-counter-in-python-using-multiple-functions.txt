Natural Text
I'm currently working on a program that I have been assigned that is just getting the word and line count of a sonnet. The first bit of code here works and is the proper output my professor is looking for, even though it includes the first 2 lines of the sonnet.However, the next part of the assignment is to get the same results using a second function, "countNum" with the parameter of "line". So countNum(line).Here is the code I have been messing around with to see if I can get it to work.If you were wondering, this is the sonnet.txt file:
Your  is printing the result instead of returning it:Also, your close methods need to have  after them. They aren't actually executing:to

You can use  to get the length of a list. The list of rows is given by  and the list of words in a line is given by . And we can use the builtin  to sum across a list and be super pythonichttps://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sumYou should use Python's automatic closing by using the  keyword. https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.htmlso we'd have:See https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions for list comprehensions
