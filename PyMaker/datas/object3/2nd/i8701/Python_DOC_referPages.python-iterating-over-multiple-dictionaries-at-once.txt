I know from this answer that it is possible to iterate over two different dictionaries at once:but how can this be efficiently extended to a list with, say, 20 different dictionaries which happen to have the same keys?
The direct translation would be something like:but what do you put in the ellipsis? You'd have to either name all those things, or have one big tuple-of-tuples that is difficult to operate on. I guess alternately you could do:but that's longer and harder to handle than just storing the list of keys once and addressing each dictionary separately.
