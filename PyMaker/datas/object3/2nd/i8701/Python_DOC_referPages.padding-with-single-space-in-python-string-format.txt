I'm afraid this is a basic Python issue, but I couldn't find a proper answer to this.I want to add a single padding space in front of a placeholder.This is my example:Now everything is fine until my  var is empty or false, in that case this is the result of aboveInstead I want  as a result.Now I've tried with  padding options like  but ofc is not working since it will add enough padding to reach a character length of 1.I ended up doing something like this:The above works fine, but I think it's kinda hackish and I'd like to now if there is a inbuilt way of doing this that I'm missing.Thank you!
Here's the solution I posted in the comments:The solution you posted in the question doesn't quite work, but it can be fixed by changing your padding length calculation toThe  function determines whether it's argument is True-ish or False-ish and returns  or , respectively. But  and  can be used in arithmetic operations where they evaluate to 1 and 0, respectively.Here's some code that demonstrates various solutions, including a couple that use literal string interpolation aka f-strings, which are available in Python 3.6+.outputFor info about f-strings please see Formatted string literals in the official Python docs. Also see PEP 498 -- Literal String Interpolation and PEP 536 -- Final Grammar for Literal String Interpolation.
