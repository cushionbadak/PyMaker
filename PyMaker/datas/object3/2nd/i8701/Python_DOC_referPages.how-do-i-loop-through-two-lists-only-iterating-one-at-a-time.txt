Im trying to implement merge sort in python and I'd like to know what is the pythonic way of looping through two lists iterating only one of the lists each loop.This is what I have now (using indexes)Thanks.
I'm not sure not sure your problem here is using indices, but there's a lot of unneeded code.Firstly, we can change your initialisers to:Next, if we change your  condition we can remove the s:Your  isn't meaningful as it will always be true, we can thus make your :And now because we're automatically breaking out of the loop we don't need the s and can move the s outside:This gives you smaller, more readable code without actually changing the way you're doing anything, that way you'll still understand it.Note that we can perform:outside the loop because one array will have contents, for example , while the other will be empty():
