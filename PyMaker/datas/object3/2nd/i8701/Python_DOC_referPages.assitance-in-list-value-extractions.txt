what I need right now is to extract a specific fileexample:Output being [2]what I need is exactly 2, and not [2]To python in general, anything will help thanks

When you are slicing an array OR list, it means you giving a range of index like  so, it must return a list. Better you can use single index of array OR list. Then it will return single instance.
Well the easiest way to do this is to just print the value of what you want. I.E:This will print out 2. I am confused on why you are looking in a range of the list which will output another list hence why you are getting [2]. I recommend going back and reading up on lists and what you can do to them in the python tutorials. Youtube might be a great help if your more visual as well. Best of luckP.S. Remember that lists are 0 based and start at 0. Thus to get 2 in this list, you need to print out the 1 spot which is really the second spot in the list. 0 = 1, 1 = 2, 2 = 3, etc if you look at the list I created.
