Hi Im a newbie about python,I have 2000 list of company that I want to share in my website.I was able to import my csv file, using python script.This is my code:Will you help me on how can I print this to a file?Thanks!
Printing each row in separate files generated with an increment number
I like repzero's answer, but rows need to be converted to str()  open test.csv in readonly mode as a variable csvfile  set the variable csvdata to all the data read from csvfile,splitting everytime it finds a comma  open test.txt in write mode as a variable text_file  iterate through every row of the csv data  convert the row of data into a string of text,and write it to the file, followed by a newline  
Create a file object using , write to it, then close it.
Differ from the other answers, you can actually "print" directly to a file using the same keyword . By rerouting the file method:
