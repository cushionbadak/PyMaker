When I try to port it it errors out asking for key2Python 2:Python 3:Getting the error:It looks like lambda function needs second argumentAny idea how to make it work?Also tried functools.cmp_to_key:Getting error:Probably because I'm sorting integers not stringsHow do I make it work for int?
 and  are fundamentally different. However there is a conversion function you can use: .
From the docs Python3 list.sort():sort() accepts two arguments that can only be passed by keyword  (keyword-only arguments)key specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract a  comparison key from each list element (for example, key=str.lower).That is, the key callable only takes a single argument in py3. So in this case doing, or equivalently will sort a list of int in ascending order.In general  should return the comparison property of the each elementof the .Additionally, you can convert the python2 cmp function:The functools.cmp_to_key() utility is available to convert a 2.x style  cmp function to a key function.https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list.sort
