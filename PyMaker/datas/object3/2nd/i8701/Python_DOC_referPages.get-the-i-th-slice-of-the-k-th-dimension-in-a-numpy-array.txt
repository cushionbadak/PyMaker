I have an -dimensional numpy array, and I'd like to get the -th slice of the -th dimension. There must be something better than
Construct the indexing tuple manually.As documented in the Python language reference, an expression of the formis converted toWe can achieve the same effect by building that tuple directly instead of using slicing notation. (There's the minor caveat that building the tuple directly produces  instead of  for , but NumPy handles these the same for scalar .)
I am not sure if it will work for k dim but it does for 2 dim
here is a late entry that can handle negative axis arguments without having to know the shape of its operand beforehand:To be used as in can be a scalar as in your case or something more interesting as well.Copied from this comment of mine.
Basically, you want to be able to programmatically create the tuple  in order to pass it in as the index of . Unfortunately, you cannot simply use ordinary tuple multiplication on the colon operator directly (i.e.,  won't work to generate a tuple of  colon operators). You can, however, get an instance of a "colon slice" by using . You could then do , which would effectively index  at the th column of the th dimension.Wrapping this up in a function, you'd get:
I'm not sure if this approach would create an entire copy of the array*, but I would take a slice of the transposed matrix in order to get the kth axis:This also has the added bonus of easier checking of the number of dimensions before trying the slice.* according to the docs, a memory view is created whenever possible.
