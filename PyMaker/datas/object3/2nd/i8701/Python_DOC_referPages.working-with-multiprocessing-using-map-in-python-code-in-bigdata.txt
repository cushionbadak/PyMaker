I'm trying to get some values(which I get using extract function) from urls which are stored in data.file and there are about 3000000 url links in the file. here is my code snippet,But the problem is, due to internet connection, this is code runs again if there connection problem. How do I add fault tolerance to my code(i:e store intermediate result, to avoid repetition of doing same task).
A very simple solution is using a file to store your current status.  Use try...finally to handle fails:See also: 'concurrent.futures` (much cooler than multiprocessing.Pool).A better solution would be using a database to completely track your progress, and/or use a better task queue (for example, celery) to execute your jobs.
