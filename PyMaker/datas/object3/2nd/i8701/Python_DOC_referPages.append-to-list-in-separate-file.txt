I have a file with most of my code in it. I have to use a very long list of items for my code and so I am trying to keep it in a separate file (to keep it cleaner and not get in my way). 1) I need to be able to read the list that is in the separate file (python or txt?)2) I need to be able to append terms to that list that is in the separate file and have it save so it will see those additions in the list next time I run my codeIs there any way to do this? Thanks!
