I am trying to debug a python script that depends on a package which has been compiled. It has a __init__.pyd files which when loaded into the debugger I get:The file is a binary .pyd file so the error makes sense. How can I tell PyCharm and Pydev to not try and step through the file? I am using python 2.7 with PyCharm 2016.3.2. Any tips?Thanks,Nathan
Your init file shouldn't be a .pyd file.What is __init__.py for?That's used to initialize modules, it's not a windows .dllhttps://docs.python.org/3/faq/windows.html#is-a-pyd-file-the-same-as-a-dll
