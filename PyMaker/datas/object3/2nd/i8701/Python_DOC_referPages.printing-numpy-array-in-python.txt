Here's a simple code in python. and output:â€‹It is easy to notice that 0.7 is missing and after 0.8 goes 0 instead of 0.9 etc... Why are these outputs differ?
It's because of floating point errors. Run this:and you will see that alpha is, successively:Basically floating point numbers like 0.1 are stored inexactly on your computer. If you add 0.1 together say 8 times, you won't necessarily get 0.8 -- the small errors can accumulate and give you a different number, in this case 0.7999999999999999. Numpy arrays must take integers as indexes however, so it uses the  function to force this to round down to the nearest integer -- 7 -- which causes that row to be overwritten.To solve this, you must rewrite your code so that you only ever use integers to index into an array. One slightly crude way would be to round the float to the nearest integer using the  function. But really you should rewrite your code so that it iterates over integers and coverts them into floats, rather than iterating over floats and converting them into integers.You can read more about floating point numbers here:https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html
As @Denziloe pointed, this is due to floating point  errors.If you look at the definition of : To solve your problem use  instead of
