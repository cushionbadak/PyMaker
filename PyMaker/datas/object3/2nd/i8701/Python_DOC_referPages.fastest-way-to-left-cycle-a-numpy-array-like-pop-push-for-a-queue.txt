With numpy arrays, I want to perform this operation:move  to  (left shift),write a new value in the last index: .This is similar to a ,  for a first-in last-out queue (only inverted).A naive implementation is: .Another implementation, using , is slower: .Is there a fastest way to do it?
After some experiments, it is clear that:copying is required,and the fastest and simplest way to do that, for  (numpy arrays) is a slicing and copying.So the solution is: .Here is a small benchmark:But if you don't need to have a fast access to all values in the array, but only the first or last ones, using a  is smarter.
