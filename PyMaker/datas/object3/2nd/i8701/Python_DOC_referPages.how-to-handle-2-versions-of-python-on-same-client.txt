I use ArcGIS 10.3 at work and it comes with Python 2.7.8; so when I run any of the .py/.pyc/.pyw files, it defaults to the path leading that versions .exe file.Because of some non-ArcGIS related work, we are also being provisioned Python 3.4.2, which also installed its own path.The question begs, how do I tell each .py/.pyc/.pyw file which Python (and associated IDLE [we don't get any IDE at work]) to execute the script with?
Pyenv is an excellent choice. Particularly, set pyenv local and along with virtualenv, you get whatever you need on a per-project basis.https://amaral.northwestern.edu/resources/guides/pyenv-tutorial
