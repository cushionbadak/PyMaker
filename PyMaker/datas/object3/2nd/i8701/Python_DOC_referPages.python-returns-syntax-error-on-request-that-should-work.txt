I'm making a small program in order to create an effective calculator. The program so far is fine but I ran into this problem while trying to get my variables to be set within a functionFor some reason only the third line (operation1) has an error. Unsure if python is being dumb or what I'm doing wrong
I believe the function syntax in python is:You are wrapping all lines within the parameter space for a function..
Python has a very strict function syntax, unlike other programming languages that don't require white space.  Additionally, the syntax you're using isn't correct because you're using "()" to define the outer limits of the function.  The correct version of your function would be:Note the ':' and then the indentation.  If you remove the indentation, it will not run.  And if you don't use the ':' it will not work.
