Given a very large list A, C, A, D, A, B, C, D, A, CHow can I get the counts of the current element and the next efficiently? Something like:AC,CA,AD,DA,AB,BC,CD,DA,ACOr if I were to print it, it would produce:
If your input is large and of unknown length (streaming in possibly), then using iterators is ideal. The output table doesn't include entries for zero counts, because I'm not assuming that you know the set of all possible input items.
You can use a dictionary of Counters:Output:It is reasonably efficient in Python 3, especially after incorporating @Rawing's excellent idea of using . I tested it on:and it takes about a half a second on my machine, less than the time spent in constructing the list in the first place.
You could use collections.Counter to count the occurrences of the elements and then convert that to a 2D dictionary:This will print
