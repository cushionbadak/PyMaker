I need to crypt/decrypt using a  and I got some problem with it. My function  must not receive an argument, only my lambda should.This my current code so far, not using any  as I couldn't find one (after several days of looking around). How to put so lines of code into it.Anyone have tips or something to help me out to find the solution to my problem?It should look sort of like that, except this 1 change only a number:
Here's a simple one which (ab)uses the  module (and a lambda).  Note that you need the codecs module here instead of just a normal call to  as you're doing a text -> text encoding.Here's some sample usage:
If you want to do it with a lambda, then you need to capture the  variable with the lambda and also use . You want something like this:I use  and  so we don't need to keep around a string with all letters. The idea here is that we are getting an integer that represents the codepoint for any given character, so we can do some math instead of using .
