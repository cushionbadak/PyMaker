I define class  I know, that  is called automatically after I declare . But what about ? Does it work without being explicitly called by  ?Is every method that starts with  called automatically or program decides when to call them?I went through many documentation to find the answer but unsuccesssfuly. Thank you for answers!
From Python docs:Called by built-in function hash() and for operations on members of hashed collections including set, frozenset, and dict. __hash__() should return an integer. The only required property is that objects which compare equal have the same hash value;Reference: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__Also, please, don't return random numbers from __hash__().
No,  is not automatically called. Have a look at the documentation for this method:Called by built-in function hash() and for operations on members of  hashed collections including set, frozenset, and dict.So this method will be called in case someone does .Btw. returning a random number is a bad idea:The only required property is that objects which compare equal have  the same hash value
