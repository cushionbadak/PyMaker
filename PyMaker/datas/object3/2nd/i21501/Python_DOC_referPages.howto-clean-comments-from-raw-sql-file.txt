I have problem with cleaning comments and empty lines from already existing sql file.The file has over 10k lines so cleaning it manually is not an option.I have a little python script, but I have no idea how to handle comments inside multi line inserts. Code:  How it should work: This should be cleaned:This should stay as it is:
Try the sqlparse module.Updated example: leaving comments inside insert values, and comments within CREATE FUNCTION blocks. You can tweak further to tune the behavior:Output:
This is an extend of samplebias answer that work with your example :Output:
Adding an updated answer :)Output:SELECT * from test;INSERT INTO test VALUES ('   -- testa');It achieves the same result but also covers all other corner cases and more concise 
It is possible to do it with regular expressions. First you have to split the file by strings and after this you can split the file by comments. The following Perl program does it:
Regex string explained:^ start of line\s whitespace\s* zero or more whitespace characters-- two hypens (static string pattern).* zero or more of any characters (i.e. the rest of the line)\n newline character? end of stringflags = re.M is the multiline modifier"When specified, the pattern character '^' matches at the beginning of the string and at the beginning of each line (immediately following each newline)"See the Python regular expressions documentation for more details:https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html
