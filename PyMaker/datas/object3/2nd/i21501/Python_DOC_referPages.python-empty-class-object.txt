I'm teaching a python class on Object Oriented Programming and as I'm brushing up on how to explain Classes, I saw an empty class definition:the example then goes on to define a name and other attributes for an object of this class:interesting!I'm wondering if there's a way to dynamically define a function for an instance of a class like this? something like:this doesn't work in my python interpreter but is there another way of doing it?
A class is more or less a fancy wrapper for a  of attributes to objects. When you instantiate a class you can assign to its attributes, and those will be stored in ; likewise, you can look in  for any attributes you have already written.This means you can do some neat dynamic things like:as well as assigning to a particular instance. (EDIT: added  parameter)
Try with :The you'll be able to do:EDIT: Thanks Thomas K for the note - this works on  and not for Python2, where  appeared to be . But this will work for s, without statements (right? Sorry, I know only  (: )
You could use AttrDictInstall attrdict from PyPI: It's useful in other situations too - like when you need attribute access to dict keys.
You could also use "named tuples" from the  standard module. Named tuples work like "ordinary" tuples but the elements have names and you can access the elements using the "dot syntax". From the collection docs:
