Is it possible to save my in-memory sqlite database to hard disk?If it is possible, some python code would be awesome.Thanks in advance.EDIT:I succeeded this task by using apsw . It works like a charm. Thanks for your contribution.
(Disclosure:  I am the APSW author)The only safe way to make a binary copy of a database is to use the backup API that is part of SQLite and is exposed by APSW.  This does the right thing with ordering, locking and concurrency.To make a SQL (text) copy of the a database then use the APSW shell which includes a .dump implementation that is very complete.  You can use cursor.execute() to turn the SQL back into a database.On recent platforms you are unlikely to see much of a difference between a memory database and a disk one (assuming you turned journaling off for the disk) as the operating system maintains a file system cache.  Older operating systems like Windows XP did have a default configuration of only using 10MB of memory for file cache no matter how much RAM you have.
Yes. When you create the connection to the database, replace  with the path where you want to save the DB.sqlite uses caches for file based DBs, so this shouldn't be (much) slower.
Per the sqlite3 python documentation, you can use the  method to make a .sql file dump of your in-memory database, and then it's trivial to apply that .sql file to a new sqlite file database.
Open a disk based database and just copy everything from one to the other.
