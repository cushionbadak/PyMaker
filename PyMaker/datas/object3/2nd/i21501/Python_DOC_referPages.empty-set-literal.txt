 = empty  = empty  = empty Is there a similar notation for an empty ?Or do I have to write ?
No, there's no literal syntax for the empty set. You have to write .
Just to extend the accepted answer:From version  and  python has got  literal  in form of usage , but  itself still used for empty dict.Python 2.7 (first line is invalid in Python <2.7)Python 3.xMore here: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.7.html#other-language-changes
By all means, please use  to create an empty set. But, if you want to impress people, tell them that you can create an empty set using literals and  with Python >= 3.5 (see PEP 448) by doing:this is basically a more condensed way of doing , but, don't do this.
It depends on if you want the literal for a comparison, or for assignment.If you want to make an existing set empty, you can use the  metod, especially if you want to avoid creating a new object.  If you want to do a comparison, use  or check if the length is 0.example:
Adding to the crazy ideas: with Python 3 accepting unicode identifiers, you could declare a variable  (Ï• is U+03D5) and use it instead.
if you want to initialize empty set then apply below code. this one is works perfectly for me in python 3:
use it like thisor
