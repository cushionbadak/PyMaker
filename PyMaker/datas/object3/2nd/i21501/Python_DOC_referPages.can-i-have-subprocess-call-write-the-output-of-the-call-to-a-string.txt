I want to do subprocess.call, and get the output of the call into a string. Can I do this directly, or do I need to pipe it to a file, and then read from it? In other words, can I somehow redirect stdout and stderr into a string? 
No, you can't read the output of subprocess.call() directly into a string. In order to read the output of a command into a string, you need to use subprocess.Popen(), e.g.:cmd_out will have the string with the output of the command.
The  module provides a method  that runs the provided command with arguments (if any), and returns its output as a byte string.The code above will print See docs: https://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.check_output
This is an extension of mantazer's answer to python3. You can still use the  command in python3:however now it gives us a byte string. To get a real python string we need to use decode:Using  as the encoding rather than just the default  should make this work on any OS (at least in theory).The trailing newline (and any other extra whitespace) can be easily removed using , so the final command is:
 takes the same arguments as , which includes the  and  arguments. See the docs for details.
