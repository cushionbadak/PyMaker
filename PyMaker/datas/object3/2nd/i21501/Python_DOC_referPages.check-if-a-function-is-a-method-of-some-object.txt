How to check if a function is a method of some object?For example:There are some special attributes in methods in my 'helloworld' example (e.g. 'im_self', '__self__' etc).  Can I rely on them or there is some nicer way?
Use .The documentation states:Return true if the object is a bound method written in Python.This means that it will work as you intend for classes that you define in Python. However, for methods of built-in classes like  or classes implemented in extension modules it will return .
It is also possible to check against the types defined in the built in types library:
A twist to the question involves asking to check if some function name would be available as a method. Since duck typing is considered pythonic there should be a simplebut it seems, there isn't.Duck typing seems to be best done by just trying:If someone wants a function to check programmatically if an object has a method with a certain variable name, then the following function has been mentioned:But for Python 3 and 3.1 at least you need to get callable() back which was removed. A discussion of the want of bringing it back can be found in a python bug entryResurrect callable with e.g.:This is straight from the above mentioned python bugtracker. Other sources on stackoverflow mentionwhich adds the hasattr to the call.Both work fine in my use caseFor more details look at the already cited other question
