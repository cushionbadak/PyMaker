I know that a list can be joined to make one long string as in:Obviously this would output:However, what I am trying to do is simply join the first and second strings in the list, then join the third and fourth and so on. In short, from the above example instead achieve an output of:Is there any simple way to do this? I should probably also mention that the lengths of the strings in the list will be unpredictable, as will the number of strings within the list, though the number of strings will always be even. So the original list could just as well be: 
You can use slice notation with steps:Same logic applies for lists too. String lenght doesn't matter, because you're simply adding two strings together.
Use an iterator.  List comprehension:Very efficient for memory usage.Exactly one traversal of sGenerator expression:use as an iteratorUsing map, str.__add__, iternext(iterator[, default]) is available starting in Python 2.6
just to be pythonic :-)in case the you want to be alarmed if the list length is odd you can try:Best of Luck
Without building temporary lists:or:

Well I would do it this way as I am no good with Regs..CODEoutput: Hope this helps :)
