By default  prints with the following format:where 638 is the millisecond. I need to change the comma to a dot:To format the time I can use:however the documentation doesn't specify how to format milliseconds. I've found this SO question which talks about microseconds, but a) I would prefer milliseconds and b) the following doesn't work on Python 2.6 (which I'm working on) due to the :
Please note Craig McDaniel's solution is clearly better.logging.Formatter's  method looks like this:Notice the comma in . This can not be fixed by specifying a  because  is a  and these objects do not record milliseconds. If we change the definition of  to make it a  object instead of a , then (at least with modern versions of Python) we can call  and then we can use  to format microseconds:Or, to get milliseconds, change the comma to a decimal point, and omit the  argument:
This should work too: 
The simplest way I found was to override default_msec_format:
Adding msecs was the better option, Thanks.Here is my amendment using this with Python 3.5.3 in Blender
After instantiating a  I usually set . So in order for @unutbu's answer to work in this case you'll need:
A simple expansion that doesn't require the  module and isn't handicapped like some other solutions is to use simple string replacement like so:This way a date format can be written however you want, even allowing for region differences, by using  for milliseconds. For example:
If you are using arrow or if you don't mind using arrow. You can substitute python's time formatting for arrow's one.Now you can use all of arrow's time formatting in  attribute.
