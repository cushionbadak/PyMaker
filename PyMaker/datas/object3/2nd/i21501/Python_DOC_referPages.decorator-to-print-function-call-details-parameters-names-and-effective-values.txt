I want to make a function that being a decorator to another function will print that function call details - parameters names and effective values. My current implementation is this. Kinda works, but with some bugs:For call it prints . The expected result is I got stuck here. Can you help me to find the right solution?
Sorry its a bit messy. I modified some code from http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonDecoratorLibrary#Easy_Dump_of_Function_Argumentstest(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, d = 6, g = 12.9)output:test ( a=1, b=2, c=3, args=[4, 5], kwargs={'d': 6, 'g': 12.9})
Here is the updated version for Python 3.6+Old versionWorking version with default values:Result:
Here's how I solved it in Python 3, based on aliteralmind's answer, put more cleanly (PEP8) if I may say so.Majority of the inspiration for the cleanup came from the (currently) accepted answer by Robert King.Code:Output:Note: The  string in the output represents the function name of whatever makes the  message call.Example in use:When I get the magical resources known as "time and energy", I'm interested in playing around with , and figure out how I can replace the  substring with say filename and linenumber of function invocation =)
@warvariuc's answer, upgraded to Python 3:
Its a bit old post but wanted to add my bit.Solution given by warvariuc does not work in all cases. If a method have default values as well as we send named arguments while calling, it does not give proper output. e.g. we get two values of b.Adding my modified code.Output
