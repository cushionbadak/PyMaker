Natural Text
Trying to understand this error in my "Variable" class. I was hoping to store a sre.SRE_Pattern  in my "Variable" class. I just started copying the Variable class and noticed that it was causing all my Variable class instances to change. I now understand that I need to deepcopy this class, but now I run into "TypeError: cannot deepcopy this pattern object". Sure, I can store the pattern as a text string but the rest of my code already expects a compiled pattern! What would be the best way to copy my Variable class with a pattern object? 
  doesn't know anything about your classes and doesn't know how to copy them.You can tell  how to copy your objects by implementing a  method:
This seems to be fixed in Python version 3.7+:Compiled regular expression and match objects can now be copied using copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy(). (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in bpo-10076.)as per: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.7.html#reTesting:
The problem seems to be the compiled regex.  cannot handle them. A minimal example gives me the same error:This throws the error: . I'm in python3.5.
