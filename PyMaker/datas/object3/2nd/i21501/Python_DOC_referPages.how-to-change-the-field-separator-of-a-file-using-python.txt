Natural Text
I'm new to Python from the R world, and I'm working on big text files, structured in data columns (this is LiDaR data, so generally 60 million + records).Is it possible to change the field separator (eg from tab-delimited to comma-delimited) of such a big file without having to read the file and do a  loop on the lines?
No. Read the file inChange separators for each lineWrite each line backThis is easily doable with just a few lines of Python (not tested but the general approach works):I'm not familiar with R, but if it has a library function for this it's probably doing exactly the same thing.Note that this code only reads one line at a time from the file, so the file can be larger than the physical RAM - it's never wholly loaded in.
You can use the linux tr command to replace any character with any other character.
Actually lets say yes, you can do it without loops eg:
You cant, but i strongly advise you to check generators.Point is that you can make faster and well structured program without need to write and store data in memory in order to process it.For instanceThis code spends memory for holding only single line.
