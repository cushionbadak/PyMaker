My models.py:Here if  I want to load  on . Currently irrespective of what shop, it just displays the  (no surprise).How can I implement it? I am stuck, please help.
This is my approach:I use lazy for lazy load:Here, a helper to chose options:Finally the model with dynamic choices:
From the Django docs: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/fields/#choicesFinally, note that choices can be any iterable object -- not necessarily a list or tuple. This lets you construct choices dynamically. But if you find yourself hacking choices to be dynamic, you're probably better off using a proper database table with a ForeignKey. choices is meant for static data that doesn't change much, if ever.
I don't think you should do this on the model, form is a better place. Or you should rethink your models. For example:
You need to use some Ajax functionality. There's no way that I know where you can do it in standard django admin interface without hacking the admin CSS, templates etc.I would recommend you to use some kind of cascading library, to implement this functionality in your own custom views using ModelForms.I have done the same with jquery plugin Cascade in a few cases.There are better implementations, but this also works fine.
