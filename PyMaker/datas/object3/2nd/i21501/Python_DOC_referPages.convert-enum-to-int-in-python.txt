I have an enum Nationality:How can I convert this some enum to int in this or similar way: I know that I can do it if I had code by:but I don't have, and this way looks too big for python. I'm sure that there is something much simpler .
There are better (and more "Pythonic") ways of doing what you want.Either use a tuple (or list if it needs to be modified), where the order will be preserved:Or use a dictionary along the lines of: The latter is preferable, in my opinion, as it's more readable and explicit.A  might also be useful, in your specific case, though it's probably overkill:
Using either the  backport or aenum1 you can create a specialized :and in use:The above is more easily written using 1:which has the added functionality of:1 Disclosure:  I am the author of the Python stdlib , the  backport, and the Advanced Enumeration ()  library.
please use IntEnum
You can't. Python does not store the order of class elements and  will return them in any order.Seeing from your comment that you really do require a mapping from strings to integers, you should in fact do exactly that:
Why don't you just define the values as numbers instead of strings:If you need to access the two-letter names, you can simply provide a table that maps them.  (Or a dictionary that maps the other way, etc.)
I have seen something like:Wrap it in a class and viola, you have a namespace for the enumeration.
