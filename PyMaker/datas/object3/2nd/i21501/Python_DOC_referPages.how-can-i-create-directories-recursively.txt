a fresh answer to a very old question:starting from python 3.2 you can do this:thanks to the  flag this will not even complain if the directory exists (depending on your needs....).starting from python 3.4 (which includes the pathlib module) you can do this:starting from python 3.5  also has an  flag - setting it to  will raise no exception if the directory exists:

Make sure to pass extra flags to recursively affect directories:EDIT I originally used , which was a bad choice since it is deprecated and vulnerable to injection attacks. (For example, if a user gave input to create a directory called , one could potentially delete all directories).EDIT 2 If you are using Python less than 2.7, use  instead of . See the  documentation for details.
