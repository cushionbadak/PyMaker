I want to create a setup.py which would install my files into custom directories. I have a certain prefix, where I would like to get the following result:My initial project is following:What would be the best way to achieve that? I would like to be able to install it later with something like:I can get "package" nicely installed in the correct directory as lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages under --prefix is the default location. But is there a clean way to get script.sh into "bin" and other python files into "libexec"? The only way I see to achieve that would be to manually copy those files in my setup.py script. May-be there is a cleaner and more standard way to do that?(edit)SolutionI ended up with setup.py like that:Of course, you could iterate over all python files for libexec, but I only have 2-3 python files I need there.(edit2)Additionally, I can have setup.cfg with the following:and instead of  I can just do:
The scripts are handled by use of the  parameter to the setup function. For libexec you can treat them as data files and use a data options.I'm not sure how that would work with a  option, I've never tried that.
