I'm using python 3.2.2. When I write a simple program, I meet the problem.How should I do it?
You probably wanted .In Python 2.x, this was a builtin, but in 3.x, it's in the  module.Note that using  outside of the interpreter is generally unnecessary, what were you trying to do here?
An update to @Gareth Latty's answer.  was depreciated in Python 3.4. Now you want .
Try .Reload a previously imported module. The argument must be a module object, so it must have been successfully imported before. This is useful if you have edited the module source file using an external editor and want to try out the new version without leaving the Python interpreter.
