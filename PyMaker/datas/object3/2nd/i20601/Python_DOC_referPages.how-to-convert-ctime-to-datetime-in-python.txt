For me at the moment,  is . I have more data like this.My question is: How to convert  to  in Python? Are there any modules to to it?I tried to make a time  and then convert , but feel like thatâ€™s not the best way to do it in Python. Details: I have a  list (like ). I want to convert the contents to , then store that in a  with .
You should use : this function parses a string representing a time according to a format. The return value is a struct_time.The format parameter defaults to  which matches the formatting returned by ctime().So in your case just try the following line, since the default format is the one from ctime:Returns: 
Try .See: http://docs.python.org/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.strptime
The Short. No.Locale information is not used by ctime().Note: When using  &  you might run into a historical issue when converting local timezones too. as stated in the comments of these answers here and hereThe Long.Alternatively, If you need a "Date & Time" that you can format there are many ways using , time.strftime, also, even using python , and here posix_time, and lastly as mention on the other answers here .Known Date DifferencesIf you are not worried about timezones or the Julian Calendar, Ambiguous Times or converting to localtime using UNIXTIMESTAMP, looking to use EPOCH Time, be sure to specify Notable epoch dates in computing and this for unix Which I thank Matt on this thread for the "Please stop calling it "epoch time" when you mean Unix Time".......My usageNow as crazy as all that was, its not that bad.  I have worked with many companies before, and this usually never comes up in the work place, as it usually has been dealt with.So, aside from all that...This is My Personal Favorite:I use this for my own stuff: time.strftime Which I Return: Year, Month, Day, _, Hour, Minute, SecondWhich I use in a function:Just something simple that keeps my logs in order.
