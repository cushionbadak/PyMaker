What is the best way to parse data out of a URL query string (for instance, data appended to the URL by a form) in python?  My goal is to accept form data and display it on the same page.  I've researched several methods that aren't quite what I'm looking for. I'm creating a simple web server with the goal of learning about sockets.  This web server won't be used for anything but testing purposes.
The urllib.parse module is your friend: https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.htmlCheck out urllib.parse.parse_qs (parsing a query-string, i.e. form data sent to server by GET or form data posted by POST, at least for non-multipart data). There's also cgi.FieldStorage for interpreting multipart-data.For parsing the rest of an HTTP interaction, see RFC2616, which is the HTTP/1.1 protocol specification.
Here is an example using python3 :output:Note for python2: SEE: https://pythonhosted.org/six/#module-six.moves.urllib.parse
If you need unique key from query string, use  with
