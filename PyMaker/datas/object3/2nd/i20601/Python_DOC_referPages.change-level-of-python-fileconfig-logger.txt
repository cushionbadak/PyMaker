I have a logger configured from a file and would like to change the level of my logging without having to change the .conf file, but instead using inline code; This should only print the "Info" log line to the screen. I don't know on which object to call the setLevel()! logging.StreamHandler.setLevel(logging.info) is just a stab in the dark after 30 mins searching...The loggingfile.conf file;

When using logging.config.fileConfig and you want to dynamically change level for all child loggers at once, you can...a) set level for root logger:b) disable other levels
