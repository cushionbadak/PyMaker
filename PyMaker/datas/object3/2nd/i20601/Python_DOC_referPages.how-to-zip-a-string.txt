What is the equivalent of this class in python? https://gist.github.com/2594962In PHP, it allows you to zip a string.I'm trying to find the equivaelnt in the following languages: Python, Ruby on Rails and ASP.I'm hoping there are built in functions for these languages. I couldn't find one in PHP.UpdateWhen I say Zip, I am referring to the standard algorithm that windows uses. Not in the sense of an archive. I currently use that class to zip a string, base64 encode it and send it as a request to an internal API.
Under Python, you are looking for the  module - specifically .I'd note that in general,  is used a lot more for the kind of uses you are talking about.
To compress a string using the same method used in  archives, just use the  module directly (which is what Python's  module does). Here's a simple example:Output:
Python has a  module which allows you to read/write zip archives.The  class has a  method that can create a "file" in the archive directly from a string.So no, you don't have to write your string to a file before archiving it.Update after question editYou say you don't want an archive but the linked PHP code does just that -- creates a PK-Zip archive. In Python you do the same with . Here's an example that creates a zip and adds one file to it -- all in-memory, without physical files. will be the compressed content in PK-Zip format.If you control both sending and receiving side and you don't need to send multiple compressed files in one chunk of data, using PK-Zip is overkill. Instead, you could just use the  module which implements the compression for PK-Zip.And then you can decompress it (assuming Python):
I don't know it exactly what you need but you might find this interesting. I use here the zipfile module with a string-file-like object Watch the PK start inside the string
