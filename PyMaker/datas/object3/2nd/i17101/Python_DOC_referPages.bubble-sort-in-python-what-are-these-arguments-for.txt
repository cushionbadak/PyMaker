This is code for a bubble sort, but what is the use of  in the  condition?
You are looking at arguments to the  function; the numbers set up the range to start at the list length, minus one, then stepping down to 1 (the end point is not included in the range).So there are 3 arguments, the first is , the second is  and the third is .Say the list is length 5, then  will produce a list with 4, 3, 2, and 1:The  loop steps over these values:The  loop assigns these numbers to , and the next nested loop uses that to create a new . The first time, that inner range will go from  to  (exclusive), the next time from  to , etc, until the last time, when it'll run from  to , always excluding the stop index. For a list of length 5, that means the inner loop first assigns 0, 1, 2, 3 to , then 0, 1, 2, then 0, 1, then 0.The code is missing an opportunity to use Python sequence assignment to swap to elements:
The first -1 subtracts 1 from the length of the input list because the indexes start from 0, not 1. The 0 is the start number(only neccesary to get to the next parameter). The 2nd -1 is the step so that tells it to move backwards through the range. Example:range(5, 2, -1) is [5, 4, 3, 2]
