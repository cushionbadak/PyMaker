I did not understand where is the logic in my bug, so I managed to find a minimal example. I defined one class , and said that something happens when you use the <= operator and that a>=b must compute b<=a.It works fineThen I derived a subclass  from .When I compare two values, if they are both from  or both from  it works as expected, but if one is from class  and another from class  it fails. Why ??EDIT : There is no problem in python 2.x (from tobias_k), but I want to use python 3.3 at least
When you do  and  is an instance of a subclass of 's class, Python will first call  (and then try other methods if this call returns )Here is how to implement it without infinite recursion:
