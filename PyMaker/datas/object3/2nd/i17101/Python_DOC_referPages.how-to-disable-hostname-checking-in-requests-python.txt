I'm using Requests to connect to a RESTful API. The server I would like to reach use ssl with self-singed certificate.the problem is I'm getting SSLError of hostname mismatch.there should be a way to disable the hostname checking without disabling certificate validation, as in many java implementations, but I can't find how to do it with requests in python.stacktrace:How can this be done? 
Requests doesn't allow this directly, however you can provide a custom transport adapter which  uses the features of the underlying . The usage of transport adapters is covered in the requests documentation.This code is not tested, but should work.In detail the  param works as follows:If  use the hostname from the URL, if  suppress hostname checking, if a custom string validate against this string.
I'm a little late to the party but  looks like it might help if you install version 0.7.0 or newer (my ubuntu 16.04 only has 0.6.0): https://toolbelt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/adapters.html#hostheaderssladapterFrom the link:
Did you look into the  parameter?You should be able to set it to False, and it should not check the hostname:The only limitation is that this only works in Python 3.4 and later.Reference:https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html#ssl.SSLContext.check_hostname
http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/advanced/#ssl-cert-verification keyword is a flag, not for providing certfile. You provided there non-empy string, which resolves to  in boolean context.Use  keyword to provide path to certificate files, or disable verification with .EDIT: although documentation says you can actually pass CA path to , but there are no examples. It would be helpful to see whole traceback you are receiving.
If this is only for testing only then just add an entry in /etc/hosts to your local system (assuming you have access).
