Natural Text
I am learning python 3.3 in windows 7. I have a two text files - lines.txt and raven.txt in a folder. Both contain the same text for the first example.When I try to access ravens, using the code below, I get the error - I know that the above error can be fixed by using an escape character like this - Why do both methods work ? Strangely, when I access  in the same folder, I get no error ! Why ?Also, when I use the line below, I get a completely different error - . Why ?I can rectify this by using  before every \ in the file path. 
\r is an escape character, but \l is not. So, lines is interpreted as lines while raven is interpreted as , since \r is escaped.You should always escape backslashes with . In cases your string doesn't have quotes, you can also use raw strings:See: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html
maybe you can use raw string.just like this .When an R' prefix is present, backslashes are still used to  quote the following character, but all backslashes are left in the  string. For example, the string literal r"\n" consists of two  characters: a backslash and a lowercase `n'. String quotes can be  escaped with a backslash, but the backslash remains in the string; for  example, r"\"" is a valid string literal consisting of two characters:  a backslash and a double quote; r"\" is not a value string literal  (even a raw string cannot end in an odd number of backslashes).  Specifically, a raw string cannot end in a single backslash (since the  backslash would escape the following quote character). Note also that  a single backslash followed by a newline is interpreted as those two  characters as part of the string, not as a line continuation.
You can actually use forward slashes instead of backward ones, that way you don't have to escape them at all, which would save you a lot of headaches. Like this: 'C:/Python/raven.txt', I can guarantee that it works on Windows.
