Why do I keep getting or my code? How can I fix this?I'm not sure what else to do.
To produce a sorted list of keys, use:instead. This works in both Python 2 and 3.In Python 3  does not return a list object, but a dictionary view object. You could call  on that object, but  is much more direct and saves you two additional calls.I see that you appear to count words in a file; if so, you are instead counting characters, not words;  iterates over a string, so  is assigned individual characters from the line. You should be using  instead:This code uses the file objects as context managers (with the  statement) to have them closed automatically. The  method takes care of the sorting for us, not by key but by word count.
