I'm trying to make a program to convert a number which is in base 6 to decimal(base 10). It doesn't seem to work. Could anyone please help.The result does not work.Now let's say I try to add 2 base 6 numbers. How do I proceed? I tried to convert each number to base 6 and add them, the answer is not correct. I also tried to add them first and then convert to base 6 but it still doesn't work.How would I proceed for multiplication as well?Thanks
You can use  function, with the radix parameter, like thisFor example,
The question "How can I add 2 base 6 numbers or multiply them" does not really make sense.All numbers in a computer is in base 2.In addition the base is just a representation.  So (The number with base 10 representation '75')+(The number with base 10 representation '103')=(The number with base 10 representation '178') does not depend on the base.Base is a feature when you need to display the number, because then there needs to be a conversion from bits to characters.  In most programming languages this is by default to base 10.So to answer your question "How can I add 2 base 6 numbers or multiply them?"I would say; you don't, you do arithmetic on base 2 numbers.If your Input/Output is in base 6 you need to take care when reading/writing the numbers so that the conversion is to the correct base.
