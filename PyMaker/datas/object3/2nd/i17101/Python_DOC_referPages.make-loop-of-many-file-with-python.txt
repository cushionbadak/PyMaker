My question still related to read many files at once. I tried to read data that consist of many variables and then plot it in one figure. Can anybody help me to make this code much simpler by using loop ?if I have more than 2 files, let's say I have 30 files, how do I use loop in this case.Thank you in advance.

I noticed that your data was only used to create a plot and then not referred to again, so I rewrite the values during each loop.  Also note that I used  while iterating over your file names to get a counter variable :
