Please, help me out in generating bingo game. I am using eclipse with "pydev" interpreter. till now i have worked this much. But I am not able to generate the matrix in a way, that 5 random numbers between 1-15 should be in 1st "COLUMN" and not in "ROW", similarly numbers between 16-30 in 2nd COLUMN, 31-45 in 3rd COLUMN, 46-60 in 4th COLUMN and finally 61-75 in 5th COLUMN. So, basically it becomes 5*5 matrix. My code generates the random numbers but not in the matrix form, i want.
First of all, to have a range from 1 to 15, you need to use , the second argument, called stop, is never included in the list. See the range function in the documentation.To answer your question, you can put your first list in the first column instead of the first row by using the  function. See the zip function in the documentation.And finally, you should learn a little more about Python syntax. It could really help you. It's designed to be simple. It's a really beautiful language, easy to read and easy to use. You can almost read every line as if it was English. Here is your loop rewritten:Learn more about for loops here.
