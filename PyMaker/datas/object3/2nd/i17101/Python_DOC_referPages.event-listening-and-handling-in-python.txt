I will start out by saying I have never done events and triggers in anything other than javascript.I have a thread that runs and processes all the files in a folder. I want this thread to run everytime a new file writes to that folder. I thought events would be the way to do that, but I have no idea how to do that in python.How do you tell a thread to throw or trigger an event? How does another thread pick this up?sample thread:Edit: I am new to mutlithreading, so maybe I should use this instead?
Well, the typical way to trigger asynchronous events is to use the  module. As the documentation notes, signals cannot be used for inter-thread communication, so threads would be inappropriate in this case. Of course, you can also use threads using  objects.That being said, asynchronous events, threads, and signals are confusing and hard to implement correctly. Are you sure you want to reinvent the wheel? (You very well might be; I just like to check.) If not,  provides the exact capabilities you require.
First of all, this is not a problem of  it's more about Operative System Signals. You will need some way of monitoring the changes in the target folder. Since you are planning  your code to be multiplatform I recommend you work with Qt specifically .Here are you have an aswer that can help you: How do I watch a file for changes?
Thanks for the great answers.This is the code I ended up using:
