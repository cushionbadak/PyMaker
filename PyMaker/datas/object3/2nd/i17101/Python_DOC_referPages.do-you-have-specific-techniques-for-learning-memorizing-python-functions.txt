I am currently learning python and have been struggling learning new functions. There always seems to be a perfect match for functions I need and I never think of them until I see them utilized elsewhere. Is this normal? Does it happen to veteran programmers as well?for example this snippet in learnpythonthehardway: I would have never thought of doing that without going in circles first.Do you have specific mnemonic techniques for memorizing stuff? Can anyone share their insights?
Write code.  Firstly, you will eventually memorise the common built-ins, like , , etc.  There are probably a few that you will never remember at once, these are those you hardly ever use (, , , etc.) but that will depend on the kind of programs you are writing.  That is normal when learning a programming language.Importantly, learn how to find your way around the documentation.  You might not memorise the exact argument-list for each function, but you should know the kind of features that are available, and how to look it up.The standard library modules are another matter.  You might only use 10% of them, although some people will use considerably more.  Again, only learn what you need, maybe start at aspects of .  Even so, there are obscure corners of  that you might never need.Don't try to remember everything, you don't need to.  Write code.
Just practice I guess.Also, when doing something that seems "common", check the doc: https://docs.python.org/3/. Like if you want to split strings etc...It's a pitty there is nothing like Hoogle (for Haskell) in Python (AFAIK)
