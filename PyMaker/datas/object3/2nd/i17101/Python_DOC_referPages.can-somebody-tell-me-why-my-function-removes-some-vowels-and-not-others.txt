This function removes and replaces a, e but not i, o, u and i am not sure why.
It's been a while since I've done Python, but it appears your function returns after replacing the first vowel.Maybe this is what you want:
Think about that. You have a for loop, and if a condition inside the loop body is evaluated as true, then you do something and return from the function. So all remaining loop iterations wonâ€™t ever run.Instead, you would want to move the  out of the loop, so it can still continue. However, you also would want to keep the changed string you did your replacements on once, and continue on that one:Finally, this all does not really make sense. There is no need to iterate over every character of your original string, if you just want to remove all vowels from the string. Instead, you can just loop over the vowels, and remove them:
There are five things here:Your return-statement is indented too far.  As soon as control enters the if-block for the first time, the for-loop will stop iterating and the function will return prematurely.String objects are immutable in Python.  Hence,  returns a modified copy of the string instead of modifying the original object.  This means that you need to reassign  to the copy in each iteration of the for-loop.Your for-loop should be iterating over the list of vowels, not the input string.  Or, even more efficient, a string of vowels.Because your function is supposed to remove vowels from the string, I think it would be better to replace them with an empty string instead of a space.Your function does not remove uppercase vowels.Below is a version of your function that addresses these issues:
