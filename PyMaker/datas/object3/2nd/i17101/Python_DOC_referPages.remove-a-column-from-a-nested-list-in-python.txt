I need help figuring how to work around removing a 'column' from a nested list to modify it.Say I haveand I want to remove the second column (so values 2,6,1) to get:I'm stuck with how to modify the list with just taking out a column. I've done something sort of like this before? Except we were printing it instead, and of course it wouldn't work in this case because I believe the break conflicts with the rest of the values I want in the list.So, how would you go about modifying this nested list?Is my mind in the right place comparing it to the code I have posted or does this require something different?
You can simply delete the appropriate element from each row using :
If you want to extract that column for later use, while removing it from the original list, use a list comprehension with :Otherwise, just loop over the list and delete the fields you no longer want, as in arshajii's answer
Use :
You can use , which is created for this very purpose.You can use it in List comprehension like thisYou can also use nested List Comprehension, in which we skip the elements if the index is 1, like thisNote: All these suggested in this answer will not affect the original list. They will generate new lists without the unwanted elements.
Here is one way, updated to take in kojiro's advice.You can generalize this to remove any column:
