Natural Text
I am trying to understand isdecimal() and isdigit() better, for this its necessary to understand unicode numeric value properties.  How would I see the numerical value property of, for example, the above two unicodes.
To get the 'numeric value' contained in the character, you could use  function:Use the  function to get the integer codepoint, optionally in combination with  to produce a hexadecimal value:You can get access to the character property with , which you'd then need to check against the documented categories:where  stands for Number, Other.However, there are a series of  characters in the category ; the Python  database only gives you access to the general category and relies on , , and , , etc. methods to handle the additional categories.If you want a precise list of all numeric Unicode characters, the canonical source is the Unicode database; a series of text files that define the whole of the standard. The  file (v. 6.3.0) gives you a 'view' on that database specific the numeric properties; it tells you at the top how the file is derived from other data files in the standard. Ditto for the  file, listing the exact numeric value per codepoint.
the docs explicitly specify the relation between the methods and  property.Example:I'm not sure Decimal Number and Numeric_Type=Decimal will always be identical.Note:  is not decimal because superscripts are explicitly excluded by the standard, see 4.6 Numerical Value (Unicode 6.2).
