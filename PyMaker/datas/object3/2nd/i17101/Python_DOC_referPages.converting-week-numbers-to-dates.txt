Say I have a week number of a given year (e.g. week number 6 of 2014). How can I convert this to the date of the Monday that starts that week?One brute force solution I thought of would be to go through all Mondays of the year:and store a hash from the first to the last Monday of the year, but this wouldn't do it, since, the first week of the year may not contain a Monday.
You could just feed the data into . EDIT:To convert this to a  object:
A simple function to get the Monday, given a date.Some sample output:Call this function within your loop.
All about strptime \ strftime:https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.htmlSorry wrong way aroundStrptime needs to see both the year and the weekday to do this. I'm assuming you've got weekly data so just add 'mon' to the end of the string.Enjoy
