why python does not have Access modifier like in c#, java i.e public, private etc.what are the alternative way of encapsulation and information hiding in python.
From Wikipedia:[Python] has limited support for private variables using name mangling. See the "Classes" section of the tutorial for details. Many  Python users don't feel the need for private variables, though. The  slogan "We're all consenting adults here" is used to describe this  attitude. Some consider information hiding to be unpythonic, in  that it suggests that the class in question contains unaesthetic or  ill-planned internals. However, the strongest argument for name  mangling is prevention of unpredictable breakage of programs:  introducing a new public variable in a superclass can break subclasses  if they don't use "private" variables. From the tutorial:   As is true  for modules, classes in Python do not put an absolute barrier between  definition and user, but rather rely on the politeness of the user not  to "break into the definition."The same sentiment is described in the We are all consenting adults paragraph of The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Python!
The alternative is to name your "private" (they are not really private in python) with identifiers that make it easy to identify that those members should not be used from outside.For example:However, if the class user really wants to change these attributes he will have no problem. It is his responsability not to do that.Look at: http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/classes.html#tut-private
