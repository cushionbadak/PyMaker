I have a list with entries similar to the following:I would like to convert the tuples to strings and print them on individual lines like so in order to pass them as arguments to another program:I tried  and  but those don't appear to be supported for tuples.  I'm assuming I would need some regex expression to accomplish what I'm trying to do, but even then I'm not sure hot to handle the fact that a potential field separator of  is both within and between the tuples.  Any pointers are greatly appreciated.  I'm old and just trying to learn to program.
You can use string formatting as follows:This doesn't change your tuples per se but does format the printing of them as you wished. The code simply iterates over your list and prints the tuples with a given format. The string  method is covered here.
Another way
You can just explicitly convert the tuples to strings (this works exactly as you hoped)- and finally join them together with the delimiter as what is between the tuples in your desired output: You can then easily output it as follows; just by printing it out:
