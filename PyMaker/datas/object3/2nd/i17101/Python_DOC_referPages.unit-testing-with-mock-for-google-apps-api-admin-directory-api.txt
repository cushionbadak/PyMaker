I followed this tutorial here and I can finally retrive all emails from my domain with my application.Now I want to write some unit tests with mock for my application, but I dont know where to start.I have read here about unit testing with mock and that the google api admin directory API comes with his own mock library. But I dont understand how to use it correctly.My application test_email_user.py contains the import from my real application email_user.py but now what?I have to fake the google api directory responses to my real application, but how?greetings,sam
I'm not familiar with the Google Client API own mock library you mention but I do it easily with this mock library:
