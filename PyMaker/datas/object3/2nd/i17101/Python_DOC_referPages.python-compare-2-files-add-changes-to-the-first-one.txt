I'm looking for a smart script to compare 2 files. My idea is the following: Take file 1 as original. File 2 is a newer version, so compare file 1 to file 2 and add all changes to file 1. BUT: It is possible that file 2 contains less entries than file 1. The entries which are not in file 2 should not be removed in file 1. Is this comprehensible? ;)Thanks a lot for any help!
