I'm new to programming. I''ve successfully wrote everybody's first program , however , it executes right before closing itself. How can I add a pause to the program?
Modify the code to be like this, you will learn about the below function soon enough:Now at the end of the program it won't exit until you press Return.Or better still, run the code in a shell like IDLE so you don't have to worry about all that.
You need to put a call to  at the bottom of your script:Doing so will keep the output window open until you press Enter.
If you literally want to add a fixed pause, use the  function in the  module. The is discussed in detail in the answer to How can I make a time delay in Python? . Your program then becomes:The first line tells python that  means the module , while the last line says to wait for 1 second. (If you wanted to wait for 2.5 seconds, then change the last line to , etc...)
