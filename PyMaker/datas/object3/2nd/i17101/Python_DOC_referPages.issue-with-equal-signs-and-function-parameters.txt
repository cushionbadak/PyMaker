I'm trying to build a function that would allow to repeat this (it prevents the console from opening in windows):Therefore I defined the following function:But when I call it like this  , I get an error because of :How can I fix this ?
 is just a wrapper, and as it stands it's expecting just a single argument, . Thus it freaks out when you give it two arguments ( as the first positional argument, and then the keyword argument  intended for the  call). Luckily, there's a standard idiom for producing a wrapper that passes along any set of arguments to an inner function. It uses the  and  notation for argument packing/unpacking.What this does is basically this. The  operator in the function definition takes all the input positional arguments, and packs them into a tuple called . Then when you call , the  operator unpacks that tuple, passing in those same arguments in the same order to the next function. The  operator works essentially the same way, except that it catches keyword arguments like  and packs all of them into a dictionary like . This dictionary is then unpacked and converted back into keyword arguments when you use the  again in your call to the inner function.
The function  only expects one argument, and when you call it:you are passing two arguments:a lista keyword argument How to fix this?You can do this two ways:Define your method to get kwargs. Note that you are not using the parameters Call the function just passing one argument:
