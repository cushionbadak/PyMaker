I have a Python mock object and I would like to assert whether any attribute of that object was set.I do not believe the PropertyMock will work for my purposes, because I must know if any attribute was set, not a particular property.It also does not appear like I can mock the  method of a mock object.How can I test if any arbitrary attribute of a mock object has been set?
While this solution is not ideal, you can store the attributes of the mock object after initialization and compare them to the attributes at the time of test.This solution requires maintaining additional state and does not strictly test whether an attribute is set, only the difference in attributes at two points in time.
