I'm an inexperienced python programmer. Is there a way to use the backgroundworker so that it starts at program startup and closes when program close?I want it to watch a button, the button returns 1 when pressed. So while the program in running whenever button = 1 button has to do "this".Can anyone help me with this?
Would make sense to start a separate thread within your main program and do anything in the background. As an example check the fairly simple code below:
As of Python 3.3, the Thread constructor has a  argument. Konstantin's answer works, but I like the brevity of needing only one line to start a thread:As the documentation mentions, daemon threads exit as soon as the main thread exit, so you still need to keep your main thread busy while the background worker does its thing. In my case, I start a web server after starting the thread.
