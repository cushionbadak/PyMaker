I have two files as input. (they each have more columns, but I narrowed it down to important ones only)First file is a kind of index. I want to look at the second file and compare the pairs by looking up their value in the first file and printing out the key with smaller value (if one of the keys isn't in the index file - then print out the other one by default). After that I'd like to remove all repearting entries, i.e.So, it's essentially an index file reduction. There has to be an elegant way in Python for doing it...
Load the data from the first file into a dict (called ).Collect all the keys associated with minimal values in a set (called ).Report the keys. Note that since  is a , there is nopredefined order in which the keys will be reported.Per the extra requirement in the comments, ignore rows where is not in the first file.
You can use zip as follows:Read both files Use zip to iterate both files linesFind minimum based on split result and show the minimum holding string
This could be one way:
