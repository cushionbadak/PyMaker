I have a few different versions of python on my computer. How do I choose which one is run from my terminal when I type "python" into the prompt?
Use  to see where your python command resides. Then use  to find out where it really is. Then link the one you want instead. Note that the other installed versions are usually all available by their respective names.Note that this changes which Python version all programs for all users on your computer will probably use! If you only want to change it for yourself. You can alias it by adding a  line (with  replaced by the version you want) to  in linux or  in Mac. (You'll need to restart your terminal session in this case.)
You should have multiple executables for every python version you have. For example, if I type  and hit tab, I see:So, if, for example, I want python 2.5 version - I run .Also, take a look at virtual environments - it's much easier to manage and switch between multiple python environments with it.Also see:Comprehensive beginner's virtualenv tutorial?Use different Python version with virtualenv
py -3 or py -2 etc to choose between versions.See https://docs.python.org/3/installing/#work-with-multiple-versions-of-python-installed-in-parallel
To choose which version of python is run when you type 'python' into a terminal, you may want to try using an alias.For example:Would make python2.7 execute when you type 'python' into your terminal.
Try envirius (universal virtual environments manager), which allows to compile any version of python.Moreover, it allows to create environments with mixed languages.
