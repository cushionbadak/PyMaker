I try to discretize some numbers, by looking if they are in a given range, and then assign a number based on the range, however the result which I get is not exactly correct. is the a dictionary of which defines ranges, and the values which correspond to the given range.  is the list of numbers that I want to match against those ranges, and assign identifiers to themThe result which I expect is:  , however that's not what I get.This is the actual result which I get, which is incorrect:I get  at  which is not correct, etc, etc.Where is the problem?Thanks

I think I have faced a similar problem once, because I found a small  class:I hope this class wraps your desired funcionality. Obviously lookup is O(N) and not O(1).Sample usage:
Putting an  after your  loop you were an the right track! When you put an  after a loop, that  block is executed each time the loop exits normally, i.e. without using e.g. . Thus, (assuming that your groups are non-overlapping) you just need to add a  statement to the end of your  block, i.e. after . Then it works as expected.Also, instead of checking whether the number is in the  (which creates and searches a list each time!) you should just use  and . Also, you already have the , so why not use it?
