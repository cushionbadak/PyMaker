Successfully made a word translator function, and from looking around with what other people have done in my class I know I need to split the sentence argument in the sentence function. But I don't know what to do with it! I've used http://www.mit.edu/~johnp/6.189/solutions/piglatin.py as a reference (it's python 2, however) to help me get to this point, and I understand it, but I get completely lost after list_of_words. Yes, I've looked at the other pig latin questions but I don't think I can comprehend enough to even see what direction I should be going in from here.Sorry it's a big ask, I don't want you to answer the question, I just want to be pointed in the direction of what to doSorry if this is just an obnoxious repost, but I have looked at a couple of answers and I don't know what to do from here on. Also, I'd like to add one of my tutors said I didn't need to seperate the consonants, although on the other examples that's all I see. May that have something to do with it? I don't know! Thanks anyway.Edit: I think I may have found an answer that shows what I need to change from here, but I don't understand. Also being refereed to look up something in my textbook is fine. I just want to read and understand, I'm aware it may be a bit much to ask.Edit: oh my god, just realized it was a typo. fist_letter, not first_letter.And thank you! I'll reread your answer.
What you are doing when you say:You are setting the type of  as a string so it is easy to understand. Then in the  loop, you concatenate the value of the pig latin word to the new sentence, and add a space. I should mention it is good practice to use:As it is the same code, it just shortens everything. The same goes for , , and .
The code that you've linked could be rewritten using  and builtin  functions:To take into account a punctuation inside a sentence, you could use  module.
