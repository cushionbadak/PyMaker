I am stack in something really simple, but I cannot find the right way. I have a dictionary like this one:I am trying to iterate through  and create a new subdictionary with the results of a function.The find dictionary would be like this:But when I run the code, I have a key error on . Any idea?
You have to create first  before assigning to .
As already said, you have to create the  entry before you can add items to it, i.e. you'd have to add  to your outer loop. You could use a  to make Python automatically insert missing entries, but since you have both  and  entries, this does not seem like a good idea.That said, using a dictionary comprehension makes it a bit shorter and IMHO much more readable:
