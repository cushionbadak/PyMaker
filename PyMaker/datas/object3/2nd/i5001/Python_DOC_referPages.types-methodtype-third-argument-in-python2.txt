I have inherited code that looks something like this:For that last line, I want to make the code 2to3 compatible, but MethodType only takes two arguments in python3.Simplest option is probably to let it break intelligently andBut then I realized that I don't understand why I'm adding the third argument in python2, because  works across languages.In Python2, what is the third argument buying me, to bind it to the class vs not?
In Python 2, the third argument to the method type constructor was mostly used for unbound method objects:A direct constructor call to create one of these would have looked like , where  is the function. Unbound method objects did a bit of type checking to ensure they weren't used for objects of the wrong type, but they were deemed not useful enough to justify their existence, so they got taken out in Python 3. With no more unbound method objects, there wasn't much reason for the method constructor to take a third argument, so that was removed too.
A python2 / python3 compatible way to accomplish what you want is to use the descriptor protocol (): will return a  instance
