This is kind of hard to explain, so I thank you for your patience. This is what I get for wandering into a debug logging API. I want to get values from all over a 444 line long program. The problem is, they are all over so I can't just go:I need to get a dictionary, two integers, and a string into a function called strlogger(). One of the integers I need to get from a other function called ifelogger(). How would I do this? Example:  The function is called like so: . If there is any easy (or hard, I dont care, as long as it works) solutions to this problem I am having, it would be much appreciated. If you have any question, just comment. Thanks! 
Make the interesting variables have file-level scope, instead of hidden inside function-level scopes ...Note that if you change a value of a global variable within a function (not just read it), you must declare it as  otherwise Python will create a variable local to the function.In , when  is set, it is the  variable at file-level scope.  This is the same  that  will see when it prints the values out.
