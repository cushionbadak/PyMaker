I have a numpy array of dimension  in which I would like to add up the first dimension to receive a array of shape . Normally, I'd use NumPy's own but in my case it doesn't cut it: Some of the sums are very ill-conditioned, so the computed results only have a few correct digits. is fantastic at keeping the errors at bay, but it only applies to iterables of one dimension.  doesn't do the job either.How to efficiently apply  to an array of multiply dimensions?
This one works fast enough for me.Hopefully it's the axis you are looking for (returns 77 sums).
Check out the  keyword to . Unfortunately, it's slower than the  solution:Code to reproduce the plot:
