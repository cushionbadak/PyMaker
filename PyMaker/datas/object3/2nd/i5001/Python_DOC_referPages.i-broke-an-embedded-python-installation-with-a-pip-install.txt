I use software at work that has python scripting built in. The only downside is it doesn't carry many of the useful modules out there today. Looking at the forum and support for the software the knowledge base had instructions on how to add new modules. All was well for a few things but when trying to install Pandas I kept getting a failed dependency for Numpy, even though Numpy was in fact in the site-packages for that python version. I made several other attempts and then came across this line of code.I replaced the  with the path to that version of Python and the install went through. But now that Python version is broken. When I open the script editor in the software and try to run ANY code I get an error that says Even when I try to run that version of Python in the console the cursor just moves down a line and nothing happens. I can't even type any more.The older version of the software still works fine, I believe this is due to it using Python 3.4 while this newer version is running Python 3.5. I have even tried to uninstall and reinstall the software for a clean install and I still get the same error, even if I reinstall in a new location. I fear its something system wide specific to that software version of Python 3.5. I have an external Python 3.5 I installed just to check and it runs fine. It's just the software version of Python that is now broken. 
You have installed Python projects with compiled components that are loaded into the Python binary. Those components are conflicting with the embedded Python version of your software package (which may not be able to load them).Because you used the  switch to install these packages there is still a way out to recover your installation. The packages were all installed into the  location, which means you can remove them again, manually.First, you need to run Python with a switch that disables loading code from that location. You can try to do this with either the  switch (which disables the  option) or the  switch (enabling isolated mode, ignoring environment variables and the  option), to verify that disabling these options actually gives you a working Python prompt:When this works, you can run the  module as a script, to print out where the  directory is:Look for the  line, it should end in . Then, move the contents of that directory somewhere else (to keep as a backup). Then try to run Python without the  /  switch again.
