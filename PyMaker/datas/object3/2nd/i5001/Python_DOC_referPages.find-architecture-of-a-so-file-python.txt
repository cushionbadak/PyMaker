I would like to find inside python for what architecture a file (in my case .so) has been build.I known that I can see this in the terminal with the 'file' command.Example: gives as output:I need this in my python script so I don't load the .so file if I running my program on a ARM aarch64 architecture.I seem to be unable to find anything on this matter...Is this not possible?
You can make a call to the terminal using the  module.
You could use pyelftools for identifying the architecture for a shared object file.Interfacing with shared libraries can be done via ctypes.cdll in standard library.
