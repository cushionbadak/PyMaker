I'm trying to filter a list based on an attribute. If I use the attribute as a string everything works fine:If I tried to use a variable (in my case a property of an enum) instead I get back an empty listThe variable  contains the string "first".
You are correctly passing in a variable, but if you now get an empty list, then  does not produce the string .If  is a  subclass, then the attributes will be instances of that class. Use the  attribute to get an actual string value:Quick demo to show how enums work like and why you need the attribute:
