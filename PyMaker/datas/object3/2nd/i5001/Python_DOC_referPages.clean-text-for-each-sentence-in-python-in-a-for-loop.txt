Natural Text
I am trying to do some text cleaning in Python for sentiment analysis. But instead of lumping all the text together and separating them, I want to clean the text by each sentence. To do that I used a  loop in my function but the issue is that it only returns 1 of the sentences in my dataframe.I can't figure out why the function is not outputting all the rows from my dataframe. Also, I don't see why its pulling out just a random row instead of the first row.
You are iterating over every element in your collection, but each time you're overwritting  variable.So, you are just returning the last line traversed.Try with this:
You loop is a bit malformed.  I would suggest using a list comprehension like:
You are overwriting  variable again and again. So as a result, your function is returning the last row. Try having a empty list and append the results to it for every iteration.Hope this helps.
