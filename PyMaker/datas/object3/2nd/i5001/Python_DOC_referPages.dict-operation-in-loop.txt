I have a dict as follows:upto:Given these, I have to populate another dict using the following condition:which gives:Similarly:upto:If I append these, I'm supposed to get:I want the l to be a dict:for A1 andfor A2..upto for A7.One problem is I have to compute this starting from A[1][0], A[2][0] to A[1][0],A[7][0] and then for A[2][0], A[1]A[0]...so on upto A[7][0],A[6][0]. The other problem is that I need to skip the computation wherever A[i][0] and A[i][0] are to be compared. I've initially tried a loop like this:I'm getting this error:Somebody kindly help me get the loop please. Please note that B has to be a dict.
Okay, I think I'm starting to understand your thing.I would say the solution might look like something like this:I'll write a bit more details as to what I'm doing here. But first, I'm not 100% sure that's what you want as a result.
