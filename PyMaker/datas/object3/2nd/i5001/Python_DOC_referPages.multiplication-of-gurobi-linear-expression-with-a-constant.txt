How do I multiply a Linear expression with a constant? I have written the code but it always returns . Need help in multiplying a constant with a linear expression.
TL;DR - This is not the way gurobi is used, see code example at the bottomLet's first go over some code lines -  The  method adds a new variable named y_1, which you store in the dictionary .This creates a new (python) variable, , and points it to the gurobi variable you created before (y_0). Note that since you didn't call  yet, y_1 can not be used in any expression at this point.I assume you wanted to create the linear expression , but this line doesn't do it. creates a new empty linear expression, equivalent to. That's because you didn't supply any argument to the constructor of the LinExpr object (documentation for the constructor here), so gurobi does not know which expression you want, and defaults to zero .Instead, you can call , which will create the expression you wanted. You can then multiply it by 2 by typing , or even create the end expression directly using  - here the first argument is a list of coefficients, and the second one is a list of gurobi variables.However, gurobi has a very convenient syntax for creating expressions (using operator overloading), so you usually shouldn't explicitly call the constructor of LinExpr yourself, but rather use the gurobi variables directly in mathematical expressions.Here's a simple working code -Which prints
