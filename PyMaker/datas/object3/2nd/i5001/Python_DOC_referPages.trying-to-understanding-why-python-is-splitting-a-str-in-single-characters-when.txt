I am using python 3.6.4 and i am trying to figure out why python is splitting my str variable into individual characters. here is what i am doing returns:Can some explain why is python splitting each of my string per character?Then how do i get it to just return?
will take each element from  and put  in between. In your casetakes each element from the string "hello world" (i.e. each character) and puts \n\n in between. So you get each character and then two newlines after it.You don't need the  in your case. just do
