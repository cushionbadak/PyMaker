I need to concat a single byte with the bytes I get from a parameter string.but I get this error:I assume this happens because I am using the string concat operator - how do I resolve that?
From the error message, I get that you are running Python2 (works in Python3). Assuming that  is a string:Python3 ([Python]: class bytes([source[, encoding[, errors]]])):Python2 (where  and  are the same):I also renamed the  to  so it doesn't clash with the  module itself.As everyone suggested, it's recommended / common to do the transformation using  (in Python3 the argument is not even necessary, as utf8 is the default encoding)
From that error message, it looks like you are using python2, not python3.  In python2, bytes is just an alias for str, and str only takes one argument.To make something that works in python2 and python3, use str.encode rather than bytes:
