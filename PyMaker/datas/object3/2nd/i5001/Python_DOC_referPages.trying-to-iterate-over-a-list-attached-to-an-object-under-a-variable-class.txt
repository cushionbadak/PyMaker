Full code is at the end.I've written a program that reads in data from a csv file.  It creates a class of variable called "Facility".  Each facility can have multiple water sources, so there is another class called "WaterSource" which appends a list of attributes for an individual water source to each Facility.  If I call : I get output:If I ask for :I need to create a report that iterates over every variable in the class and returns a list of Facilities that have multiple water sources.  Thus the final output would a list of [RegNo, Facility Name, No. of WaterSources] such as:[Facility 00312 US Aggregates Inc 4]The issue I'm having is understanding how to iterate over the Facilities to count the records of the water sources appended to each Facilities object.  I think I could add a method into the class somewhere, but I can't quite figure out where.  I'm a python beginner, so please forgive me if this isn't quite  the right vocabulary.  I'm not even sure where to start, so any suggestions you could offer would be helpful.
[Facility 00312 US Aggregates Inc 4]The issue I'm having is understanding how to iterate over the  Facilities to count the records of the water sources appended to each  Facilities object.From my understanding, simply add a method and return a count of the objects or straight up count the records using len unless there is something more to what you are asking for?
All of your Facilities are stored as values in the dictionary  using the facility's RegNo for the keys.  You can iterate over all the data using the dictionary items method.  The length of each facility's  attribute is the number of water sources.  You can build a format string to use the information you need.
