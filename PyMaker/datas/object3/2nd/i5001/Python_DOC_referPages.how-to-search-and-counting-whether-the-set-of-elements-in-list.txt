Below is the code that I search and count the pos_xist named list that holds the crawled element of en.wiktionary.org. The list holds the possible Part of Speech tag (with something not pos too) of wiktionary, and I search that list only to count how many of them in the list.How can I shorten this code below in a more concise way?
You could create a list of words to search for, and iterate over each item in  with a a generator expression:If you want to limit to the first ten items use slicing .No exception handling should be necessary.
form a list of all possible pos tags and search in them.
You could use the  builtin coupled with just going through the list per item rather than waiting until an error is thrown.It would look something like this
