I'm trying to write a Python function (without the use of modules) that will iterate through a list of coordinates and find the euclidean distance between two subsequent points (for example, the distance between points a and b, b and c, c and d etc.). After a few hours of searching I came across this post which I thought solved my problem, so I wrote this:However, this retrieves the distance between the first point and every other point. I've been trying to figure out how to define a variable for the next point in the sequence, but I'm pretty new to Python and just don't quite understand how to get there. I'm currently writing the  function like this:but can't figure out how I would go about defining pTwo.
One way of doing this would be:Basically, record the first item, and iterate from the second item in the list. It's probably better to swap  and  around for easier understanding, or to be clearer and use more Pythonic names:
With a list comprehension and zip this can be done like:Code:Or alternatively for Python 3 (from comments) using :Test CodeResults:
With itertools and NumPy:
