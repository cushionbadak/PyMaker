I am writing a Python script that I need to run on Windows and UNIX systems.I have two folders, let's call them 'Main' and 'Data'. 'Main' contains 'Data' and my script, and 'Data' contains my data in the form of CSV files. 'Main' --> 'Data' ---> data1.csv, data2.csv....Currently my code below works if I keep the CSV files in 'Main'. How can I get it to work on both Windows and UNIX, keeping the CSV files in 'Data', if the path naming conventions are different?Here is the code I am running
