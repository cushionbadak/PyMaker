I am trying for hours to come up with the most efficient approach to structure and append flowing tick data to a shared memory numpy array and later get a pandas DataFrame in a timely fashion.Questions:1) What is the right way to structure my array and (faster) append new tick data to it?2) What would be the most efficient approach to create either a pd.DataFrame of the complete array or a pd.Series for a column?3) Is there a better way to work with shared memory timeseries in python (besides multiprocessing.basemanager)?Many thanks!
