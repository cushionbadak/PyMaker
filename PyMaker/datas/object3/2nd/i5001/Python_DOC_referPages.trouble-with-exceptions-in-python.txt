I am learning about exceptions in  python and I am having trouble with some code. the following code is:Now when I execute the code I get the following to two lines:Content written to file successfully. Have a nice day.Error: unable to write the file. Check permissionsThe issues I am having is that because the error, in this case being the "r" which should be "w" I should only get the message Error: unable to write the file. Check permissions. But I am getting both error and the success messages and I am unsure why
I'll break it down one by one for you.Try block openedFile opened with read privileges.Try block opened, exception occurred when you wrote since you wrote to a readonly file object.Since you have an inner try block, the nested finally is the first block executed.Printing success even though the file write failed. Closing the file, works fineException handler, now the exception is handled.
 always executes:A finally clause is always executed before leaving the try statement,  whether an exception has occurred or not.The process you are seeing:Your script will not error on  because at the stage it is notwriting any data.When it moves on to  it errors and moves to ,for the reason given above.Since you have met an , you will also see the messagedefined in your  clause.
