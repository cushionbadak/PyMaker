Here's the situation:I need to get a value (float) that is different from the selected option in the combobox (a string) and I don't know how to do it.DAP=46MAP=52SPS=21SPT=46 will fetch me "DAP" (if DAP is selected in the combobox obviously) and I want to get 46 in this case.So when an option is chosen from the combobox I need to get a float (e.g. when someone selects DAP in the combobox I need to get or get returned 46 as a float). With  I'll get 'DAP' (If DAP is selected for example) and I want to get 46 instead (as a float).I need to relate each gotten string with the corresponding float.I use it on this formula:
Use a  ([Python]: Mapping Types â€” dict):and its usage (as current values are s, convert them to s):or better (in case the string returned by the combo is not present in : [Python]: get(key[, default])):
