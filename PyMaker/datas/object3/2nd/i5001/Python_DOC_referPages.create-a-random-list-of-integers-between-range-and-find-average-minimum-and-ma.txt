I am new to coding and still trying to learn python coding.I am trying to write a program that generates 5 random numbers and stores in a list. My output should end up like this: [2, 34, 23, 5, 22] I am trying to find the average, lowest, and highest number from the list. I tried a few other ways to find the answers but I get the final number in the list as my highest, lowest, and average number. Can anyone help me solve this issue? 
You may use  to get your random list using a list comprehension as:Here,   will returned a random integer between  and , which in this case is  and  respectively. For example, my list is as:For finding average, do:For finding max value use  on the list:For finding min value use  on the list:
Your problem is in the definition of . Define  as the following list comprehension and your script works:The reason your definition fails is because  just creates a list of a single integer. If you wish to perform this in a loop, you can do so as follows:However, a pythonic idiom would be to use the list comprehension as mentioned earlier.
For each n, you're replacing the whole  list with a list containing only .
