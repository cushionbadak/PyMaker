Natural Text
I have an XML document that has entries that contains URL, basically a Git / Bitbucket URL:So basically this URL points to the dev branch, and I want to replace it such that it points to master by removing the  string.How do I trim this using regex using the suffix  as reference? Can you give both Python and bash script solution? How about when  is to be replaced with ? (Please note that I cannot just replace all occurence of  as the word is too common, so I still need to use  as regex reference)
with note that you have to escape the question mark.
