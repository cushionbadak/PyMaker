How am I able to extract the source IP relevant for "main.mp3" mount point from the below xml source     My current code gets the first on the list which happens to be for the listen.mp3 mount point, however I would like the extraction to be bound to a particular mount pointCode that extracts the source IP:xml source of the link:
You could select the container 'source' tags and collect 'source_ip' tags on each of them, so each IP will be relevant to a mount poin.  Or you could create a dictionary and select IP by mount point, eg,  If you want to select the IP from a specific point only, just select the 'source_ip' tag on that node.
I have pasted your XML data into excercise.xml file, and it should work fine with python 3.x
Use ElementTree, ships with Python.
