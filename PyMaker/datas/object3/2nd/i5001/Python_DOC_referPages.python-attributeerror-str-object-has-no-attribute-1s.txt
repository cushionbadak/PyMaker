You need to slice your string .   is not a command Python understands but  is. See string slicing.Your working code:Modified:Slicing strings are versatile.  For example:You are doing the same here.  You input your name and slice at a point.  Note that string slicing starts at 0 for the first character and not 1.
 in a format string is the syntax from the older -style formatting. There, it would have looked liked this:With the format string syntax, which you are using, this looks a bit different. Format specifiers are to be specified after a colon, like this:Or using named groups:This is using the precision to limit the string length, as documented (emphasis mine):The precision is a decimal number indicating how many digits should be displayed after the decimal point for a floating point value formatted with  and , or before and after the decimal point for a floating point value formatted with  or . For non-number types the field indicates the maximum field size - in other words, how many characters will be used from the field content. The precision is not allowed for integer values. (Yes, I am aware that “van” is not a middle name…)
