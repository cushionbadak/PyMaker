This is my code for form with button:When I start this file, I receive next error:But in my ClickerBot class exist this method:Where is problem? I import this code from catalog studio recorder, and start learn python a week ago, because many things for me like magic and google help not every time (Sorry for bad English)
Your code would be ok if your  class was an ordinary class. The point is that  is a very special framework, and  classes are not meant to be used directly, but thru a  and a  that both do quite some magic under the hood. This is partly documented, but you'll probably have to read the source code of the existing runners and loaders to really find out how to make the whole thing work. A good starting point might be the already existing GUI testrunner mentionned in the doc:The script Tools/unittestgui/unittestgui.py in the Python source   distribution is a GUI tool for test discovery and execution
