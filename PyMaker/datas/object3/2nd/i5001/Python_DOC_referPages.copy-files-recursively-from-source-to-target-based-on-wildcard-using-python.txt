I have a source directory that has several xml files in nested location. I am trying to write a python script to copy files recursively based on a pattern (say *1.2.3.xml) to a target location.Expected outcome:The following script doesn't do the filtering.What am I missing here?
What is happening here is that the copytree function will work recursively. First, it will descend into source and give   two items for filenames arg - The ignored_files will return  as it does not match with the pattern and thus copytree will ignore the entire directory itself.You will have to add an additional check for directories in your condition in  something like .
Can you please try this?
Try this instead:
