This question already has an answer here:Delete a file or folder                    10 answers                Whenever I try to use them to remove dirs with things in them I get this error message"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/os.py", line 170, in removedirs      rmdir(name)  OSError: [Errno 66] Directory not empty: 'new-file'However I think I saw people using those commands to delete dirs that weren't empty, so what am I doing wrong? Thanks
You should be using  to recursively delete directory:Answer to your question:Is  and  only used to delete empty directories?Yes, they can only be used to delete empty directories. Below is the description from official Python document which clearly stats that.Remove (delete) the directory path. Only works when the directory is empty, otherwise, OSError is raised. In order to remove whole directory trees, shutil.rmtree() can be used.Remove directories recursively. Works like  except that, if the leaf directory is successfully removed, removedirs() tries to successively remove every parent directory mentioned in path until an error is raised (which is ignored, because it generally means that a parent directory is not empty). For example, os.removedirs('foo/bar/baz') will first remove the directory 'foo/bar/baz', and then remove 'foo/bar' and 'foo' if they are empty. Raises OSError if the leaf directory could not be successfully removed.
