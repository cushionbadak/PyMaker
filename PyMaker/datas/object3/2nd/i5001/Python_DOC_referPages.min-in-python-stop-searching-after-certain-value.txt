Natural Text
I am trying to find the minimum of three values which are provided by three functions. What I've done so far looks something like this:The functions are recursive and need quite some time to process. However, the smallest output possible is always 0. Which is why I'd like to know if there is a build-in function where I can specify a certain value after which min() will stop searching. Surely I could write my own min-function but maybe there's another way?
You can create a generator function that stops yielding if  has been seen, or some other condition is met:This is modelled on the  function, but yields that last value that matched the predicate.Combined with a generator expression you can then take the minimum value of the output, and anything beyond  is ignored:I used a generator expression to call each function in series, that way you don't even call later functions if one of the first functions produces .Demo: is never called because  produced .
