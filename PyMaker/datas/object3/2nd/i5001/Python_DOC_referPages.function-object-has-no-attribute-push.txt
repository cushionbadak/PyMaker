I am trying to push new values to the queues employeeName and employeeSalary()However I am faced with this error. What am I doing wrong?
This is calls of  on methods. What is the idea? You have  methods on your class, start with calling Btw, you should probably look into deque
'function' object has no attribute 'push'  ...  What am I doing wrong? and  are not queues, the are instance methods (functions) of your class.  They do not have a (callable)  attribute.  They do not contain anything, they do something, so you cannot add to them.
