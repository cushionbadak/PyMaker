Natural Text
I want to write an encoded text to a file using Python 3.6, the issue is that I want to write it as a string and not as bytes.The problem is, I still get the file content as bytes (e.g. the '\n' remains the same instead of become a new row).I also tried to use: but it's just returning me back the old text I had in the first place.any ideas how can I improve this piece of code?Thanks.
The problem you have here is that you  into  bytes object and then cast it back into a string object without specifying an encoding.  The default is , so you've just converted using the wrong encoding.  If you pass the same encoding to  then it should work.Better yet, don't call  at all when writing out - if you already have a bytes object, it's not necessary.This concept generally trips up a lot of people.  I suggest reading the explanation here to help wrap your head around how and why we do the string/bytes conversions.  A good rule of thumb - string types inside your python, and decode to string from bytes as data comes in, encode from string to bytes as it goes out.
