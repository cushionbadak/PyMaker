I as going through some Python notes and I saw this example and its working find but i am trying to understand what is happening.How and/or operator works here? I tried looking up on google but it just showed me basic and/or stuff :(.
The  and  operators deal with the truthiness of their operands. So returns the first falsey operand, or the last operand if they're all truthy, whilereturns the first truthy operand, or the last operand if they're all falsey.The link above explains what's considered truthy and falsey. Objects are always truthy, so will always return  since  can never be the first falsey operand. Converselywill always return  because it's the first truthy operand.returns  because  is not falsey.
You have to fundamentally grok truth value testing and boolean operators. https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/stdtypes.htmlNote, the  operator returns one of it's two arguments: If x is false, then y, else xIt is an idiom that is frequently used to check if something is falsey, usually  or an empty container.e.g. use  if x  is not  else use something else... So a shortcut for:I prefer the full if-else, or if you want something that can fit on one line, use a conditional expressionOr The and operator also returns one of it's arguments: if x is false, then x, else y
