I am using  as a measuring/monitoring tool in my tests. I need to edit  configurations automatically; since all tests are being executed automatically.Currently I am using  for configuring it; this is the process:Read the whole file content.Use regex to find and edit the required plugin/property. Write the whole changed content to the file.But I'm searching for a library, if exists, like  or  to handle the configurations as an object not content. I tried ,  and ; all return: library has specific configuration classes, each belongs to a special type of linux configs (e.g. ,  and some other types), but it doesn't contain a class for  configs.Does anyone have an option in mind?EDIT 1:I tried  library (as @KevinC suggested), but it loads nothing:Using  returns the same results.
You can use configobj, but you have to specify "list_values"=False
