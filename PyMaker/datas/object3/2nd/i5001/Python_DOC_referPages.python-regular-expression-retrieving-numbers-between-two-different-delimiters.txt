I have the following string I would like to use regular expressions to extract the groups:group1 56,7,1group2 88,9,1group3 58,8,1group4 45group5 100group6 nullMy ultimate goal is to have tuples such as (group1, group2), (group3, group4), (group5, group6). I am not sure if this all can be accomplished with regular expressions.I have the following regular expression with gives me partial resultsThe matches have an extra comma at the end like  which I would like to remove and  is not returning a null.
You likely do not need to use regex.  A list comprehension and  can likely do what you need like:Code:Test Code:Results:
You could match rather than split using the expressionand grab the first group, see a demo on regex101.com.That isIn :Which yields
You can use  Online demojust you need add index to group
You could use  in positive lookahead to match against the end of the string:Output:
Here, I have assumed that parameters will only have numerical values. If it is so, then you can try this.(?<=h=|d=)([0-9,]*)Hope it helps.
