Natural Text
so I have a Class Number with two string attributes called roman and text (It is supposed to store the Roman value and text description of an Arabic number)I use a dictionary to store this information, the keys are the Arabic numbers and the values are instances of the class Number.Finally, I want to print the attributes but I cannot find the way to access them.Example:So when I print the Arabic number and its roman value and tex description I want to get this output:I thought that in order to get this I would have to code:But that is not the case, does someone know how to access the attributes of the object from a dictionary?  
The proper way of accessing is storing the key and the value in temporary variables to be used in printing (or something else), rather than manually typing in 20.If you want to do this in a loop (to print all elements),Or using dict.items(),
