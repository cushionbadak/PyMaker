The following Python code below gives a syntax error on the ':' in the for-loop inside the while-loop. Code works fine if for-loop is removed. Have searched this site and Googled around with no answer for this issue. I am learning Python. Want to understand where the issue lies here. Thanks.
The error is not because of the colon . You are using for loop to check if , The structure of  is not used like this. Use while loop instead.
This line is not correct. Do you want to use an if? like this.
