I need your help with my code. I have converted from  to  object. Now I would like to convert it back to  object after I have added to the next day date. When I try this:It give me an error: TypeError: expected string or bufferThe error are jumping on this line:Here is the datetime object for :Here is what I am trying to achieve:Can you please help me how I can correct the error to allow me to convert it to  object?

There is no 23:00PM. Change it to 11:00PM.[Update]As you mentioned, the error came out from the second line. When I run the first two lines with Python 3.6, the result wasValueError: time data '23/02/2018 23:00PM' does not match format '%d/%m/%Y %I:%M%p'It means that there is a problem in "23:00PM" so I suggested to change it to "11:00PM". Or you can use "%H" instead of "%I" (as Patrick Haugh suggested in the comment).P.S. I could not give full answer because of mobile device. Sorry for that.
