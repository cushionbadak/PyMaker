I'm having the hardest time trying to figure out the difference in usage between  and .To help, this is bit of code is a barebones example of what I'm trying to do.I'm trying to run  and  at the same time. I'm not trying to have them communicate with each other so there is no need for a .  is called every 5 seconds.I can't really rap my head around the difference between creating a pool of workers, or creating a queue of functions. Can anyone assist me?The real  and  functions are much more elaborate than the example so concurrent execution actually is necessary, I just thought this example would suffice for asking the question.  
The  and the  belong to two different levels of abstraction.The Pool of Workers is a concurrent design paradigm which aims to abstract a lot of logic you would otherwise need to implement yourself when using processes and queues.The  actually uses a  internally for operating.If your problem is simple enough, you can easily rely on a . In more complex cases, you might need to deal with processes and queues yourself.For your specific example, the following code should do the trick.I'd also recommend you to take a look at the  module. As the name suggest, that is the future proof implementation for the Pool of Workers paradigm in Python.You can easily re-write the example above with that library as what really changes is just the API names.
