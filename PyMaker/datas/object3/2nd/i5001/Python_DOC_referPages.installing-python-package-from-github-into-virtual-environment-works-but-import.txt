I created a python project named PythonApplicationI created a virtual environment env (Python 3.6 (64-bit))I run the following in the virtual environment directoryI get:Looking at the directory structure at I seeandI then add the following code inside PythonApplication.py When I run this I get the following error:ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'somePython'What did I miss?Based on Saurav's comment below I re-did the steps. However, after creating the environment I did activate it at the command prompt and ran the pip command inside the activated environment instead of the command prompt. The results did not change.Someone else commented that github.com/BillMills/python-package-example.git is written in Python 2 and will not work in Python 3. If that is correct, what needs to be changed?
The package you are using from https://github.com/BillMills/python-package-example is using an import style not supported in Python 3. You can see in python-package-example/__init__.py thatis used to import a submodule, but python 3 will assume  exists as a top level module. See PEP-328 for a better explanation.A Python 3 compatible example package can be found at https://github.com/kennethreitz/samplemod. Notice that in sample/__init__.py submodules are imported using a relative import (indicated by the leading '.'):If you wanted to modify python-package-example to be compatible you would need to change its __init__.py to use an absolute import:or a relative import:
