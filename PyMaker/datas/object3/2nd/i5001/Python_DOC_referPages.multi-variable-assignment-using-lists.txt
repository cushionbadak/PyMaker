Natural Text
For a multi-assignment the left side should be tuple, so first is a normal tuple assignment. But why doesnâ€™t the list assignment generate an error, it is a list and not a tuple:
Both tuple and list syntax is supported. See the  definition in the Assignment statements section.[...]Assignment of an object to a target list, optionally enclosed in parentheses or square brackets [...]No actual tuple or list is created here, it is just syntax that echoes the syntax for lists and tuples. There is no difference between using either tuple or list syntax in an assignment target.
