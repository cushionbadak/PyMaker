I have a large number of DataFrames with similar prefix , that look like:Of course I can do The issue is that although the prefix  will always be there, the rest of the dataframes' names keep changing and do not have any pattern. So, I have to constantly update the list of dataframes in  to create the 'final_df`, which is cumbersome. Question: is there anyway to tell python to concatenate all defined dataframes in the namespace (only) starting with  and create the  or at least return a list of all such dataframes that I can then manually feed into ? 
You could do something like this, using the built-in function :Logic:Filter down your global namespace to DataFrames that start with Put these in a list (concat doesn't take a generator)Call  on the first axis.Example:Always use  with caution.  It gets you a dictionary of the entire module namespace.You need  rather than  because the dictionary is being used inside a function.   would be null here at time of use.
