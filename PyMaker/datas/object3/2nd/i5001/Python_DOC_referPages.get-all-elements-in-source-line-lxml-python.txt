Natural Text
I'm extracting some html information and querying it using the  method in python. For one particular application I would like to extract all elements belonging to a particular sourceline. For instanceThe above yields sourceline number 14, which contains the following source html.How do I then extract all the contents of this html  using the sourceline rather than the conventional xpath query? Or does xpath have some syntax that is sourceline aware?Thanks
If you're interested in getting the content visible on the page, you could use: , as mentioned here: http://lxml.de/api/lxml.etree._Element-class.html#textIf you need the actual html of that element you can use ElementTree's  method:Also, as CristFati mentioned, try to avoid using  as a variable since it's a python built-in function and you have overwritten it's reference.https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#all
