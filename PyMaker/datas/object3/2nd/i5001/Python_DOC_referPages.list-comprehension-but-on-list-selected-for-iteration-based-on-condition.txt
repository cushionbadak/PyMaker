I am having two lists  and  as:I want to create a new list  based on the condition that if my condition  is , then  should be holding the content from  else it should be holding the content from . Below is the code I tried: But this is raising . How should I achieve this?Expected output for above code is:
If you only want to create a new list  based on your condition , you may simply do (no need of list comprehension):Above result is based on the fact that Python treats boolean value  and  as  and  respectively. So, we are fetching the desired list from tuple based on the condition.Other alternatives to perform the same task:If list comprehension is must to use for you (may be to perform some operation on the elements), then you may use list comprehension with any of the above condition as:
You're just missing some parentheses:A list comprehension can have a filtering condition ( in the language reference) as follows:In your current version,  is  and  is , but your additional  is syntactically invalid. You need to be explicit that your conditional expression is all part of , which you can do with parentheses.
