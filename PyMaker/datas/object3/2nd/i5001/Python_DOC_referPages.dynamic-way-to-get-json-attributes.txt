Natural Text
My first dabble with Python and JSON.In the example below, I am loading JSON data and writing the values to a text file.Is it possible to output the attribute names (, , and ) as the first line of the text file? Obviously I could hard code the attributes (or column names as that is what I am after), but wondered if there was a more dynamic way to do this....what if I don't know the attribute names?
An object within a JSON string parsed via  will be converted into a dictionary, thus all you need to do in order to iterate through the object and write their values is the followingIf you only want to write the values, as shown in your example, you could also do something like this
