I have 10 test cases testing various scenarios so far. What I want to do is reduce the amount of repetition that's in the code.this is the login_form_base I use as a module for the testcases:And this is the code with the testcases:The login_form_base module is fine in my opinion. But the test case look like they can be condensed without taking away from their simplicity. I've done my best so far from 150+ lines of code to this but I'm just not sure how I can simplify from here. By the way, the code is functioning just fine.
I'm not sure if you are able to use  but if so, the  option seems like a good fit. Here is a rough example (be warned though, I haven't run it!).
EDIT: Lettuce is right, it's better if you make a separate unit test for each User.Yet you can forget about defining so many tests if you define a User class with and  attributes, as inThen you can store them in a binary file with pickle dump.In the end, you only need one function to test all these cases.
