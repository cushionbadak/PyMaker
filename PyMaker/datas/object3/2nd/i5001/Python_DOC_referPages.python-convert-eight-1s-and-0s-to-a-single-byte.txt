I have a binary string representation of a byte, such asHow can I convert it to a real binary value and write it to a binary file?
Use the  function with a  of  to read a binary value as an integer.Python 2 uses strings to handle binary data, so you would use the  function to convert the integer to a one-byte string.Python 3 handles binary and text differently, so you need to use the  type instead. This doesn't have a direct equivalent to the  function, but the  constructor can take a list of byte values. We put  in a one element array and convert that to a  object.Once you have your binary string, you can open a file in binary mode and write the data to it like this:
