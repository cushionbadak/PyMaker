Following piece of code, I expect range to vary every time when the flow increment +2. So I expect 0,8  2,8  4,6  6,8.But it is following the linear increment like 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 instead of 2,4,6,8 Code:Output:
Range in pydocs The range type represents an immutable sequence of numbers and is commonly used for looping a specific number of times in for loops.Which means that on every iteration your loop takes the next element from the list and the "+2" part gets dismissed. (overridden)
i is reset on each iteration, use a different variable to increment, for instance:
 assigns the next value in the range to  in every iteration rendering   useless.I would suggest you use
