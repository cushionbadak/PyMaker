I'm quite new on Python, and just can't figure out how I get this working.What I want is a background while loop that prints every second something out, but can turn it off and on when I want to.For the example I just want to have it the first 4 seconds turned on, after that 4 seconds off (so nothing actually happens). I run it as an process.So there is probably a lot of ways how to do this, but can't figure out what's the easiest way. Many thanks.
I think you should run the while loop inside a Thread
Your loop should always run, otherwise you would need a second loop to check if it should run the loop = redundant.  Also you are using the multiprocessing library, which means they won't share global variables inside the system, like threads would.  SO... you need to save the switch in an outside context (like a DB, or config file) and have the loop check that before output.  Here is the problem with the above.  Sleep blocks the thread.  You really should think about context switching, like gevent.  Additional option, if you do go to gevent, you can use GIPC to open multiple processes as well as asynch threading inside each process AND share states between them.  It works extremely well.
