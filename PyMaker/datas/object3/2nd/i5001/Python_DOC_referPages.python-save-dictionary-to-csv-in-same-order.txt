this is my actual code : i want to same dictionary in csv in same order like fb_catalog_dict, problem is python create me csv file with diferent order filds, how can i fix this ?
In CPython >= 3.6 this will work as written, because s are ordered now.On any earlier Python version (or different implementations), you can use . It does exactly what its name suggests.You will have to slightly change your instantiation, because passing a  to  just preserves the order of the , but not the order in which you wrote it. So just make it a list of tuples, as recommended here.Example code:(Not sure what your  was defined as, so I left it out.)
Dictionaries are unordered.  And given you only use the keys anyway, what you are doing can be achieved with a list.  ie:etc..
In Python dict is and unordered structure. There is no specific order in a dict. So the only way I see is to use a list of fields to be sure you always get them in the same order:P.S> the example is for Python 3.x
