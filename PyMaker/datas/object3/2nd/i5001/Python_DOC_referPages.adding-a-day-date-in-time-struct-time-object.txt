I need your help with my current code. I want to add the next day date using with  object, but I have got no idea how to do this after I have stored the string in the  list.Example:    time.struct_time(tm_year=2018, tm_mon=2, tm_mday=22, tm_hour=17, tm_min=00, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=3, tm_yday=53, tm_isdst=-1)To this:If I want to add the next day, I would have to readd the same code that I have already been using:Here is the code:Output for :Output for :I don't want to re-add the same code that I have already wrote it. If you can show me an example how I could use a short simple code to add the date to the next day date using with  object, that would be great.
Can you use  instead?
