I have a folder with 1,199 CSV files. These files are all of the form 'BCx_mmyyPPO.csv' where  and  is 2-digit month followed by 2-digit year. A snippet of the folder is below: folder sampleI've written the following Python 3 code take all 1,199 files and jam them into one large CSV file:The print step is functionally unnecessary but is the meat of what I'm trying to figure out. What logic does  use to choose the order of the items. I can't figure out how/why it chooses 'BC56_0608PPO.csv' as element 0? There really seems to be no rhyme or reason to it but it's problematic. I need the first file to be any of 'BCx_mm16PPO.csv' or 'BCx_mm17PPO.csv'.My searches for anyone else with this problem are coming up short. I'm probably not looking correctly. Thank you for your assistance.
Enumerate does not change the order of an iterable, it just gives each item an index. The order of  is dependent on , whose order is arbitrary.You can sort it alphabetically by using :... or use os.path to sort by size or last modification time:
