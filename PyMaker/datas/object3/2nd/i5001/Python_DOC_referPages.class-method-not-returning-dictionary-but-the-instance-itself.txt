This question already has an answer here:Bound method error                    6 answers                Fairly new to Python with a question regarding class instances. I have something likeIn my main file I'm importing  and call an instance and assign it to a variable:But when I want to get the dictionary out it like this: it does not return the dictionary but the instance itself.The print output I'm getting is: Why is it not returning the dict?
Because is a method.For it to be not callable make it property with  decorator.For it to be more pythonic, i woud suggest using method and call it appropriateIn instance initialization you would assign default value of  and if you need to inherit you  class you can just override your  to match your possible changes.
You're missing the parantheses for your method. You're getting the address of the method function instead of the method itself. Try the following:
What you need to do to actually call login_headers is just:login_headers is a function that you've defined as a child of the Headers class, so you just need to call it like any other function.
