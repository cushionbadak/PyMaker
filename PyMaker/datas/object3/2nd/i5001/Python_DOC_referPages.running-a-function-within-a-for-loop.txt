I've got a start on the read and write file code working (though it's flipping the columns), and the function to calculate and classify BMI, but I'm not sure how to combine them to run the function within the FOR LOOP.BMI function:Read/write code:EDIT: This is my attempt to call the function in the for loop, in response to one of the comments. I'm new to Python and not sure how to do this, which is why I'm asking for help:This code doesn't add BMI or classification of overweight/obsese/etc to the outfile, and returns this "function BMI at 0x113fc4400" in repetition in the IDLE shell for the number for rows in the bmi.txt file.
I think it would be better if you get first all data from  and then write the result(s) to another file.And then, for each data, you calculate and write to
