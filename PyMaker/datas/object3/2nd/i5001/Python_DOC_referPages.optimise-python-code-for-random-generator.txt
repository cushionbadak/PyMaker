You can use dynamic programming:The reason this is faster is that it only calculates each value once, while your code calculates things exponentially.This algorithm is  (for loop of length ), while your algorithm was  ().Alternately, as suggested in the comments, you can use :This works in almost the same way as the previous code, but uses a decorator to memoize results instead of storing them in a list.
