Natural Text
In the following method, I am unsure of what .join(data_directory, d) and .join(ROOT_PATH, "TrafficSigns/Training") yields.  Specifically I don't know how .join() handles these two parameters.  A quick note, I am loading images from within the TrafficSign folder (which contains the two folders, Training and Testing).  
This safely joins the paths together as a string.  It uses  to ensure the correct path separator is used for the os platform.  It can correct extra separators.
