Natural Text
I'm just a bit confused on how to make my items in a list see several characters as one.  So far, the entire thing looks like:When I enter classes in the form of something like  I want it to print back out:See below to see what it gives me.  It sees each character as one item on the list.  I also need it to return the value of all the characters in the list, so in this example, I want it to be 21, but instead it gives me 34.  How can I fix it so GEO 101 and all the rest would be one item?
 always result in a single . If you want to parse this string as being JSON-like you can use the  module.For more user friendly input you can use the split function and trim function.Note: do not add multiple things in a single method. The method will become cluttered and unclear. What is the single responsibility of this method, (printing or calculating the length of the input string)
This should work
[Update]Use  instead of dangerous  (as Francis Colas pointed out in the comment)[Original]I suggest simply using  as follows:
