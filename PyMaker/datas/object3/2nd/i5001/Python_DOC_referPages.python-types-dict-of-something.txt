Is there a way to inform python (3.6+) that my attribute is a dict of something?What I'd like:
In order to type as a Dict you have to import Dict from typing. The typing module also offers support for other typing kinds as well. Such as: Tuple, List, and Union. You can use these same types to indicate return values.https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html
