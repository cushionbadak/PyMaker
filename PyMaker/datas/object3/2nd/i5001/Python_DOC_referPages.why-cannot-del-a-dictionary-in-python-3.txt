I created a dict in python 3, its type is dict as expected,then I deleted it with , but it still exists and type is changed to "type"Why does del not work on the dict? Why is type changed?
When you name your dictionary  there is a problem. is a built-in function.Rename the dictionary and try again:
If you really want to "abuse" the word "dict " in your scripts then you can use the word "dict " only like this "dict_" by using "_ " behind it.>> Here << is pythons build-in list of words reserved for your scripts functionality by python.In semantics context: The word "reserved" means "to keep or set apart for some particular use or purpose in its functional/semantic context.". Thus if your change those reserved words your script/code/program comes tumbling down like a house of cards and python starts spitting "traceback errors" when you run your code. Regardless of your free choice to change the wording of them into other lingo, you have to correct all those words written in your scripts/code to maintain its functionality in place by these "reserved" words. If not you have a bright "debugging" future ahead for all you scripts where you changed these "reserved" python wordings/ built-in functions.
