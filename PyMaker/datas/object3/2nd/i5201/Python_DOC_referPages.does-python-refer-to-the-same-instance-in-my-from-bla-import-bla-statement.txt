Let's say I have the following pseudo-code. Does importing  in both files refer to 2 instances of  or do they refer to the same instance? In other words, can I connect and disconnect a single connection in different files like this in Python?bla.pyhello.pyworld.py
Yes, both in  and in ,  references the same instance.Modules are singletons, and there is just one copy of their namespace. The top level statements (everything outside of functions and generators) is executed just once, when your module is imported the first time.Modules are managed in the  mapping. Importing first ensures the module is loaded and present in , after which names are bound in the importing namespace. Essentially,  does the same thing as the  assignment statement would. So loading your module into memory takes place just once, your  is executed just once, and all further imports will access that one reference to the instance.From the  statement documentation:The basic import statement (no  clause) is executed in two steps:find a module, loading and initializing it if necessarydefine a name or names in the local namespace for the scope where the  statement occurs.[...]The  form uses a slightly more complex process:find the module specified in the from clause, loading and initializing it if necessary;for each of the identifiers specified in the  clauses:    check if the imported module has an attribute by that nameif not, attempt to import a submodule with that name and then check the imported module again for that attributeif the attribute is not found,  is raised.otherwise, a reference to that value is stored in the local namespace, using the name in the  clause if it is present, otherwise using the attribute name(Bold emphasis mine).
