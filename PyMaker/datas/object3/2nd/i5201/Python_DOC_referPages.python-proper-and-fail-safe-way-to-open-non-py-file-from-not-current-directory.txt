What is the proper and fail-safe way to open non py file from not current directory?To be more specific, I have a method, which validates API response with JSON schema, contained in file schema.json:And got the following project structure:My goal is to run tests not only from the directory  by exectuting command , but also from parent directory, by executing , with command  inside.  Now the second way fails with .I tried using :but in this case absolute path ignores  parent directory - .How should I open my  placed in different sub-directory and be able to run commands: from  folderand from  folderwithout failing test because of .
If you are happy in making your project a package,  can help abstracting from the resource location in the filesystem.See here.
Fixed problem to achieve my goals from the other side - I changed my  from this:  to this:  Now tests can be runned from project folder and also from the tests folder by simple cmd script runners. Can't definetely say is this a kludge or not, but users are happy.
