Natural Text
I have a python script that reads switch hostnames from a txt file (cisco_input.txt) and runs commands on each switch. However, I need to be able to read a second variable for the interface and I'm not sure how I would do that. This line is where I need to be able to call my second variable for the interface:CLARIFICATION:Currently, the script reads in the switch name to run the command on. So right now I have a text file that looks like:switch1switch2switch3This works great when the port I need to run the command on stays the same. But the port is going to be changing for every switch.So I'd need an input like:switch1 Gi1/1switch2 Gi1/15switch3 Gi1/20Then I need to be able to use the interface as a variable for the command I'm sending:    remote_conn.send("show interfaces counters errors | in $INTERFACE\n")Thank you.
Say you format your file like this (csv, comma-separated value):You can then read it in using csv.reader:There is a problem with this however. If your file is large, loading it into memory all at once can be problematic. The following approach ditches the list and just iterates over the csv.reader, only loading into memory a single row at a time.
