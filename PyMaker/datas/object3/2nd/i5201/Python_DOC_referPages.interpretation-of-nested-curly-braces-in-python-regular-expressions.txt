I ran across this regular expression in a Kaggle kernel and can't figure out what it does:I've been experimenting with it but find it surprisingly difficult to interpret."Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it". - Brian Kernighan
This is three operators in one, format, regexp match, and regexp replace.to understand it easily, write it as:(this assumes python2; add () around print args if you are on python3)Now let's try it:Our regexp has two groups (each in ): first one is "any non-whitespace character, repeated four times. We can see it matched . The second group contains back reference: match  (whatever group 1 matched), repeated twice. We see it matched Together, this matches , and this is replaced again with  , which is  as we saw before.You could ask: but how did group 1 knew to match  and not, say, ? This is regexp magic for you. The regexp engine will try different matches until it finds the one which can match entire string.
