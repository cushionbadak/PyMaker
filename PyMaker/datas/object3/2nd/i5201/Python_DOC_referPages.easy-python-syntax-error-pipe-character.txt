Natural Text
I am new to python and jupyter notebook. When creating a table, a syntax error keeps popping up, it seems that python cannot recognize the pipe character (|). Can anyone help me? Many thanks!I am using a MAC and there is a pipe character on the keyboard. 
Actually python doesnÂ´t store data in tables. But you can store data you need in e.g. list and then use module texttable to output a table.
