Let's say I have a list that contains three strings, and I want a new list that drops one of the strings. I know there are alternate ways of doing this, but I was surprised that the following does not work:Why does the above not work?Edit: Thanks for the answers everyone!
Per the Python Programming FAQ (emphasis added):Some operations (for example  and ) mutate the object, whereas superficially similar operations (for example  and ) create a new object. In general in Python (and in all cases in the standard library) a method that mutates an object will return  to help avoid getting the two types of operations confused. So if you mistakenly write  thinking it will give you a sorted copy of , youâ€™ll instead end up with , which will likely cause your program to generate an easily diagnosed error.Since  is a mutating method (changes the  it's called on in-place), it follows the general pattern of returning . If it didn't, a line like:would appear to work, but it would be aliasing  to the same  referenced by , not creating a new  at all, and it might take some time for that mistake to be noticed, even as you use  and  believing them to be independent. By returning , any attempt to use  believing it to be a separate  (or a  at all), will likely fail loudly (as it does in your case, with or without the  wrapping, making your misuse of  obvious).This also generally encourages Python's (loose) guideline to avoid shoving too many steps in a process on a single line. If you want to copy a  and remove one element, you do it in two steps:and it works just fine.
