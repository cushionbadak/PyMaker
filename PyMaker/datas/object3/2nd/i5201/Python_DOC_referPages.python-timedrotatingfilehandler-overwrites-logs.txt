I setup  like that:Usage:I expected that every minute new messages from  had to append to existing log file for current date. Instead it every minute messages from  overwrote existing log file for current date.What should I do to reach that behaviour?PS: After small research I found that  in the  method deletes existing log file and creates new file. So first solution is to create new handler derived from   which creates new file (with some index for example) insted of deleting existing log file.
After little bit more researching I found  attribute usage in the  method:The default implementation calls the 'namer' attribute of the handler, if it's callable, passing the default name to it. If the attribute isn't callable (the default is None), the name is returned unchanged.So as a solution I implemented my own  function that got  and returned new  with my template:etc.Full example:
According to the documentation of TimedRotatingFileHandler:The system will save old log files by appending extensions to the  filename. The extensions are date-and-time based, using the strftime  format  or a leading portion thereof, depending on  the rollover interval.In other words: by modifying suffix you are breaking the rollover. Just leave it at default and python will create the files called:    And after this (if ) it will delete the  one and create the .If you instead want to have names like :    Where  is the newest one and  is the oldest one, then yes, that handler has not been designed to do that.
