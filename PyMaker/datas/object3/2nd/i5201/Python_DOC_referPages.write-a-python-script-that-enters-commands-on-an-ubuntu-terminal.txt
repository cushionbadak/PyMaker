I am using spyder on ubuntu 16.04.  I want to write a script that will execute several commands in the same linux terminal.First I want to open a terminal, then ssh into another computer, then enter my password, then continuing entering commands.I have tried  but this does not open a new terminal for me nor run the command I want. works but I am stuck when trying to enter my password.How can I enter commands with a Python script in this context?
If you're looking to automatically connect & login to an ssh server with a password, you can use  to enter the password, but it'd be better to use an SSH key. Github has a good tutorial on how to generate a key here.If you're looking to execute commands after SSHing into your server, you can do so with: 
For executing commands on a terminal you can use python's subprocess module. There's already a question here on how to execute multiple commands using a single terminal with subprocess.
You can use the  module along with the  command if you're using Gnome.The idea is to spawn a GUI terminal, and to execute a script into it through the  option.Here is a very simple example, on how to execute a shell script in a new terminal.Running  will spawn a new terminal, print the working directory (), print the content of that directory (), and then echo the input from  ( without arguments).
