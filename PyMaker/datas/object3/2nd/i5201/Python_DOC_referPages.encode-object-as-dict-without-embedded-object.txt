I have an object (objectname) that I am currently trying to get a dict representation of using objectname. _ _ dict _ _The object has another object embedded in it and as a result I get a "Cannot encode object error" - which makes sense I don't want this embedded object to appear in the encoded dict as it's not relevent to that output, but I do want to retain it in the object being encoded as it has use throughout the life-cycle of the object.Is there a good way to do this without deleting the sub object first?
