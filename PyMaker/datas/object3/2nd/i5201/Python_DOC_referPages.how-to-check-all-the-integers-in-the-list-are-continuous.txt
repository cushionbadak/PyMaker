I am trying to write a program which will print "YES" if all the numbers in the  are continuous and should return "NO" if the numbers are not continuous. By continuous I mean every number in the list should be greater than one from the previous element.For example:It should print "YES" for inputs: , , , .. etcIt should print "NO" for inputs: , , , .. etcI used  for this purpose.Here's my code:The code works fine but i find it redundant.Is there a better way to do it using enumerate or without using enumerate?
You don't need  in order to check the elements of your lists are continuous. You can simply achieve it via creating a function using  and  as:Same result can be achieved by  with  as (similar to  but with  and  for comparision):Above functions will return / depending upon whether your list is continuous or not.Sample run:In order to print "YES"/"NO", you may make a simple check outside the function call as:
I don't see why you need  at all, given that you never use . Try using the  block:You can also  the list with its copy shifted by one (but that, well, makes a copy):Or make this into a function:
