I have been trying to use lists so I can separate my integers into something organized (which lists are made to do, right?). Making these integers as random numbers are also makes this a little more confusing. This is what I have so far:My display is random numbers going down with my printed First List/Second List connected to every number.Second part of my assignment is to use to compare elements in the two lists in pairs, i.e., compare the first elements in both lists, compare the second elements in the both lists which has to show the larger number in each comparison. I just wanted to show  what the conclusion is as to why I need help from you all in the first place.
Your professor/teacher/whoever is testing your knowledge of the list.append() method and the zip() method.list.append() adds an element to a list. zip() yields an object that allows for iterating through multiple iterables at the same time.read the python docs.https://docs.python.org/3/ Martijn's answer is much more pythonic and elegant, although for printing the results, max() would need to be extended with a custom function to pass to map(), but I'm assuming that you don't understand list comprehension. This is the beginner's answer.
