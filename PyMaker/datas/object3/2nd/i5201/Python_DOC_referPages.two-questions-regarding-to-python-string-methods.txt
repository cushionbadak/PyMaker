This question already has an answer here:When does using swapcase twice not return an identical answer?                    3 answers                As I reviewing the standard library today, I found two questions that I did not notice before:1. What is the difference between  and ?: Return a copy of the string with its first  character capitalized and the rest lowercased.: Return a titlecased version of the string where words  start with an uppercase character and the remaining characters are  lowercase.I don't find them to be much different? And according to the python spirit:"There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do  it."NEVERMIND, I got it:Capitalize() will not put capital on the second word of the string contains more than one word.2. , in the document it mentioned:Note that it is not necessarily true that s.swapcase().swapcase() ==  s.Can somebody give an example? I couldn't think of any.
 only changes the first letter. changes the letters of each wordOk that we could have known by reading the manual. Now the really interesting part of your question: performs a  (which is slightly smarter than ) which cannot be undone in some cases (german double-s/ letter for instance):
You could have easily found the answer to this one if you had tried little harder, but here you go. only capitalizes the first character in a line. capitalizes first character of all the words in a string., well, swapcase of all the characters in the string.
