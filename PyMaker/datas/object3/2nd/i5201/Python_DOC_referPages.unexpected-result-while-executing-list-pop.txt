I'm trying to assign a = x and b = x.pop(); Albeit I'm getting unexpected assignments. Could you explain this?
You will get a = [10,11,13], b = 12.A value of x pops out after you execute 'b = x.pop()' and x changes forever i.e for the rest of the program after executing value 'b' 
Since you're referring direct list, it's popping and assigning what  left in list. If you have list as copy then try this:-
When you say a=x, both a and x are pointing to the same list, therefore modifying a will also modify x. If you say a=list(x)then a will be a separate copy of the list x.
