I am trying to print the common letters from two different user inputs using a  loop. (I need to do it using a for loop.) I am running into two problems: 1. My statement "If char not in output..." is not pulling unique values. 2. The output is giving me a list of individual letters rather than a single string.  I tried the split the output but split ran into a type error. 
You are trying to perform the Set Intersection. Python has  method for the same. You can use it for your use-case as: will return the unique characters in your string.  method will return the characters which are common in both the sets.If  loop is must for you, then you may use a list comprehension as:Above result could also be achieved with explicit  loop as:
For this kind of problem, you're probably better off using sets:
