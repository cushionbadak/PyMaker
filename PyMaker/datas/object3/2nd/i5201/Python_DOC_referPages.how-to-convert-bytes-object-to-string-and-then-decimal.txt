I am trying to convert the bytes object to . In order to achieve it, I am firstly converting it to string. Below is my function to convert it to string.Then I am calling this function as:But with this code I am getting the error as:Error has occurred: Cannot convert b'6016.0000' to Decimal
In order to get a  from  object, you need to firstly decode your  object using  function as:Or you may get the same result by passing  parameter while type-casting your bytes object to string as:As the Python's  document says:if object is a  (or ) object, then  is equivalent to Then in order to type-cast your number string  to , you may simply do:In your code, when you type-casted a bytes object using  without the  parameter, it returned you a new string having  at the start as:This behavior is also mentioned in Python's  document:Passing a  object to  without the encoding or errors arguments falls under the first case of returning the informal string representation (see also the  command-line option to Python). 
Instead of strip(), try . This makes the bytes object  a string and should work great.
