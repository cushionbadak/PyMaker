Natural Text
I learned that " is a two-character string containing  and , while  is a one-character string containing a newline. Regular expressions will often be written in Python code using this raw string notation." And the  is equivalent to  to denotes two-character string  and .I test it by printing and it worksHowever, when I tested in regexWhen I tried this, it works thoughWhy? Does this mean I have to add one more backslash when using regex to make sure it is a raw string?Reference: https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html
The reason that  works is that  is not a proper escape sequence in Python strings and Python simply treats it as a backslash followed by a "d" instead of producing a syntax error.So ,  and  are all equivalent and represent a string containing one backslash and one d. The regex engine than sees this backslash + "d" and interprets it as "match any digit".,  and , on the other hand, all contain two backslashes followed by a "d". This tells the regex engine to match a backslash followed by a "d".
