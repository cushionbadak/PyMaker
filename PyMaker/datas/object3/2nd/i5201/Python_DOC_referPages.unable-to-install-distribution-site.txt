For a course I am taking, I need to install the package(?) site into an Anaconda virtual environment. I was able to install the other requirements for the course using the commandHowever, when I ranI got the error messageThe only information about site that I can find is (https://libraries.io/pypi/site), but it does not really give much information.I am using Anaconda 4.4.0 (x86_64) and Python 3.5.3.Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!
 is internal to the Python interpreter, and is used to initialize machine-specific details of your Python installation.What's telling you that you need to install this module? Ignore it. It's wrong.
