So I'm trying to know the details of  function. First I looked at the implementation of it:https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/e76daebc0c8afa3981a4c5a8b54537f756e805de/Objects/object.c#L1450-L1477And found that the  function doesn't do any work itself, but invokes the  method of the introspected object. So how to know the implementation of it?
 is a special method, so looked up on the type, at least in Python 3:See the Special method lookup section of the datamodel:For custom classes, implicit invocations of special methods are only guaranteed to work correctly if defined on an object’s type, not in the object’s instance dictionary.This is exactly what the  function does, see the  source code:The  call there is the important part,  is looked up on the type.The  method is implemented on the  type and inherited by the function type, so the implementation is in the  function.For Python 2, the  implementation is more elaborate, and actually also delegates to other functions! For function objects, it delegates to the  function. This function consults the  of the type:where  recursively incorporates the class hierarchy attributes into the final result.
The code you're looking at is from a recent Python version, but you're testing on an old version.In the new version, an implementation  is automatically provided on all types.In the old version, objects do not have  unless it is manually provided. The implementation then takes this into account in . This is from Python 2.7: For the implementation of  in Python 3, see  in Objects/typeobject.c.
