I have a function to check for the "negative", "positive" and "zero" value in the list. Below is my function:But when I run this function, it stops after checking the value of the first number in the list. For example:I want it to continue for the entire list. In the above function, if I change every instance of  to , then it does what it should but now I don't want it to say  when the function is complete. Any ideas of where I went wrong?
 stops the control flow of your function and returns back the flow. You may use  here which will convert your function into a generator. For example:It will yield the next result every time  is called on the returned object:Or you may get all the result at once as:You can also iterate it using  loop.  loop repeatedly calls the  method until it receives a  exception. For example:For more information on , please refer: What does the “yield” keyword do?
Your issue is returning immediately on the first list element Personally, I would do like this - define the function for a value only. Not a list. Run the function over each value of the list (Python 3)
You could always just build your results in a list:Which works as follows:Or even with a conditional list comprehension:
Try thisoutput['neg', 'pos', 'pos', 'neg', 'neg', 'zero', 'pos', 'neg']
