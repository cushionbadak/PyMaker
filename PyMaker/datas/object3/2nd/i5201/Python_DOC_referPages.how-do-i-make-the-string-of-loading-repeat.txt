So I'm working on a project at school and I'm wondering how to make certain strings repeat. As an example, I made a small piece of code that has a string to that could be repeated. How do I repeat the string "loading..."? (Obviously, half the code is missing as this is just an example!)
Use a loop.
Can you define what you mean by "repeat"? If I understand the meaning of your code snippet correctly, you want "Loading..." to keep printing as long as the user is entering a "Y"?This is a great use for a while loop! I would recommend putting it into an infinite loop () and then  out when a certain condition has been satisfied.
You could either use a  statement or  statement.Also I would assume you would only want it to do this for a certain amount of time and not infinitely in which case  might also be useful.Method 1: using :This output would be: Method 2:  using :This output will be:Method 3: infinite looping:This will keep printing "Loading..." forever.
