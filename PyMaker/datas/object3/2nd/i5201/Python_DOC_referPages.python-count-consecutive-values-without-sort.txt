I am trying to build 2 different functions in Python.strip consecutive values: desired outcome:What I have tried so far: Outputs:  [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0], I could loop again but I think there is a better approach somewhere?count consecutive values and joinPseudo:  4x0, 6x1, 3x2, 2x1, 1x2, 1x1, 1x2, 2x1, 6x2, 4x1, 2x0I think I'll need the stripArray for this?Edit: SOLVED: We have 3 perfect funtioning answers! Thank you all! Your Answers couldnt be more different and i really like them all!Edit: Thank you all for contributing to the accepted answer! Also future viewers, there are different solutions to this, not all of them need imports and others are using numpy approach. Thanks to all contributors!
Try thisoutput[4, 6, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 4, 2] [0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0]
Here is one way:
Your  may look like this:I haven't understand the , so I cannot help. Maybe you should provide more detailsUPDATE:
You want to group values, so let's use :To get the second list, assuming the values are always between 0 and 9:
Following works by comparing each item of exampleArray to last added item of strippedArray: Output:For counting and joining: Output:For getting a list of integers:Output:
You can do something like this without importing any module:output:
