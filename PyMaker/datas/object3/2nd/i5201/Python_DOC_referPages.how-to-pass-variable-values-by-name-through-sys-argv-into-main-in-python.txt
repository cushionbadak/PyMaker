I need to pass arguments to my python program, something like:Basically, I need to be able to assign argument value to a variable, however, the user may pass in the arguments in any order, so I need to make sure that the proper argument value is being used in the right place in the code. Is this possible? If so, how?
If you want to stick with your current format, you could do this by use of a dictionary.Assumptions: Every variable passed in will be by the format .You know what variable names the user is supposed to put, meaning you're expecting certain variables to be declared to be used in your program and you know what names the user will give them.The code basically looks like this:Testing (filename is ):Doing this, you could also iterate over all the user's inputs, albeit dictionaries don't preserve order:Output:
Personally, I would use . See https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html for details.
You could always use  if you want to do this.Then you would do  to pass the values, instead of passing them as arguments. This sets them as environment variables, and executes your program which picks up the variables from the shell environment. This code also uses the  method to provide a default value (False in this case), so you can easily check if a variable is present or not.
You might want to look at sys.argv. In your example... =  = etcThen you could parse it out with ...
