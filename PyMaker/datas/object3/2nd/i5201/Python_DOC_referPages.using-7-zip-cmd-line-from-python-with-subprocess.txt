I am trying to run 7zip through a command line code from a Python script using subprocess library.The code below works fine when I use it directly in the command line. However, I am not capable to make it run with subprocess.The current code I am trying to execute is the following.The error message is "FileNotFoundError: [WinError 2]"Does anyone know where is my mistake?
Your environment settings (including the PATH variable) will not be passed to the subprocess. You could copy, edit and pass them like this: But why don't you just call 7-zip with it's full path instead of fiddling with the PATH variable?BTW, you can also provide the full command as a single string (on Windows, conversion to string is done anyway under the hood):
