I'm trying to figure out if it's possible to create categories using custom filters.I am building an e-commerce app and I have set up my category model using mptt. I am importing a csv that creates my top level categories which works fine. The problem is I will need to have sub-categories that are more specific e.g Men's Clothing(Top Level) > Jeans.The csv has several fields that contains info relating to each product e.g description: "stone wash bootcut jeans". I would ideally like to check these fields for keywords and add each product to the correct categories. Is it possible to set up categories this way or is there an alternative solution?I am a django newbie so any help is appreciated.models.pyimportCSV.py
So you haveManually predefined subcategories that may comprise more than one keywordSeveral text fields for each Product where it is assured that any of the keywords appears at least onceFrom this setup I would at first try to generalize the "search term" for each subcategroy, maybe by a regex, depending on the complexity of conditions that you need to identify a subcategory. Most probably a list of synonyms is already sufficient. Add such a field to your  model (here a regex solution):For your example where  and  would be equivalent (to my English knowledge these are plural words here, so not equivalent to  or  appearing anywhere), this would by (as a regex) This is the part you need define manually - I don't envy your for the tedious work involved ;)Afterwards, your import loop would need some changes around here:and hereComplete
