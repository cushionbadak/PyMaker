I want to create percentage change column for each column that is a float in my dataframe and stored it in a newn column each time with the name of the initial column and the add on "_change"     I tried this but it does not seem to work any idea?for example if my column is df["Expenses"] I would like to save the percentage change in df["Expenses_change"]Edited for adding example data frame and outputdf initiallyafter the loopkeep in mind that i have more than 2 columns on my dataframe.
Why are you using '&' instead of '+' in ?
String concatenation is performed in python via the  operator.So changing to  will fix this issue for you.You might find it helpful to read the relevant python documentation.
As it has been mentioned in other answers, just by changing & for + should do it. I was getting issues with using dots instead of square brackets so I changed them too.This code has been tested in Python 3 and it works :)Enjoy!
