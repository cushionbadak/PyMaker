I want to accept an argument with an equals sign in it:but I keep gettinghow can I avoid this? I need to useas an argument in another function, and I can't do that as a string (and I've heard using eval() is bad?)
You will need to pass optional arguments in the end and required arguments at the start.In this case, I think href will be required argument, so here if you want to pass with argument name(in your case href) then you will need to pass all arguments with name and not one of them like "href ='example.com' ""for e.g.for above method test_method,  you cant call this function as test_method(1,b=2,3) , you will need to call it as test_method(1,2,3) or test_method(a=1, b=2, c=3)But as "e" argument is optional argument you can call it as test_method(1,2,3, e=5) without bothering about value of d.
Have a look at the actual error message:You are calling  and pass a positional argument, followed by a keyword argument, followed by two more positional arguments. Python does not allow this. Have a look at the Python Glossary for the explanation of positional and keyword arguments.What you need to do is, either replace all positional arguments with keyword arguments or remove all keyword arguments (in your case: ).I'm not familiar with the code that you're using, so I'll make up some keyword arguments. This would be the case using only keyword arguments:What you could also do is:Here the last keyword argument is followed by two more positional arguments.
