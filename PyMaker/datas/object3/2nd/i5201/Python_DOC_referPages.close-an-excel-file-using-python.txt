I want to close an excel file after opening it. I searched this site but I cannot get a solution. Can anyone help?Thank you very much.
This isn't possible using . According to the os.startfile documentation:startfile() returns as soon as the associated application is launched. There is no option to wait for the application to close, and no way to retrieve the applicationâ€™s exit status.You might consider using the  module. There are a load of options depending on what exactly you're trying to do at this question: How to terminate a python subprocess launched with shell=True
