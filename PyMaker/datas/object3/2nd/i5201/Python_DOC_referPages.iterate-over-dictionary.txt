The two setups using  and  return the same result. Are there cases when oneshould be used over the other or is it correct to use them interchangeably?
Both are different if remove parenthesis in print because you are using python 2Xoutput
In Python 3,  and  does not return the same result.  prints the key  followed by it's value  prints a tuple containing the dictionary key followed by its value
 returns a view object which allows you to iterate over the  tuples. So basically you can just manipulate them as what you do with tuples. The document may help:iter(dictview)  Return an iterator over the keys, values or items (represented as tuples > of (key, value)) in the dictionary.Also I think  would result in error in Python 3 since  returns .
