I have an array of multiple even and odd numbers, how can i make this array to an arrary of odd elements, for example:odd elements ignored but even elements plus 1;this is my code :but this  contains (even elements + 1) not all elements, only 
Just set their 1-bit:Demo:
As you've correctly observed, you can convert a list of even and odd elements to only odd elements by adding  to the even elements. You also know this can be done with a list comprehension. Your code is close, but not quite right. Right now, all you're doing is filtering out any odd numbers from your new list. If the current element is not even, you need to add it to the new list:Here is what the above list comprehension produces:
You can use:This works as follows, with the condition , we check if the number is even ( if is even,  otherwise). Since  is as an integer , and  as an integer is , we thus add  to the value, given the number is even.This gives us:Or we can use bitwise operations:The result is again:
The reason your statement  does not work is: you are filtering the list and only use elements that are even - to those you add 1.processes all elements of Input_array and adds 1 to the even ones, leaves the odd ones as is. processes all elements of Input_array and adds 1 to the even ones, ignoreing all odd ones.
