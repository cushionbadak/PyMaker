I am using Python 3 within a C program. What I wish to do is "run" a single Python file (.py) which will be the main file for a larger Python project. When I use  within this Python file, it works fine for other Python files in the same directory. In fact, the  works for files in sub-directories too whenever I run the .py file using "Python" in the terminal.However, if I run it using  in C, I receive a "ModuleNotFoundError" error.Here is my directory setup:Preferably, I do not want to use  so I can use the sub-directory names within the imports.Here are the contents of all relevant files:bla.pybla2.pyProgram.cpp
You just need to addafter  (documentation). This prepends the directory that your program is in to your Python path. (This is equivalent to prepending  to the path, rather than , but it should be more reliable, for example if your program is not started from its own directory. It gets the needed information on where your program is located from C++ )It's probably a bad idea to call your module . There's a built-in Python module called , and on a case-insensitive OS like Windows that might conflict and get loaded instead.
