I have written a program for a homework assignment, that should function as a mock grocery list that will calculate how much the items should cost as well. This is the error I get:There are multiple problems with this code.I am supposed to use the  to get the price in dollar form, but I have no idea how, and the things I've tried haven't worked. There are syntax errors in my  statement. The code doesn't run through the list , and just repeats with the same input over and over.
To get a formatted print with the fields from the  you can use  like:
You have an error because you are adding string to floats. Python does not know how to do that.As @Stephen Rauch showed, you can do it in one line with a very pythonic structure. If you want you can use the syntax Which works great as well.
I assume you wanted to add items to already existing  and then calculate the grand total of all your groceries (using Stephen Rauch's printing answer).Some of what went wrong:You weren't actually asking the user to enter  or , so you just went once over the list and exited in the end because of .You were constantly overwriting your variables, for example:First line assigns string and the second - integer. You can operate directly on dict values, provided you know how to access them. This part:assigned the last actually updated  (eggs) and you did all your calculations in  loop with these two values.Here:you were appending strings and numbers to a list of dictionaries.
