What is it the best way to create a log that resume the percentage of resources (ram, cpu ...) used in each execution of python script.
I think the  library and the  function is the solution you're looking for, but it will only inform you of the memory used, not the cpu.Other option is execute a unix command like perf through a bash script and save the results.
