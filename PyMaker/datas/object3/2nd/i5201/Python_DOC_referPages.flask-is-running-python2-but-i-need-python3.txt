This question already has an answer here:installed flask successfully, still getting import error                    2 answers                I'm using Kali Linux. I wanted to make the default version of python to python3. Now it is python2. Both version(python2.7 & python3.6) is already installed.I couldn't find a way to do this. I ended up searching when someone said I shouldn't change the default versionI figured out flask isn't running python 3.6+ cause it couldn't recognize f-strings which was introduced in python 3.6. I thought maybe changing the default version of python can help me. Now I'm confused. I want to run flask apps with python 3.6+ or the latest versions. How do I do it? I ran into some of the similar questions but those couldn't help.
Just use  with Pyhton 3:It will do the job for the rightful version of Python.And always invoke your script with  to be sure you are using the proper version. You can also check with  command to understand what binary will be executed when invoking in shell:Or create an alias to python3 if you find it easier, then  will respond accordingly.
