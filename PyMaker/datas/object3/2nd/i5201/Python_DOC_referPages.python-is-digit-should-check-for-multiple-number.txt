I write small program on python just to learn how  and  functions worksProgram is:Question is what... When i type one single number  program works fine.  checks for number. (Is really list contains of number).When i type 4 (only one number - that's fine)But when i type 3 6 4 2 6 3 multiple numbers  can not check it Why?
