I have an URL template of the formI have retrieved the following fields and there around 1000000 of these records. After retrieving the record belowI need to construct this URLI am thinking of some approaches, should I construct a dictionary for this one?
You can try using :Everything surrounded with  and  in format string is called "replacement field". It ca be used with  for such formatting. More info here.
A dictionary would probably be your best bet. As an alternative, check out named tuples.
I have managed to extract the data from the file and now I have two things, a fixed set of keys and a list of different values.keys['farm-id', 'server-id', 'photo-id', 'secret', 'originalformat', 'originalsecret']values['3', '2287', '2109698205', '20fbbcc947', 'jpg', '7a57411545']['3', '2063', '2172469872', '8ddb85aedd', 'jpg', 'e12b952909']['2', '1079', '830593398', '9ddca27ab0', 'jpg', 'bb91586e56']['3', '2371', '2226919732', '248f23c5ff', 'jpg', '29f35fb0ca']['2', '1014', '798067744', '4f043d2ea6', 'jpg', 'd739cc870b']Is there a smarter way of merging these two lists into a dictionary after which I can use the formatting required to create the url
First of all, if your data is in the format you indicated you should make sure that numbers such as  can be interpreted are not interpreted in different way than you intended. For example with After you successfully imported the fields to a dictionary there are multiple ways you can use string interpolation and formatting. Apart from the  specifier mentioned in previous answer you can use the traditional  style formatting as below (note the format specifier  after the closing parentheses)You can also use Template Strings which uses the  class from the  module. This would be more familiar to bash/perl programmers. The template string is of the form below. The placeholders (within optional braces) must be valid python identifiers so it cannot contain characters such as . The first non-identifier character terminates the placeholder. With  method if any placeholder value is missing it will put the original placeholder instead of raising a key error.
