Console output from function :Good, that's what I expect. Now I want to put this in a worker pool and get it done about 4x as fast.I thought I did exactly that and correctly. Why do I not have any output?There is no console output when running  and the application returns immediately.Complete code below. Let me know if you need the source to the  wrapper or anything else.
As it states in the / documentation, each call to  or  is equivalent to one call to the function you pass as the first argument (i.e. ).In your synchronous code, you are passing each element of  to a separate  call:In your async code, you are asking the pool to compute this:This is not what you want it to do.  You need to call  in a loop, just like you called  in a loop.  Alternatively, you could use , but this only calls your callback once, with the entire list of results.  That does not appear to match what you are doing in the synchronous code, but you could rewrite your callback to fit this pattern, or use something like  as your callback for .
