I am new to coding and I have extracted data from the column of a table that look like this I then split the string by '; 'so when I try to print using I get an error due to not all the lists having a length longer than [0]. I am not sure how to get each of the elements from a dataset of varying list lengths.
Do not use direct indexing, use  over the elements of the list:or (not as good, not needed, never do this) use  to get the length of a inner list (starting at 0 up to len(l)-1 is the index):Output (for both):If you really need the index alongsinde the value, use enumeration and  decomposed index and value:Output:
