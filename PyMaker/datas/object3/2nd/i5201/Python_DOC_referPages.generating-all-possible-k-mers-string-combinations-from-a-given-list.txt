I have a string  that is composed of 20 characters: I need to generate all possible k-mer combinations from a given input k.When , then there are 8000 combinations () and the output list looks like this:When , then there are 400 combinations () and the output list looks like this: When , then there are only 20 combinations:I know how to do this if the number  is fixed, like if , then I can do this: But the number  is chosen randomly.I tried to use permutations, but it does not given me strings with repeated letters like , but maybe it can and I'm just doing it wrong. 
What you are looking for is itertools.product(). You can use  argument for the number of 's in your algorithm.Bear in mind it returns tuples of characters as default, if you want strings instead, you can join using list comprehensions as below:
You can use  and generate the random value for :
Just generate random integer V in range  where L is string length and k is length of k-mer.Then build corresponding combination
