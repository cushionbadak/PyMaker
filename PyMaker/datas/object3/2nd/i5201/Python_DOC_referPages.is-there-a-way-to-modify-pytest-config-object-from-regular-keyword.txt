Wouldn't logging module help here?You can configure log record to contain exactly the information you want e.g. module and test function in which message was logged. Logging has great features like filtering by log level, message content, writing different records to separate log files with various text formats etc.I would encourage you to take a look at:https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/logging.html
