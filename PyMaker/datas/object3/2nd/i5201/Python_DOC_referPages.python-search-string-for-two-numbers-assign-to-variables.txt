I have the following string a part of a file with lines with the same format.I need to access two specific numbers and preform math on them.  -35700.0 and 180.0.I am struggling with getting those specific values and assign them to variables. 
Just get rid of the part of the lines that are not the value and use  to get the rest as a python variable.The following line will break your string at the '=' character using  (so you will get 2 strings). It will then get the second part of your string (the one which starts after the '='), remove the final ';' character and use  to interpret the whole thing:Now you'll get a list of lists that you can extract your numbers from easily
You can split the string by the "=" and then use the ast module to convert the string list to a python list object and the use list indexing to fetch the required valueEX:Output:
