Imported module, connection_status_message.py:Try Except file, connect_to_server.py:The issue is the variable is trying to be made local. So I read up on the issue and saw how to reference a global variable:But now PyCharm is stating the import statement at the top is no longer being used.How can I get this Try/Except to use the imported variable?
