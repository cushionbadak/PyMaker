I have to multiply a list (a) with one of two other lists (b and c), but conditional on if the value in (a) is positive or negative.I do have a working solution, but it is quite slow and I would like to speed it up significantly.I believe this code in R is what I need, but don't know of a similar approach in Python. EDIT:I have applied Moinuddin Quadri's method:100000 loops, best of 3: 2.35 µs per loopWhereas my own attempt:100000 loops, best of 3: 2.97 µs per loop.So it is a slight improvement, but not huge. I have to iteratively perform this task, many times and need significant improvement...
Better way to achieve this is using list comprehension (having conditional check) with  as:
Not sure how much of an improvement this will be, but you can shorten your original approach to:
