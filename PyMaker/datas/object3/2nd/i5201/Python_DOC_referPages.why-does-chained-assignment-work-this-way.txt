This question already has an answer here:Python Assignment Operator Precedence - (a, b) = a[b] = {}, 5                    1 answer                I found the assignment  in an article.  I tried it in python3 and python2; it all works, but I don't understand how it works.   here is not like in C; C processes  by right to left.  How does python process the  operator?
Per the language docs on assignment:An assignment statement evaluates the expression list (remember that this can be a single expression or a comma-separated list, the latter yielding a tuple) and assigns the single resulting object to each of the target lists, from left to right.In this case,  has an expression list , and two "target lists",  and , where  is the left-most "target list".You can see how this behaves by looking at the disassembly:(The last two lines of the disassembly can be ignored,  is making a function wrapper to disassemble the string)The important part to note is that when you do ,  is loaded on the stack (in this case by the  and ), then the stack entry is duplicated and assigned, from left to right, to the targets given.So when you do:it makes two references to a brand new  containing , and the first action is a  one of these references to . Next, it stores the second reference to , but since the slice assignment mutates  itself, it has to load  again, which gets the  just stored. Luckily,  is resilient against self-slice-assignment, or we'd have issues (it would be forever reading the value it just added to add to the end until we ran out of memory and crashed); as is, it behaves as a copy of  was assigned to replace any and all elements from index one onwards.The end result is equivalent to if you'd done:but it avoids the use of the  name.To be clear, the disassembly annotated:Make list :Make a copy of the reference to :Perform store to :Perform store to :
The way I understand such assignments is that this is equivalent toThe resulting value of  is consistent with this interpretation.
