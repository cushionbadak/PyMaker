I have gone through numerous Sphinx tutorials, but I still can't figure out how to make Sphinx document a simple Python script like this one:Below are the steps that I make. What am I missing?Install Sphinx:Create a documentation directory within my project directory:Run  from inside of the new  directory and hit Enter to answer every question except for these two:This makes my project directory structure become this:Open , uncomment the following lines, and add the path of the folder where my code is located:Run the following command from my  directory:Which gave me the following confirmation with no errors:Now when I open C:\myproject\docs\build\html\index.html, all I see is the following and no info from the docstrings that I inserted in my original script. Clicking on Module Index gives a file not found error. Why is that?EDIT:After doing all the above steps, I added a folder  and copied the file with my code in there making the directory content look like this:I then ran the following commands from  directory:Now clicking through Module Index gives me the following:And clicking on  gives this:Now the question is why is my main script myscript.py is listed under modules and not listed on the home page of the documentations?
An  file is required to make Python treat the directories as containing packages. See Python tutorial documentation of packages.My guess is that  recognizes your script as a script, not a package, because you omitted a  file.  According to the docs for :sourcedir must point to a Python package.There's also a warning just below that in the docs:If you document scripts (as opposed to library modules), make sure their main routine is protected by a  condition.Without seeing your code, I'd start with the  file and see if that takes care of it.
