I am using the  tool so , ,  and  are not available to use by default. They would require manual creation of a C recipe for them to work with . I have no knowledge of C so not really possible.Using Python, are there any methods to download html data from a url to a variable without requiring any modules to be imported in?I don't mind if it's a longer process then required by the above modules, as I have no choice lol
urllib is a native library and it appears that buildozer has (buggy) support.More information is available in this bug report on the buildozer page!
You can use sockets:
