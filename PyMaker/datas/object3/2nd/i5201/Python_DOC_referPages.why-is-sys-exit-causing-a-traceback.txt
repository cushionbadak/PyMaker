According to How to exit from Python without traceback?, calling  in a Python script should exit silently without a traceback.However, when I launch my script from the command line on Windows 7 with , (or from Notepad++), a traceback for a  exception is displayed.Why is  displaying a traceback when run from the Windows command line?(For reference, I am using Python 3.6.4 on Windows 7)
You're running Python with the  flag.  suppresses the usual special handling of the  exception  raises; since the special handling is suppressed, Python performs the normal exception handling, which prints a traceback.Arguably,  should only suppress the "exit" part of the special handling, and not cause a traceback to be printed. You could raise a bug report; I didn't see any existing, related reports.
No exception shown:    and your program is terminated.Run with  option for interactive (inspect interactively after running script)  and the exception is shown:because the interpreter keeps running.Exit the interpreter by raising SystemExit(status).
Because under the hood,  raises a  exception.Further reading herewhat you want is:
Because you are using the -i option. Try it without that and you won't get a stack trace.
As Matt_G says,  is exactly the same as raising , which can be caught in higher level, which in your case is happening since you are using .If you want to exit without traceback, there is  which calls a "C function" and exit immediately even in  modeas @user2357112 told me,  is drastic move that exits without any cleanup. No finally,  , , , etc.
