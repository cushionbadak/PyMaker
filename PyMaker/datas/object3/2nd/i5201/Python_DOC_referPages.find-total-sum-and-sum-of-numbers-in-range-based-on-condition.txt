I want to create a function  which will compute the sum of numbers from  to , prints out this sum, but also all intermediate sums of type  that are divisible by .I want the program to work as follows:The output should look like:Now I have already done this:Ive been trying for hours. I know my code only checks what numbers between  are divisible by , but how do I make it so that the function computes and prints all the intermediate sums that are divisible by ? My first function only computes the sum of all integers in the given interval. I now want the subsequent function to compute all intermediate sums that are divisible by div in a given interval and print all of these. Thank you in advance.
Output:
You may create your custom generator to  the results as:Using above generator, you may yield one result at a time with  as:OR you may get the list of all the results in one go as:Result with commented version of code to yield total  at last:In Python 3, you can simply store the sum of intermediate values and the total sum at the end in two variables as:For older versions of Python, you need to do:
Hereâ€™s my implementation
