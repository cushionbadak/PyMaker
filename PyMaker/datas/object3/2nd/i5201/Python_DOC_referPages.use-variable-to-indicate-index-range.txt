This question already has an answer here:Slicing a list using a variable, in Python                    4 answers                I want to create a list containing indices that would be used to get elements from another list.A simple case:I want to then do something likeWhich would be like saying C = A[2:4]I want to later extend this to multidimensional arrays, where e.g b = [2:4, 5:6] and I can simply call A[b] to extract a multidimensional array out of A.
You can define  as a  object to achieve this:Regarding your other requirement I think if you create a list object containing 2  objects then it should achieve what you want:
You can either use straight python using e.g. slice:But this does not scale very well to nd-arrays. To do this, I'd recommend using numpy's  function which does exactly what you are looking for, without the need of explicitly constructing a  for each axis.This extends nicely to e.g. 2d arrays:
