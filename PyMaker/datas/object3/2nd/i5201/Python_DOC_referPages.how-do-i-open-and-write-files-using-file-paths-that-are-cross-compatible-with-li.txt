This question already has an answer here:Why do I get a SyntaxError for a Unicode escape in my file path?                    7 answers                How do I open and write files using file paths that are cross-compatible with Linux, Mac, and Windows in Python 3?I made an function that opens an input_file containing the following line, "Hello World." The functions then opens an output_file and writes that line to the output_file. The output file should now have the line, "Hello World."However, I get a UnicodeError when trying to use the absolute file paths.I tried using os.chdir, os.path, forward slashes for the file paths, double slashes for the file path, and raw strings but none of this worked.After looking at previous answers to the question Why do I get a SyntaxError for a Unicode escape in my file path?, using os.chdir gives me the error:Furthermore, those answers will only work for Windows machines, not Linux or Mac machines.What should I do to make sure that my function can open any file and write to any file on Linux, Mac, and Windows machines?
Always use forward slashes so that you don't accidentally introduce invalid escape sequences such as "\Users".
