Is there a simple way to append an integer to each item in an itertools iterator? If I use , I do not receive the expected output. For example: But I would expect (and I want) is I know that I can "flatten" the output, but I would rather construct the iterator to produce tuples, not tuples of tuples. I have many different iterators floating around, and I want to keep the code the same for s of itertool iterators and plain itertool iterators
These two alternatives each produce an iterator. In the first case, the iterator is created by a generator expression. In the second, the iterator is created by the use of a generator function.A generator function might be more readable at the call site, especially if the function name describes its behavior.
