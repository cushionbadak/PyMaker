I have tried to use the datetime code but i really don't understand it very much. I have managed to allow the user to input a date but i am not quite sure how to compare the dates. Here is what i have so far.I really have no clue how to compare the two please help me. if you have any suggestions for code that might be on this site please tell me. In the meantime i will keep trying to research.
you can try this one :for your second condition you can use  for the year of entered date and  for current year. With that you can write condition according to your need .remaining all code is same UPDATE :it will again ask to enter date if  or 
In your case, you should use calendar.
