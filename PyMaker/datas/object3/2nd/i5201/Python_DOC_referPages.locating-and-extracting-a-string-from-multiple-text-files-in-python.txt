Natural Text
I am just picking up and learning Python, For work i go through a lot of pdfs and so I found a PDFMINER tool that converts a directory to a text file. I then made the below code to tell me whether the pdf file is an approved claim or a denied claim. I dont understand how I can say find me the string that starts with "Tracking Identification Number..." AND is the 18 characters after that and stuff it into an array?Any help would be appreciated. this is what the text file looks likeupdate: Many helpful answers, here is the route I took, and is working quite nicely if I do say so myself. this is gonna save tons of time!! Here is my the entire code for any future viewers.Update: Added the rest of my finished code, Writes the lists to a CSV file where i go execute  some =left()'s and such and boom I have 1000 tracking numbers in a matter of minutes. This is why programming is great.
If your goal is just to find the "Tracking Identification Number..." string and the subsequent 18 characters; you can just find the index of that string, then reach where it ends, and slice from that point until the end of the subsequent 18 characters.You can also modify the append line into  or things like that.
Regular expressions are the way to go for your task. Here is a way to modify your code to search for the pattern. Explanation: Looks behind the capturing group to find the string "Tracking Identification Number" matches one or more dots () (we strip these out after) matches 18 instances of (capital or lowercase) letters or numbers More on Regex.
I think this solves your issue, just turn it into a function. If you want to read the documentation it is here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.search
