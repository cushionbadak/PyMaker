I'm trying to create a  object from a json string (not a file):but this approach causes the following error:The documentation makes it sound like this would be possible:pandas.read_json(path_or_buf=None, orient=None, typ='frame', dtype=True, convert_axes=True, convert_dates=True, keep_default_dates=True, numpy=False, precise_float=False, date_unit=None, encoding=None, lines=False, chunksize=None, compression='infer')Convert a JSON string to pandas objectpath_or_buf : a valid JSON string or file-like, default: None  The string could be a URL. Valid URL schemes include http, ftp, s3, and file. For file URLs, a host is expected. For instance, a local file could be file://localhost/path/to/table.jsonI've already tried calling the method with several combinations of  and none succeeded. Any tips on how to accomplish this? I really don't want the overhead of saving my string to a file to be able to use  successfully.
