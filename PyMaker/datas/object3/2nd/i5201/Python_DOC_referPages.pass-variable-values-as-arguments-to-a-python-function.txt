I am trying pass variable values as arguments to a function which I am calling with in a for loop. Somehow before calling the function when I print the variable values they are showing fine but they are not getting passed into function as I am getting Index out of range :0 which means nothing is passed. Researched with no use...your help is really appreciated.Code is:createCluster:Error:
You are not extracting the arguments passed to your method properly. In Python, you simply just use the arguments that you defined in your method like this: The above will output For your issue on your usage of  that you are incorrectly using:Snippet from the documentation on sys.argv:The list of command line arguments passed to a Python script.In example of this would be when calling your code from a shell prompt:python your_script.py a b cInside  you will ahveWhich will output: So, you see here that it ends up giving you the name of the script and all arguments. This is maybe where your confusion came from between calling a script and calling the method in the script.
