What type of Python data structure is represented by "< >", like this.I came across this while working with the Flask-SQLAlchemy library for Python3. See code below.
It's not a data structure. This is just how Flask-SQLAlchemy represents an instance of your model as a string with :It's a whole lot more useful than the default :You can put whatever you want in , but it's usually best to unambiguously represent your object as a string:I've often seen the  string used for object representations that aren't valid Python code, as many other built-in objects' esentations are valid Python code that reconstructs an equivalent object.
It's not Python syntax, but it is part of the default string representation for objects, e.g.In your case, it looks like the implementers of the library have adopted this convention as well.
