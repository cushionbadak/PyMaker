This question already has an answer here:Getting a list of values from a list of dicts                    7 answers                I have this JSON file where the amount of id's sometimes changes (more id's will be added):I have this python code that has to print all the values of ids:I have to use variables, because i want to show the values in a dropdown menu. Is it possible to save the values of the id's in a more efficient way? How do you know the max amount of id's of this json file (in de example 4)?
 is a simple list, so you can iterate over it as such:To store them in a variable, you'll need to output them to a list.  Storing them each in a separate variable is not a good idea, because like you said, you don't have a way to know how many there are.
You can get the number of  (which is the number of elements) by checking the  of :A clean way to get all the  values is storing them in a . You can achieve this in a pythonic way like this:Using this approach you don't even need to store the number of elements in the original , because you iterate through all of them using a  approach, essentially.If the pythonic approach troubles you, you can achieve the same thing with a classic  approach doing so:Or you can do with a classic , and here is where you really need the length:This last is the classic way, but I suggest you to take the others approaches in order to leverage the advantages python offers to you!You can find more on this stuff here!Happy coding!
