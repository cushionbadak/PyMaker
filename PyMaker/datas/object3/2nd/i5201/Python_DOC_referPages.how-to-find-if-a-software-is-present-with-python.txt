This question already has an answer here:Check if a program exists from a python script [duplicate]                    9 answers                I have a python code that call a gpg command with  to decrypt some files as part of a larger file management pipeline.  However, on my MacOS 10.11.6, I have a version of gpg2 that I use to decrypt files.So Iâ€™d like to add in the script some check of whether gpg or gpg2 are present on the machine. I tried to test a call for gpg and catch a possible OSError with:But this doesn't work even if gpg is not present and the output of the  call is:Any idea of how I can do this?(PS: I have no clue what the 32512 is...)
Like the  documentation has been telling you for I think 10+ years now, use  instead.In recent versions of Python, you probably want to prefer  over the somewhat clunky legacy API functions.
From python docs about :Execute the command (a string) in a subshell. This is implemented by calling the Standard C function system(), and has the same limitations. Changes to sys.stdin, etc. are not reflected in the environment of the executed command.So this is not the command to use. You should use os.popen which is now deprecated and substituted by subprocess module.This answer is a valid example of what you're looking for.
