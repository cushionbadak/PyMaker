Natural Text
I could see a space popping up by default if I use '\n' in python 3x. Could someone please help me in removing it?Appreciate your help in advance!sample code:OutputExplanationThe second line of the output starts with a space. Why is this happening?
As stated in the Python3 documentation, the print() function does as follows:Print objects to the text stream file, separated by sep and followed by end. sep, >end, file and flush, if present, must be given as keyword arguments.Therefore, there's a number of ways to solve your issue:1. Use the sep keyword argument, removing the default space separator.2. Use the .format() function.3. Use two print statements.All of these options will output:Although all three are valid implementations, I'd personally choose option two as I feel it's a cleaner and more logical solution.  Hope this helps!
By consulting the documentation: https://docs.python.org/3.0/whatsnew/3.0.html#print-is-a-functionYou can see that in Python3 the  function uses a space separator to print the arguments passed to it.To change this behavior you can use  as:
The comma adds in the space. There is a difference in-between:andCheers,Sebastian
separates its arguments by spaces. You may use two prints and omit the explicit newline :or you concatenate the strings:or you use a format
Comma is creating space replce it as
The comma is causing the space. Use the  sign to concatenate like this:outputs:
You are using a comma separator between variables. () which by default has a space separator. The recommended ways would be:Use : Use  instead of :
