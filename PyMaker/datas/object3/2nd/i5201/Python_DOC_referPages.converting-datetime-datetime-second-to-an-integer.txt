I'm trying to convert  to an integer in Python 3. I would like to round this value and then use the integer value in the function  where ,  and  represent integers. I'm currently getting an error message which reads as such:Below is a snippet of my code which shows what I'm trying to do.Please could someone explain why this type conversion does not work, what is  actually returning and what solutions there are to my problem.I expected the code to return the number of seconds in the current time. E.g if it is 10:29:34 when the code is run I expected  to be set to 34. I was trying to round the number of seconds to  or . So in this case I expected to round the number of seconds to , then get the value for  and  and store them in  and  respectively. Then put those values in  and display that time later in my code.
 does not give you the current time. It is not an object you generally want to use; it is an implementation detail of the  class.To get the current time as a  object, use the  function, then use the  method on the returned  instance:Demo:If you need to manipulate these values, you can use the  method to create a new  instance with the updated value.So to round your seconds value, you could use:To be precise, ,  and  are descriptor objects, letting you access the internal information of a  instance; it is these objects that make the attributes ,  and  on instances of the  class:
