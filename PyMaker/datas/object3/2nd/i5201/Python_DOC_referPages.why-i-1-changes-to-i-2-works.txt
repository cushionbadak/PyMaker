It's my first time to ask a question here.I try to get players whose height is above 200 centimeters but I don't know why it doesn't work until I adjust  to , and I still don't know why it works.By the way, I try to use  loops but not  loops to write this code.Thanks in advance!
Restructure with a  loop and specify only when you want to do something:Or use a list comprehension:The problem with your code is that when it hits ,  does not increment as the next iteration of the loop begins. Read up on  here. Here's how you would do it with a  loop:
Your problem is that you end up in an infinite loop due to the following bit of code:When you change to  this problem still exists but you happen to avoid getting stuck in it. This is because you only process the even-indexed elements. Each of these has a value over  so your code never gets to the  statement.Try:
If you insist on using while loop here is another, clean, alternative:This works because players evaluates to false when it is empty . And in every step we are popping away an item. However, after running the loop, players is an empty list.
Before adding  i += 1 to i += 2 and not understanding what it means just think what you are trying to do. You want to get values from the array right? i.e.So increment i accordingly. Sometimes the easiest way to write code is to first say out loud in your head or write it in simple english.You want to loop over values of the arrayYou want to then check if the value matches somethingIf it does print itIf it doesn't don't print it and then move on to the next valueKeep doing it till you have checked every value in the arrayNow writing code makes sense right?The easiest way to understand increment is to write it like this
simplest way to achieve what you're after in the future
