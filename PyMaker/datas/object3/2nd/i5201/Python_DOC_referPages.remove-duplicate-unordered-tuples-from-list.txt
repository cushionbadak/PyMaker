In a list of tuples, I want to have just one copy of a tuple where it may be (x, y) or (y, x).So, in:the result should be:This list of tuples is generated using  but I want to remove the duplicates.My working solution:How can this be improved?
You could use combinations_with_replacementThe code for combinations_with_replacement() can be also expressed as a subsequence of product() after filtering entries where the elements are not in sorted order (according to their position in the input pool)
This is one solution which relies on sparse matrices. This works for the following reasons:  An entry in a matrix cannot contain two values. Therefore, uniqueness is guaranteed.Selecting the upper triangle ensures that (0, 1) is preferred above (1, 0), and inclusion of both is not possible.
edit I just realized, your solution matches my solution. What you are doing is just fine. If you need to do this for a very large list, then there are some other options you may want to look into, like a key value store.If you need to remove dupes more programatically, then you can use a function like this:running this results in
