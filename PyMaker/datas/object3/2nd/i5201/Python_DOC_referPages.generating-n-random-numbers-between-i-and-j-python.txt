I want to create a random number using n numbers which are between i and j. For instance, for n=10 and i=1 and j=5, such an output is expected: . I did it in R using this code:I want to do the same in Python. I found  but it generates 1 number and I don't want to use loops.update:i and j are integers between 0 and 9, while n could be any integer. i and j decide which number can be used in the string while n indicates the length of the numeric string.
If I understand your question (not sure I do), and you have Python 3.6, you can use :
The random.choices() function does what you want:
If you consider list-comprehensions being loops (which they actually in many ways are) there you will not be satisfied with this but I will try my luck:Notes:The result is a string! If you want an integer, cast to . works incluselively; the  () and  () might be produced and returned. If you do not want that, modify them ( and )Is there a reason you are using  (and subsequently ) and not simply ?
