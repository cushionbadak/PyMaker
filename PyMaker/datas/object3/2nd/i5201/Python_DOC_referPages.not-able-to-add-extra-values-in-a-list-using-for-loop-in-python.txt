I need to write a function takes one argument, a list of strings, and returns a single string which is an HTML list. For example, if the function should produce the following string when provided the list ['first string]', 'second string'], the result should be like thisCode that i am using isIt is throwing the errorcode raised an exception, "'list' object has no attribute 'strip'".Can anyone please tell the correct way to achieve result
Your code doesn't run with any errors when I try it. It outputs this:Have you tried isolating just this function from everything else in its environment and testing it all by itself? The error is probably coming from somewhere else besides this script.If you want a html list, then using a python list won't work, instead use python strings.This should outputIf you want your whitespace (new lines, indents) to look nice, then you can add "\n" for a new line, and spaces to indent:
Your code cannot throw that error.Please check again... You have not used strip() in the code anywhere.For more neatness to get every list item in new line, modify your code as:
Your code does not throw an error (you aren't even calling ), however it does return a  of the lines, rather than one  as you asked for.To get the , you can do it in one line:which you should be able to see, works:why?The first step is to create a  that will yield each string in  - surrounded with  tags. This can be done really simply using a :Note that I have used a  for this example, but the solution uses a  as they are more efficient in terms of memory.We then want to join each of these modified strings together with one new-line () and a tab () between each element. This can be done really easily with  which works in the following way:The final step is to add the  tags around this string which is formed and that gives us the final result of something like:which, when passed into , will give you the right output.
