I am trying to make a module that generates a tkinter window and then packs a question with a set of answers. My issue is getting the algorithm to produce the sets of question and answers one after the other. What I mean by this is that the algorithm currently only packs the answer sets and doesn't wait until after the player has answered to refresh and produce a new set. I have been thinking about this for ages and I am new to tkinter so I don't know what I am doing. My code is below:This is my code for checking if an answer is correct or notThis is my code that produces the answer sets and packs them into the window:
I'm not sure understanding what you want but i guess it is something like :when the user start the programm -> Display one question and some anwserswhen the user clic on an anwser -> Display one other question and some other anwsersSo you must call the code that display the set of question inside your check_answer function.e.g. :
