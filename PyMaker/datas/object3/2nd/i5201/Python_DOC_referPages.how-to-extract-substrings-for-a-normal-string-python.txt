Natural Text
I am looking for a way to extract a part of a string (I think they are called substrings). I have looked for a solution, but haven't found one. Here is an example:`                                                                      For example if I typed in , how would I get just the  part? The type of substring I would like to have extracted is the operation and the two numbers surrounding it. I would also like it to be flexible in a way that it could find 3*4 or 3 times 4. My Python version is 3.6.4 and I am using a Mac.

There are many ways to accomplish this, one option is to  use the re module to identify the first numerical digit () and then capture the remainder () as the substring:output:
