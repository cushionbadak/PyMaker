Use .lower() 
In Python3.3+, you should prefer .From the docs:Return a casefolded copy of the string. Casefolded strings may be used for caseless matching.Casefolding is similar to lowercasing but more aggressive because it is intended to remove all case distinctions in a string. For example, the German lowercase letter 'ß' is equivalent to "ss". Since it is already lowercase, lower() would do nothing to 'ß'; casefold() converts it to "ss".The casefolding algorithm is described in section 3.13 of the Unicode Standard.
