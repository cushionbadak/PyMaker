For file:and so forth, I have created a function that would calculate the average of grade of each following year. However, what I found was that instead of getting a list at the very end, I am continuously getting a tuple. I have to get a list instead of tuple to pass the assertion test. This function actually gives meYear,  Grade2000,  832001,  882002,  952012,  99Something similar to this. It gives me the average of each year. However, it should be in orderly fashion (according to years), so I have done the last step. Should pass this:years_answer = [i+2000 for i in range(0,5)]    assert_equal(years, years_answer)The error I am getting:Any suggestions in fixing such problems? 
Choose one of the following:- 1.  in place of  2. Use  3. Use  4. Use  Separately I don't understand your statement . As per the code and the error in OP function actually gives you  and Let's understandFirst let us see what zip does. Let us split the above statement into smaller steps...at the end of  is iterator on tuples.after sorting..now re-zip the tuples..Now finally when you do...At this point  and  are tuples not lists.
You need to change the final line that  :to one where they are explicitly converted to :This will work as   an  of  when what you want is . We know this from :zip(*iterables)Make an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables.
