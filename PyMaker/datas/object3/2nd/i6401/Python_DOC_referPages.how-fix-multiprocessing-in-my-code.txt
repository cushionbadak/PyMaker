Without multiprocessing my code brute-forced my test-site in 8 seconds (4 logins\100 passwords).With  it took 115 seconds instead.
NB: processes are the wrong tool for input/output related speedup. See this discussion.You joined the process inside the loop, so the code is completely serial (each process completes before the next one is created). You need to move the s into a separate loop.To let the  module handle this for you, look into using a pool instead of creating the processes manually. However, as mentioned above, you probably want a thread pool, not a process pool, in which case you should look here.As requested, an example of using a pool:
