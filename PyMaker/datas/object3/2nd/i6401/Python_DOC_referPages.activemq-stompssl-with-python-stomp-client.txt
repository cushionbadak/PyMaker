Can anyone explain me how to add SSL to the Python STOMP client I'm using.I added the stomp+ssl transport connector in the ActiveMQ configuration file and my basic Python STOMP client is below:I created the key store and trust store given in the http://activemq.apache.org/how-do-i-use-ssl.html docs and added them to the  environment variable in the broker but I'm unable to find how to initialize the Python STOMP client with the key store and trust store. Should I use the SSL paraments given in the  method, and if yes how to do so?Can anyone please explain if there is any other way to add SSL over STOMP?
The Python STOMP client (as of version 4.1.20) uses an  to process its key pair/certificate, so there is no reason to produce a Java KeyStore for the client.With this in mind, let us go through the entire process of setting up ApacheMQ to support SSL-wrapped STOMP connections. The process below has been tested on ApacheMQ 5.15.4. We explicitly set up two-way trust by manually moving self-signed certificates between the broker and client; using a certificate authority is also possible but how to do so is a different question.Create a client certificateAs mentioned above, on the Python side of things, a KeyStore will have little use, and since  expects PEM encoded certificates, we might as well create the key pair and certificate by hand (that is, using ). First, on the client machine, let us create a 4096-bit RSA key:Using this, turn the public key part into a certificate and sign it with the key itself; since we will be manually moving the certificate to the broker, self-signing the certificate is not an issue:The STOMP client will need both the signed certificate, , and the private key, , while the broker will only need the certificate.Create a broker certificateOn the broker, we can follow the first part of the Apache guide and use the Java  to create a KeyStore with a key for the server:When prompted for "first and last name", provide the hostname of the server, which in our example we will take simply to be ; if the broker and client are running on different servers, make sure that this is set to whatever the Python client will end up using to identify the broker:All other input values can be left as "Unknown".      At the end of the day, we will only want to allow connections to the broker from clients with certificates that we know, so at this point copy the  generated above to the broker and add it to a trust store throughIf the broker is to allow connections from any client, then this final step can be skipped.Setting up ApacheMQBy default, all connections through STOMP (and indeed all connections) are plaintext ones, and in order to enable STOMP connections over SSL, add the following  to :Make sure to remove any existing plaintext connectors such as the default STOMP connector as otherwise clients will be able to simply use those and bypass the SSL requirement. Note also that  is what forces client certificate validation; without this, clients are able to connect without providing a trusted certificate.To configure ApacheMQ to use the key and trust stores defined above, define the environment variable  through (on Unix)or (on Windows)Here, the two passwords are those chosen after running  in the previous step. If client certificate validation is not desired, simply leave out the configuration of  and .With this, ActiveMQ can be started as usual through . To make sure that the SSL configuration matches expectation, pay attention to the  part of the output printed when starting the server.Testing the STOMP clientWith the broker properly set up, we can configure the client as well. Here, we provide  with references to the key and certificate created in the first step. Assuming that the ActiveMQ server is running on localhost:61613, your test script simply becomesTo make sure that ApacheMQ is indeed validating the client certificate, we could repeat step 1 and create a new pair, / say, and use that instead. Doing so should result in the following non-sensical error message being printed by ApacheMQ:Validating the broker certificateNow, the attentive reader will have noticed that we never actually moved the broker certificate to the client, and yet things seem to work regardless. As it turns out, the default behavior of  is to perform no certificate validation at all, allowing an (active) attacker to MITM the connection.As we are rolling self-signed certificates, all we need to do to fix this situation is to provide the actual broker certificate to the Python client. On the broker, export the certificate throughand move  to the Python client. Now, in the test script above, include the certificate by replacing the SSL configuration withAs above, we can test that this is indeed performing the proper validation by repeating the broker certificate generation process to create a , use that in the test script, and note that it will fail with an
