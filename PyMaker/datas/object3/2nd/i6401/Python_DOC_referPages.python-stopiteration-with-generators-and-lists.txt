Following Jean's answer to my question on: Python converting strings in a list to numbers , I get a  exception when running the below minimal code. and  are empty.From googling I think I may need a while loop around the line in traceback but I'm not sure how to remedy?Traceback:Sample data in CSV file:Minimal Code:
A list comprehension is not a generator or iterator itself. It will not stop when the expression side raises a  exception. The iterable that  loops over can use  to communicate to the  loop that iteration is done, but that doesn't extend to the rest of the construct.If you need to get at most  number of elements from an iterator, use :It'll take up to  elements when iterated over, or less if there are not enough elements in .An earlier revision of the post you linked to tried to pad out the result with  values in case there were fewer than  elements by giving  a default value. I'd have used  and  to achieve this:The  part will endlessly add  values after  is exhausted.  takes  elements from that sequence.Demo:Note that you can't read from a CSV file twice in a row, not without rewinding the file object first. Your code is using  in two locations, but the  file object does not go back to the start. Add  before trying to read from it again.
