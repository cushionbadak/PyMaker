I am trying to read a csv file into a dictionary using this codethe csv file contains thisI am trying to create the dictionary so that each value from the first column indexes a value of a certain type in the second column. e.g, 1 would be an integer, True would be a boolean, False would be boolean, no_cursor would be a string, etc.However, when I run my code, all the values saved into the dictionary is automatically converted into a string.Any help on this would be greatly appreciated!
If you want more fine-grained control over how to parse the strings to types, for example if you had some custom objects, you'll need a different approach, but you can use  to cover all the basic builtin types. Basically it does  but safely, converting an arbitary string into an appropriate type. Read more here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast.literal_eval
