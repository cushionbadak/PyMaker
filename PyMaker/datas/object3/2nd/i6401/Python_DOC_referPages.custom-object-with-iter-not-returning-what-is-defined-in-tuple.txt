[closed]                    1 answer                In a custom object with  defined, when calling , it returns the data of  in tuple form, but I want it to return from .This is a really big class, and I don't want to paste it here. I instead wrote a smaller example of my problem.If you need to see all of my code, ask, and I'll put it in a Pastebin. I just wanted to save you the effort of sorting through all of those extra methods.Does  override the  type? For some reason I can't get it to change to return what it should from .Thanks in advance.
