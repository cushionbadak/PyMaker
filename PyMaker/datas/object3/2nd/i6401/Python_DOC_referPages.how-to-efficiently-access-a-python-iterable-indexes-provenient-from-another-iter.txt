I have a list  and a list  where there are some shuffled indexes.I want to have a new list  such thatThe issue is that i have to do this multiple times, for such big . There is any more efficient approach than the list-by-comprehension for loops?Note:  solutions are apreciated!
Since  accepts multiple indices, one solution is:The efficient one (as posted in comments) would be via 's array indexing:but only if  and  are converted to  once (ahead of use) and used many times.Performance testsIndexing  elements () from a list of  elements ().1) List comprehension ~ 34 µs2)  ~ 16.6 µs3) , arrays converted on fly ~ 31.6 ms   ⇒   slowest4) , arrays pre-converted ~ 1.72 µs   ⇒   fastest
Convert your lists to NumPy arrays and use the second as the index for the first:
