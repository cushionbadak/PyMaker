What are the changes that i have to make in this code in order to open a .zip file instead of .gz?
According to the gzip documentation, there's no simple or immediate way to do this:The GzipFile class reads and writes gzip-format files, [...]  Note that additional file formats which can be decompressed by the gzip and gunzip programs, such as those produced by compress and pack, are not supported by this module.A possible workaround could be the use of the zipfile module, which does indeed support  files, and put together a custom  function to open ,  and generic filesas a note, I used the  and  constructor because, according to their respective documentations (zipfile, gzipfile) they are both functionally equivalent to , which is not implementd in .
