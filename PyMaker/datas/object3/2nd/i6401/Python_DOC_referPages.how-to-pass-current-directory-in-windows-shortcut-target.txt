So I have a Python program written, and what I am trying to do is to create windows shortcut to the program, and making sure that when running the shortcut, not only the software is ran but also the current directory that the shortcut is at would be passed as , so that I could do something to it in the program. I know that for windows shortcut, you can do something like this:to pass in arguments to the target. I am wondering how could I make it work for my specific case? So for example, if we put the shortcut at Desktop, and run the shortcut, the Python software would start with .
You can specify the current directory for the executed application in a .LNK, that is the normal way to do things if you depend on a specific directory.If you for some reason actually need to get information about the .LNK you must call the GetStartupInfo Windows function (with ctypes I assume) and if the  bit is set in  then  contains the path to the .LNK the user used to start the application.
