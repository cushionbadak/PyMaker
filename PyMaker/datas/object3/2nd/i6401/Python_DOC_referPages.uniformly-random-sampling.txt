My problem is as follows, I have 4 playing cards face down in front of me. There is a King, Queen, Jack, and Ace. I pick a card, look at it, then put it back face down in front of me. I'm trying to simulate picking 3 cards 1000 times (you can pick the same card multiple times) i.e. one sample of 3 can be Jack, Jack, and King. I've tried to do that here:All this does is print out 1000 iterations of picking 3 cards, but it never picks the same card twice, which it should.What I wanna do is count how many times I pick 3 unique cards and then calculate the probability of doing so.Then I want to calculate the average number of different cards I pick each trial. I know it will help to add values to a list, but I'm not sure how to go about it. Apologize for formatting, I'm inexperienced.
This should give the desired output
Does this look like what you are looking?
Monte-Carlo can be confusing â€” at least for me. My first step was to try out code that would produce samples of three cards. I set  to 10.The output was this. Obviously this is no guarantee that I was successful but it appears that it's possible for the code to produce all possibilities. I could try increasing  if I had any real worries.You want to count uniques. This might be most conveniently done by converting  to a  and taking its . Calculating an average is easy.A dictionary is not a bad place to keep counts. Initialise it outside the loop and then increment entries.When I'm experimenting I often try increasingly large values of N in hopes of seeing convergence.
