Natural Text
I am working on to write a Python function  that takes a value  and a number . Then the value  is put inside a , which is put in another list, and so on, up to n levels. For example:should return:
You can try this,
You may write a recursive function to achieve this as:Sample Run:Note: There is a maximum recursive limit allowed for the Python interpreter stack. This limit prevents infinite recursion from causing an overflow of the C stack and crashing Python.You can check this value using  function which as per the doc:Return the current value of the recursion limit, the maximum depth of  the Python interpreter stack. This limit prevents infinite recursion  from causing an overflow of the C stack and crashing Python. It can be  set by setrecursionlimit().
This is a recursive solution, it pretty much comes naturally from the problem definition:
