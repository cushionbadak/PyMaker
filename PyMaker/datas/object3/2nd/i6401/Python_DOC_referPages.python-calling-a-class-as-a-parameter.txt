To use a button I write in code ,  and so on. is same for all buttons.Buttons ( amount and type ) are selected by user (stored in ) and not known in advance.I wish to know if there is a way writing code more efficiently rather than:and so on.by efficiently I mean something like:thnks
You can use the  built-in function to access attributes of an object using strings:Return the value of the named attribute of object. name must be a string. If the string is the name of one of the objectâ€™s attributes, the result is the value of that attribute. For example,  is equivalent to . If the named attribute does not exist, default is returned if provided, otherwise AttributeError is raised.As mentioned by @MadPyhisist, modules are not some kind of magical object, and thus can be used with like any normal object could be .
You could define a dictionary (preferably inside your module):and then call the entry:If your button classes have a function returning their name, you could also define the dictionary like this:More advanced: Python stores the name of a class in .Even more advanced: You could get the elements of the module with . But this might impair readability.
