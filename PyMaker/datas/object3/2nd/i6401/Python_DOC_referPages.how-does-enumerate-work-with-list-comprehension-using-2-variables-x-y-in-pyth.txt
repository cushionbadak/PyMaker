Why does this not iterate?Output:Docs:https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#forhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerateRun online: http://goo.gl/75yuAd
Any iterator is "one-shot" in sense that, when it is fully executed, it becomes empty and can't be used anymore. When you called , you have used it in the list() function and so exhausted it. So, the following attempt to use it in  cycle gives nothing.With modified code when enumerate() is called again after this debug, the script behavior gets changed - it raises IndexError on ; I won't fix this for you but this is enough sign that cycle body begins being executed.
Because  returns an iterator:Once the end is reached,  raises a  exception:Thus you cannot iterate twice over . You will have to recreate the iterator.
this line : consumes the iterator, so when you get here: is already exhausted.
try this instead:
