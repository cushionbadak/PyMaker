I have a large file in my FTP, and I need to write it to google cloud storage.My first thought would be download it from ftp to local file, and then transmit local file to remote storage. But I would prefer to do it without downloading it localy.So far I came up with the following code: But I get: Is there a way to pipe data from ftp to cloud storage (or any other remote resource) without downloading it to local machine? I am using python 3.6.
I think you can achieve what you want, without python, using rclone. If you must use python, maybe they provide a wrapper or you could use  module.
