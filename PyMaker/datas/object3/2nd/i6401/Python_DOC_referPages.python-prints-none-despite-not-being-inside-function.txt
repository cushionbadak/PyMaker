So I'm still relatively new to Python programming and so at the moment I'm just trying to create a simple password program. If the use has opened the program before, then it will skip the create a password bit. I have done this by creating a file which will contain the number of times the file has been opened. If the number is less than 1 then it will ask for the new password. This bit works fine, I just have the problem that when running the following code, "None" is printed. I understand the whole function return bit but the code I'm using isn't in a function so I'm not sure why it is happening. Would really appreciate help in fixing this!
You are doing that, in fact: you are passing the result of  to . There's no need to do that.
