I'm working on a simple negative index listing while loop for class and I don't understand why it's not working correctly.Instead of printing:4321I'm getting:1432Any help pointing out what I'm doing wrong would be greatly appreciated.Thank you in advance!Professor's exercise:My coding:Professor's test:
You just have a couple of off-by-one errors. And as I said in the comment, , so  is the same as , i.e., it accesses the first item in .Here's a repaired version of your code.outputAs Davis Herring mentions, it's more Pythonic to iterate directly over the items in a sequence rather than doing it indirectly via indexing. OTOH, it's important to do exercises like this that practice using indices to develop your understanding of how indices work.
Using a  loop with : is used to generate the index starting from 1. We don't need the values from the list that  returns, so they are bound to  to indicate that we don't care. Using  is a little cleaner than using , although it will execute a little slower.With a  loop you can start your counter from 1 instead of 0:
-0 is still 0.  As such, backward indexing is 1-based (or -1-based, perhaps).  You can write directlyor indirectly (with fewer -1s)or, much more Pythonically when it's not homework,
