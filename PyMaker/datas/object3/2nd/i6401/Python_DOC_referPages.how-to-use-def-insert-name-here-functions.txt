I'm new to python and had a question about to to use more functions in a code besides def main():My code below works, but I am trying to add new def's to their respective areas. So like a new def called (def calcPay():), to where the hours enter are calculated (regPay, overtimePay, and total) as 3 separate items. &Also add a new def called (def displayOutput():), the function would receive all three of the values from (overtimePay, regPay, and totalPay) and print the message below.If someone could explain to me how to use new functions besides main, that would be greatly appreciated.Thanks, here is my code:
You can declare your functions outside of the main function declaration and then use them in the main function (or inside of other functions in the main function).So you could do something like:
Have a look at these similar questions:What does it mean to call a function?How to correctly define a function?Basic explanation of Python functions?There's nothing special about the function named . You can name functions whatever you want.When you "call" a function you're just jumping from one block of code to another. When the function returns it goes back to the line that called it.In your example a good use of a function would be to calculate the employee's pay.This function allows us to define the three things that determine a worker's pay.  The  will be, at most, the number of hours before overtime is applied. The  will be from 0 to "some other limit" that's not defined here. Overtime is given time and a half ().
