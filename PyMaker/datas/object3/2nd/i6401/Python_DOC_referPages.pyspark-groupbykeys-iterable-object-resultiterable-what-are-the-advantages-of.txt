I'm not finding anything helpful on line regards to the result structure after the  transformation.  What can I do with the  object after ?  I would have expected a list returned with the key.  I can convert it to a list but not sure if I'm missing something
what are the advantages of this?SerializationWhat can I do with the "ResultIterable" The same things you can do  with any  object:specifically you can assume that it implements  dunder method - it means it can be iterated or converted to another collection and can be used whenever iterable objects is expected.I would have expected a list  requires specific implementation of the collection.  allows other options, including larger than memory collections, and specific implementation  can be change whenever needed.
