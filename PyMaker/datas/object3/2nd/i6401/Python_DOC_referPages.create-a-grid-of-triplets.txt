I am trying to create a grid that lists all triplets that sum to 1, discretized at 0.01. Here is what I have tried, without much luck. First tryAnother try:
How about taking all possible values of  and  and then computing what the appropriate value of  would be:This uses  to get the cartesian product of  and , although  would work just as well.We can show that the resulting triples sum to 1 (modulo some rounding errors):Here's a pure  version of the same approach; I'm using  instead of  because it gives me back a single array instead of a tuple of two arrays:Here's the same sanity check ( is transposed with respect to ; that is, their shapes are  and , respectively):
You don't need to iterate 100**3 times. Here's a plain Python solution without any :It outputs:You only need to divide by  and put the triplets into an .
