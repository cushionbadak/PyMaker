I'm unable to get this to workI get output:This was linked in an answer Python Gzip - Appending to file on the fly to Is it possible to compress program output within python to reduce output file's size?I've tried integer data but no effect. What is the issue here
by default  streams are binary (Python 3: gzip.open() and modes).No problem in Python 2, but Python 3 makes a difference between binary & text streams.So either encode your string (or use  prefix if it's a literal like in your example, not always possible)or maybe better for text only: open the  stream as text:note that append mode on a  file works is not that efficient (Python Gzip - Appending to file on the fly)
In order to compress your string, it must be a binary value. In order to do that simply put a "b" in front of your string. This will tell the interpreter to read this as the binary value and not the string value.https://docs.python.org/3/library/gzip.html
