Natural Text
I am using python requests package to get results from a API and the URL contains + sign in it. but when I use requests.get, the request is failing as the API is not able to understand + sign. how ever if I replace + sign with %2B (URI Encoding) the request is successful.Is there way to encode these characters, so that I encode the URL while passing it to the requests package
