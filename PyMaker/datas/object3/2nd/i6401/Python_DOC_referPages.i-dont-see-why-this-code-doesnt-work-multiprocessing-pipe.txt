I'm studying Python multiprocessing Pipe. My goal is two make two independent processes, one of which sends the other a message for five time. I have no problem running it, but it just shows their PIDs and that's it. What did I wrong with this code? My environment is Windows 10(64bit) and Python 3.6.1(32bit).
It seems you forget to call  method of  class (CHILD) which inherits the  class (PARENT).Since  is not called explicitly,  method of parent is called and it doesn't have your receiving value printing code. Therefore, it is giving feeling that code is not running.Also some more things :Both the pipes need to be closed at the end like you close the file.Child class  method need to called till the sending process is alive.Please check the below code with above points incorporated.Code:Output:
