This question already has an answer here:Python- how do I use re to match a whole string                    4 answers                This is my first attempt at trying to use regex with Python or at all, and it is not working as expected. I want a regex to match any alphabetic character or underscore as the first character, then any number of alphanumeric characters or underscores after. The regex I am using is '^[a-z_,A-Z][a-z_A-Z0-9]*', which seems to produce what I want at pythex.org, but in my code it is matching strings that I do not want.My code is as follows:Two examples of strings that are matching that I don't want are: "qq-q" and "va[r". What am I doing wrong?
I think that you just forgot the  at the end of your regex to specify the end of the string.Without that, it will match the beginning of the string and not the entire string, which explains why it worked on  ( is a match) and  ( is a match).
