Natural Text
I am trying to make a table from a data set that should give me the words in the data set and the number of times they are repeated.So for example:dataset : table (final result): I thought to use a dictionary and play with the keys, so if during the iteration a word that is already a key is found, don't add it to the dictionary (that should represent the table) but increase the numeric value.The  is a secondary key that I am storing together with the word. This value can be yes or no. I am mentioning this because I am not sure if this can cause the problem (or better, the selection of the specific key I want to compare).  When I print the whole dictionary, I get a long list of words as keys (the program does not detect repetition) and all 1 in the counters. Output:Is there any other approach or data structure that should I use for this particular case? Or it is just the code?
It's fine for your dictionary key to be a tuple (though in your post it's unclear why you want to dot his). All you need to do is make sure that you're checking for that tuple in your  statement:
The  is probably what you are looking for:
I believe that the structure you need is the counter structure from the collections package.  You simply feed it your list of words, and you get a dictionary structure filled with the words and counts.
