I want to run 2 functions at the same time. Then wait until those 2 functions are over, and it can start processing the rest of codes.  I tried to use  module but it just continue running without waiting those 2 functions finished.  My example codes are as below: If the above codes get executed, the  inside  will just print out immediately even before the  and  are over in each round of the . However, what I want is that the  will only be printed out as  and  are finished printing  and .  That is, the codes should stop at  and wait for the  and  to finish so that it can continue processing the next  in the .If anyone know how to solve this, please let me know. Appreciated!!
You need to  the threads (join means "wait for it to finish"). See the docs. Depending on your problem, you may want to use  instead, as mentioned in the comments. I'll proceed under the assumption that you do want to do threading.Defining a class with methods to ask your question was unnecessary (and, even worse, you're redefining  , , and  on every iteration). Just use some functions. You can turn them into methods later if you need to.The s are just there to show that the two threads really are running at the same time. Example output (which may vary from run to run depending on exact timing):EDIT: class-based example
As already pointed out in the other answer, you need to join the threads. This example keeps your structure. I have added a sleep there so that you can see it works (otherwise buffered output might mess things up).
