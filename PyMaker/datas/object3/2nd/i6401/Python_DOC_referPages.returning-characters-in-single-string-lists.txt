I'm not quite sure why this doesn't work, can anyone please help me fix this?
Here's a slightly more Pythonic way using 
If the  condition is satisfied the  is triggering after only checking the first . For correctness, return  when this condition fails, and return  outside the loop if this never triggers.Also, the length condition doesn't need to be evaluated inside the loop.
I am not sure exactly how you want this code to work. However, based on your comment:Given a list of single character strS and a str, return True    if every character is in the given string.I assume you simply want to know that all characters (="every character") in  are in . I would do it this way:It is not clear what  is supposed to do.
This is one of many possible ways to valid the guesses
