I am writing a program that needs input in the console to control where a turtle goes on the screen. For example, if the user of the program types  in the console, and presses enter, the turtle should move forward 30 units. If the user types , the turtle should turn left 45 degrees, etc.I wrote some functions and used an infinite  loop for the program. It looks like this:The program works, except when I enter  in the console, it takes at least 2 entries to get my turtle to move forward. It takes even more when I try to turn my turtle right.Any ideas? Thanks in advance.
Each  prompts for a new entry from the user.What your code does is, for every set of 5 entries:discard the first entrycheck if the second entry is  then move forwardcheck if the third entry is  then move leftcheck if the fourth entry is  then move rightcheck if the fifth entry is  then move backYou should assign the first  to a variable, then check with that.Use  to avoid checking other characters if it already satisfies one.
