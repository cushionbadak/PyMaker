I have tuples in the form of:k âˆˆ [0,1]a is made up of objects T, that are included in a list teams.What I want, is to swap the position of all pairs a[i][j][0] and a[i][j][1]. so:As a is a tuple, I understand it is immutable, which is the reason that this does not work:I have tried converting a to a list (L = list(a)), but without success.Can somebody help me with suggestions? Sorry in case my nomenclatur is not perfect yet, this is my first question on SO :)Thanks
let's say  is a  of s of s.I wouldconvert it to a list of lists of listsdo whatever I wantconvert it back to the original format if neededexample:result:as you see, the tuples were converted to list, worked on, then converted back to tuplesEDIT: if  is a list of list of tuples you cannot do:but you can recreate the inner tuple:
We can simply do this using Python's reversed
ProblemTuples are immutables indeed.  might be a list, or even a list of lists. So this code:won't change anything. The problem appears to be that  is a list of lists of tuples.  is a tuple, and it's not possible to assign new values to it:Possible solutionIf you're working with 3-D matrices,  could probably help you. It supports advanced indexing and slicing:Elements inside the matrix don't have to be numbers, they could be any objects:
