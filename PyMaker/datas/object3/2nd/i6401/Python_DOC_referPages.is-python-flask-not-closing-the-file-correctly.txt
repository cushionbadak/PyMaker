Natural Text
I’m new to python. I have a separate flask web application that reads the ‘log.txt’ file in real time (via AJAX)The expected result is that it shows “message 1” and 5 seconds later shows “message 2”. Then I have the below scripts to write into the files:When I make a standalone Python script the below works (I see the first message and 5 seconds later the second message):When I put it as part of a web app, and the function Is call as below, they both appear together after 10 seconds and not one after the other.I must point out at this stage that I was using  and  but from what I understand doing  will do both of these anyway. Besides it works when I put it as a standalone script, but not when I put it into a method as part of a webapp.
Use the debugger in your IDE. Set a breakpoint at the first time.sleep(), and stepping through line by line you should be able to diagnose the issue much more exactly.
