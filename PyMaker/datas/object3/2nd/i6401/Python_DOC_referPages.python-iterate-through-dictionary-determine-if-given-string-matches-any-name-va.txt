I looked through this post trying to figure out how to find out if a given string matches a certain value in a dictionary, but it's throwing nothing back. I have a dictionary with dictionaries and I'm trying to figure out how I can, let's say if given a string , look through the dictionary, go inside the sub dictionary, check the  key for the given string, and if it exists, return the class. This is my code.classes.pyplayer.pyWhat can I do to have it search through the dictionary, and if  is an existing class dictionary, return true or return the dictionary?
