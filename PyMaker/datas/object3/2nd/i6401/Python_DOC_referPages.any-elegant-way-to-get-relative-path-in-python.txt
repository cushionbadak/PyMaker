Say I want to delete  after , so I write a hook.Say the hook path is , the file I want to delete is in I think my way is very silly, is there any elegant way to get the relative path?
Using :
Anti solution is the best in python 3. For Python 2, you could use  and :
os.path.relpath would be what you asked for. You should also be using os.path.join instead of that long list of + and sep. In Python 3's pathlib, there's relative_to. It appears your code is trying to apply a relative path, not get it in relative form. In that case, joinpath and normpath or realpath might help.
