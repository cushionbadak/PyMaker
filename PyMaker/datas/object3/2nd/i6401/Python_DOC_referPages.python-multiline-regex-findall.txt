Natural Text
I'm trying to find multiple matches across multiple lines of text with a delimiter to stop the search using regex in python... my query works well for what I'm trying to accomplish if what I need is all on the same line: re.findall('([a-zA-Z]{3}\d-[aAeE][rRsS]\d.*), output)the problem is, sometimes the additional data I'm trying to capture doesn't fit on the same line and goes to the next... is there a way to set the pattern match to stop if it either finds the next match or hits a delimiter (= in this case)?  Simplified example with two matches below, and I need the ability to capture both...Example
It seems that all you have to do is to add  to capture whatever coming in the next line and include the expected stops  to stop the match. Note that it is important to make  lazy, otherwise, it will match the whole thing.output
You mentioned  and . There are several ways to setre.IGNORECASE so that  would suffice.You didn't make it clear if you're using  or if you're deleting newlines before evaluating the regex. You end with  which could trivially becomeif you want everything up to the  delimiter.Alternatively, before evaluating the regex you could split on  newline and  equal, so you hand in appropriate size chunks for evaluation.
