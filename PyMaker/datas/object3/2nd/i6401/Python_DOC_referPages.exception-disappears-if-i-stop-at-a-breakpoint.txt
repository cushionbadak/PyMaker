Python 3.6.2The problem with the code below is that being run, it raises an exception.But being stepped in debugger, it works perfectly. Where I stop in the debugger is marked as breakpoint in the comments.I tried the command both in IDE and in the shell. Exception raises. So, this problem is not related to the IDE.This situation shook me a bit. I made a video of it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUcMpEzooDkCould you give me a kick here? How can it be?Comment on the code below (not related to the problem, but just for the most curious).This is an utility to use with Django web framework.Users upload files, they are put to the media directory.Of course, Django knows where the media directory is sutuated.And then Django keeps in the database paths relative to media. Something like this: it_1/705fad82-2f68-4f3c-90c2-116da3ad9a40.txt'e5474da0-0fd3-4fa4-a85f-15c767ac32d4.djvuI want to know exactly that files kept in media correspond to paths in the database. No extra files, no shortage.Code:Traceback:
You're using the  attribute on paths, which is undocumented and not guaranteed to be set. In general, an underscore prefix indicates that this is a private attribute that should not be used by user code. If you want to convert a path to a string, just use  instead.But in this case, you don't need to do so:  objects have an  method which you can call instead. Another possibility is to pass the  object itself to the  function, which is supported on Python 3.6.
