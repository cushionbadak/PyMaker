Natural Text
Using Python 3.6 I have the data shown below in an xml.etree.ElementTree, the xml output using minidom.toprettyxml is shown below.Before outputting to XML file I want to sort the Observation nodes using the PT attribute as the key. Whilst maintaining them in their correct Setup node.This is for human reading purposes so that "Observation"s to the same "PT" are next to each other for checking, and possibly editing manually. Thanks in advance for any help.My complete Python code below, I can't get the Output to sort.
This should work
