This question already has an answer here:How do I parse an ISO 8601-formatted date?                    24 answers                I am having trouble converting the date time string  into a Date object in python, simply because I can't figure out the format.I have the code line: , which accurately gives me the date itself, but lacks the time obviously. When trying to modify the string formatter, I am getting confused by the , and the last decimal  (from the example above).Can someone help me understand what these values mean in this timestamp, and what the proper  might be?
The numbers after the  are microseconds. You can parse it using the  module, like so:The format looks like ISO-8601, which is a widely-used standard. But it appears that the  module doesn't yet provide a way to parse this without providing the format-string yourself.
