I have multiple files formatted as shown below and tab delimited. The bing column contains multiple values as shown below. File is named file1.txtWhat I am trying to do is to find the maximum value of d under the bing column. For this case the max will be -0.2 and print out the entire row with all the headers and values. I also wish to have the filename from which the row originated from printed at the start of the row. My final file will contain something like:I am currently stuck and not even sure how to proceed. This is what I have so far:I am learning, I think I am on the right path but still a long way to go. Please if you could give some explanation on an answer to help me learn, I will appreciate it. Thank you in advance
Using the standard's library's  module and  with a key function and assuming the fourth column is as regular as you present it: is an iterator producing lists of strings. Each string is a field in a csv row. The key function of the  call takes the 4th field ([3]) of a row, splits it on , takes the second token of the resulting list ('d=x'), splits again, this time on , takes the second part of that split and finally turns it into a float. This float is used to determine the row with the max value: .
