I have a list of ids and I want to display a fake id for each id in my list using Python.I used the uuid1() but when there is a duplicated id in my list the program stop and don't generate the same random id for same input id.
You could just hash your id :You'll have to store the correspondance somewhere though, because there is no way to retrieve the id from a hash.
from python uuid doc, uuid1 is dependent on current time.You could use uuid3 to have a reproducible uuid for the same input, by reusing the same namespace:
