This question already has an answer here:Print out message only once from the for loop                    4 answers                how do I get my else print to only print once instead of for every row that the string doesn't exist? I tried moving it around by tabbing back a couple of layers but it doesn't work. I understand the logic, I but don't know how to limit it. I'm adding a little bit at a time to my parsing scripts for practice, learning as I go, but this one got me. Thanks!
In Python, you can have an  clause attached to your  loop. For exampleNote  was found so the else statement is not executedSee the documentation on for statementsA break statement executed in the first suite terminates the loop  without executing the else clause’s suite. A continue statement  executed in the first suite skips the rest of the suite and continues  with the next item, or with the else clause if there is no next item.
See Gibson's answer first. You can do this:You can also omit the  flag (as suggested by Jean-François Fabre in the comment) but this makes a bit hard to understand imo (I had to compile in my head):
