What is the best way to append a list ofand obtain a list of this sort;
Just a list comprehension with slicing
And another list comprehension that avoids playing with indices too much.
I think the best way and the most basic way is to use  !Output:By the way for the example that you gave above even this will work:
Output:
What you describe here is what is known in some functional programming languages as .We can construct an  function that works on infinite generators and with lazy loading as follows:For your case, we can then perform a  and also perform  on the result:The advantage of this appraoch is that it works with infinite generators, as well as with collections that can be enumerated, but do not support slicing. Furthermore memory is shared among the differenct s, so we do not construct explicit lists, unless we explicitly want this (like in the above example).
