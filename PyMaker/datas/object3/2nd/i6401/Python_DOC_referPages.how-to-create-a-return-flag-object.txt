Currently a set of functions returns  or .  We've discovered this isn't good enough, though, since  can convey both "valid result" or "invalid result", and we want behavior to differ in each case.  So I think they should be changed to instead return , where  is false for backward compatibility, but can be tested for using .I'm not sure what the terminology is, but I'm imagining something like the built-in  that's returned by comparison functions. This is called a "special value" in the docs and is of type .How to create such an object and what methods/attributes should it have?  I should create my own type like  also, or is there an existing type that conveys this "flag" concept?  It's a similar kind of object to , , , , etc.
You could just use  or  as the  value, e.g. in , define , then elsewhere you can test . See here for some more info on the "truthfulness" of None: False or None vs. None or FalseOr you could define an object with suitable methods for Boolean conversion; hopefully others will chime in with those details. Note that whichever way you go, you'll have to be careful if you have multipart Boolean expressions:  will give but  will give . 
Apparently this is called a "sentinel" and is a simple as this:Now of course I find the similar questions:Defining my own None-like Python constantand the  might be overkill; I'm not sure if pickling or copying will ever matterHow to create a second None in Python?
