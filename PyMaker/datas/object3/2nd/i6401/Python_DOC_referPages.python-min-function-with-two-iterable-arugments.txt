I understand that min will give me the smallest item if I use a list or a group of numbersbut when this was used in map:it gives me back:isn't map suppose to help me to apply min to L1 and L2 in turn? and I am kind of expecting:
If you want the  of each of several lists, you need to create a list (or iterable) of the lists to hand to map:That has the effect of calling  and then . can take any number of iterable arguments; it assembles all of the corresponding elements of the iterations and passes all of them to the provided function. So  is similar to  (except that it is an iterable, not a tuple).
If your lists arethenwill apply the  function to the corresponding elements of , :(But it will do it only if there is a request for evaluating it (so called a lazy evaluation) - as the  loop in your case - so it will not return a list , but a  object.The  object is a sort of the iterator - something as a recipe how to do it.Why? Because lists may be very very long, but the recipe is still the same - the short one.)
