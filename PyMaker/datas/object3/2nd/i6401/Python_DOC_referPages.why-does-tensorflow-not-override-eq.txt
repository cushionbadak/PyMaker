Tensorflow overrides multiple operators for the  class, including , , etc.However, the implementation for  seems to be conspicuously absent:Why does  for tensorflow's tensors not behave the same way as for numpy arrays?Code example:With numpy, on the other hand:
Tensors do implement , but the implementation only tests for identity. I found this GitHub issue, which explains why tensors test for identity, and do not broadcast:This may be a complication of fact that tensors can be used as keys in dictionaries, which I believe use  to find the matching object with the same hashThe commenter is correct; if  was overloaded to broadcast then you could not use tensors as keys in a dictionary. Objects that define a  method (required if you want to use such objects as keys in a dictionary), must produce the same hash value for two objects that are equal; see the  method:The only required property is that objects which compare equal have the same hash valuebut broadcasting would produce a 'true' tensor object for objects with different hash values.(the speculation that  would break boolean testing is wrong; boolean testing uses , which tensors do implement).If you need to make element-wise equality tests on tensors, you can use the  and  functions.
