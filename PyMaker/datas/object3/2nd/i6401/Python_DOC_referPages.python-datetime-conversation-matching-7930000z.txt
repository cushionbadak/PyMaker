Im trying to convert a date time into a human friendly format but keep getting errors in the conversion, im not what im missing to match the current format.I think its 7930000Z thats causing the issue, everything else seems straight forward. Ive tried, %fZ and %SZ, no luck thus far
Maybe %f is for microseconds and they are "Between 0 and 999999 inclusive"(https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html)And a post about nanoseconds parsing: Format Nanoseconds in Python
