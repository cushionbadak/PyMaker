I started practicing codefights recently, its supposed to be a great practice space for online interview questions. Problem being, this is my solution in python for a simple question on finding the first non repeating character in a string : which when I run on my local jupyter notebook gives me the following output : Which is awesome. That is the answer. However running the same on codefights  env gives an error: So my question being, I being a python noob, the append in a dictionary does it add keys to random place or is it in an orderly fashion ?? Or the output difference is because of some difference in the python env of the jupyter noteboook and their online compiler. 
You can use  to count character occurrences.Since the keys in a dictionary have no order, you need to loop over the string:
It's not stored in order. You can try using  https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict
