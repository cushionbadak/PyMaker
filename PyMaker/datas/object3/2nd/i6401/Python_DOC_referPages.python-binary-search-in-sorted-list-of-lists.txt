Is it a way in Python 3 to binary search in sorted list of lists? Let's assume I have a list of lists:I've sorted it by 3d element in inner list with:and now list isAnd now how can I search in this sorted list with binary search (O(log(n)) time complexity) using element from inner list by which sorting was done?LikeOuter list is huge. Inner lists have len 50. And I need to make many queries to extract some elements from outer list based on condition related to inner lists. I was thinking about  but inner arrays would be a problem for it I think. 
I think bisection algorithm is simply enough. Python docs told us thathttps://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.htmlThis module provides support for maintaining a list in sorted order  without having to sort the list after each insertion. For long lists  of items with expensive comparison operations, this can be an  improvement over the more common approach. The module is called bisect  because it uses a basic bisection algorithm to do its work. The source  code may be most useful as a working example of the algorithm (the  boundary conditions are already right!).
