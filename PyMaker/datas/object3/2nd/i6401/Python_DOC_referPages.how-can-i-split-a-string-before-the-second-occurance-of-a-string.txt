Say i have the string , i want to split it into a list that has only  and (splits right before second occurance of ).  Is there a way to do it in python?
You can use  to find all substrings starting with , not containing another  or followed by the end-of-string character:The first  ensures the search is non-greedy; one substring at a time, while  enforces an assertion that the substring is preceding the next  substring or the end-of-string character .More tests:
You can try something like this:
Since the question was about splitting, this can be done with the new regex module, which allows zero width characters for splitting outputUPDATETo avoid splitting at the beginning of the lineoutputexplanation
from the documentation:findall(pattern, string, flags=0)  Return all non-overlapping matches of pattern in string, as a list of strings. The string is scanned left-to-right, and matches are returned in the order found. If one or more groups are present in the pattern, return a list of groups; this will be a list of tuples if the pattern has more than one group. Empty matches are included in the result unless they touch the beginning of another match.
