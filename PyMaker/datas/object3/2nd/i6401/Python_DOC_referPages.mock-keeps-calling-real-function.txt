I'm trying to mock a function. When I try to mock the function  the mock doesn't work. It keeps printing "Ouch".I've tried to test  and it returns False.Does anyone know why it keeps using the real function even if I mock it?views.py:tests.py:uses_cases.py:
So, searching around and looking some codes on github, I found out that I need to mock from the  even if the function belongs to the  module.So my code now is:tests.pyI know that this works, but now I need to search why it works. I'll explain it when I figure it out.
