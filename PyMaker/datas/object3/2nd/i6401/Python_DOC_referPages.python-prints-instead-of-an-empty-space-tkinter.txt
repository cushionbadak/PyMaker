As jonathan and Ron Norris already said, you need to pass a string to the  argument of the  constructor.I would suggest to transform your heterogeneous list to a string thusly:Documentation link for : map documentation for python 3Documentation for : str documentation for python 3Documentation for the  method of : string join method, python 3Edit: Since you now ask for a way to do this in many code locations, with minimal code changes, I would suggest this wrapper around :This function will pass all of its arguments unchanged to , but taking care to transform a  keyword argument to a string, if it is a list. When you have defined this, use a "Find & Replace" function in your editor to replace calls to  with .Your original could would be transformed like this, for example:
 is a heterogeneous list, tkinter.Label's documentation suggests that its  parameter should receive a string (Which the word "text" also quite strongly suggests)https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#label-options
If you want "1 3", try:
