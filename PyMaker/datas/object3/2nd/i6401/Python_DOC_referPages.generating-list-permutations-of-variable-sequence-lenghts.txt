Suppose I have a list that looks like this:Now, here are the basic patterns that I want to extract:The problem is, if I extract only  out of , I miss out on the previous  before that pattern occurs.(Better example - There can also be )Therefore, every letter in those basic patterns can be expanded in a sense of:Os can occur together thrice. Ps can occur together twice. Rs can occur together twice.Ss can occur only once.I want to generate a list of all possible permutations but have no idea where to start.I wrote a naive python code that replaces every occurrence of O with three Os and etc. But that results in -Which won't work when I need to find:Any help is appreciated. Thank you.
This sounds like a job for regexes. If you join your  list into a string with , you can build regexes to search it for substrings matching specific patterns. For example, using the  quantifier to search for a certain number of repetitions of a subpattern, you can useto search for a pattern consisting of 1 to 3 Os, 1 to 2 Rs, and 1 to 3 more Os.See the  module documentation for more information on Python's regex syntax and functions, and see any number of online tutorials for help getting used to writing regexes.
