I do not understand how the dictionary "count" is being being populated and referenced by 'List'.Specifically, why do items in the list ('List') get added to the dictionary ('count') with the "if item in count" statement? The 'count' dictionary is empty to begin with and there is no 'append' function.Here is the python function:output: 
you can run your code by hand to see how it worksiterating through list first element is 1 it checks the dict in this line to see is this element added to the dict before it's not in the count so it puts the element to the list and makes its value 1 in this line count becomesthen it iterates through the next element witch is 2 same story count becomes next item is 4 next item is 2 in this case we have 2 in our dict so it increases it's value by 1 in this linecount becomes and it continues until the list is finished
This is why it checks , which will fail if this is the first time you are seeing the count (since it won't be defined in the dictionary yet).In that case, it will define it using . The next time the count is seen, it will already have been defined (as 1), so you can increment it using , i.e. , i.e. , etc.
Specifically, why do items in the list ('List') get added to the dictionary ('count') with the "if item in count" statement?when the element in list[1,2,4,3,2,2,5] is already present in the dictcount[item] += 1 --> increment the occurrence against each item`
