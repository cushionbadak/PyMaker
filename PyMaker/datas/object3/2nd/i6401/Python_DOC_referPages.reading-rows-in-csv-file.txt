I have a csv file that has data looks similar to this:So I want to extract these two rows into two different list. But this will only give me 20, 20, 20, something that I didn't want it to show. So that I can have like:However, for age, I am planning to get the average age for each year. But I don't know how in this case. 
You have opened the file, and are reading it line by line.  When you reference  and , you are referencing the first and second character of each line.  In this case, it happens to be  and  as part of the year.You need to take it one more step and interpret the file as a CSV file, rather than just a series of lines.  Reading the documentation of Python's core CSV library should help.  Meanwhile, here's a code snippet from there which may jump start your process:Further, with your implementation, it looks like you are iterating over the entire file, constantly reading the first and second characters, and finally returning just the last line.  That looks like a possible error.
You need to split and strip the string.
