Hi I am using Python to sort my GPS data based on the timestamps and also I would like to add the function of error if the location is same but different timestamp is not possible. I found that my data set is a bit weird. If you can can you suggest new data set type? So far I have this...This code only sort the timestamp values. But I would like my other keys to follow the order of timestamp's value.
You could store ,  and  in a dict:The sorting could be done like this:
I would use a  for this.The attributes of each point are directly accessible:And it acts like a tuple for sorting so it sorts by the first index (timestamp)This is a bit of change from having lists of long/lat/time but it forces the points to stay in sync. With the dictionary of lists approach the longitudes can get into a different order to the latitudes so there's no way to get back to the original data.
Convert this dict into pandas dataframe.then sorted = my_dataframe.sort_values(by='timestamp',ascending=False)
Here is a simple function that does what you ask for:or:then:ResultDifferent approach:But may I suggest you use pandas for this:orthen:Returns:
