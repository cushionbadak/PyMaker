I'm trying to implement simple log handler that uses Python's standard  library to log events to remote server. So I created custom class inherited from  called  that accepts  and sends it to remote server. The handler is attached to root logger in standard  manner.This works as intended, but can obviously cause locking of the calling thread when the remote_url becomes inaccessible or starts responding slowly. So I'm trying to figure best way to make this call independent on the calling thread.What I've considered:Including some non-standard library that would make the http request asynchronousUsing QueueHandler and QueueListener as outlined hereUsing asyncioAll these solutions seem to be way too complex/unnecessary for achieving such simple task. Is there some better approach with less overhead in order to make this handler non-blocking?
For anyone who will face this, the solution turned out to be simple as described here.QueueListener runs in its own thread and listens to LogRecords that are sent by QueueHandlers which results in non-blocking logging.
