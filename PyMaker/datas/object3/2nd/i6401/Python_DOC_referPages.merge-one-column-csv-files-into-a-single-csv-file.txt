I have seen some answers to this type of question here, but not enough to really help me. I did a split on a 9- column .csv - file & wrote them to vectors for other work in c++. They are subsequently written back to a folder as Single- column .csv files that basically look similar to this:Now I want to combine all those 9 simple csv files into 1 file again so that they stack up horizontally next to each other,like this in the new file:I hope this is easy enough to understand. My code below is as follows:This code DOES move all the rows of the columns into 1 new file, but it just puts them underneath one another. How would I go about writing the columns next to each other,comma separated ? I have tried extensively with Pandas, numpy and the csv lib according to concat, merge and others, but i just can't find the right way. I don't think I'm that far off, but my python is not the best unfortunately!
I read you tried pandas, what went wrong there?. With pandas we can simply use pd.concat([df1,df2....]). So let's read them in and bunch them together:Example:Let's first create two imaginary files:
You can open all the files using a single context manager with  (in Python 3) and then write to the output file after applying  on the iterable of files:Update:If the file contains characters that cannot be decoded to UTF-8 (the default encoding for ), you can use intermediate surrogate characters when reading, which are replaced with their original form at write time:
