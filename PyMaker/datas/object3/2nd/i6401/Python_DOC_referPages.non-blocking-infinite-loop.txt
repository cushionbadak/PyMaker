I have a Raspberry pi with a Sense hat. I've made a binary clock that I want to display and keep updated on the Sense hat's display. However, I want the ability to toggle the clock on and off with joystick middle. Everything's working fine, apart from my clock's update-loop blocking any new input once it's started.I've been thinking about how to solve this. How to allow the script/clock to keep running and still accept new actions from the joystick. But once the while-loop starts, I'm stuck. I'm not sure what to google for. I've started looking into async/await, but that seem to be a Python 3.5+ feature, and my pi only has 2.7.9/3.4.2(I just -ed). I've also tried moving the loop around in the program, but it's blocking everything no matter where I place it.Is it a non-blocking (infinite) loop I'm looking for?Is this what a game-/event-loop is?Can I solve this with out using multiple threads(just curious, not a limitation if it's a must)?Is this a general problem in "designing" infinite loops?Can I approach this as a (reverse?) race condition? I was thinking about maybe using a semaphore as some kind of tool to not block, but I'm not sure.
What you need is multithreading. Here you can find a good explanation with example.How to use threading in Python?
I solved it by using a global variable:
