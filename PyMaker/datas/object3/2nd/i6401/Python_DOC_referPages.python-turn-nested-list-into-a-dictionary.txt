I am using a nested list which contains various types of crimes. To clarify,  is formatted as such: . I am looking to create a dictionary that will hold every value/crime that is in this list and record its frequency, or how often it appears in the data set. Since the keys inside dictionaries can't be lists, I am attempting to access the string inside of each nested list, by calling its index i[0] in the for loop. When I run the following program:I get the following error:What am I doing wrong? How can I create a dictionary containing each different value that is in my nested list? Any advice will be helpful.
To count something with a dict, check if the key already exists and then increment the value, otherwise add the key with value 1:The modern way to solve your problem is to use a  and a generator expression:
Do you want to if key not existence, created value OR if key existence, add value.I recommendation using setdefault() method.If using setdefault() method, code is simple.I usually using setdefault() method frequently.
