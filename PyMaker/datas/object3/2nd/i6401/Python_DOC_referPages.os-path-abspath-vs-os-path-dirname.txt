These are equal in string value, but are they truly equal? What is going on where?
According to here, the value of  is a string, which is set when module was imported by a loader. From here you can see that the value of  is The path to where the module data is stored (not set for built-in modules).Usually, the path is already the absolute path of the module. So, the line 4 of your code can be simplified to . Obviously, the line 3 of your code can be presented as  (let us ignore the order of execution for now).The next thing is to see what does  do. In fact, you can view  as a wrapper of , which splits a path into two parts: .  is the last part of the given path and  is the rest of the given path. So, the  is just the path of the directory containing the loaded file. Moreover,  is a absolute path. Hence  is just the same with . So,  is the same with .
