I tried to run the following multiprocessing code:and get the results:The  outputs seem strange. I have set the attribute  to be  in the method , and the outputs  show that the  method has been executed. And, if I add a line  immediately after  in the method , the output would be . Why does the class attribute  change after multiprocessing has finished?Thanks!
This will allow you to share the finished value between processes.  It uses a  to create a shared object using shared memory.
The  executes in another process and only changes the variable in that process, but you are printing the value from the main process.  You need variables that are shared.
