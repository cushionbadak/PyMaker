When I run my query below, it creates a file called ‘mycsvfile’. However is there a way to add the current date and timestamp when the CSV file is created? For example if I run this query now the file should be named mycsvfile20171012 – 10:00:00 (something like that).Could someone edit my code and show me how to do this please?My code:Thank you in advance!
It is better to use underscore in filename than any other special character since it widely acceptedTherefore constructing file name as below :Use datetime as below :

Have a variable for file name as  and use
