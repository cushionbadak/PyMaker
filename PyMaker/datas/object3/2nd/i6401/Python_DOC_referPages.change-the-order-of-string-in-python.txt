How do I change the sequence of string?For e.g. Expected result:What I have tried:I can enumerate the splitted string and then re-arrange the sequence like 1-3-2
With  you can get multiple items with a single call:With string format  you can pick values from arguments:With  you can capture groups and reorder them (assuming digits):If you need this in pandas (as hinted in comments), you can use the regex-based approach in both  and , for example (add  for in-place subs):
If you're really trying to just reformat datetime string, I suggest you parse the string to a datetime object and format it as you wish:
Given the context of the question, your approach is fine:It's brittle certainly, but if it's for a personal or one-off script, who cares?  If you need more flexibility, then you'll need to describe more explicitly the nature of your constraints.
One good way is to use regular expressions this way the numbers which I presume can have different lengths eg:  will also work fine.You can remove the  line if you wish of course. There are many others ways to do what you want but if you need it to be flexible this is what I would recommend.
Given:You can simply write up a function for it such as this:Which given  with an  (actual code takes 1 away because it's zero-indexed) reordering gives:
You can split on , then re-join with  as the separator, but simply re-order as you need to:Or, without , after you split, you can simply do: 
You can try this:Output:
You could use slices.
