Natural Text
I am parsing a big text file with the following format.city is city1 in the west coast.(some lines which are not relevant to me)......temperature is 15 degree in winter......daytime is 5 hours.....city is city2 in the west coast..... the pattern repeats.I have used line.startswith() and made a outputline by concatenating the values like : for line in file:finally outputline = line1 +line2+line3so it prints one outputline for each city block.But I understand this is an ugly solution. What I want is a dictionary like this:{city1:[15, 5], city2:[temperature, daytime] ....}could you please help?
From here you just need to , etc.Loop through your input by identifying the pattern wherein the city category will repeat.
You can loop over the lines of the text file looking for your cues, then add the values to a dictionary. Each city's values are stored in a list, so you'll end up with a list of city properties keyed by the city name.You may prefer to use  instead of slicing the values directly. You may also be interested in something like regular expressions, which are much more powerful for parsing strings like this.
