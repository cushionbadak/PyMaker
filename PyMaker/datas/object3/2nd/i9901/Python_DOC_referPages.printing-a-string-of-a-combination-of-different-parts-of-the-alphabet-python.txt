Using a range with negative step value you can create the reverse list. Then concatenate the forward, the one element list for z and the reverse list using the shorthand '+' notation. Use list comprehension to convert the ascii indexes to the respective characters and finally join the resulting list using the empty string "".
The following code should do the trick.
