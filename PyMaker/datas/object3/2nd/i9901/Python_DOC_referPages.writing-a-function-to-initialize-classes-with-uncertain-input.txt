I have three classes that receive input in similar ways, but each class takes a different number of arguments. So, class 1 has 7 arguments in its init function, class 2 has 4, and class 3 has 5, and I'd like to make a function that can initialize any one of them. How should I go about doing this? Normally I would take the list of parameters, p[0], p[1], etc., and feed them in as arguments to the class, but with an uncertain amount of input, I'm not sure how I can do this.
Without judging your design concepts, I reckon a plausible way to achieve this is by writing a function with a variable number of  and checking against their length, i.e:Handling error cases accordingly. With some sample classes:you'd get the required effect:
