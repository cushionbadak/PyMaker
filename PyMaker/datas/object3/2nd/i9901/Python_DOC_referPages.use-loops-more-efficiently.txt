I am looking to write a program where I enter a word or a phrase and it counts the number of vowels in the input and then returns how many of each vowel there is. I have done this, but my code is very long and I want to know how I can write it more efficiently. How can I reduce the amount of for loops I use?
Use a :Output:
In complement to @Lutz Horn answer, you can make it much shorter, and also count the number of different vowels, as you need:Or you can reduce that to 4 readable lines, if you don't need to keep the counts in a variable, but just need to print them:Or you could use Python built-in collections.Counter which offers both best performance and functionalities:
You can use :and for the total number of vowels:
I like the dictionary example shown above but if you want a slight change you could do the following:Only iterate over the input string once.Use an array track the count for each vowel.
Trying to preserve your original code as much as possible, here's your algorithm, using a  - to count vowels:
