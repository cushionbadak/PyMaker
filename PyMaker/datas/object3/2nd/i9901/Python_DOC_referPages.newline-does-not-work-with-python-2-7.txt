Natural Text
So I wrote a python script that formats a text file so I can import into my SQL. I am using python 3.5 and my code works perfectly. However, When I try to run my code in python 2.7, it does not work and it throws this error. ( I have to use 2.7) I did not know this till after.Is there a way around this, if I don't use newline, it skips rows in my data and it shows as a blank row.Here is my code:How can I modify my code so it's compatible with python 2.7. Thanks so much!
The short answer: use  which has the same signature as python 3's .The  module handles line ending for you so that it can deal with line endings different than local file system encodings. For instance, a dialect may want to write  line endings even on linux. In python 2, the solution was to open files in binary mode.In python 3, things are different. Files opened in binary mode return  objects that need decoding to become unicode string objects. You can open in text mode, but that does two things - decoding and newline translation. So the  keyword was invented. It lets you open in text mode for decoding but leaves the newline terminator in the string.This functionality is also available in the  function available on both python 2 and 3. You can use that function to get what you want. Notice that you also need to make some sort of a decoding decision. By default its whatever  returns. You may need to make a decision about how you are encoding your csv files in the first place and use that encoding in your files.
