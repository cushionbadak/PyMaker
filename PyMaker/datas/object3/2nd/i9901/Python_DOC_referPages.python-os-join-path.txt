This question already has an answer here:Why do backslashes appear twice?                    2 answers                I used os.join.path() to load image in a folder. But I found the function cannot give accurate path when it is used in defining another function in some cases. For example: When I implement the function, the printed result of the path is:It is illegal for image loading. But os.path.join() works well in Pythonconsole.How to make the path generated in such function definition have double backslashes? Also, it is noted os.path.normpath also cannot work well sometimes. For example:It should give the result:But instead, it results in:How come??
 is equivalent to . (See escape sequence part in String and bytes literals.)You need to escape  to mean backslash literally:   or, use raw string literal:
