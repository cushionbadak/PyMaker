I was examining a code written in python but I got confused with the following line.This code takes x and y as an input sums x and y's first element. After that  I think it reduces myList to the value of x+y[0] . How can I accomplish this with using list comprehension instead of using lambda.
The part that corresponds well to a list comprehension is what the reducing function does with its second argument :The reducing function then combines this list one element at a time with the "accumulator" :or more simplyor, as you have probably recognized by now
