If I have a nested dictionary I can get a key by indexing like so:Am I able to pass that indexing as a function parameter?EDIT: I am aware my syntax is incorrect. It's a proxy for the correct syntax.
You can use  (or  in python 3), but that would also require you to pass in a list/tuple of your keys:(In your case  doesn't work because  is a list, and  is trying to look up the element at "b"th index of that list)
I'm having the same problem, and I'm solving it with a recursive function:This works for both a nested dict-of-dicts, and a list of dicts:returns
Not really, but by rewriting your function body a little bit, you can pass the keys as a tuple or other sequence:
Take a look at https://github.com/akesterson/dpath-python. It makes traversing nested dictionaries a lot easier.It will iterate out all of the conditions in the dictionary, so no special looping constructs required.
