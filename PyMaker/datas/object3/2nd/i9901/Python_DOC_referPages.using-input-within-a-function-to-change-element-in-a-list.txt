I'm struggling to make a tic tac toe game in python and didn't want to cheat, so I'm asking a very specific question here instead. My board is a list : which I break up with the following function to make it look like a grid: so that calling the function prints:I then tried to take an input and use it to replace a number in the list with a string 'x': This prints the string and provides a box for the input, but doesn't replace the number in the list with 'x'. I realize there must be something wrong with the function, so if anyone has the patience to explain it I would be very grateful.Ok so now I want to turn the numbers in the board into strings because it looks better:     ['1', '2', '3']    ['4', '5', '6']    ['7', '8', '9']And I came up with the following mess of code because I realised that if the for loop came across a string like 'x' and tried to turn it into an integer it might display an error: Before the extra conditions (if x!= 'x', etc) it marked the 'x's but then displayed an error when it was time for the second player to input a number, (int is not callable), but now it doesn't do anything. Any ideas?
Which you could clean up:
I believe this is because the items in your list are ints not strings and user input is a string. So you could do:EDIT: You could optionally use an if with move1.isDigit() instead of try/catch
