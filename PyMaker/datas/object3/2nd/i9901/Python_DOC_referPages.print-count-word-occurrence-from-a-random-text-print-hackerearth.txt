Natural Text
I am trying to find the count of occurrence of fixed word from any given string.Fixed word = 'hackerearth'Random string may be s = 'aahkcreeatrhaaahkcreeatrha'Now from string we can generate 2-times hackerearth.I have written some code to find the count of (h,a,e,r,c,k,t) letters in string:Code:Output:  From above output list, I want to calculate the total occurrence of word.How can I get total count of fixed word and any other way to make this code easier?
You could utilize :Output:Above code will create two  like counters where letters are keys and their occurrence are values. Then it will use generator expression to iterate over the letters found in the word and for each letter generate the ratio.  will pick the lowest ratio and  value of  is used for case where  is empty string.
When looking for a substring, you need to account for the character order, and not just the countssomething like this should work:For example:Because you can choose each of the 3 s and construct the word hello with the remainder
