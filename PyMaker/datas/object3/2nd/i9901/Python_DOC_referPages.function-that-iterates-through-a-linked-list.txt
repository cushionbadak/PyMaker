I am working on an iterative function named . It takes linked list and two values, value and new. It mutates the linked list such that every occurrence of the value is now followed by new. For example:add_after(a,2,-1) results in a referring to a linked list containing the values 1->8->2->-1->4->2->-1->5->2->-1->None.add_after(a,2,2) for the original list in a results in a referring to a linked list containing the values 1->8->2->2->4->2->2->5->2->2->None.plus( I am not allowed to use lists, tuples, sets, or dicts in my code)use linked lists processing onlywhen I run my  it gives me an error:can anyone help me to fix my  function? many thanks. 
Make  iterable, by defining  methods which yields nodes:Make  link new node.UPDATE after reading OP's comment => changing only  (manually loop through nodes):NOTE: I made  add only one node. I will leave it as your work to add multiple nodes.
 is an object of user-defined class . It is not iterable like a list, hence a for-each construct would not work in this context.The following would be the alternative.Addressing the OP's concern on inserting at the nth occurrence, the following code can be also applicable:The optional fourth argument determines after which occurrence should the new value be inserted. For example,  adds -1 after the second occurrence of 2.
Here is my solution using recursion. I've also added a helper method  to visualise the changes for when I was testing.
