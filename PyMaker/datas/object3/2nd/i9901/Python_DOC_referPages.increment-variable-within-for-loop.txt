I am new to Python and am trying to figure out how to address the following issue. I have two lists, list1 looks like this:And list2 looks like this:I also have a dictionary consisting of the following key-values:The keys in this dictionary consist of those elements in list1. Each element in list1 is also associated with a single element in list2 (in order, such that '10' in list1 is associated with '15' in list2, '12' in list1 with '16' in list2, etc.). For each element in list1, I would like to take the associated dictionary value, and insert characters into specific positions using the associated element in list2 to determine the positions. So far I've been working on a for loop to do this:I would like my final output to look like this:But my output currently looks like this because I am specifically calling for only index 0 from list2:I want to increase the element that's called for in list2 by 1 with each iteration of the loop, but I can't seem to figure it out. Should I define a new variable using range? Any comments will be appreciated!
Just change  to  and remove the assignment of  in the second line of the loop.  will let you iterate through both lists at once.
Using enumerate is helpful in situations like this - it gives you a tuple containing the position of each element, and the element itself. Note, I've changed your meaning of  to mean the element's position rather than the element.Your variable  would probably be better called , since the element in  is actually the key that you are looking up in .
You can build iterators for your lists ( for instance iterates , converting its values to  on the way) and use  to read them in pairs.Some people would prefer string formatting to build the resulting string but that's personal taste.
