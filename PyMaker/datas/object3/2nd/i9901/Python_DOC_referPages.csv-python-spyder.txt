I have a csv file of service price list where column a = name of service and column b = has price.I need to make a function like def pricelist("servicepricelist.csv", "servicename") -- the first part states the file, the second part is asking to pull an element in the row of the file like "washing".I need to somehow, make the washing or whatever service is entered match the csv file column a and then print the value from column bthe output has to be like: 49.95 Please help
Although I have not tested it, the following script should accomplish what you're looking for: All it does is import the standard library's  module, open the file, iterate over its contents until it finds the service, and print out the corresponding price.
