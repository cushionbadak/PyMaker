Sometimes it looks reasonable to use  as initialization method for already existing object, i.e.:As alternative to this implementation I see the following:It seems to me as over-complication of code. Is there any guideline on this situation?
 is not a constructor. It is an initialisation method, called after the instance was already constructed for you (the actual constructor method is called ).You can always call it again from your code if you need to re-initialise, this isn't a style violation. In fact, it is used in the Python standard library; see the  implementation for example:or the  implementation, which uses a context manager to defer initialisation.There is otherwise nothing special about the  method itself. It is merely automatically called by  (after creating the instance with ,  is called if it is available).
In addition to Martjin's answer: a common pattern in Python is to use classmethods as factory methods, ie:
I found some differences between  and 'normal' methods:1.,  is not allowed to return anything: TypeError will be raised.2., If  raises error,  will be called:UPDATE by Martijn Pieters: this is only for constructor calls, not for generic usage, see comments below.will output:
