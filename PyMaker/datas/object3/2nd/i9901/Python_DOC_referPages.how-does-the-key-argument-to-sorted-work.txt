Code 1:    Code 2:Why in code 1, is  omitted in , and it reports error if parentheses are included, but in code 2 in , the parentheses are kept?
The  argument to  expects a function, which  then applies to each item of the thing to be sorted. The results of  are compared to each other, instead of each original , during the sorting process.You can imagine it working a bit like this:As you can see, the parentheses  are added to the function  inside , applying it to  and , which are items of .In your first example,  is the function that gets applied to each  and . is a bit different. It's a function which returns another function, and in your example, it's that other function which gets applied to  and .You can see how  works in the console:It can be a little hard to get your head around "higher order" functions (ones which accept or return other functions) at first, but they're very useful for lots of different tasks, so it's worth experimenting with them until you feel comfortable.
poking around with the console a bit reefers to the method 'lower' of 'str' objectsand  is a function, how ever  requires an argument, so properly written it would be  and it would return  the error is because you did not pass any arguments to the function but it was expecting one.
