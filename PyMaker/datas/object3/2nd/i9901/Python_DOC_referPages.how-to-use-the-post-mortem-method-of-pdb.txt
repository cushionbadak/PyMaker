I am trying to understand how to use the pdb.post_mortem() method.for this given fileCommand prompt
The post_mortem method wants a traceback object, not a Trace object.  Traceback objects can be acquired from  inside of an  block, or you can simply call  with no arguments directly (in the  block).But either way, you must catch the exception before you can debug it.
