task = count vowels in word, print least frequent vowels that occur. in this case, "potato" would print:how do I make it so that it prints just 'a'? I could use min(leastFreq) but that would only return the value "1". how do I do it so that it prints using the format 'a' = 1 or if there is more than one vowel with the same number of occurences.
You could use  with an additional filter condition, testing whether the element is :But this way, you lose the information what character this count belongs to. Instead of your five different variables, you could create a dictionary, mapping vowels to their respective counts:And then again use  with a generator expression and a specific  function (to sort by the count, not by the vowel itself).If you are interested in the counts of all the letters, you could also use .
To minimally change your code:But you should use  instead will then be a tuple like EDIT:  If you want all of the most frequent items you can use This looks complicated, but all it's saying is take a list in sorted order and take all the tuples with the same second value and put them in a list.
A combination of Counter and operator might do the trick:
