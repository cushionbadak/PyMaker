This question already has an answer here:How do you create a random range, but exclude a specific number?                    5 answers                I am trying to use  to randomly generate a single  between a range, e.g. , however, it could possibly generate , which is not expected, so I am wondering is there a way to make it not equal to . Or just use a loop until  not generate , and get the output.cheers 
Don't use  then; it picks an integer from a continuous range of values, not a discrete set.Use the  function instead, passing in a list of just those integers you want to pick from:This'll return a random value from that list.
