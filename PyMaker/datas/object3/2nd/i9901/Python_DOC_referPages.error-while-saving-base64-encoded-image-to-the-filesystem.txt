I have tried to follow this example to save a base64 encoded image I receive in a HTTP request, to the filesystem:I have printed the string I'm trying to decode and it seems to be correct.But I keep getting this error
The  function expects bytes, not a  object. You'll need to encode your base64 string to bytes first. Since all characters in such a string are ASCII characters, just use that codec:From the  documentation:Decode the -like object s, which must contain one or more lines of base64 encoded data, and return the decoded .
