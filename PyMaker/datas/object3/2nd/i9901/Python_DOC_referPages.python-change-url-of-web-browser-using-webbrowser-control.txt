Ok, I know that if you want to open a particular url using pyton you would run:But what if you want to change it to a different url in the web browser without opening a new window or a new tab in the web browser. Is there a way to do that?
And the docs says:If new is 0, the url is opened in the same browser window if possible.  If new is 1, a new browser window is opened if possible. If new is 2,  a new browser page (“tab”) is opened if possiblehttps://docs.python.org/3/library/webbrowser.html
