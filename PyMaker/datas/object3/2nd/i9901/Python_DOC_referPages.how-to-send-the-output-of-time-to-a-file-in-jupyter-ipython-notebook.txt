The magic command  produces the time it takes to execute a given code segment (statement) to the output cell in Jupyter Notebook. I would like this to be appended on to a specified file instead.My objective is to find the runtime of an algorithm in different settings. I am able to automate the parameters of the algorithm, although not able to store the output of the  (and ) magic command in a file for further processing.Is this possible?
Reposting as an answer: (but not ) has a  option which makes it return an object, so you can do:Then you can get the numbers from res and write them to a file however you wish.For more flexibility, use the timeit module in the standard library.
