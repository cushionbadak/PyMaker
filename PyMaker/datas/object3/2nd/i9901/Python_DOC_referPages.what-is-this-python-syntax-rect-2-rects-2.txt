This is slicing arrays in python, as e.g. explained here: Explain Python's slice notationIn you specific case, you have a numpy array, which is a 2D structure, so there are two dimensions on which you can slice. The individual slices are separated by the comma. Look at this code for a visualization:
To dissect what the expression is you have to consult the Python Language Reference. What it is is that the subexpressions  and  are slicings, then the expression  is two slicings joined by the comma operator (creating a tuple of two slicings).
