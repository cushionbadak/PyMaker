I'm trying to achieve the following code but in a more pythonic way. Using generators I can manage to proceed based on a single list's items:...but I can't add the second comparison. I managed in the below to have a single additional criteria but I need to iterate over a list of additional criteria:How can I achieve this 'cleanly'?
You can avoid walking into subtrees that are excluded in the first place. This solution is also more robust than the original approach, assuming that testing for substrings to determine inclusion and exclusion of folders is not what is meant (do you really want to exclude the folder named "Criteria2345"?) Note however that if  is in the exclude-list it would be ignored in this implementation.
Combine two condition with  operator with another  call:or with another  call (with condition negated):BTW,  is a generator expression, not a list comrpehension.
this works perfectly:
