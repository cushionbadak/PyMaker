Ok, I have a directory with many files and subdirectories; among these ones there are 20 directories called , , ... until  that are the ones I am interested in.I want to write a program that iteratively goes into , do somethings, then to , do the same things, and so on.A solution with Python's  until 20 seems pretty inefficient.Besides, when I am in such directories, let's say for example , I want to create a variable that has in its name the number of the mbr where I am, in this case 12. Something like . (This  is used in what I am doing inside each directory, not relevant here).What I would need would be something like this (note this is pseudo-code):How can I do the loop and the variable naming? Thanks in advance.
What about something like this ?
Use :
You just need to concatenate '_files.dat' into the directory name
