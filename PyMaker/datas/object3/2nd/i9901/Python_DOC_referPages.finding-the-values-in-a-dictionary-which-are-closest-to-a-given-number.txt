New to python 3 and trying to play about with some dictionaries.What I'm going for is I have a dictionary with a lot of keys e.g.  but its really big. Now I'm given a value e.g.  and I want it to return ten dictionary elements have have the value closest to .Any ideas if it is possible to do this, and if so can some one point me on the right path?Sorry I have just realised that actually all I want to be returned is the key.
Yes.  With Python, use heapq.nsmallestFor more general answers, search web for 'n smallest'.  There are related answers already on SO.
