I am trying to figure out how to use a barely documented feature of a poorly documented API. I have distilled the chunk of code that is giving me trouble down to this for simplicity:I can tell from the function that constructs  that it is a list. Problem is, a list of what? No matter what I put in the list, key.get() raises one exception of another.For example, if I execute that code like so:  then I get an understandable error message: .Or, try a dictionary: , but the error is raised: .As best I can tell  is a list of some standard python objects - there is no indication that these are special objects with a custom  method.Am I missing something obvious? Is there some standard python object that has a  method which takes no positional arguments? Is this a syntax of some older version of Python? Or have I found a bug in the API?EditThe accepted answer shows that I was mistaken believing that  had to be a python built-in.Jack's answer is worth a look because it actually does solve the problem "what Python built-in could  be that would cause this function to not throw an error?"
Well... I found this in the github link you have provided Matter of fact, a lot of those classes have get methods. Since Python is duck typed, there isn't really a way to determine what object is correct, but you're just building a dictionary, so shouldn't matter too much 
AFAIK the only class with a  method that can take zero arguments is a .Which in your example is probably a  of s
