Basically, you create a file object by opening it and then do read or write operationTo read a line from a fileTo read all lines from fileTo write a file using python

After having the file object "f" the content of the file can be accessed by:To write a file in python, you need to "open" the file in write mode ("w") or append mode ("a"). If you choose write mode, the old content in the file is lost. If you choose append mode, the new content will be written at the end of the file:To write a string s to that file, we use the write command:In your case, it would probably something like:I would recommend follow the official documentation as pointed out by cricket_007 : https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files
