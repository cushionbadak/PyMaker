So I have an assignment, and For a specific section, we are supposed to import a .py file into our program."You will need to import histogram.py into your program."Does that simply mean to create a new python file and just copy and past whatever is in the histogram.py into the file? This part of my assignment is to create a graphical display with the contents in the .py file (which confuses me too) I was reading the chapters from the tb and it states how to create a window, but I havent seen anything about importing.. Sorry if this is a dumb question
You have to create your own python file and simply addat the top of the file (or lets say in the "import" section).Yout don't need the .py extension. Make sure the histogram.py file is in the same folder like your created py file.
You need to make sure you have the files you need before you try and import them, either downloading them or getting them through pyget. Once you have your files then you need to call them (2.7 docs)
All you have to do is paste the file named histogram.py to your working directory and to use the file on your code just type  on the top most line of your main code file then you can use anything(functions and variables) from histogram.py.
