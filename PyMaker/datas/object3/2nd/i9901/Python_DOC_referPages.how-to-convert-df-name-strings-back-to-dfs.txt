I have several dataframes, such as df1, df2 etc. then i made a list of the names of these df's like Now, I want to use these df's in a function "my_func()" ...How can i express the list of dataframes in a loop, so that i can call different df's in my_func? (the way below does't work, since I'm calling strings instead of df's...)Thanks!
I would argue that storing the name of your data-sets as strings, and then try to pass the string as a argument is counter productive.Instead, what I would do is create a dictionary with all your data-sets as values to string keys, and pass the dictionary objects into your function.Another nifty thing with dictionaries and functions is that you can expand the dictionary as named parameters right off the bat.But that's just a little side note.
So i figured out...Just need to use eval():
