Natural Text
I'm trying to do problem #22 in python and my answer is off. I've gone through the list and tried certain names and they've been calculated correctly (I think). Can anyone help??Problem:Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 46K text  file containing over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it  into alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for  each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the  list to obtain a name score.For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN,  which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the  list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
Your indexing is off by one.  is at index  on  based indexing but the assignment uses  based indexing. You could fix the issue by changing your code a bit:
It's off-by-one error. In the code: starts from , while the name should start counting from , use  instead.
