Natural Text
I am trying to make my program locate a flower within a text file. The file tells the user how many flowers of that type are in stock. I can make it do this by printing the information, but is there any way the computer can put the information into a new text file first and then print the text file?Here is the text file which contains the flowers and their stock level (and some other numbers to do with how many need to be in stock)Here is the program I have so far, which only prints what i need to find instead of making a new text file:
