When passing a list as an argument in function, why is the following list not changed?The function is returning , not . Why is this happening? Is this something to do with call by value?
Why creating another function?You can just do thisHowever if you want to create another function. You have to call it.
As Blue Monday says, there's no need to create a new function for this, you should just call the  function. However, here are a couple of other ways to fix your code.outputNote that  expects us to pass in the items to sort as individual arguments. We can pass it a list (or tuple) by using the  "splat" operator in the function call. See Unpacking Argument Lists in the official Python tutorial.
because the argument of your function is specified as *a, which is like saying your argument is a tuple of undefined dimensionwhen you try to sort a tuple with a nested list, the value will not changeinfact as result you got a list of list (you got [[3, 2, 1]] not [3, 2, 1])if you try this, it will work
