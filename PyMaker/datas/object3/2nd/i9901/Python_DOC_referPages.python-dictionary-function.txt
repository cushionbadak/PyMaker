This question already has an answer here:Why is the order in dictionaries and sets arbitrary?                    6 answers                The code is this and the output is two but I can't figure out why that is the output.
Dictionaries have no sense of ordering, so if you're checking if a value is a particular number, there's no guarantee you'll get the key that you're expecting to find if you have duplicate values. If you want to Guarantee that a dictionary will be ordered, you can use collections.OrderedDict: https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict
While inserting the elements into the dictionary, they are not ordered. If you run your code multiple times, it would give you a varied result of 'one' and 'two'. If your intention was to get all the key's for that value, you can store them in a list and return them.
