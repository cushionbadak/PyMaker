here's my codei took it from my teacher's slide, it took an integer (radius) when called (a = Circle(25) -for example) then return --Circle with radius 25-- when i print itthe problem is when i do that, instead getting it, i got an error saying that self_radius is not defined (in str method), so the question is how to use a variable in different method than it's origin?Thank you
Qualify instance attributes with , not :If you name the variable , it become local variable; not accessible from another method.
