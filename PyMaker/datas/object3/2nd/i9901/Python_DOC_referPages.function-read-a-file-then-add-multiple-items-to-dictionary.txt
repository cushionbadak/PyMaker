Trying create a function to read a file and add additional multiple items to it into an organized dictionary then return it without changing the original dictionary. Not sure if I'm doing it correctly with the multiple items and values.Returns:Example file:Code I have so far:Restrictions:Asciibetical order:  Is sorted in ASCIIcollated order rather than alphabetical order.No imports/collections/modules. Just basic built in functions, loops, and dict methods.
As we discussed in the comments, your main problem is figuring out where to place the new painting in the list of an artist's paintings based on it's title.It appears to me, that this is some kind of a homework question, since there is no reason for these constraints in a real world setting. Because of that I'm not going to give you the full solution, but point you in the right direction (at least I'll try to).Your algorithm should look something like this:Get a dictionary with the name of the artist as the key and a list of his paintings as values. Each painting consists of , , , ,  and .Given a new set of , , , , ,  and  you retrieve the list of that artists work.Now your problem is to find out where to add the new painting (if it doesn't already exist).You loop through all paintings in the aforementioned list. For each entry you check if the  of the new work should be inserted before the current  using the -function below. If yes () you insert it. If the result is  it is already in the list and you return the dictionary. If the result is  you move on to the next item of the list. If there are no more items you append it to the end.This is the  function:I don't know how you'd like to handle numbers in the comparison, feel free to add them to the  variable.
