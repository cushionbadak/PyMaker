Natural Text
I've searched answers on here and tried implementing them but I think that there is some tiny detail I'm missing. I have a very short python code for a program that is supposed to return the initials with periods of a persons input(for their full name). So for example, input is Atticus Leonard Beasley and output should be but instead I'm getting:Here's my code:
FYI, you can do this using  and :Or using list comprehension:
I think you can do that in a easier and "more pythonic" way.EXPLANATIONSInstead of doing a  loop over each letters of the name, you can use split() function to be sure to took care of every words without the extra spaces.Now, you try to verify if the first letter is an , but if the user enter his name without , your function does not work. An easier solution will be to extract the first letter of the word  and automatically add an : Maybe the one-liner solution is confusing, but most of the python developers use   over  loops when the solution is easily readable.EDITOne more thing, even if you are writing a simple function such as print the initials of a name, you should always write tests accordingly.A good way to start is to use doctests because it forces you to describe what your function does. Even if you think it's a waste of times, it helps to overcome many problems when your program is getting bigger. I'd be please to help you if you want to try to write your first
