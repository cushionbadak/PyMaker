this adds 30 minutes to the time such as 07:39but gives me "1900-01-01 08:09:00". How do I get it to give "08:09:00"The important thing for me is the format - the code works and adds 30 minutes (as has been pointed out) I want to remove "1900-01-01" from this and leave only 08:09:00. I can't get strptime to work to do this. HOUR_ON will print 07:39 before I usewhen I have finished though I want "08:09:00". thanksAdditionif update the code toI still get 1900-01-01 08:09:00
This code is tested on both python 2 and python 3:The above code prints the following to standard output showing that it works even when the next day is fewer than 30 minutes after the input time:
works fine for me. I do not see any issues with your code. May be re-check the HOUR_ON variable
If I understand this correctly, after I included answer from Seth, I then split the time and joined it together again as an int to get my answer with 30 minutes added in the format I needed - thanks everybody (even the -'s)
