I'm trying to learn the difference between class variables and init ones. I understand the class variables are usually static and can change. I would like to know why when you print the Variable Accounts after it had been changed by the instance of Sam it has changed for David.HOWEVER, whenever you update the balance for Sam, it does not change for David. Thank you.    
To illustrate the answers given:  you can check to see if objects are the same thing using id() or the is operator.Naming and Binding is a good read.And the Classes section of the Tutorial may provide insight.
Whenever you assign an attribute to an instance, it becomes an instance variable (not shared by any other instance), even if it was a class variable before.  This is what happened in the case of .  However,  is an entirely different situation - you did not assign anything, the Accounts list is exactly the same object as it was before, still a class variable.  You simply made a change to the contents of that list, which is visible no matter how you retrieve the list.
Integer in Python is not mutable, so when , this will add instance variable  to instance , not change the class variable.
