By default  will return the PID of the shell (ie the parent process). What you're looking for is the PID of the child process (sshpass).So set  in . Documentation is here.
Just call the  directly from  and pass in the  option. Then the direct child will the be the  subprocess. No need for a shell wrapper. 
Using  I would simply call the  option.
