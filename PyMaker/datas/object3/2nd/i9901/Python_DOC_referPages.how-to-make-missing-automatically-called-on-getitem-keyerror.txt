I'm writing a class that emulates a mapping object.  It has the following functions.I would think that a call to  would also call . But since I've overridden  I have to do thisIt seems that the  hook is not wrapped into calls to  but instead built inside .  This makes the  hook only useful for classes that extend dict.  In my case it makes no sense and I should just implement the missing functionality inside the try/except.Is there a way to make  automatically call  on a ?
Per the docs:Called by  to implement  for dict subclasses when key is not in the dictionary.Basically, if you're not a  subclass, or you are, but you overloaded  without delegating up the inheritance chain to , then  means nothing, because nothing checks for it. You can't make it call  implicitly unless you're a  subclass.If you're writing your own mapping class, and you want it to do something like , you don't really need to have a  at all, just put the handling code in your :That behaves the way you expected (note: It does not update ). You could use  to shorten it to just:
