I'm switching from R to Python for new machine learning project I'm doing.I found one code architecture which seems ok (image below) but I have problems with with implementation if I want to keep my code DRY.So basically I have a piece of code (functions) that I want to share across different modules (namely ,  and s located under  module).That code in this case contains functions for loading and saving the data.The problem is that I cannot import functions from upper module (for example if I had  directly under  folder)I could add separate  inside every module (, , ) but that would defeat the purpose of me trying to create well structured project.I assume I'm not the only one with this issue.How is this usually handled?How do you create shared module that can be used by all most deeply nested modules? (I'd like to import the same module into , , , )EDIT:I also forgot to mention I use virtualenv and global space should not be contaminated.SOLUTION:So what I ended up doing was I added the following code to my top package  file:So whenever you use anything from the main package or the subpackage it is automatically linked (because when you import main package then  file is automatically called). And every module can make it's imports relative to top package.E.g: if  wants to import  it would do it like so:
You need to add your project to your system path so that python can find the module. This can be done within python:Then you will be able to call your modules with
You need to make  file in your directory would you make as a module. So  or whatever is in the folder that you can call with . I hope it works https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages
