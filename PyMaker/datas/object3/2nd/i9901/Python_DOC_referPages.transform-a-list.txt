The input:The desired output:
I've made a few assumptions here, and this is probably not the most elegant solution, but given that your matching None based on the length of space, this will workthis is currently implemented as a list comprehension, but could easily be spread over multiple lines for readability as sucheither method yields the same result:Bear in mind that any changes to the width of spaces used to define 'None' will impact the function of this implementation.
I will not answer your question right away because it is not how stackoverflow works but I will give you some hints.HINTSFirst, you can iterate over each line of your first list  using a  loop.Then, you need to split every numbers of this line, luckily for you, it took always 16 characters. In python, there is severals way to do so. A good training for you will be to use the  function in a  loop. Then use slicing in python strings.Now, it could remains some extra spaces in the beginning of every numbers. A good way to remove them is to use the  function. Last thing you need to do is to  every clean strings to a new list (e.g. )ENDI will edit my answer with a working function as soon as you edit yours with a proper try. Good luck!EDIT Since my namesake @Max Chesterfield already gave an answer, I'll give mine. Instead of using lists of list, you can use a generator to match exactly the desired outputWill output:
