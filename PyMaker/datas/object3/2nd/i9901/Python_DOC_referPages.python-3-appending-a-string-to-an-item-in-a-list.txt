After trying many different methods for this problem, such as nested  loops (which iterate over the first list as many times as the length of the second iteration), and I've tried  which I couldn't get to do what I wanted.Here is the problem... I am using two  loops to append the same list. The first  loop:Which gives me:the second  loop:Which gives me:What I actually want is:
The ErrorThe mistake you are making is that, by calling , you are always adding to the end of . But for your links, you don't want to add to the end of , you want to change the value of an element already in .The SolutionYou need something more like this:The Better SolutionBut this is verbose. There is no need to do two explicit -loops. You need the power of , which will merge your two separate lists into a single list of 2-tuples and do exactly the same as the above.
