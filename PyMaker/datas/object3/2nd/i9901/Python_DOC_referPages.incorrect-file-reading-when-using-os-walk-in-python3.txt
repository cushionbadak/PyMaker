I am crawling through folders using the  method. In one of the folders, there is a large number of files, around 100,000 of them. The files look like: . But they are read as . Indeed, when I open windows explorer to browse the folder, for the first several seconds the files look like , but then change their appearance to . This is a strange scenario.Now, I can't use  because all folders and and files are being read into python variables in the looping line. Here is a snippet of the code:In the last line, I get a file not found exception, saying that the file  does not exist. Has anyone run into this mysterious issue? Anyway to bypass this? What is the cause of this? Thank you.
You don't seem to be concatenating the actual folder name with the filenames. Try changing your code to: should be avoided like the plague. For one thing - if the changes suceeeds, it won't be the directory from which you are running your os.walk anymore - and then, a second  on another folder will fail (either stop your porgram or change you to an unexpected folder).Just add the folder name as prefixes, and don't try using chdir. Moreover, as for the comment from ShadowRanger above,  officially breaks if you  inside its iteration - https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.walk - that is likely the root of the problem you had.
