I want to read a csv file with each line dictated by a newline character ('\n') using Python 3. This is my code: This above code gave error: Reading these posts: CSV new-line character seen in unquoted field error, also tried these alternatives that I could think about: No luck of geting this correct yet. Any suggestions?I am also reading the documentation about newlineï¼š if newline='' is not specified, newlines embedded inside quoted fields will not be interpreted correctly, and on platforms that use \r\n line on write an extra \r will be added. It should always be safe to specify newline='', since the csv module does its own (universal) newline handling.So my understanding of this newline method is: 1) it is a necessity, 2) does it indicate the input file would be split into lines by empty space character? 
 is correct in all  cases, and failing to specify it is an error in many cases. The docs recommend it for the very reason you're encountering. doesn't mean "empty space" is used for splitting; it's specifically documented on the  function:If  is '', universal newlines mode is enabled, but line endings are returned to the caller untranslated.So with  all original  and  characters are returned unchanged. Normally, in universal newlines mode, any newline like sequence (, , or ) is converted to  in the input. But you don't want this for CSV input, because CSV dialects are often quite picky about what constitutes a newline (Excel dialect requires  only).Your code should be:If that doesn't work, you need to look at your CSV dialect and make sure you're initializing  correctly.
