I have a list of lists and need to find the max value in the last list and last value of each listThe code should find 5 as the max value however currently finds 6.
If you only want the last value in each row to count, only include that in the generator expression: takes the last value of a given row, and  produces the index of that last element.If you also need the last row, then add those elements in a separate sequence; you can use  to combine two generators:This does include that column in the last row twice, but for one extra value it's not worth slicing the last row for.
