I am a beginner and new to coding. I have an API in php gives the some meteo data retrieved from a meteo station. i want to have a python script which will call the API and print the results from the API in a file. Please suggest me the right coding approach. The API is:http://ewodr.wodr.poznan.pl/doradztwo/swd/meteo_api.php?dane={"token":"pcss","id":303,"operacja":"odczyt_doba"} 
Use the  library (for python 2) to fetch the data from the API. It could look something like this:or if JSON I have not used it with python 3 but I do not think there is a lot of changes.
