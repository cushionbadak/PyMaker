I've gotten use to using print in my python code to show contents of variable and checking the shell output.But i have now migrated all my work onto a online server. Pythonanywhere I don't have the foggiest idea how to do the same now?Can someone point me in the right direction?Print to web console? To a file? Or even to the shell session?Thanks
On production server your print statements will output log to your webserver log filesIn case of pythonanywhere there are three log filesAccess log:yourusername.pythonanywhere.com.access.log  Error log:yourusername.pythonanywhere.com.error.log  Server log:yourusername.pythonanywhere.com.server.logthose logs are accessible in your web tab page.The logs you are looking for will be in server.log
As mentioned in Serjik's answer you can see the output of the console via the server log link on PythonAnywhere.However the much better way to approach this is to use the Python logging module.. Using this module will solve many of these problems for you and solve many issues you may not have thought about (like thread safety). This lets you do things like filter log messages by severity and a whole bunch of other things.To get started with that I would recommend having a look at the basic logging tutorial.
