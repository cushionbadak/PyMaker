You can use the  argument to the  function to find the tuple with the smallest second value:Here a lambda expression is used to select the second item of each tuple and  uses that value in its comparisons.  returns the full tuple, so you can extract the first item using .You can also use :
This should work:So we are providing the method for tuple comparition
