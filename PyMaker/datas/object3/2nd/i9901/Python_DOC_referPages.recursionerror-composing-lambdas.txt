I am trying to write a function that composes any number of lambda functions. I have two simple lambda functions.My attempt at a composing function is this:My thinking was to loop through the variable number of functions, each time making the  function include a new function inside it.Then I could make a function that is a composition of  and So calling  should return , which is 26. But instead, I get I thought introducing an intermediate variable might fix the problem.But the same error is raised.Is there a way to fix this?
First, I think your approach will suffer from late closure binding, as  in lambda will only take the last value of function at the end of the iteration. Secondly,  will only call itself recursively in the end also due to the first reason;  - the lambda - calls the last value of  - itself!One possible fix is to bind  and  to the  at each iteration:But your overall problem looks like a good use case for :
