I need to get total space and used space of a SAN volume in Windows. There are too many volumes on the server to mount using the Windows letter mount points. Instead the server software mounts all available volumes in C:\Volumes path.is fast and works great, but it only lists the volumes mounted as Windows letters.returns the information I need, but it's very slow as it recurses through all the files. I have hundreds of thousands of files on each volume.is slow for the same reason as the dir command.Is there any other way to get fast stats on a volume from the Windows command line or even better from Python?
I think you are looking for  psutil (python system and process utilities) is a cross-platform  library for retrieving information on running processes and system  utilization (CPU, memory, disks, network) in Python. It is useful  mainly for system monitoring, profiling and limiting process resources  and management of running processes. It implements many  functionalities offered by command line tools such as: ps, top, lsof,  netstat, ifconfig, who, df, kill, free, nice, ionice, iostat, iotop,  uptime, pidof, tty, taskset, pmap. It currently supports Linux,  Windows, OSX, Sun Solaris, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD, both 32-bit  and 64-bit architectures, with Python versions from 2.6 to 3.5 (users  of Python 2.4 and 2.5 may use 2.1.3 version). PyPy is also known to  work.https://pythonhosted.org/psutil/And for you, particulary this part of the documentation : https://pythonhosted.org/psutil/#disks
You can get the requried data from the below script. Enter all the volumes in your system in the array $DriveLetter and  it doesn't take much time to execute   Hope it HElps.
