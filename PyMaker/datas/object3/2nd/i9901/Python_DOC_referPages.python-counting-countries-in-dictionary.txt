I'm writing a function that counts the number of times a country appears in a dictionary and returns the country that appeared the most. If more then one country appears the most then it should return a list of the countries.Example dictionary: Since France, Italy, and Spain all only appear once in this dictionary the function should returnIf one of those countries had instead appeared 2 or 3 times the function would return just that country. The current code I have below instead searches for the artist that appears the most but I believe a couple small changes could help me instead return the country that appears the most. Does anyone have advice on how to do this? Thanks for the helpCode:

Flatten the values to get a list of the countries:And a  can give you the most frequent ones directly:
