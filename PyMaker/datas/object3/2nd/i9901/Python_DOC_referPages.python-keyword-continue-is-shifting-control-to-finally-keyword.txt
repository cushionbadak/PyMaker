I am actually new to python. While learning it I came across this piece of code.Python official document says when encounter with continue statement, control will shift to the beginning of the loop, but in this case it is shifting to final statement and executing from there onward. Is this a bug in python or what? Can somebody please explain this to me? Thanks.      
This is stated in the documentation for the  statement:When continue passes control out of a try statement with a finally clause, that finally clause is executed before really starting the next loop cycle.(Emphasis mine)Yes, without the  loop present, you'd have a  popping up; since  is inside the  and  always gets a chance at finalizing things; it gets executed on the way out.
The  code is always executed in a  block.The  doesn't skip it (or it would be a bug in python).
The  clause must be executed no matter what happens, and so it is.This is why it's called : it doesn't matter whether what you have tried succeeded or raised an exception, it is always executed.
finally will be executed always in a try/exept no matter what is the exception.I think this material will help you https://docs.python.org/2.5/whatsnew/pep-341.html
