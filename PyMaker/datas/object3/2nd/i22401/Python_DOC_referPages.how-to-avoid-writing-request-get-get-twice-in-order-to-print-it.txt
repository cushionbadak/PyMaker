I come from a PHP background and would like to know if there's a way to do this in Python. In PHP you can kill 2 birds with one stone like this:Instead of:I can do this:You check to see if  exists AND if it does, you assign it to a variable in one statement.I wanted to know if there's a way to do this in Python? So instead of doing this:avoid writing  twice.
Probably not exactly what you were thinking, but...this?
See my 8-year-old recipe here for just this task.
A variation on Alex's answer:Usage:or if you prefer an alternative interface:I would find this helpful to test a series of regular expressions in an if-elif-elif-elif etc construct, as in this SO question:
There's no way of doing assignment and conditionals in one go...
If get() throws an exception when it's not there, you could do 
Well, this would be one wayA briefer (but not superior, due to the call to print of nothing) way would be

a possible way to do it, without necessity to set the variable before, could be like:.. it's just for fun - this method should not be used, because it is ugly hack, difficult to understand at first sight, and it creates/overwrites a global variable (only if the condition is met, though)
Simply try:which basically prints nothing if the first argument is not present (see ).Alternative solution would be to use a conditional expression in Python:but you'll end up repeating variable twice, for example:For variable assignments in loops, check in here.
PEP 572 introduces Assignment Expressions. From Python 3.8 and onwards you can write:Here are some more examples from the Syntax and semantics part of the PEP:
