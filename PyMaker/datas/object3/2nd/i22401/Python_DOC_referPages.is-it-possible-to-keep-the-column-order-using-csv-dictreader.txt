For example, my csv has columns as below:I need to write the columns back in the same order. The  jumbles the order immediately, so I believe it's more of a problem with the reader.
Python's s do NOT maintain order prior to 3.6 (but, regardless, in that version the  class was modified to return s).However, the instance of  that you're using (after you've read the first row!-) does have a  list of strings, which IS in order.So,will show you that the order is indeed maintained (in  of course, NEVER in the  -- that's intrinsically impossible in Python!-).So, suppose you want to read  and write  with the same column order.  Using plain reader and writer is too easy, so you want to use the Dict varieties instead;-). Well, one way is...:assuming you have headers in  (otherewise you can't use a DictReader on it) and want just the same headers in .

Make an  from each row  sorted by .
I know this question is old...but if you use , you can pass it an ordered list with the fieldnames to the  param
Unfortunatley the default DictReader does not allow for overriding the dict class, a custom DictReader would do the trick thoughuse it like so
