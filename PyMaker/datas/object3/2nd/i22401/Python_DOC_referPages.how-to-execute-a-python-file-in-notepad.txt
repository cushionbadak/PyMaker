I prefer using Notepad ++ for developing,How do I execute the files in Python through Notepad++?
First option: (Easiest, recommended)Open Notepad++. On the menu go to: Run -> Run.. (F5). Type in:Now, instead of pressing run, press save to create a shortcut for it.NotesIf you have Python 3.1: type in  instead of Add  if you want the command line window to stay open after the script has finishedSecond optionUse a batch script that runs the Python script and then create a shortcut to that from Notepad++.As explained here: http://it-ride.blogspot.com/2009/08/notepad-and-python.htmlThird option: (Not safe)The code opens “HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Python\PythonCore”, if the key exists it will get the path from the first child key of this key.Check if this key exists, and if does not, you could try creating it.
@Ramiz Uddin's answer definitely deserves more visibility : Open Notepad++On the menu go to: Run → Run.. (F5)Type in: 
Here is what's worked for me:Open notepad++ and press F5. You'll get a little popup box:Type: C:\Python27\python.exe -i "$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)" for Python 2.7.and then Save As..., and pick your own key combo to start it each time you want to run something
First install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/Run the installer** IMPORTANT ** Be sure you check both :Install launcher for all usersAdd Python 3.6 to pathClick install now and finish the installation.Open notepad++ and install plugin PyNPP from Plugin Manager. I'm using N++ 6.9.2Save a new file as new.pyType in N++Press Alt+Shift+F5Simple as that.
On the menu go to: "Run" --> "Run..." (or just press F5).For Python 2 type in:For Python 3 type in:References:To understand the  command better:Another helpful link to understand the  command: How do I run python 2 and 3 in windows 7?Thanks to Reshure for his answer that got me on the right track to figure this out. 
I use the NPP_Exec plugin (Found in the plugins manager). Once that is installed, open the console window (ctrl+~) and type:This will launch command prompt. Then type:to execute the current file you are working with.
None of the previously proposed solutions worked for me. Slight modification needed.After hitting F5 in Notepad++, type:The command prompt stays open so you can see the output of your script.
All the answers for the Run->Run menu option go with the "/K" switch of cmd, so the terminal stays open, or "-i" for python.exe so python forces interactive mode - both to preserve the output for you to observe.Yet in  you have to type  to close it, in the  - . If that is too much typing for your liking (for me it sure is :), the Run command to use is - obviously the full path to your python install (or just  if you want to go with the first executable in your user's path). is unconditional execution of the next command in Windows - unconditional as it runs regardless of the RC of the previous command ( is "and" - run only if the previous completed successfully,  - is "or"). - prints "Press any key to continue . . ." and waits for any key (that output can be suppressed if need). - well, types the exit for you :)So at the end,  runs  which executes the current file and keeps the window opened,  waits for you to press any key, and  finally close the window once you press that any key.
I wish people here would post steps instead of just overall concepts. I eventually got the cmd /k version to work.The step-by-step instructions are:In NPP, click on the menu item: RunIn the submenu, click on: RunIn the Run... dialog box, in the field The Program to Run, delete any existing text and type in: cmd /K "$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)"The /K is optional, it keeps open the window created when the script runs, if you want that.Hit the Save... button.The Shortcut dialogue box opens; fill it out if you want a keyboard shortcut (there's a note saying "This will disable the accelerator" whatever that is, so maybe you don't want to use the keyboard shortcut, though it probably doesn't hurt to assign one when you don't need an accelerator).Somewhere I think you have to tell NPP where the Python.exe file is (e.g., for me: C:\Python33\python.exe). I don't know where or how you do this, but in trying various things here, I was able to do that--I don't recall which attempt did the trick.
No answer here, or plugin i found provided what i wanted. A minimalist method to launch my python code i wrote on Notepad++ with the press of a shortcut, with preferably no plugins.I have Python 3.6 (64-bit), for Windows 8.1 x86_64 and Notepad++ 32bit. After you write your Python script in Notepad++ and save it, Hit F5 for . Then write: and hit the Run button. The  flag forces the terminal to stay still after code execution has terminated, for you to inspect it. This command will launch the script in a cmd terminal and the terminal will still lie there, until you close it by typing . You can save this to a shortcut for convenience (mine is CTRL + SHIFT + P). 
I also wanted to run python files directly from Notepad++.Most common option found online is using builtin option . Then you have two options:Run python file in console (in Windows it is Command Prompt) with code something like this (links:   ):(If your console window immediately closes after running then you can add  to your code. Links:    ) This works fine, and you can even run files in interactive mode by adding  to your code (links:        ). Run python program in IDLE with code something like this (links:    , in these links  is used, but I am using  instead, because  sets the right current working directory automatically):Actually, this doesn't run your program in IDLE Shell, but instead it opens your python file in IDLE Editor and then you need to click  (or click F5) to run the program. So it opens your file in IDLE Editor and then you need run it from there, which defeats the purpose of running python files from Notepad++.But, searching online, I found option which adds '-r' to your code (links:     ):This will run your python program in IDLE Shell and because it is in IDLE it is by default in interactive mode.Problem with running your python files via builtin  option is thateach time you run your python file, you open new console or IDLE window and lose all output from previous executions. This might not be important to some, but when I started to program in python, I used Python IDLE, so I got used to running python file multiple times in same IDLE Shell window. Also problem with running python programs from Notepad++ is that you need to manually save your file and then click  (or press F5). To solve these problems (AFAIK*) you need to use Notepad++ Plugins. The best plugin for running python files from Notepad++ is NppExec. (I also tried PyNPP and Python Script. PyNPP runs python files in console, it works, but you can do that without plugin via builtin  option and Python Script is used for running scripts that interact with Notepad++ so you can't run your python files.) To run your python file with NppExec plugin you need to go to  and then type in something like this (links:  ):With NppExec you can also save your python file before run with  command, set working directory with  command or run python program in interactive mode with  command. I found many links (    ) online that mention these options, but best use of NppExec to run python programs I found at NppExec's Manual which has chapter  with this code:All you need to do is copy this code and change your python directory if you use some other python version (e.g.* I am using python 3.4 so my directory is ). This code works perfectly, but there is one line I added to this code so I can run python program multiple times without loosing previous output: is to enable the "append" mode which keeps the previous Console's text and does not clear it. turns off console's internal messages (those are in green color)The final code that I use in NppExec's Execute window is:You can save your NppExec's code, and assign a shortcut key to this NppExec's script. (You need to open Advanced options of NppExec's plugin, select your script in the  drop-down list, press the , restart Notepad++ , go to Notepad++'es  ->  -> , select your script, click  and assign a shortcut key. I wanted to put  as my shortcut key, to do that you need to change shortcut key for builtin option  to something else first.) Links to chapters from NppExec's Manual that explain how to save you NppExec's code and assign a shortcut key: , .P.S.*: With NppExec plugin you can add  (found in ) that highlight certain lines. I use it to highlight error lines in red, to do that you need to add :  and  like this.
There is one issue that I didn't see resolved in the above solutions. Python sets the current working directory to wherever you start the interpreter from. If you need the current working directory to be the same directory as where you saved the file on, then you could hit F5 and type this:Except you would replace C:\Users\username\Python36-32\python.exe with whatever the path to the python interpreter is on your machine.Basically you're starting up command line, changing the directory to the directory containing the .py file you're trying to run, and then running it. You can string together as many command line commands as you like with the '&' symbol.
My problem was, as it was mentioned by copeland3300, that my script is running from notepad++ folder, so it was impossible to locate other project files, such as database file, modules etc. I solved the problem using standard notepad++ "Run" command (F5) and typing in:Python WAS in my PATH. Cmd window stayed open after script finished.
I started using Notepad++ for Python very recently and I found this method very easy. Once you are ready to run the code,right-click on the tab of your code in Notepad++ window and select "Open Containing Folder in cmd". This will open the Command Prompt into the folder where the current program is stored. All you need to do now is to execute:python This was done on Notepad++ (Build 10 Jan 2015).I can't add the screenshots, so here's a blog post with the screenshots - http://coder-decoder.blogspot.in/2015/03/using-notepad-in-windows-to-edit-and.html
In Notepad++, go to Run → Run..., select the path and  file of your Python installation:add a space and this:and here you are!Video demostration:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJipYE1JT38
Extending Reshure's answerOpen Run → Run... from the menubar in Notepad++ (shortcut: F5)In the given space, enter: Click Runta da!
Got it to work by just. Using the name "python" and not the full directory. Now I can read The 'Stack traces' and errors in my programThis Works Perfect:Cmd /k python "$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)"-python is already in my path-so no need to use the full path("c:/python27/python.exe")Although this will work, but it will make it difficult to read Stack traces and error Types in my program.
