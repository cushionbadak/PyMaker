Is there a one-liner to read all the lines of a file in Python, rather than the standard:Seems like this is done so often that there's got to be a one-liner. Any ideas?
This will slurp the content into a single string in Python 2.61 and above: And this will create a list of lines:These approaches guarantee immediate closure of the input file right after the reading.Footnote:This approach can also be used in Python 2.5 using .An older approach that does not guarantee immediate closure is to use this to create a single string:And this to create a list of lines:In practice it will be immediately closed in some versions of CPython, but closed "only when the garbage collector gets around to it" in Jython, IronPython, and probably some future version of CPython.
If you are on Python3, make sure you properly respect your file's input encoding, e.g.:Find the list of codec names in the Python3 codec list.(The mechanism is also advisable for Python2 whenever you expect any non-ASCII input)
