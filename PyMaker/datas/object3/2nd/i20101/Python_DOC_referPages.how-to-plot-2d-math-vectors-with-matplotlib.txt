How can we plot 2D math vectors with ? Does anyone have an example or suggestion about that? I have a couple of vectors stored as 2D  arrays, and I would like to plot them as directed edges. The vectors to be plotted are constructed as below:Edit:I just added the plot of the final answer of  for anyone interested in the output and want to plot 2d vectors with matplotlib:
The suggestion in the comments by halex is correct, you want to use quiver (doc), but you need to tweak the properties a bit.
It's pretty straightforward.  Hope this example helps.Will produce:To plot the arrays you can just slice them up into 1D vectors and plot them. I'd read the full documentation of matplotlib for all the different options.  But you can treat a numpy vector as if it were a normal tuple for most of the examples.
