I'd love to use tuple unpacking on the right hand side in assignments:OF course, I can do:But I consider this cumbersome. Am I mising a point? An easy way?Is it planned to have this? Or is there a reason for explicitly not having it in the language?Part of the problem is that all container types use a constructor which expect an iterable and do not accept a *args argument. I could subclass, but that's introducing some non-pythonic noise to scripts that others are supposed to read.
This is fixed in Python 3.5 as described in PEP 448:
You could use add operator:
You have a few options, but the best one is to use list concatenation ():If you really want to be able to use the  syntax, you can create your own list wrapper:then you can call it as:I suppose the benefit here is that  doesn't need to be a list, it can be any Sequence type.
No, this is not planned. The  arbitrary parameter list (and  keyword arguments mapping) only applies to python call invocations (mirrored by  and  function signatures), and to the left-hand side of an iterable assignment.You can simply concatenate the two lists:
