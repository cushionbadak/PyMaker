Basically my question is say you have an list containing 'None' how would you try retrieving the sum of the list. Below is an example I tried which doesn't work and I get the error: . Thanks
You can use  functionUpdated from commentsTypically  usage is , but passing  as first argument is a special case, described in Python docs. Quoting:If function is None, the identity function is assumed, that is, all elements of iterable that are false are removed.
Remove  (and zero) elements before summing by using :To see why this works, see the documentation for :Construct a list from those elements of  for which  returns true.  may be either a sequence, a container which supports iteration, or an iterator. If iterable is a string or a tuple, the result also has that type; otherwise it is always a list. If function is , the identity function is assumed, that is, all elements of iterable that are false are removed.Note that  is equivalent to  if function is not  and  if function is .
Another suggestion:
Assuming you want to treat  as zero, a simple way is
You always have the option of just writing the loop you want:But it certainly doesnâ€™t hurt to know about  either.
Explicitly, this is equivalent to filter:That saves me from remembering another function.  :P
