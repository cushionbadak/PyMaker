Natural Text
I'm trying to combine a string with a series of numbers as tuples to a list.For example, starting with:  I want to turn that into:I tried:but this returned:
You can iterate over each position within a string so  causes the behavior you were seeing previously.
If you want to use , then create a list for your string variable before multiplying: creates one long string, and  then iterates over that to pull out individual characters. By multiplying a list instead, you get a list with  separate references to the  value; iteration then gives you  each time.You could also use  to give you  repeatedly:This avoids creating a new list object, potentially quite large.
