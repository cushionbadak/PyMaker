I could see the path I had just added, and when I tried to import this file from another directory path like this:it worked just fine, but once I came out of , entered it again, and checked the , I saw that the path which I had added was not present, so can anyone let me know how to add a path to sys.path permanently in python. Thank you in advance for your help. 
There are a few ways.  One of the simplest is to create a  file (as described here).  This is just a file with the extension  that you put into your system  directory.  On each line of the file you put one directory name, so you can put a line in there with  and it will add that directory to the path.You could also use the PYTHONPATH environment variable, which is like the system PATH variable but contains directories that will be added to .  See the documentation.Note that no matter what you do,  contains directories not files.  You can't "add a file to ".  You always add its directory and then you can import the file.
