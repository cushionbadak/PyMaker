In Python, callingresults in a list in which each element is a line in the file. Its a little stupid but still:  also writes newline character to each element, something I do not wish to happen. How can I avoid it? 
You can read the whole file and split lines using :Or you can strip the newline by hand:Note: this last solution only works if the file ends with a newline, otherwise the last line will lose a character.This assumption is true in most cases (especially for files created by text editors, which often do add an ending newline anyway).If you want to avoid this you can add a newline at the end of file:Or a simpler alternative is to  the newline instead:Or even, although pretty unreadable:Which exploits the fact that the return value of  isn't a boolean, but the object that was evaluated true or false.The  method is actually equivalent to:Since  keeps the newline also  keeps it.Note: for symmetry to  the  method does not add ending newlines, so  produces an exact copy of  in .


I think this is the best option.
another example:Reading file one row at the time. Removing unwanted chars with from end of the string see also  and (python >= 2.0)
