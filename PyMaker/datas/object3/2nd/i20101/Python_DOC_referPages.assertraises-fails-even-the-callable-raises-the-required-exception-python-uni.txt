I have the following test-code checking for an exception raising in a function. I expect the test to pass, but a failure is indicated instead. Here is the test code:When  is called in the assert statement,  is raised (can be checked easily). So, the  test should pass the test, as  failes with , BUT:I do not see something wrong, so I would appreciate some input on this problem.
 calls the function for you. By calling it yourself, the exception is raised before  can test it.Change your code to:and it'll work correctly. Alternatively, you can use  as a context manager (python 2.7 and up):Using  as a context manager has the added advantage that you can now retrieve the exception instance and perform further tests on it:
Due to the rules of the languages, the arguments are evaluated before the code of the called function is entered (and that's generally a good thing). Therefore,  can't catch exceptions occuring during evaluation of arguments. The workaround (in more than one API) is that you pass a callable to methods like , so they can evaluate it in a place they can control and where they can catch exceptions. If the entire argument is a method call, the magic of bound methods allows you to state this quite elegantly, without  or such silliness:
