I am not at all familiar with  but I am working on sending  through  code. I have the code but I need to pass   for it to actually work. Is there any service which provides a free  service that I leverage for testing out my code? I looked around to create my own  but couldn't find something that provides a step by step guide to create a . I want to create a free server(or if there is any free service) that will provide me with a host name( address) so that I can put that host name in my python code and execute it from any machine.If anyone can point me in the right direction it will be helpful.
You can use  linux command also here.See :https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.htmlhttps://support.google.com/a/answer/176600?hl=en
You need service like https://mailtrap.io/. You'll get SMTP server address (eventually port number) that you point your application to. All e-mails produced by your application will be then intercepted by mailtrap (thus not delivered to the real  address).They offer free variant that seems to be suitable for your needs.
