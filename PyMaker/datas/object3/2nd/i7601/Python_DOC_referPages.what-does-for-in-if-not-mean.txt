This question already has an answer here:What does “list comprehension” mean? How does it work and how can I use it?                    4 answers                There's a function I don't get:What does the last line mean? At first I thought it was "apply the function to  except the ones with name ", but I'm not sure.
This is a list comprehension with a condition. It has nothing to do with Tensorflow, it's just basic Python.Conditional list comprehensions take the formThis iterates over all elements in  for which  is true, assigning each to  in turn, evaluating , and making a new list of the results. It's equivalent toexcept that the list comprehension is cleaner code and possibly a bit faster to run.
It represents list comprehension expanded as the following:It is iterating through each item in  passed as list in Then, checking if string 'bias' is not in W.nameand then, doing(whatever) operation for tensorflow.
Let's break it down, it's convention in python:
Yes it is a list comprehension with a condition. List comprehensions can have multiple conditions.The general format for a list comprehension with a  condition is this,You can also have an  in the comprehensionNOTE: Your iterable can be To make things clear consider this simple example,Assume this is your  from your given code, also for understanding purposes let's say  is something similar to Now suddenly you decide I want a list x which has items from v but not in Wname. Hmmm... How to do that? Take a look below.Somewhat along these lines is what's happening in the code you mentioned above.
