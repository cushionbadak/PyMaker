I have a string like following:I want to convert it to a regular list like :and then I can parse it or do whatever can done with lists.I tried to split the string but it doesn't work becuase the result was a string.I even try to convert it using  function:but it doesn't return anything.Is there any (clean) way to convert this kind of string to appropriate list?
Use literal_eval after splitting the string around the . Please pay close attention to the extra space trailing the , as it is necessary to ensure that the  can properly process the string structure passed. Otherwise you will be faced with an exception of Solution:Output:Extra Note: I noticed you assigned your list in your example to a variable named list. Please be aware that list is a builtin name in Python and using that as a variable name will shadow the built-in and could lead to problems in your code. 
well in your case you can just slice string like list! cause ultimately it is list of characters.in your case you can just use x=x[x.index('['):] This will slice your string and then you can just use list_x = eval(x) to get actual list
Just  the string
