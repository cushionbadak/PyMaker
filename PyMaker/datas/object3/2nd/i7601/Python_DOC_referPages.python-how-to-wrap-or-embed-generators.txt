I'm trying to provide a unified interface for retrieving all files from a single directory or a list of directories. Questions:error says 'file' is still a generator regardless of the input being a single dir or a list of it. Why is it still a generator? is it possible to wrap or embed generators in functions? If so, how to make this work? Thanks!
You are yielding  each time:but  itself is a generator.In Python 3.3 and newer, use  instead:This delegates control to another generator. From the Yield expressions documentation:When  is used, it treats the supplied expression as a subiterator. All values produced by that subiterator are passed directly to the caller of the current generatorâ€™s methods.In older Python versions, including Python 2.x, use another loop:For more information on what  does, see PEP 380 -- Syntax for Delegating to a Subgenerator.Not that you really need the helper function, it does little more than just loop over the  results, you can do that directly. You also need to correct your function to actually use ; currently you are ignoring that argument, so you only get text files from the current working directory.Next, you want to use  instead of  to get the lazy evaluation over  rather than load all results into memory at once. I'd just turn a non-list  value into a list, then just use one loop:Now, instead of a single argument that is either a string or a list, I'd use a variable number of arguments instead, with the  parameter syntax:This can be called with 0 or more directories:
