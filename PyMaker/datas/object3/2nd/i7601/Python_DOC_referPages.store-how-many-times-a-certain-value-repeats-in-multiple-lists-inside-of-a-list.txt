I'm trying to grab the first value in a multiple lists inside a list and store how many times it repeats if it's more than once into a dictionary/hash.When I try the following:The value of  becomes:instead of:How would I obtain the above in python3? The original data sample would have over 20,000 lists inside one list instead of only the 4 listed above.EDIT:When I mention , i mean the particular place in each row which would be row[0], not just returning only 1 result in a dictionary. if there were multiple different values that repeated, it would lead to this, as I'm looking to store any repeated value, lets say if sw1950 was in 20 lists and jb1994 was in 393 lists it would be:
The reason your existing approach doesn't work is because you're trying to do this:Now, you think this will return  because 1 is present 3 times. However, this is what it returns:The reason is because those elements are in a nested list, and  does not count nested elements.Contrast the above with this:This makes sense, because those s aren't in a nested list.One workaround is to use the :Output:Now, you're free to poll this dict for counts of whichever item you like. If you want to extract duplicates, you can do this:This prints .  
You can use defaultdict:Output:using Counter:
Using :If you want to get duplicated key count only, filter them after creating Counter.
