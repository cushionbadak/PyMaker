If suppose I have a file full of functions in python naming basics.py which does not have a class inside it.and there's no   __init__() function too.Now if I want to access the functions of basics.py inside the views.py .How can I do that?
This is a common mistake because python 3 have stricter rules when it comes to relative imports.I assume you have a structure like this... where  is in the root of your project.Let's assume  looks like this.The ways you can import things from basic would then be ()I assumed here that  and  are located in the same package ().When you run a python project your current directory is added to the python path. You will either have to import all the way from the root of your project or use  to import from the local package/directory.Also notice in the example that you can import the entire module or just single functions/objects. When importing the entire  module you access it using  in the view. 
use:than use all the functions you want :)
