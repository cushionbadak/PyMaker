Is there any way to return a variable using any?Without using Any:With Any (Getting error since punctuation isn't initialised):
No,  only produces  or . If you need the matching elements, don't use , instead filter (like you did with your  loop).You could use a list comprehension first to do the filtering:or if you only need the first matching element, use the  function and a generator expression:The second argument to  is returned if the generator expression doesn't produce any values; so here  signals there was no matching punctuation (so  would have returned ).
No,  can only return True of False, if you need a variable use
