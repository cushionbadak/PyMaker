This question already has an answer here:Why is dictionary ordering non-deterministic?                    2 answers                I have the following  script:I run this script, and every 15 times, 2-4 times it gives me distincted results:Why this happens and how can I prevent it. This may be a reason of some raise conditions which are strongly unwelcome.My Python version is 3.5.2.My question DOES NOT regard specific order, just deterministic one.
 is not  ordered, and can display arbitrary ordering.... you should read about : https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html
Although dictionaries are deterministically ordered in Python from version 3.6 on (but not before), you should not rely on that fact.If you need a dictionary like type that guarantees order, use  or sort the keys before iterating over them."Ordered" in both cases means: remembers the order entries were added.
