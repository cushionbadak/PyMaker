I have a directoryHow can I read these dat files into separate variables?So far:So, How can I get the full path of all the filesAnd import them (np.fromfile?)Any "smarter" way to do this?I come from an R/dataframe background and would prefer to mimic something near that.
You can get full path by replacing  with  variable contains the directory path in which files listed in  are located.Correct loop implementation would be:Storing results can be done using  if you want to access them by file name
Use glob to find all files in subdirectories, the walking over the list and storing names and content. Its  option allows the token  to match any path which includes subdirectories into the search.This cute single generator also allows us to express this in a nice pythonic form
