Using the  library to run a second process, how can I keep that process running after closing the initial one? I swear it originally did that, and I had to enable the daemon option so that it would close properly, but now I can't seem to separate them.Here's some simple code that has the problem. Hitting close on the main window will also close the second process, but as far as I'm aware that should only happen if daemon is set to True.I'm aiming for the script to run on all platforms, so as the multiprocessing part is a big chunk of the code, I'd prefer to keep it fairly universal.
You can simply use :You can use signals, pipes, and sockets (Unix sockets) to communicate.multiprocessing.Process tries to make your life easier, but it seldom does. I would advise you not to use it at all.
