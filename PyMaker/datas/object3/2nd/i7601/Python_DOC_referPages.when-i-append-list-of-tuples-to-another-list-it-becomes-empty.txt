When I try to add list of tuples to another list it becomes empty. Exactly in this line:Terminal printsI want to append lists of tuples to another list. So I would have:Any of you have any idea why? Thanks
 empties the list, yes.You have one list object that you keep filling and emptying, and you add references to another list. You are not creating copies here:Create new list objects:Python names are just references; you may want to read up on how Python's memory model works, I strongly recommend Ned Batchelder's Facts and myths about Python names and values.Your code is doing a lot of redundant splitting too. Use the fact that Python  loops are for each constructs; there is no need to generate an index when you can just loop over the list itself:Note that there is no need to use ; all you do is re-combine the first and second element of the  split result.If you were to use list comprehensions, that could be further reduced to:
Try this: Or...If you're on python3, you may also tryWhat your current code is doing is, appending the list to the bigger list, and then clearing it using . Now, since the references are the same, you end up clearing the contents of what you stored inside the bigger list too.Observe:You've gotten an empty list because you appended and then cleared the original. Now, this is what happens when you make a copy of the list:
