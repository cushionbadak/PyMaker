I am trying to copy all .csv files within a parent folder and all sub-folders within, to a new destination ("C:/Projects/CSVFiles").I have used the following code(from elsewhere on the forum) but this only copies the .csv files in the parent directory (DataFiles) and not from the sub-folders within /datafiles/. Any advice appreciated. Thanks

Python 2.2 to 3.4Ref: Use a Glob() to find files recursively in Python?
