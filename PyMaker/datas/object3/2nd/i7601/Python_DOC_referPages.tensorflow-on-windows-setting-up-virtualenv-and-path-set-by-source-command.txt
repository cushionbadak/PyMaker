I am attempting to train a TensorFlow model in Windows 10 using these steps: https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/attention_ocr#requirementsI have installed virtualenv for Windows (following this example)The source command is not recognized by Windows, what needs to be done so that when I run the subsequent steps so that python sees what virtulenv created? Is there something related to the 'source' command needed in Windows? I can see virtualenv created the ~/.tensorflow folder, but I do not see a 'bin/activate' folder inside that. I tried adding the full path to ~/.tensorflow to my Windows PATH, but I still get the following error when I run the train on inception_v3.ckpt:
Since you are running TensorFlow on Windows, I would guess that you are using Python 3.x. The  module was removed in Python 3.0, so the code you are running appears not to be compatible with Python 3.x. I would recommend filing an issue on the GitHub repository, but you may be able to fix it by replacing  with , and any uses of  with .
