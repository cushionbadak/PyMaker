This question already has an answer here:Writing to module-wide variable                    2 answers                I am trying to pass a python script variables from another python script in a python script. What I am trying to do in code form:file1.pyfile2.pyfile3.pyBut I always get the error x is not defined. If I import file1 in file2 and run it, it works, but if I run file2 from file3 it does not work.Help would be much appreciated :)
You don't have to use .file1.pyfile2.pyfile3.pyBut if it was me, I'd guess you want something like this:file1.pyfile2.pyfile3.pyAs you can see, you just have to play around with explicit imports depending on what you need to accomplish. However, this looks weird and I can't recommend it to anyone because either one of file1.py or file2.py seem to be useless. Here's the doc about imports
