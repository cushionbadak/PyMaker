I have below two input file examples:Now in case 1 i have only one start and end value that is 01 and 05Functions I have is func1 to func13 . I have provided two examples  Now program execution is stopped for some reasons in case2  input example .It got executed one time  and stopped.Now I need to provide option to user to start execution from where it got stopped.Users knows where it got stopped.I will provide options like this:In above example user selected , and then again he selected .Now my program execution must be start from user input.Please help, as previous I have confused all so I came with input and output expected. Hope this time it will be clear.
Since your functions have varying number of arguments, I would wrap them in  objects and then construct some sort of structure to access them:This lacks error detection of the input and could be done a lot better as a whole, but it should be enough to get you started.
