I have a python script  that I wrote. In which directory can I put that script so that I can use  without getting any error. I am using Windows system with anaconda.
In case of conda environments on windows you can simply check where the external packages for conda (or that conda environment) are installed.For example type something like this into the Python prompt of your conda environment:That gives you the path where you're normal packages would be installed (well, minus the  part). So if I put a file in that directory, in my case  then I can load it.Just make sure that you really import a package that has been installed with  in that environment!For example:C:\Anaconda\envs\work\lib\site-packages\fun.pyPython prompt (again)That will make the file accessible for the corresponding  environment (and just there).
