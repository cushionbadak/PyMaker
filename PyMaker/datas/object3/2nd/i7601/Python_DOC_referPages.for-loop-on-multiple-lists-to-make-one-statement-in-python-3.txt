If this is a duplicate question, I am sorry. I have spent a good hour trying to find the answer and tested a couple theories with no success. Without posting my whole code I'm working on, I'll just post the snippet. Basically I need to print these for loop statements all into one line to run for each employee. i.e. 'Employee Sam is 31 years old, their job title is Data Analyst and they make $90,000 annually. Their 2017 bonus will be $2,700."
You can use  to iterate collectively through parallel lists.This will still each part of the message on a separate line, because they are separate print statements. Instead, you could combine them into one :
 these together and, ideally, use a format string for cutting down the overall lines since they all use the same format:Tweak the format in  accordingly. 
You could also just access the lists by index if you know for sure that all lists have the same length.I personally don't think this makes the code any less readable compared to using .
