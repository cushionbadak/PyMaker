This is the first question I am asking on this forum, so I welcome your feedback on making this more helpful to others.Say I have this list:and this dictionary:Is there a shorter, easier to read one-liner than the following?Many thanks
A more efficient (and probably more readable) approach would be this:This defines a generator which checks the  in order, and yields values from  that equal .  is used to retrieve the first value from this iterator. If no matching name is found, this will raise .
If you look at your code in these two lines:The index of  in your newly created list will ALWAYS be equal to the index of  in . Because your list comprehension will iterate  in order and put the corresponding  values in that order, you will always create  at the same index as  appears in . Therefore it is far more efficient simply to call it from that list using one of the above methods.
