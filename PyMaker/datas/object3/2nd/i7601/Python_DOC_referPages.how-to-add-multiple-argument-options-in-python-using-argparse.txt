My Requirement:For now when I run my python application with this command The program will run and save the result file as predefined name say reports.txt Now I want to add this functionality to allow users to choose what to put the filename and where to save as so Everything is same but I want another argument -o to be passed which will determine the filpath and name to be saved. How do I do it. What is the best way to handle or combine multiple options.I tried this I am getting this error when trying to solve the issue this wayError:report.py: error: unrecognized arguments: -o listhere/users.txt
A  flagged option works in 3 wayscommandline:https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#constTaking advantage of that, you shouldn't need anything like this erroneous  flag.If you don't use the  parameter, don't use '?'
Do you want to have something like this:Result of option :Without any option (or missing option ):With option :With :
