Natural Text
I have a list  which contains the path of files(images) of a particular folder . Example:I want to sort then in the order: Neither sorting via length nor via alphabetical order is helping. What should be done here?
You can use  with a . For the sorting criteria, you can use  to first pull just the file name (using ), then you can split off just the filename less the extension (using ), lastly convert to  so you sort numerically instead of lexicographically.
Use natural sorting (see this question): clean code and good practice when sorting strings. givesNatural sorting sorts based on how you would read things on a computer screen (alphabetically and numerically), rather than how the computer reads the code. 
The other answers here are good. But anyhow I would like to post mine with some explanations1) Creates a list which has only the file name.  and so on.Note: Why [0] ?? Because the output of each  would be like this,so  index gives us just the filename!2) zip each and every item from both iterables with each other and create a list. So this list has values like these,3)  This one creates a list from the sorted list of  note key is the main thing here. Key will be the second item from tuple i.e  and such. Based  on which sorting happens.finally your output:
You can use split on "/", take the last element, split on ".", take the first, and convert it too an int:output
