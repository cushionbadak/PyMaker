There is a list of dictionaries I need to iterate through and filter in dictionaries which meet criterion and then return only values under key1. I'm using filter, as follows:the iterator works alright returning only those results which meet criterion. But it returns the whole dictionary rather than only .I'm thinking it's something to do with filter but have no clue. Q1: Can someone explain why it returns whole dict rather then only value under key1?Q2: is there a workaround to make filter to return only value under key1?P.S. there is no problem to do it through list comprehension like that:But I was just curious why filter doesn't return .
Filtering is not the same thing as mapping. Filtering selects based on your criteria, a yes/no decision on wether or not to include one of your values. In fact, you are filtering on both  and the truth value of ; if the value for  is ever set to  or  or another false value, you'd also drop that specific dictionary, which I don't think you really wanted.You want to filter and map, so extract the right key from dictionaries that passed the filter. That's actually best done with a list comprehension instead:You can still do it using , if you must, but then you need to add a  call to this to actually do the mapping:But as you notice, that gets verbose and unreadale really quickly. You could use  objects to replace the s:but readability doesn't improve much with that. 
A filter simply filters: it takes as input an iterable, and produces an interable with the items that satisfy the criterion.What you want is an additional ping:Mind that you do not need to use  in the criterion: the  will simply evaluate the function, and inspect the truthiness of the result. If it is , it will emit the item, otherwise it will ignore the item.
