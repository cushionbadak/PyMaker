I am using widows 10 pro, python 3.6.2rc1. I am training a convolutional neural network made by tensorflow. As a preprocessing phase, I hae written the following code to resize each image. It works perfectly well, but since I have more than 100 training images (I made it quite low just to see how it works at the moment) with very different names, and at the end I'd like all of them follow the same naming convention as in "image001", "image002" and so on, I added a counter and use it to change the name of the image before saving it to the same folder by using cv2.imwrite(). But I am getting this error:I need my images have the names image001, image00x. I appreciate if you help me solve this problem.Thank you very much.
The imwrite method expects the extension to determine the file format.Simply change your line to (for PNG, or whatever file format you want) and it should work:You can rename the files later if you so wish, using . A working example should be something like this:
This method will give you the leading zeros you want in the file name:
