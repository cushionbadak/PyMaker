I am using Python 3.6 and I need to convert an integer to a list of individual bits. For example, if I have:This currently outputs .But I need to have in a list of integers (but in a hex type format) like so  in order to pass it to another function. I am stuck at this part.
What about a simple list-comprehension with cast into type?It does almost the same as  expect it will forces to keep  rather than . If you do need a list of , then yes,  is enough.As you can see, each items of the list are not  nor  but :Because the problem while using  is that it will transfrom your items to string even if they have the hexadecimal form e.g
One liner:ORIt's ugly, but I'm pretty sure it does exactly what you need it to.
