I didn't understand why we should use try and except in our code. I mean when the code is wrong, the system always returns some error telling us which part cannot pass coding. From my understanding, try and except also throw some error to us when the code goes wrong. So, could anyone tell me why we should use try and except? 
One example of using  could be as simple as detecting whether a value casts to another value to act upon the result of the cast properly.This is a very basic example, but could be a use case to answer you question.
