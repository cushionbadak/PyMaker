This question already has an answer here:How to generate all permutations of a list in Python                    31 answers                Not a particularly complex question but I'm looking for a efficient/clean way to generate all possible permutations of tuples.For example, given a size value (ex. 3) for an n x n grid. I'd like to generate comparisons between rows and columns.So for rows, comparisons would go as (1,1) vs (2,1), (1,1) vs (3,1), (2,1) vs (3,1) ... (1,2) vs (2,2), (2,2) vs (3,2) ... etcAnd for columns, comparisons would go as (1,1) vs (1,2), (1,1) vs (1,3), (1,2) vs (1,3), .. (2,1) vs (2,2), (2,1) vs (2,3), (2,2) vs (2,3) ... etcDoes anyone know of an easy way to generate each pair of tuples? I'd like to pass the two tuples from the comparison into a separate function (tuple1, tuple2). Got an idea but it uses multiple for loops and seems inefficient. Assistance would be appreciated.
Using itertools.combinations,you can generate all combinations of 2 indices without repetition.So, you can generate your pairs of tuples like this:And use them like:
