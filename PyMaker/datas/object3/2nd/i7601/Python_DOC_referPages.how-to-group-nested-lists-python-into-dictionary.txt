I have a list of lists in Python, and I'd like to corral them into a more coherent ordered dictionary.The data is of the form:Ultimately, what I'm looking to get is some sort of dictionary structure by marching through the list and categorizing based off of same items at the first, second, third, and so on levels.I've been playing around with  in order to try this with code like:This works for the first level, but I'm stuck on how to recurse through the structure in order to do the same sort of grouping at progressively deeper levels.Any thoughts would be appreciated!EDIT: Judging by the downvotes, I guess this wasn't a good question? I thought the expected output was clear from my description, but to be explicit, I was looking for a tree pretty similar to what Delgan's code produces:
You really do not need .This can be much simpler: just populate your dictionary iteratively while iterating trough your data.You may use  for convenience too. This avoid having to check to see if the key is already present in your nested dictionary.This is actually creating a tree. The leaf elements are empty dictionaries which can be populated later.
