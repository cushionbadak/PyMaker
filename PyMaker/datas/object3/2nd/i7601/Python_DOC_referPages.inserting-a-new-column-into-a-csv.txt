I realize this may be marked as a duplicate, however I would still appreciate a clear and concise response. I have spent quite a bit of time trying to use some of the code from some of the responses that were already given in other similar questions to no avail.I have a csv file that may vary in length from time to time. The program that I have written in python will open the csv file, read it and make changes to certain fields of data. The program I have written works wonderfully and I am near the end of this project. The only issue I am facing is that I need to add two new columns. One of them has the header 'Institution' and will always contain the same data, the number 18 and another with the header 'File Type'. The 'File Type' header will always have the number 16 below it on every row.In example:etc, etc, ...So basically for every row of data that needs converted, I will always need the program to take my csv file, and insert the two new columns,  and  with the data  and , respectively, on each row that happens to exist within the csv. Make sense? So if there is 150 rows, I will need it to put it in 150 times. If the document converts 45 rows, then 45.Here is the program that I have written and it works perfectly, other than the column part. I am not sure how to go about writing the part to add the columns.So here I am showing just the code I edited to include the new columns.Here is the error I am getting.I am using Python 3.6.1.I sincerely appreciate any and all responses.Thank you,Max
It looks like your problem is trying to access  when data only has seven entries.  I assume you probably want  instead.As an aside, using pandas makes things quite easy:
