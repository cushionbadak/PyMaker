If I have a stream of individual characters in python and I want a string buffer 4 characters long, how can I have it so that the newest character goes to the end of the buffer and the other characters all shift down by one. I have a stream of characters being fed from a serial port and decoded into a variable called  each run of the loop there is only one character read from the . I wish to end the loop when a certain string is received. To do this I want to be able to put the characters into a buffer that I can check.E.g.decode each run of the loop will beGoing into a variable called Buffer.
You could create the buffer using a  (double ended queue) of fixed length:Once the deque is full, an item is discarded from the opposite end to accommodate the new entry.
