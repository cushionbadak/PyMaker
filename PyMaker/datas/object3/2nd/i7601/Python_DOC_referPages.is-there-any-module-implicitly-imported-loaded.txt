When starting the interactive Python interpreter with defaultsettings, is there any module implicitly imported/loaded into theinterpreter, without explicitly running ?I thought that modules like  or  would be, but when Itype their module names, So is it correct that by default, there is no module imported/loaded implicitly?When executing a python script, is there any module implicitlyimported/loaded into the script, without explicitly specifying in the script?Thanks.
