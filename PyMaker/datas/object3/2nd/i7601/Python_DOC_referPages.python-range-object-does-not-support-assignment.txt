I keep getting a TypeError 'Range' object does not support item assignment. I tried to change the code a little as in add iter(...) before the range, aswell as list(...) before range. However, it didn't help and the Error continues.Here's the code:Now the TypeError is in the beginning at anchors[start] = node. And node is a given argument from the second function where it says for node in iter(range(len(graph))). I tried it with iter and with list, neither worked. What to do?
 generates a  in python 2 so you can assign to it.But in python 3, the behaviour has changed.  becomes a lazy sequence generation object, which saves memory & CPU time because it is mostly used to count in loops and its usage to generate a contiguous actual  is rather rare.From documentation:Rather than being a function, range is actually an immutable sequence typeAnd such objects don't support slice assignment ( operation)Quickfix: force iteration on the  object, you'll get an object you can use slicing assignment to:
