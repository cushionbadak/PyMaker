I have a  list with e.g. 5 elements, but I want to slice it in template by using command:or this command:What's the difference between  and ? (I don't have currently access to machine with django installed but I'm curious)
 and  are both same as they will return first 3 elements from the listbut if you use  then it will leave the 2 items from the first of the list and take from 3rd item till the number you mentioned in the x variable, its basically taking a part
They produce same result:Django  filter internally use  python function (or type).
