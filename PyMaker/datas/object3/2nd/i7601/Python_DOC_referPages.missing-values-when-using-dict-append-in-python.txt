there is something wrong when I use dict.append(values) but not all of values are addedThe result is:Why the result for append command does not include all number in my dict?
There's no , but you are using . The problem is that you haveinstead ofin your recursive function, so you overwrite the collected values with a new list every time you find a nested dict. Using  you append all the items found in the recursive call to your list.Consider using :etc. instead of checking the type name.
