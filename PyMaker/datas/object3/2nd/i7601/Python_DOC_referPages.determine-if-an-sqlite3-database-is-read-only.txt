I'd like to open an sqlite3 database, and immediately check that it is not opened read-only. Since I know I'll need to write to it, I want to return an error immediately at start-up, and not have to wait until a later time when the program first tries to do a write.I see there is a sqlite3 C API function . Is it possible to access this function from the Python API? Or is there some other way to check if a database is read-only from the Python API?
no and yes.see the source code of the python standard library sqlite3.this means even if you didn't set the ,it will open in read-only mode when the file in read-only mode.and search in the code.there are no invoke of .so you cannot do it by library sqlite3.but yes,there are other library,for exampleAPSW.the codethen read the DOC,just call 
Apart from other possibilities mentioned, you can just try writing to it.  For example, if the  of the database is 0 (which it will be unless you have changed it), issue .  This will have no effect if the database is writable, but will result in an error if the database is read-only.
