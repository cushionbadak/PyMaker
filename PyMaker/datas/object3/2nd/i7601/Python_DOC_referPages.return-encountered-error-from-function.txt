How would I return the error received during a function call back to main?I've got something simple such as:When called, it just returns to the calling  and the program ends. But I am trying to return what happened (i.e. the file does not exist). Is raising an exception more appropriate?
If you do want to raise an exception instead of returning  when the file doesn't exist, you could skip the  and go directly to  or whatever you actually want to do with the file.The correct way to actually raise the exception is to let it get raised. So do:And if you do want to explicitly check before you open, this will raise the actual error object:Result of this version is:Also, note that just doing , like in another answer provided, breaks how  actually raises:Raising explicitly (the filename gets considered as the err message):How it's actually raised by Python:
You could  an exception ( is used in built-in libraries), although if you'll try to use non-existent file you'll get  exception raised by default.Then, when using this function, handle your exception:
(As an alternative to my previous answer.)Another more correct way to do the  if you want to explicitly check before doing anything else - use  which doesn't actually open the file:Result of this version is:Note that the error is a bit different here vs the prev:
