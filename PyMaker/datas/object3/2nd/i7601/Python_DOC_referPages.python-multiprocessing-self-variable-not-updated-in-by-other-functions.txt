Looks like I am out of luck here... sorry to ask you folks. :(I am trying to do the following:However, in the result, it doesn't update the self.VARIABLE in run(), but only in setVar().I thought, "self" would indicate, that this are "global" parameters for this class/object?Even when I modify the run() function to have a "while true: --> break" loop, the same issue still occurs. Where is my thinking error?Thanks in advance...
 causes the  method to be executed in a separate process; that's kind of the entire point.  As a result, you do not have one  instance; you have two, and they exist in separate processes.  One of these instances is updated by your calls to , and the other (due to being a different object) is not.  If you want to be able to communicate between processes, look into pipes and queues.
