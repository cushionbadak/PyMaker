My file looks like this: I want to import it into numpy array using np.genfromtxt. The biggest problem is that it has ';' and ',' as delimiters.My try:I get error: TypeError: Can't convert 'bytes' object to str implicitlyHow to solve it? I'm also open to completely new (better) ideas.
According to the docs:Parameters:fname : file, str, pathlib.Path, list of str, generator  File, filename, list, or generator to read. If the filename extension  is gz or bz2, the file is first decompressed. Note that generators  must return byte strings in Python 3k. The strings in a list or  produced by a generator are treated as lines.Probably easier and more efficient to give it a generator, just bearing in mind it must yield byte-strings:
Per the docs for numpy.genfromtxt:Note that generators must return byte strings in Python 3k.So instead of creating an  object, create a :yieldsNote that if you have Pandas installed, you could use  which would allow you to specify a regex pattern as a delimiter:yields returns a DataFrame. If you need a NumPy array, you could access it through its  attribute:
