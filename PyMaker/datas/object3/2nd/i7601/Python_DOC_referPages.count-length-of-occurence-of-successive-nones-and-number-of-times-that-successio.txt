I have a list  I want to know the number of times the None occur and the length. This should give me:[2, 1] and 2I wrote the following code:as output I am getting the following The code works good. But is there a more beautiful way to do it in python?
Use the  object to both group the consecutive  values, and to count the group length:Since  is a iterator of unknown length, I used  to avoid materialising that into a list; that could be quite memory intensive otherwise. If you are 100% certain that your groups of consecutive  objects is small (a few hundred at most) it may be faster to just use  instead.The default behaviour for  is to produces groups of identical objects, so consecutive objects for which an  test is true. This is ideally suited for  values. For each group, a  and a dependent iterator are produced, with  set to the common group object; if  is  you know you have a series of consecutive  objects on hand.
Use  to group consecutive similar items, and filter out those whose group key is :
