This question already has an answer here:Why itertools.groupby() doesn't work? [duplicate]                    2 answers                When I try to use itertools.groupby to group a list of numbers like this:The output isinstead ofWhy doesn't it group identical numbers correctly?
Grouping input by common key elements with  only works on input already sorted by that key:[...] Generally, the iterable needs to already be sorted on the same key function.Your example should work like this:If you use  on unorderd input you'll get a new group every time a different key is returned by the  function while iterating through the iterable.
 only group the consecutive elements. So you need to sort before doing .Result
Based on your output requirement, I'll change your question. collections.Counter is simple to use here
