I am reading information from a CSV file and I am using a nested dictionary to map out the repetitive information in the file. How do I go about creating a nested dictionary for this file for all rows of the file? An example of the data (not actual data but basically same concept) So essentially, the master dictionary has 3 keys: NY, MA, CA, each of them has a dictionary with City/Region as key, and each City/Region has the questions and answers.So it would be a very nested dictionary but I can't figure out the syntax for this to do it for every row in the file. I've tried opening the file, used a for loop to read through the lines and split the lines by ",". Something like this:
I figured out how to get it to work. 
You can try this slightly shorter version:
You can read the CSV file with the csv module that will take care of the splitting. The example data you gave is full of unneeded spaces. In case it is the same on your real data, we sanitize it with .To avoid having to create the missing keys in your dictionaries, you can use a defaultdict. It creates on-the-fly the missing keys with a default value.  For example, you could do:to create a  with empty dicts as default values for missing keys, and use it like this:There's one difficulty in your case: you want a nested dictionary, so we need a  of  of The parameter we give to  must be a callable, so we can't write something like , as  is a , not a function. One way to accomplish that is to use functools.partial to create a  function, that we can pass to the main .
