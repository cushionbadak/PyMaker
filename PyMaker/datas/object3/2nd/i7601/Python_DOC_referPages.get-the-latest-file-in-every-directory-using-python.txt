I want find the latest zip file in every directory in a current working directory. I have this code that can find the latest file in one folder:How can I find the latest file in all folders?
Python 2.2+:There is a better way of doing it, but it requires Python 3.5+:Quoting the documentation for :If recursive is true, the pattern  will match any files and zero or more directories and subdirectories. If the pattern is followed by an os.sep, only directories and subdirectories match.
