I have the bottleneck in my calculations on python: I need to shuffle a large list ( elements).Current implementation:With this method, only one core is involved. Is it possible to shuffle a large list in parallel?
You may check the Process class, which can be exemplified in this way:If you want to run this data in parallel, you can use multithreading or multiprocessing. You should define your worker function and call it in the process.
