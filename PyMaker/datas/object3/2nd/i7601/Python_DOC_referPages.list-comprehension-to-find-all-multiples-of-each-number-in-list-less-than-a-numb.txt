I'm trying to write a function that will find all numbers that are a multiple of at least one number in a list where the multiple is less than a certain number. Here's what I've tried so far:For example, MultiplesUnderX([2,3],10) would return [2,3,4,6,8,9]. I'm a little unsure how to do this with the for loop inside of the list comprehension.
You can use the Python any() function to check if there is at least one instance of a divider in MultArray:
You can use the Python built-in function  which returns  if the iterable passed in contains any truth-y values in combination with a conditional at the end of the list comprehension limiting the list to only elements that satisfy the  call.Your desired output is shown as such:
Another version of this algorithm which may be more efficient if the list is mostly co-prime, you can just use  to generate only the multiples of , then use  to merge the iterators such that the iterator returned is sorted.The last step is to eliminate duplicates as you go:
