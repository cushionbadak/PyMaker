Today I want to program a karaoke in python.I have to show a text (the lyrics of the song) scroll down and play the music in the background.But I'm wondering if I have to do some code to move the lyrics and another code to play the music or I have to join both codes to do the parallel programmingBut I know that Python is a structured language and I can not do parallel programming.
There are basically two simple ways to do concurrent programming in Python, using build-in libraries:Using the  module (https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html)Using the  module (https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html)
Yes, check Parallel Processing, where you can find information for:Symmetric MultiprocessingCluster ComputingCloud ComputingGrid Computingand pick what best fits your application.Or, check How to do parallel programming in Python?
