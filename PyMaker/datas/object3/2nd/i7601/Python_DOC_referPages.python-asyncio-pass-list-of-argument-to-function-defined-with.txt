Let's consider the following example from the documentation:The gather function is presented as such in the module:It works all fine, but for my real life problem I need to pass in the gather function not a multiplicity of functions with hardcoded arguments, but rather a tuple comprehension of some form creating the multiple functions.I tried:but it doesnt work. Anyone knows how to have that gather function to work with a programatically created list of functions?TO BE CLEAR: the  function is not defined by me so i cannot remove the * from its definition and simply pass the list of arguments like that. I would need to "unpack" the list but i don't know how.
You also can use the  for this task:Make an iterator that computes the function using arguments obtained from the iterable. Used instead of map() when argument parameters are already grouped in tuples from a single iterable (the data has been “pre-zipped”).For more reading: here
Found the solution:
List of coroutines can be dynamically generated and passed as follows:
