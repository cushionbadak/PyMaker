i am new to python,trying to learn machine learning in python.i have tried to write a neural network from scratch with one hidden layer on the famous iris dataset.this is a three class classifier with out put as one hot vectors.i have also taken help from already written algos for help.for instance i used the same training set as my testing set.it is a huge code to go through,i would like you to tell me, that how do we subtract  'y' output( which is one hot vector) of dimensions (150,3) and my out y softmax will be of vector (150,21).this is my biggest problem.i tried to look online everyone have used this method but since i am weak in python i don't understand it.this is the line of code  if m1 is sie of(150)and if i give size m1(150,3) thenmy code is
In Python  generates a tuple of numbers from x to y with . If you generate something like  then it is the same as . Lists in Python need an integer index such as  or , not , however, there is a built-in thing in Python that allows access from index x to index y in a list here is the syntax: . This will return every value from 0 to 3 in the list. Such as if a list is  then  will return . Try taking a look at list data structures in Python on the Python Docs. As well as Understanding Generators in Python.I think what your looking for is something like this: . This list comprehension uses two generations both, , which subtracts one from every element in the list, and , which generates a list of lists with values through x to y in a range of m. Though I'm not sure I understand what your end goal is, fully.
