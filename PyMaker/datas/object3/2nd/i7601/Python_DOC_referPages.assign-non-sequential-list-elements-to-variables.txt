I want to do something equivalent to: As opposed to:I know I can assign a sequence of elements like this: But how can I do this if the elements I want are non-sequential?
You would use  in Python which returns a tuple of the selected items:There are other ways to this of course, but these may not be the one obvious way.Using a list comprehension.
