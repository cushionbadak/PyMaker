This question already has an answer here:Can one partially apply the second argument of a function that takes no keyword arguments?                    10 answers                Trying something out with partial, I observed the following behaviour:First, I defined a function  which takes 2 non-keyword arguments:Then, I use partial to create a higher order wrapper.Then, called it like this:This gave me  which was expected. Next, I tried to apply  to :But this gave me an error:I tried  as the argument name since that was what was specified in the docs (linked above). It seems that the actual definition does not have the second argument named  as the docs might otherwise state.How now, would I create a partial function with the second parameter without being forced to specify the argname? I definitely cannot do  because  will be taken as the first argument, not the second. If possible, would like to find a way to do this without using  functions too.
Unfortunately, that's just not something  supports. You'd need to write your own version that does support it, or find one in some 3rd-party library somewhere.
