I have a test class with some static methods along with normal methods. The problem is that  is not collecting static methods. I couldn't find anything in the documentation regarding this. How can I make it collect staticmethods too?In the above class, only  is collected and  isn't.I am running Plugins are 
When collecting test functions, pytest ensure each functions are callable.But a staticmethod is not callable, from https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html:Static method objects are not themselves callable, although the objects they wrap usually are.see:For this to work, pytest itself should be modified to accept static method, I don't know if that's what they want, you can open an issue on their issue tracker on github if you think you really need it.Why do you think static methods are a solution? For which problem exactly?
