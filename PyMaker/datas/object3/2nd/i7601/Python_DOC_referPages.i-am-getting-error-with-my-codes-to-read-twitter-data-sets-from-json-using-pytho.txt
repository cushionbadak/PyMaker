You have posted samples, and as far as I see you just need to skip empty lines.OLD ANSWER BELOWYou should parse json this way: accepts a file-like object as first argument.What you're currently trying to do is reading file line by line and trying to parse each line as separate JSON string, and the file seems to be formatted, so you don't have complete json in any line.You might want to iterate over tweets list in your file (if my guess is correct), not text lines and call  in the loop.
