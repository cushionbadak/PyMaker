I'm giving the Python  module a shot.I know that it's valid to specify the length of a  like the following*:Is there any shorthand for longer lists? What if I want to set it to 10 floats?Any idea if this is possible, this would be handy.*NOTE: It turns out that supplying multiple arguments to  (and its subclasses) in this manner is currently NOT valid Python. Furthermore, it is currently not possible to specify a  length using the  module in this way.
You can't. A list is a mutable, variable length structure. If you need a fixed-length structure, use a tuple instead:Or better still, use a named tuple, which has both indices and named attributes:A list is simply the wrong data type for a fixed-length data structure.
So far, only tuples support specifying a fixed number of fields and it has no short-cut for a fixed number of repetitions.Here's the definition and docstring from the  module:Since lists are a mutable, variable-length type, it doesn't make any sense to use a type declaration to specify a fixed size.
