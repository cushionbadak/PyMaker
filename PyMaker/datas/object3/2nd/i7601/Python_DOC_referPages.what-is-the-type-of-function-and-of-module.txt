So a method of a class is an instance of class . Since  is a class and a class is an object, what is the type of , i.e. what is it an instance of?    As the comments suggestedThen why does  not work? Is  a class, of which a class's method is an instance?Similarly, why does  not work?
The built-in module  stores all kind of different types that are used throughout the language. It contains also the  which corresponds to the instance method:When calling  in the interpreter then the output is  however this does not necessarily mean that the class's name is  but it is just the class's representation ():As pointed out in the comments  also only holds a reference to the type of functions which is defined at the implementation level.The type of  is  again, that is  is an instance of  (as it is the case for all classes).Also note the peculiaritywhich means that type is its own class (i.e.  pointing to itself). This is achieved at the implementation level.
