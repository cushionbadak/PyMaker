I have a flask server that grabs binary data for several different files from a database and puts them into a python 'zipfile' object.  I want to send the generated zip file with my code using flask's "send_file" method.I was originally able to send non-zip files successfully by using the BytesIO(bin) as the first argument to send_file, but for some reason I can't do the same thing with my generated zip file.  It gives the error:'ZipFile' does not have the buffer interface.How do I send this zip file object to the user with Flask?This is my code:
 needs to be passed bytes data, but a  object is not bytes-data; you actually created a file on your harddisk.You can create a  in memory by using  as the base:The  statement ensures that the  object is properly closed when you are done adding entries, causing it to write the required trailer to the in-memory file object. The  call is needed to 'rewind' the read-write position of the file object back to the start.
