In  an optimization problem,if function  in  the  code given below is objective function  with initial values of  as .Then, to solve the problem i need to compute the obj. function as well as its derivitive. So, when i am doing so,i am getting .Output is:Can anyone suggest me a solution so as to get correct answer by ignoring  values.
This is what try blocks are for!  If you don't want to sanitize your inputs and are coding for a situation where a division by zero IS zero (the other option is infinity which makes for some much more interesting math), then a simple try block is the way to go.  If you need precision, sanitize your inputs (make sure y isn't zero before sending it to the function).Code:
How about this:
