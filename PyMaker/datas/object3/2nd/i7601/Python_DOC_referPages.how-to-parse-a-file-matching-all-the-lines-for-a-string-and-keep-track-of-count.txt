We have a file with following lines in it,we need to find all the lines with "Error" message type..save the message and its count and print the messages in the descending order of count,can anyone provide guidance on how to do this?file.txtCODE:-
Open the file and read all lines  Make a list of lines that contain the word "Error"   Get the time and message items from the  list  Sort the  list by 'time' in descending order   Note that  is a list of dictionaries, you can use lists if you like.If you want to print the results :  Output :  
For similar task, I used next trick:Sorry for code "as is". As you can see, I just add to  pairs regexp-callback  and match them to each line. Simple and  powerful.
You could do something like this:The  function is just checking each line in the file to see if it's an error, and returning the error message if it is.The file  is opened, and all the lines in it are read into a list. Then we  the first element, which is the header. Then we go through each line, and check it to see if there's an error message. If there is we increase the count for that particular error message.  Once we've checked all the lines, we sort the dictionary , except that we want to a) sort it by the dictionary values, and b) sort it in reverse. Finally, we print the sorted elements in order, and the number of times they occurred.
