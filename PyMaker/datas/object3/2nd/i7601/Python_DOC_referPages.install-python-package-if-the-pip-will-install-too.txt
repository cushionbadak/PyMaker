I download the python3 package , and install it, and I find the pip3 is installed too.So , I want to confirm if the pip3 package is include in the  file, because when install the python3 the pip3 is installed too.from the command lines you can see I only instal the python3 , but the pip3 is installed too.
This is as expected.Newer releases of Python 3 (3.4+?) come with pip pre-installed, as well as with the  module.
