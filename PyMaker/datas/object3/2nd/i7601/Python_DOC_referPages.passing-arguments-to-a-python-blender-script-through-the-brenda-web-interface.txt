For example: I found a way to separate out the script arguments by using this:Which breaks them all up individually. Which is not what I think needs to happen. I also have tried argparse, but I think that the "--" is breaking it.  Does anybody know a complex way to parse this stuff out?  I'd like to keep the arg + value together, so that I can do something like this:But I am stuck with "blender: error: unrecognized arguments:"EDIT-----------------------------EDIT------------------------which creates this structure:['-items', '1', '-type', 'AO', '-samples', '100', '-size', '1024']What should I do? I think this is going in the wrong direction, seeing as I want to group by Option:Argument.I tried this code also, but it split the actual letters in the arguments into pieces:
You can make your own parser, by using iterators. This code will seperate your arguments into two dicts (before and after the ):Output:I'm not really sure what you're trying to do with these arguments though, please clarify your question if you want more help.
