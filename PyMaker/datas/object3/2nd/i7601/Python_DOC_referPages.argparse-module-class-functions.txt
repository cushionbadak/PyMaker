I have small doubt in organisation of module arparseFollowing code is found on python documentation onlineI assumed argparse will be module argparse.ArgumentParser() will be a class within the module so 2nd line simply create the object of that class. Next line we call methods defined in the class using dot operator. Till this point all made sense. I was thinking args will be simple variable but when args.echo is accesses using dot operator then what type is args? Is it parser.parse_args() return object of ArgmentParser() type.Apologies if question is too naive.

Almost all of the code is classes.  There several utility base classes (container, etc), but the key ones are imported with the  list.It's also instructive to run your code in an interactive process and look at the objects that are created.  Or just add lots of  statements to see their respective .creates a  object.creates an  object (actually a subclass of , according to the  parameter.creates a  object,  creates a dictionary object from the  attributes.
