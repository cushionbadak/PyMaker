I'm trying to extract a substring with Regex,Here is my script:I'm trying to get the value of device, in this string it's "D:\"as u can see I tried "device=(\'.*\')" with REgex and it returned:["'D:\', mountpoint='D:\', fstype='FAT32', opts='rw,fixed'"]I'm not professional on REgex, How can I force it to take D:\ and print it out ?
You can use non-eager regexpnotice that the .*? means non-eager so it will take the least chars until the next ' ...
REFER https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.htmlYou might have to replace * with [A-Z]. I think the drive letter are in caps always else use[A-Za-z]
