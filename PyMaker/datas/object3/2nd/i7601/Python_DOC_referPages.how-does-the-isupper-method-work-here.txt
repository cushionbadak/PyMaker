Why do I get  when I do:But  when I do:Is this documented somewhere?
Per the Python 3.6 documentation:Return true if all cased characters [4] in the string are uppercase and there is at least one cased character, false otherwise.Since digits are not cased characters, there is not at least one cased character thus it returns false. In the second example, there is at least one cased character and they are all uppercase, thus it is true.
