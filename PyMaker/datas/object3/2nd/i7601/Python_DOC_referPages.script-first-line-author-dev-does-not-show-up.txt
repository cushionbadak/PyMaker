I am learning Python by watching youtube videos and also through an online course that I bought.  In every video I watch, the first line of each file is: .  For some reason when I start a new file this does not come up.  What does this mean and if it is an issue how do I correct it?  FYI I am using IntelliJ IDEA as an IDE.  Thank you!
It is pre-compiled in some IDEs like PyDev but not in IDEA, you can add it manually if you want it. I also recommend you to use PyCharm instead of IDEA for python.
