I am trying to sum each i which falls within the range in this 1d data called subset. I wanted to know if I could do this in one line- I get an generator object which I am not sure how I can access when I run the following:
 takes an iterable as argument, but you're passing an integer to it. Generators,  in Python 3.X for example, are iterable. See below links:https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sumhttps://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html -> search for "iterable"
you need to do the  over the generator:your brackets were just set around the wrong items...a bit more explicit: what you want is this:the way your brackets are set, your result is this:...and the expression in the print statement is just another generator.
