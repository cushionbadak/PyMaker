I import a class  that has a default parameter  upon which if performs a function . How can I change the default ? Do I need to inherit this class and then change it, how?
why don't you just provide a different argument when you construct an instance of the class:btw:  is a python built-in and therefore not the best choice as variable name.if you want the default changed, you can inherit indeed:
Just create a factory function for  objects and be done with it:Since you're importing , you could go a step further and just shadow  like this:Of course you can inherit from . Be sure to look up how to call the baseclass constructors. I find that sooo hard to memorize that I just end up google it. Every. Single. Time.BTW: Looks like @hiro protagonist already has the calling super figured out.
