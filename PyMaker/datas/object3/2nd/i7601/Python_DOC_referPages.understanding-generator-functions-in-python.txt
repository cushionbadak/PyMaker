Why it outputs ?result is:why None is printed?? not hello * 3 ?
Why it prints None:Here when you  but doesnt  anything, python will add a  automatically at the end.Let's see an example using output:Let's see now when you return an explicit values:output:See, the  was not called the second times. Therefore, the first value being loaded was return.What you should do to improve your code:Do this, if you just need to print "hello" inside the  function.  OR, use return value, in that case you need to return instead of printing.But it is weird to call several , better do a loop to avoid a e.g
By default functions return  type. Output:What are generators?The main difference between generators and functions is that you can obtain values on the fly. And after one value is 'ed by the generator. and next value is returned the old one is not stored in the memory. Iterating over a generatorOutput:Now using Output:So far so good. Right?  here  becomes a generator object.Iterating over a listOutput:Same output? Yes same output. But only difference here is that I can use the  iterable any number of times I want,Output:However if I try to use the Generator when it is exhausted.OutputHow to overcome this? Create a new generator object again and use.Output:You see the difference? Hope I was clear.
