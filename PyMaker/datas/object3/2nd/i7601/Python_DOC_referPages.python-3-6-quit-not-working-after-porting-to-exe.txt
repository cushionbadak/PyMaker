I have a small tkinter gui that generates some reports. I built a quit button into it. The button works perfectly when I launch the script, but I converted it to an exe with cx_freeze and the entire program is working except the quit button. I created the quit button to call this  function because I read that just calling quit directly could cause problems. Anyone have any idea why this is not working as an exe?
As per the comments the  function doesn't work outside of the interpreterThat does the trick
