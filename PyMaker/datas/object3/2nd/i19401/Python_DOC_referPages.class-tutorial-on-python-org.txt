I'm going slightly mad on this one, trying with Python 3.3.0 .On http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html there is a class example with the following code:First I wonder that it is missing the object class somename(object) that Python3 normally demands.Second, when I try to run it I get this error message:WTF?
First I wonder that it is missing the object class somename(object)  that Python3 normally demands.In Python 3, your class will automatically derive from , and so there's no need to do it explicitly.  The only reason this wasn't done in 2 was for backward compatibility, because so-called new-style (deriving-from-object) classes behaved slightly differently from old-style classes.This doesn't make an instance of , it just says that  is now a new name for the  class.  As a result, when you useyou're not calling the method  of an instance, so the instance isn't being passed as the first argument (it can't be, as there isn't an instance yet!)  As a result, it's interpreting '23' as your value for , and therefore you didn't pass an , henceTryinstead.
