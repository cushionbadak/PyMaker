So I'm trying to work to create a program which can take two inputs such asand it will returnwhere the code ('12345') and been incremented by the key ('12'), working from right to left.I have already created one which will work for when the code and key are both 8 long, but I cannot work out how to do this should the code be allowed to be any size, possibly with nested for statments?Here is the one i did early so you can see better what i am trying to do
Some code tested on Python 3.2:Some explanation: is a cool way to reverse a string. Stolen from here endlessly repeats your key. So the variable  now contains a generator which yields , , , , , , etc is a datatype which can handle arbitrary precision numbers. Actually Python 3's integer numbers would be sufficient because they can handle integer numbers with arbitrary number of digits. Calling the type name as a function , calls the constructor of the type and as such creates a new object of that type. The  constructor can handle one argument which is then converted into a Decimal object. In the example, the  string and the integer  are both converted into the type  with its constructor. is a variable that starts with  is multiplied by  for every digit that we have worked on (counting from the right). It's basically a pointer to where we need to modify  in the current loop iterationThe  loop header ensures we're doing one iteration for each digit in the given input text. We could also use something like  but that's unnecessarily complexOf course if you want to encode text, this approach does not work. But since that wasn't in your question's spec, this is a function focused on dealing with integers.
