I'm having long lists of networking class definitions for C structs in python.What would be the best way to use them in C++?Is there a parser I could use that exports C++ classes?Is a framework wrapper like Boost, that is quick enough to use it for tcp connection handling?Other suggestions?
You could embed the Python parser into your C++ program in order to load the Python classes directly, or write a Python program to generate C++ equivalents to these Python classes. Read about embedding Python 3.x here or 2.x here.
