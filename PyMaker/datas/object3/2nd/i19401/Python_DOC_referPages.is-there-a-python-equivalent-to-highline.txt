HighLine is a Ruby library for easing console input and output. It provides methods that lets you request input and validate it. Is there something that provides functionality similar to it in Python?To show what HighLine does see the following example:It asks "Yes or no? " and lets the user input something. As long as the user does not input y or n (case-insensitive) it prints "Answer y or n for yes or no" and lets the user type an answer again. Also if the user press Enter it defaults to y. Finally, when it is done the input is stored in . Here is an example result where the user first input "EH???" and then "y":Is there similarly simple way to do the same in Python?
You can use the Python 3 module cliask. The module is inspired by the answer of IT Ninja, fixes some deficiencies in it and allows validation via a regex, a predicate, a tuple or a list.The easiest way to get the module is to install it via pip (see the readme for other ways of installing):You can then use the module by importing like in the following example:And here is how a session might look when running the example:
The following should work similarly for you, although it will not be exactly the same style of asking as it is in Ruby.And you would use it like:
