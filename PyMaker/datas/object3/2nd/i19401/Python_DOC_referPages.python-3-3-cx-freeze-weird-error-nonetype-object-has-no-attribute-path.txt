So, here's my problem.I'm making a game in Pygame and Python 3.3, using Ubuntu 12.10.  Fine.  I'm gonna bundle a bunch of Python scripts into one executable, then distribute it.  Also fine.  I'm going with cx_freeze, because since I'm using Python 3 I have no other options.This is where my problem comes in.  I've Googled around, but haven't seen anything like it.  My  is as follows:My  is as follows:The rest of my code (including the full ) can be found at https://github.com/CorundumGames/Invasodado, in case it's relevant.I get a long-ass stack trace, which can be found here http://pastebin.com/Aej05wGE .  The last 10 lines of it is this;In case it's relevant, I'm using Pydev and Eclipse.  Now, the last line stands out because Googling it reveals nothing.  I have no idea where  could have become , and I can't easily check because cx_freeze has shit documentation.I've never really used cx_freeze or distutils before, so I don't know what the hell I'm doing!  Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Having dug into this, it's a bug in cx_Freeze, that can only hit when you have more than one Python version since PEP 3149 installed - i.e. it wouldn't have come up before 3.3.I've filed a bug report for it: https://bitbucket.org/anthony_tuininga/cx_freeze/issue/22/error-when-scanning-for-modules-with-aIn the mean time, you can probably avoid the problem by using Python 3.2 for now, because that's the default in Ubuntu 12.10. Python 3.3 will be the default in 13.04.
