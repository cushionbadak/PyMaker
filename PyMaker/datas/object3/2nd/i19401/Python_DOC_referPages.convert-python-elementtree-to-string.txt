Natural Text
Whenever I call , I get the following error message:Is there any other way to convert an ElementTree object into an XML string?TraceBack:
 objects have no  method. Drop that call, and the  call works:
How do I convert  to a String?For a solution that works in both Python 2 & 3, use  and .Example usageOutput:ExplanationDespite what the name implies,  doesn't return a string by default. The default behavior is to generate a bytestring. While this wasn't an issue in Python 2, the two types were made more distinct in Python 3.In Python 2 you could use the  type for both text and binary data.  Unfortunately this confluence of two different concepts could lead to  brittle code which sometimes worked for either kind of data, sometimes  not. [...]To make the distinction between text and binary data clearer and more pronounced, Python 3 [...] made text and binary data distinct types that cannot blindly be mixed together.Source: Porting Python 2 Code to Python 3We can resolve this ambiguity by using  to explicitly convert our bytestring into regular text. This ensures compatibility with both Python 2 and Python 3.For Python 2 & 3 compatibility: For Python 3 compatibility: For reference, I've included a comparison of  results between Python 2 and Python 3. Thanks to Martijn Peters for pointing out that the  datatype changed between Python 2 and 3.Why not use str()?In most scenarios, using  would be the "cannonical" way to convert an object to a string. Unfortunately, using this with  returns the object's location in memory as a hexstring, rather than a string representation of the object's data.
