This question already has an answer here:Converting JSON into Python dict                    6 answers                I have a JSON file that only contains a JSON dictionary (example: http://www.collegeswimming.com/results/17172/event/4/). Is there any module in Python that will easily convert this into an object I can work with in Python?
Python's JSON parser http://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html
That’s called JSON, by the way. It’s not JavaScript. Fittingly, the module is called .Try !
