Natural Text
I want to write a code to insert a text file which contains some set of codes which have to be inserted in the Head section of a HTML file. I don't want to do it manually since i have 100s of HTML files in a folder. Is it possible to tell my code to search for the Head tag and append the given text file below that?How can we do this?
If you can use , this might be a solution you can consider:  This will write 'ADD YOUR TEXT' to the line next to line containing  tag. Your original files will have an added extension .PS: If your original files are complex and do not contain properly formatted html or the text that you want to add is complex, you should use BeautifulSoup or some specialized library that deal with markup language.
Since you read in html, i would recommend doing this with ElementTree which works somewhat like this:See ElementTree documentation for Python2 or Python3
