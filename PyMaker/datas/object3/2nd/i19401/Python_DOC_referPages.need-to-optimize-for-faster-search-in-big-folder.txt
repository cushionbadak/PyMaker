I have a folder that contain a lot of files and i need to optimize the speed of the search because i have over 1k of different files to search , actually i am using this : But it is taking really long time ( over 30 minutes ) to search in all the folder (because it search file by file), but the "Windows search" take 20 second to find it .Do you know some tricks to optimize the search and make it more fast.Thanks for any tips.
You are in the land of Information Retrieval, instead of searching from scratch every time - do what search engines do:Index your data (pre-processing, done only once, or one in a while - this assumes the collection of documents is relatively stable - and changes very little comparing to the number of searches)Each time a query comes - search in the index to quickly find the answer.This approach will allow you later on not only to return related documents - but will also allow you to rank them from most relevant to least relevant by using some already proven heuristics, such as the tf-idf model.There is an open-source project called Lucene, which also has python binding that can help you with the implementations. Lucene is a mature widely used (and widely tested) Information-Retrieval library (used in eclipse search, for example)P.S. If you find yourself interested in Information Retrieval further more, I recommend reading Manning's Introduction to Information Retrieval - it will give you great understanding on the field - but it is really not mandatory for just applying your task.
You can use Windows Search SDK + Python ctypes.
