I have a  instance and I want to get a well-formed  HTTP header from its content.I had a look at Python modules source code but it amounts to ~ 3/4 functions and 20 sloc, I'm looking for a more elegant solution.Note: I really want the header, not to make a  request with that cookies, and I know of  but it doesn't fit my needs (see above).EDIT: If I was able to obtain a single  (different thing, different module) object with the contents of the cookiejar, then it would be as easy as . However,The cookielib and Cookie modules do not depend on each other.
Since Python uses duck typing, you could instead pass in your own object to ; the documentation even lists the methods you would need to implement (, , etc.), although it's probably just simpler to create a temporary  object and then fetch the cookie from it and do what you want with it.(Of course, you could call internal methods like  but I assume you know why that's a bad ideaâ€”it's brittle to depend on implementation details like that.)
