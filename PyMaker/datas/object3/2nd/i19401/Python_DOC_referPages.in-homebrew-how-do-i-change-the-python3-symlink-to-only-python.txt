I want to install python using homebrew and I noticed there are 2 different formulas for it, one for python 2.x and another for 3.x. The first symlinks "python" and the other uses "python3". so I ran . I really only care about using python 3 so I would like the default command to be "python" instead of having to type "python3" every time. Is there a way to do this?  I tried  but I get a "python is not found in the Cellar" error.
You definitely do not want to do this! You may only care about Python 3, but many people write code that expects  to symlink to Python 2. Changing this can seriously mess your system up.
If you are absolutely sure that you will never want to install / use Python 2, I think you can just create additional symlinks in /usr/local/bin.Check for everything that links to something in and create a link without the 3 at the end, likeThink twice though, why give up the advantages of having two Pythons side-by-side? Maybe just use the homebrew Python as intended, and create your Python 3 environments with virtualenv.
If you're doing this for personal use, don't change the symlink for . Many of your system programs depend on  pointing to Python 2.6, and you'll break them if you change the symlink. Instead, pick a shorter name like  and write an alias for it in , like .For example, with testing:This will give you the convenience without effecting the system or other users.
Yes, far better to use [virtual environments] (https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for python 3 than mess with the system defaultwhich will setup python 3 as the default  and also isolate  installs to that environment which is what you want to do on any project.
As mentioned this is not the best idea. However, the simplest thing to do when necessary is run python3 in terminal. If you need to run something for python3 then run python3
