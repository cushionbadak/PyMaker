Design a logical expression equivalent to the following statement: is a list of three or five elements, the second element of which is  the string  and the first of which is not a number or Boolean.What I have: My question: How do you check for whether or not it is a Boolean or a number?
To answer the specific question:This checks if  is an instance of any of the types in the tuple .You can add  in there, too, but it's not necessary, because  is itself a subclass of .Doc reference: built-in numeric typesTo comment on your current code, you shouldn't rely on interning of short strings. You are supposed to compare strings with the  operator:
Easiest i would say:
In python3 this would be:  see example.

You should compare the type of  to the  class:or:Here is more on the type methodFrom Data model docs:Booleans (bool)These represent the truth values False and True. The two objects representing the values False and True are the only Boolean objects. The Boolean type is a subtype of the integer type, and Boolean values behave like the values 0 and 1, respectively, in almost all contexts, the exception being that when converted to a string, the strings "False" or "True" are returned, respectively.
