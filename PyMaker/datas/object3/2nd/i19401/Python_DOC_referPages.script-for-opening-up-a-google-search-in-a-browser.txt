I'm a programming novice whose experience is limited to writing very simple programs in Python. For part of my first 'real' project I'd like to write a script that takes an input and opens up a browser window with a Google search for that input. I'm at sea on how to accomplish this; I've fiddled around with variations on scripts like this, but this outputs the results by printing it to the console; for my purposes, I'd like the output to actually open a window with the search results for the query (ultimately I'd also like the script to take screenshot of the browser window and paste it to a Word document, but one thing at a time).
Opening a webpage is pretty simple in Python.For a little more reliability, you can pass search_term to  first.
