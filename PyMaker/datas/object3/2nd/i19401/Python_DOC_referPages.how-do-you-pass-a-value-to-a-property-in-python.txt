So I'm writing a python script that modifies TV show titles. this is more for practice than anything. I'm trying to use the @property decorator, but I was under the misconception that when you do "var.property" I thought that the var would get passed to the property... so I'm trying to get splitName() to be able to use the hasDots property from the base class, but I'm not sure how you would pass the name Var into the property. I know I could do this with a method, but I'm trying to learn how to use properties. the splitName() method is going to be the main method once I can get the base class to work properly. any help on this would be greatly appreciated. also I'm pretty new to python, so if I'm doing anything that is "unpythonic" let me know. 
It is good idea to read documentation carefully when you are learning something.Look at the third code example here http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#propertythis is how you define setters and deleters for the properties defined using built-in  decorator.P.S.: Corresponding Python 2 documentation is here: http://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#property
