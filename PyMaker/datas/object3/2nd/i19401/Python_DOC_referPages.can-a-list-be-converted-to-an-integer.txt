I am trying to write a program to convert a message inta a secret code. I m trying to create a basic code to work up from. here is the problem.this point of the above progam is so when i input my name:the output should bebut I continue to recieve this messageso i assumed this meant that my code variable must be an integer to be used in replace()is there a way to convert that string into an integer or is there another way to fix this?
The reason why your original code gave you the error is because of . The  method can take 3 arguments. The first is the string you want to replace, the second is the replacement string, and the third, optional argument is how many instances of the string you want to replace - an integer. You were passing a list as the third argument.However, there are other problems to your code as well. is currently . What you need is a dictionary. You might also want to assign it outside of the loop, so you don't evaluate it every iteration.Then, change your loop to this: gives you the desired output.Note however that if a letter in the input isn't in the dictionary, you'll get an error. You can use the  method to supply a default value if the key isn't in the dictionary.Where the second argument to  specifies the default value.So your code should look like this:
Just to sum up:% cat ./test.py% python ./test.py
You can use translate:(assuming Python 3)
The previous comments should give you a good explanation on your error message,so I will just give you another way to make the translation from  to .We can make use of Python's  method.Just for the record, if you are interested in encoding data, you should check for hashing.Hashing is a widely used method for generating secret data format.A simple example of hashing in Python (using the so-called sha256 hashing method):
