I installed the python package , using , to obtain real time data from the FRED / ALFRED API.  My task now is to match an assessment date to the data -- so to extract values associated with the greatest  that's less than or equal to what i'm calling the assessment date ().  The data itself is returned in a python dictionary, which contains lists, with each observation stored in a dictionary along with some meta-data -- each observation dict contains: a reference date (), the realtime period that the request covered (, ) and the value (). I can see how to match the data to an assessment date when there is an exact match, but in the real world these are the exception.  I am looking for help to generalise this to an inequality. (note below i am using a variable  -- whereas you must supply your own FRED API key to access FRED). For this example, I chose an annual benchmark revision date, to be sure to get something back.  In practice, I am usually going to be updating the simulation on dates where noting happened -- in which case my method returns nothing.  The solution seems to be to match to the greatest date (a  value) that's less than or equal to the assessment date (say ).  How might i match to the greatest  that's less than or equal to ? thanks
One way would be to identify the candidates by filtering out all items in  where   .I would do this as a generator expression:If you want to see the details, you could form a list comprehension in your interpreter:Once these candidates are identified, then use the in-built  function, providing a lambda for the , which uses the value of  to sort the candidate s:The details you require are now in  and .
