I have a list of tuples that look like :What's the best way to check if a value exists in that tuple? For example I want to be able to say:and get True
You are looking for :Combined with a simple generator expression, this does the task. The generator expression takes each tuple and yields  if it is contains .  then returns  when the first item it requests returns  (otherwise, ). Hence this does what you want. It also reads nicely - if any of the tuples contain .If you are doing this a massive number of times and need performance, then it might be worth making a set of all of the values to allow you to do this very quickly:Naturally, constructing this will be slow and use memory, so it wouldn't be a good idea unless you need a lot of performance and will be doing a lot of membership checks.
You can use :Using it with  will result in short-circuiting, similar to .For performance comparisons you can check my other answer.
