I have a situation with some code where  came up as a possible solution.  Now I have never hadto use  before but, I have come across plenty of information about the potentialdanger it can cause.  That said, I'm very wary about using it.My situation is that I have input being given by a user:Where  needs to be a dictionary.  I searched around and found that  could work this out.I thought that I might be able to check the type of the input before trying to use the data and thatwould be a viable security precaution.I read through the docs and I am still unclear if this would be safe or not.  Does eval evaluate the data as soon as its entered or after the  variable is called?Is the  module's  the only safe option?
 means that you actually evaluate the code before you deem it to be unsafe or not. It evaluates the code as soon as the function is called. See also the dangers of . raises an exception if the input isn't a valid Python datatype, so the code won't be executed if it's not.Use  whenever you need . You shouldn't usually evaluate literal Python statements.
 only considers a small subset of Python's syntax to be valid:The string or node provided may only consist of the following Python literal structures: strings, numbers, tuples, lists, dicts, booleans, and None.Passing  into  will raise an error, but  will happily wipe your drive.Since it looks like you're only letting the user input a plain dictionary, use . It safely does what you want and nothing more.
Python's eager in its evaluation, so  will evaluate the user's input as soon as it hits the , regardless of what you do with the data afterwards. Therefore, this is not safe, especially when you  user input.Use .As an example, entering this at the prompt will be very, very bad for you:
eval:This is very powerful, but is also very dangerous if you accept strings to evaluate from untrusted input. Suppose the string being evaluated is "os.system('rm -rf /')" ? It will really start deleting all the files on your computer.ast.literal_eval:Safely evaluate an expression node or a string containing a Python literal or container display. The string or node provided may only consist of the following Python literal structures: strings, bytes, numbers, tuples, lists, dicts, sets, booleans, None, bytes and sets.Syntax:Example:In the above code  nothing but object itself. Now we instantiated all the subclasses, here our main objective is to find one class named n from it.We need to  object and  object from instantiated subclasses. This is an alternative way from  to access subclasses of object and attach the system.From python 3.7 ast.literal_eval() is now stricter. Addition and subtraction of arbitrary numbers are no longer allowed. link
If all you need is a user provided dictionary, possible better solution is .  The main limitation is that json dicts requires string keys.  Also you can only provide literal data, but that is also the case for .
I was stuck with . I was trying it in IntelliJ IDEA debugger, and it kept returning  on debugger output.But later when I assigned its output to a variable and printed it in code. It worked fine. Sharing code example:Its python version 3.6.
