I have to input the parameters from the command line i.e username, password and database name. I know how to do that without using flags, by using 'sys.argv' (like below).So, it could be run as:$test.py DATABASE USERNAME PASWORDBut the problem is that I have to use 'flags'. So, the script could be run like this:How can I use flags to take arguments from command line? I would appreciate your help on this. 
The python 3 library includes 3 modules for parsing the command line thus nothing extra to add to your setup.The one you should use is argparse
First of all thanks to Mark for 'argparse' code. I have figured out the way to take arguments from command line specified by flags. I am pasting the code below which uses a modified 'Mark' code and a small module which shows how to use the arguments collected via commandline:One of my concern was how to use variables from arguments to the code. For that two things need to be done Add 'dest' to the add_argument line e.x. dest ="username" which means the value collected from comamnd line will be assigned to variable 'username'Whenever an you use such command line assigned variables from 'dest' just add 'args' before variable e.x con=sql.connect(host=args.hostname, user= args.username, passwd= args.password)DoneThanksAK
