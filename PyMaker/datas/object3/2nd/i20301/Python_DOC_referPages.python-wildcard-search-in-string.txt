Lets say that I have a list how can I have a user do a wildcard search?Search Word: 'th_s'Would return 'this'

Use :If you want to allow  as a wildcard, just replace all underscores with  (for one character) or  (for multiple characters).If you want your users to use even more powerful filtering options, consider allowing them to use regular expressions.
You could try the fnmatch module, it's got a shell-like wildcard syntaxor can use regular expressionsimport re
Do you mean any specific syntax for wildcards? Usually  stands for "one or many" characters and  stands for one.The simplest way probably is to translate a wildcard expression into a regular expression, then use that for filtering the results.
Same idea as Yuushi in using regular expressions, but this uses the findall method within the re library instead of a list comprehension:
Easy method is try :
