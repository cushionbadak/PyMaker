How do I have to configure so that I don't have to type  but simply  in CMD on Windows?I added my python directory to %PATH% that contains python.exe but still scripts are not run correctly.I tried it with django-admin.py Running  gives me  Using python in front of it processes the command correctly. What's the problem here?
Or whatever the relevant path is - you can also set command line args using ftype.In order to make a command recognized without having to give the suffix (), similar to how it works for  files, add  to the semi-colon separated list of the (global)  variable.ETA 2017-07-27Seems like this is still getting eyeballs, wanted to elevate a useful comment for Win10 users (from @shadowrunner):For me to get it work under Win10 the actual command was (note the placement of the quotes): ETA 2019-02-01Talk about evergreen!First of all, if you're newly installing Python, I highly recommend reviewing the answer by @NunoAndr√© .Secondly, to clarify something from a recent comment, please note: you must do both parts ( and ), or use a pre-existing association label in the  command.By default, at least for Python 3.7 under Windows 8.1, the association for  is , so performing the  command I wrote above will not work correctly unless the association is first changed. Or you can just use  and give the default association instead. Up to you.
From Python 3.3 a launcher for Windows is included:  (and  for GUI or non-UI applications)which aids in locating and executing of different Python versions. It allows scripts (or the command-line) to indicate a preference for a specific Python version, and will locate and execute that version.Unlike the PATH variable, the launcher will correctly select the most appropriate version of Python. It will prefer per-user installations over system-wide ones, and orders by language version rather than using the most recently installed version.Python installer links Python's file extensions to  verb by default, so you can run a python file simply by typing its name (and args if needed).: ,  and  (byte-compiled), and  (zip-compressed).:  and  (zip-compressed).Caveat: be aware of the differences between python.exe and pythonw.exeAmong other advantages, Windows launcher reads 'nix shebangs, so you can specify Python version or 's command line argumentsYou can check this running this script (supposing py3 as default):: runs with , launches  and enters in interactive mode after finished (, great option for testing and debugging).: runs with , launches  and keeps interactive mode.: runs with default python runtime, no interactive mode.You can change this default association with , but I would strongly recommend:Nirsoft's File Types Manager utility.Taking a look at msdn docs about file extensions and associations: Implementing a Custom File Format.You can easily associate other verbs (like , , ...) to these files.In addition, you can omit Python's extensions to run a file in a terminal by adding them to  environment variable ordered by preference. (You must re-open the terminal for the change to take effect).
