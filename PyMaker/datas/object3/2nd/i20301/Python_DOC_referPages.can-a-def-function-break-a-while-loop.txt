Yes, I know that I cannot . But how can I break a while loop by the def function? Or my concept is wrong?
No it cannot. Do something like:
A very Pythonic way to do it would be to use exceptions with something like the following:Another, less common approach would be to use a  function which will return  indicating that it's time to quit calling  on it:
You could have  return  (to continue) or  (to stop) and then have or indeed just loop
If you use a  loop instead of a , you can cause it to break early by ing  - this is the usual signal for a  loop to finish, and as an exception, it can be nested inside functions as deep as you need and will propagate outward until it is caught. This means you need something to iterate over - and so, you probably want to change your function into a generator:, in which case instead of doing , you would just  from the generator and the loop will finish. However, note that this (as well as options having the function return a flag that you test in the loop condition) is subtly different to using  - if you use an  clause on your loop, ing from a generator will trigger it, whereas  in the loop body won't.

I would be tempted to just re-factor similar to:And then you can do things such as:This allows a possible meaningful value to be returned from  instead of using it as a "do I break" flag.This will also allow the following construct:
