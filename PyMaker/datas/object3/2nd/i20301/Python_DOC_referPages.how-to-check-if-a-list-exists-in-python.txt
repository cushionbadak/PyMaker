What is the easiest way to check to see if a list or dict exists in python ?Im using the following but this isn't working:Thanks,
For the lists:The same is for the dicts:
You can use a try/except block:
When you try to reference a non-existing variable the interpreter raises .  It's not safe, however, to rely on the existence of a variable in your code (you'd better initialize it to None or something).  Sometimes I used this:
If you're able to name it - it obviously "exists" - I assume you mean to check that it's "non-empty"... The most pythonic method is to use . Note, this won't work on generators/iterables to check if they will return data as the result will always be .If you just want to use a certain index/key, then just try and use it:
Examples:Or use this:
Simple console test:Examples show how to check if a list has elements:Otherwise:If you need to check existence/nonexistence of a list/tuple maybe this can be of help:If we need to avoid of in globals() maybe we can use this:Bibliography: 8.15. types — Names for built-in types — Python v2.7.3 documentation  https://docs.python.org/3/library/types.html
Check (1) variable exist and (2) check it is list
