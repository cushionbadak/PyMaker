How would you print this listin alphabetical order with the highest number for each person, by the highest number of each person in descending order and by the average score of each person in descending order?Ive looked into using class1.values() but this only prints all the values where do i go from here to sorting them?
Assuming I understood your question, these should do it:result:then:result:then:result:
