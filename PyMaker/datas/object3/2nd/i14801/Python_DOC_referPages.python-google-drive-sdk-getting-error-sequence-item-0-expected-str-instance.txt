Consider the code below:I am getting following error:Any idea why it is happening?
This error occurs because of the difference in the way Python 2 and Python 3 handle byte strings, more details about this are available here:https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.htmlThis issue occurs because of the way that oath2client and httplib2 handled strings as bytes - the latest version of httplib2 which is newer than the current PyPI version(as of 03/25/2015) has included a work around for this issue.Eventually the developers might decide on a different solution to the problem, however, you can use the newer version of httplib2 to resolve this problem in your code.
