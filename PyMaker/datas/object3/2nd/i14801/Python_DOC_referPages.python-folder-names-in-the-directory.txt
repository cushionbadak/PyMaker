You can use EDITIf you only want the first level and not actually "walk" through the subdirectories, it is even less code:This is not really what  is made for. If you really only want one level of subdirectories, you can also use  like Yannik Ammann suggested:
You should import os first.This would give you list with all files in the FileDirectoryPath sorted.
Starting with Python 3.4, you can also use the new  module:
You can use  here a link to the docsWarning returns files and directoriesexample:update: you need to check if the returned names are directories or files
Use 
I use os.listdir Get all folder names of a directoryGet all folder paths of a directoryGet all file names of a directoryGet all file paths of a directory
