From the following dictionary  structure, how do I extract and print email addresses? E.g. I want to see 'smauel.david@gmail' 4, 'sdusa@yahoo.com' 1, etc.
Use dict comprehensionsoutput:
You can iterate the keys, and grab only those that contain  (assuming that all your keys are either hours or email addresses):OUTPUT
Assuming:If the address are of the type you show, you can use  on the keys:If, however, you might have more complete strings representing the RFC822 email address of  type (or a mixture) you might want to use email.utils.parseaddr() to separate the comment (or real name) from the actual address:So then:Note:  Only separates the parts of a valid but complete RFC822 address; it does not validate that it is a real address.
