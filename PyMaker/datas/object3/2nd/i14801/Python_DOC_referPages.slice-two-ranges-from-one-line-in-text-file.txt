Natural Text
I'm trying to extract two ranges per line of an opened text file in python 3 by looping through.The application has a Entry widget and the value is stored in . I then loop through a text file which contains the values I want, and write out the results to  and then display in a Textbox.I've tried variations of the third line below but am not getting anywhere.I want to write out characters in each line from 3:24 and 81:83 ...Here's an abridged version of the text file I'm working with (original here):
You're not far off - your problem is that you need to specify what you're slicing each time you slice it:... but you'll probably want to separate the two fields with a space:However, if you find yourself using  more than once to construct a string, you should think about using Python's built-in string-formatting abilities instead (and while you're at it, you can add that newline in the same operation):
