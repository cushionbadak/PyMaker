This question already has an answer here:How to test multiple variables against a value?                    21 answers                This is a piece of code I was trying to make one day:It was supposed to be a text-based RPG game, the problem is, when i run it, no matter what I enter for the gender, I get get the printed message "You are a male" as if it overrided the first if statement and somehow made it true. The way it is supposed to work is that during a loop you would be asked a question, then check if the answer really made any sense and assign it a specific value that would not change. if the answer did not make any sense, it was supposed to say "Sorry, I could not understand you." and loop back to the question. I am fairly new to coding and would appreciate any input.
The line  will always be true.What you are checking is if gender_answer equals "male" or if one of the other options are true where the other options are tested for their truthiness. As any non-empty string is True, the condition becomes  which will always be true.Use  instead or better yet .
You need to make a complete condition.Same solution for the elif.Because "male" (or any string) is considered to be true, you go into the if. You need to compare it every times.
