If I have a list with say  how can I make it add upp every second number, for instance ?I've tried adding  etc but it is very tedious.
the  takes every other item, and  sums it.If you want to have the first, third, fifth et cetera item, you can use:  This will first omit the first item (with the  part), then do the same as in the first command.
