I'm quite new to using Django, so please be gentle, if this is a stupid question. I'm trying to play with some stock-information in Python/Django. I'm getting the stock-rates from Yahoo Finance (with urllib). Whenever I get some stock-information, then I will get it like this (yep, it's one long string):I then send it to a template with Django, using and then Is there a way, to get Django to beautify the long string for me? So I don't have to manipulate the string and replace all  with , in order for me to be able to read it easier? And what does the [b' ... '] mean (that contains the entire result?Thanks for your assistance.
