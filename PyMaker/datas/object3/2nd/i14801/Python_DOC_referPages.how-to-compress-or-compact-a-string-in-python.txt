Natural Text
I'm making a python "script" that sends a string to a webservice (in C#). I NEED to compress or compact this string, because the bandwidth and MBs data is LIMITED (yeah, in capitals because it's very limited).I was thinking of converting it into a file and then compressing the file. But I'm looking for a method to directly compress the string.How can I compress or compact the string?
How about zlib?You can also use  to see how much data an object takes up before and after compression.
