I have two modules:constants.pytest.pyThe result is:I would expect to get:Why is that? What am I missing? Can I fix it to give expected results?
I recommend something like the answer by adarsh for "real code", but if what you need to do is just to hack some existing code as quickly as possibly, you might try reimporting the constants, with a  like:You would also have to modify  so that it doesn't reset the  to 1 when reimporting, something like:
You can't share global variables across modules in Python as such. You could use a config module, by importing it where ever you need it in the project and since there would only be one instance of it, you can use that as a global. It is described in the documentation.
