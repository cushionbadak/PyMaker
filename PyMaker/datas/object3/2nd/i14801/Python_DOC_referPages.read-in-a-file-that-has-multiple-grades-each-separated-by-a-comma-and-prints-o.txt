QUESTION: Complete the following program, which reads in a file that has multiple grades, each separated by a comma, and prints out the computed average. That is, write the functions  and I have inserted the given function and wrote a new program, but I am little bit confused, also I am getting an error. Please help!
In your  function, you pass the argument  but for the  loop you use the local variable name  of function .Also, the result of  is a list of strings. To convert them to integers to perform the summations you can use .  returns an iterator that applies function to every item of iterable, yielding the results.To remove newline and other whitespace from the lines you read you can use .Finally, to perform a floating point division if both your arguments are integers you have to transform one of the two to a . Check this answer.The final program looks like this:If you run this with a test file with contents:5,10,15,20you get: without  and with list comprehensions could be:Finally you can do it the naive way and have a for loop for converting each element in the list returned by split to integer:
