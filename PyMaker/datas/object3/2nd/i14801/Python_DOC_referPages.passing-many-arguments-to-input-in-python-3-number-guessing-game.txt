I just started learning programming in Python with Michael Dawson's book and cannot think of a way to get around a problem with an exercise. It's supposed to be a 'guess a number' game where the computer tries to guess a number I chose.As you probably expect, this is what python feeds me back:So I know that I shouldn't expect to take more than 1 argument but I can't really grasp what to do with this. Any friendly kick towards the solution will be highly appreciated :)
 expects a single string as mentioned in the docsIf the prompt argument is present, it is written to standard output without a trailing newline.Use  instead
You can add one line above input and change the input function call a bit.
