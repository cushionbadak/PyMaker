I am writing a raingauge precipitation calculator based in the radius of the raingauge. When I run my script, I have this error message:I am using for data input. When using  the typecasting was automatic.How can I have a  entered value using ? 
As mentioned in the docsThe function then reads a line from input, converts it to a string (stripping a trailing newline), and returns thatSo you need to type cast it to  explicitly 
You need to cast to float, input returns a string in python3:  Probably safer use a while loop with a try/except when casting input.
