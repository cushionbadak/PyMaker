Now, if I add a generic descriptor and replace the  attribute in , this happens: So far, so good. However, using the above descriptor, if we do something like this: This error occurs because of this failed attribute lookup:What I want is for the descriptor to "fail silently" and for the attribute lookup to continue up the MRO chain. I'm unsure how to do this. I tried this: But that does not do the trick. How can I get the behavior I want? I have a feeling I need to use  somehow in this case, but I don't know what to do with it. 
Two things.you need to store the reference to the actual attribute name in the , so that you can use that in the parent lookup.during the lookup, you can delegate the attribute fetching work to the  class, with So your  would look like this
You can take care of setting _i in the init method as follows.
