I'd like an equivalent of the Django One True Way settings layout: a shared base file, and then a production file and a development file, each of which import the shared base.Is this possible with Pyramid's config?
Yes that's possible. In one of my projects I have a  file and all other production inis inherit from it: You can also check paste docs for more examples.  Side note - you can't inherit logging section though.
