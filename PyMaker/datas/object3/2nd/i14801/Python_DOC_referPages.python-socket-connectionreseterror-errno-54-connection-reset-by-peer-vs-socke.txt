And or how are the two errors  and  related?PS: I read that the  might be related to http proxy (I'm using a proxy in my code). If so, how?
According to the  library  is Did you determine that by examining ? Anyway - this  library might be at fault. You could verify the meaning of an error code on your system by looking into , e. g. with the help of :Also, the Python documentation says:To translate a numeric error code to an error message, use  os.strerror().It may well be that error number 54 is  on your system, and that  will attest that.Now that you have verified that  returns 'Exchange full', I am puzzled why the error number  and the error string  do not match. If that happens on a system with  or something similar, I would further check which error is returned by the operating system through use of  on the affected process.Regarding your question about EXFULL: Its meaning seems somewhat system dependent; e. g. on Linux, EXFULL is returned from only a handful places in the kernel, the only network-related place being in br_if.c concerning network bridges, when no available bridge port number is found (other places are in USB and SCSI drivers).
