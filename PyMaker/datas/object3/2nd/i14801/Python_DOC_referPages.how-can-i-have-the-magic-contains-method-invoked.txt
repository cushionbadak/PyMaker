I have the contains method in my Sentence class that checks if a word is in a sentence(string in my case) I tried to check in my  if  exist in  and I got this error instead:here is my codeHow do you call the  function? Did I make a mistake in the class method function or did I make a mistake in the  when calling it? I am expecting to get .
Quoting the documentation of ,Called to implement membership test operators. Should return true if  is in , false otherwise. For mapping objects, this should consider the keys of the mapping rather than the values or the key-item pairs.For objects that donâ€™t define , the membership test first tries iteration via , then the old sequence iteration protocol via So, it will be invoked when used with the membership testing operator, , and you should use it like thisImportant Note: Python 3.x, doesn't have  special method at all. Quoting Python 3.0 Change log,,  and  were killed. The syntax  now translates to  (or  or , when used as an assignment or deletion target, respectively).So, you cannot invoke it with the slicing syntax.I am expecting to get True.No. You cannot get , because you already called  before the membership test. So, your  is  by the time membership test is happening. So, you will actually get .Note 1: In Python, boolean values are represented with  and . But in your  function you are returning  which will raise  at runtime. You can better write it succinctly like thisNote 2: Also in your  function,you are using  and  which are not defined. Perhaps you wanted to use  and  like this
You can call the  function by using  keywordlike
