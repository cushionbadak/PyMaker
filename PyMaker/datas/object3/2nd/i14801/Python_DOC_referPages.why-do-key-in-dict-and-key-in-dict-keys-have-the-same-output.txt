I tried to search the keys in a dictionary, but I forgot to add the  function. I still got the expected answer.Why is the result the same for these two expressions?and
To understand why  returns the same result as  one needs to look in the past. Historically in Python 2, one would test the existence of a key in dictionary  with . This was changed for Python 2.2, when the preferred way became , which basically did the same thing:In a minor related change, the  operator now works on dictionaries, so   is now equivalent to The behaviour of  is implemented internally in terms of the  dunder method. Its behaviour is documented in the Python language reference - 3 Data Model:Called to implement membership test operators. Should return true if item is in , false otherwise. For mapping objects, this should consider the keys of the mapping rather than the values or the key-item pairs.  For objects that donâ€™t define , the membership test first tries iteration via , then the old sequence iteration protocol via , see this section in the language reference.(emphasis mine; dictionaries in Python are mapping objects)In Python 3, the  method was removed altogether and now there the correct way to test for the existence of a key is solely , as documented.In contrast with the 2 above,  has never been the correct way of testing whether a key exists in a dictionary.The result of both your examples is indeed the same, however  is slightly slower on Python 3 and is abysmally slow on Python 2. returns true, if the  is found as a key in the  in almost constant time operation - it does not matter whether there are two or a million keys - its time complexity is constant on average case (O(1)) in Python 2 creates a  of all keys; and in Python 3 a view of keys; both of these objects understand the . With Python 2 it works like for any iterable; the values are iterated over and  is returned as soon as one value is equal to the given value (here ).In practice, in Python 2 you'd find  much slower than  ( scales linearly with the number of keys - its runtime complexity is O(n).)In Python 3, the  won't be much slower than as the view does not make a list of the keys, and the access still would be O(1), however in practice it would be slower by at least a constant value, and it is 7 more characters, so there is no reason to use it, even if on Python 3.
Python data model dictates that generally a membership test are normally implemented as an iteration through a sequence unless a container object supplies the special method   . As mentioned further in the document, for objects that does not implement the    special method, the membership test first tries iteration via , then the old sequence iteration protocol via .Its important to know that for dictionaries,  returns either an iterator either a dictionary view (Python 3.X) or a sequence (more precisely a list), in Python (2.X). Membership test for a sequence/list is an  complexity  where as for a dictionary like object which is implemented as a hash map, or a dictionary view which supports operation like supports operations like membership test and iteration has a complexity of O(1).So for Python 2.X, there is a distinct difference in terms of what both does, that might impact performance, where as for Python 2.X, the only overhead is an extra function call.In any case, it is always preferred to use the membership on the dict object rather than using the membership test on a dictionary view or a sequence which is returned by
