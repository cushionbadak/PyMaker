I have the following structure:In  I have,In  I have, When I run  I get,I do not have  anywhere and I do not have a virtual environment.  How does my reference work without the  file? Is it because I'm using Python 3.4? I am in Windows 7 if it matters.EDIT:  Best I can tell it is because I am in 3.4.  I explicitly used  and it failed until I put .
The 3.4 Glossary has this entrynamespace packageA PEP 420 package which serves only as a container for subpackages.  Namespace packages may have no physical representation, and  specifically are not like a regular package because they have no  init.py file.From my reading of the PEP, directories contained in directories on  but not containing  are potential namespace directories.  When  is run, , representing , is added to the front of .  Therefore, the directories in `/blog' are searched as potential namespace directories.The PEP also saysIf a developer knows that her package will never be a portion of a  namespace package, then there is a performance advantage to it being a  regular package (with an init.py ).  Creation and loading of a regular   package can take place immediately when it is located along the path.  With namespace packages, all entries in the path must be scanned  before the package is created.In other words, every directory on  is searched for possibly other modules in the  package, instead of stopping with  (). I would go ahead and add the  files that you thought were required. The PEP also noted the possible surprise effect.Note that an ImportWarning will no longer be raised for a directory  lacking an init.py file. Such a directory will now be imported as  a namespace package, whereas in prior Python versions an ImportWarning  would be raised.
Yes, as of Python 3.3 you do not need to include  in your packages. Please see PEP 420 for more details.
