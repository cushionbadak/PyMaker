I have a Python script around 5,000 lines long. If I make a single change in the file, do I have to recompile the entirety of the file, or is it possible to compile only that part or particular code?
CPython will re-generate the bytecode for an altered source file from scratch. There is no 'partial' compilation option for just the lines that you changed. Recompilation is transparent and automatic.I'm not aware of any Python implementation that would behave otherwise.I'd not be worried about speed here though; compiling a 5000 line module doesn't take all that long. But from a maintenance point of view you should still look into refactoring your module into a smaller separate modules.
