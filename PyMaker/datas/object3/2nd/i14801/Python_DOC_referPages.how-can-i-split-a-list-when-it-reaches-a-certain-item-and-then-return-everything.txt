In this program I am looking for the last item that ends with 0,1 or 2 and return that item along with everything that comes after it 
This searches from the end of the list, returning the appropriate slice the first time it hits a match (and returning  if it doesn't):

Loop over the list backwards, and return a sliced list:Replace  with  if you're using Python 3.
