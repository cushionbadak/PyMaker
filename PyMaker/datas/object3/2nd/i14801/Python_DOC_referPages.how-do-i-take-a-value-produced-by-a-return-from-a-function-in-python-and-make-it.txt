So i'm creating a little experimental python program and I'm using a little tidbit of code (shown below) to determine if a number is whole or has decimal places.My problem is that no matter where I go I can't find a way to just take the returned value and assign it to a variable...Sorry if I seem like an absolute spurglord noob for asking this question but I never even knew that functions could "return" until about 2 days ago, so yeah...
like this:
The return value will always be 1.
Answering your question, how to assign a variable, just assign it to the output of the function as below:As long as you have a  in your function, you can assign a variable to the output:However if you do not have a , then it returns , so beware :)
As others have explained, you can just assign the result of calling the function to a variable name to save the value. Perhaps equally important though, is the fact that the code shown in your function will always return  since the value of  is always going to be  regardless of the value of  (assuming its value is non-zero and a type with a modulo operator).I would suggest that tou instead implement your function to return a  or  value and do it like the following:(See the  documentation for more information.)You can assign the result of calling this function to a variable as shown below:
