I am trying to create a GUI in tkinter. The Gui is basically for Mcp23017. I am trying to configure the input and output pins so that the user could change them according to their choice.. There is also an option to make the inputs/outputs high or low..Now I am trying to read a pin using 'i2cget'(using a seperate function).. I need to display the output of this subprocess call into a label on the gui.. This is what my code looks like:When this function excutes(by pressing a button), however it prints a value '1' on the python shell alternatly when I press the button... I dont know how to redirect the output to the label.. Could somebody suggest something?Update:: On executing the suggested commands:I printed the 'output' and 'process' and they gave me the follwing respectivley:Since nothing is connected to the pin I expect it to return a value of '0'.. I don't know what is the b'' it is giving me ...Any advice is really appreciated..Kind Regards,Namita.
What you have is the return code, not the output.From  docs:Run the command described by args. Wait for command to complete, then return the returncode attribute.Instead, use  to open a process,  to pipe the output to you, and  get the output:
There are multiple things wrong in your code. You should split your problem into tiny tiny subtasks and complete each task independently.1. Get output from a subprocess as a string variable in Python returns an integer (exit status), not string (the output) -- start Python REPL and try to run any command via  and see for yourself: it should help you to understand what is happening in addition to reading the linked documentation.You could use , to get the output if you don't mind blocking your GUI thread -- nothing will respond until the subprocess returns. Otherwise (if  does not return in an instant, always), you could do it asynchroniously using threads or  method.2. Learn why  is useless in PythonIt is SyntaxError in Python 2 by default. Otherwise  function always returns  i.e., you could have written  (except that  is printed to stdout as a side-effect).3.
