Natural Text
I don't understand why the following code is returning an error  in the  method. I know that I have created one, and my debugger shows it as a class attribute. What is wrong with this (simple) code? 
As noted in the comments, the error is raised because  calls  on the class instance (i.e. ) before  has been set.The reason why the  module does this is because it collects a lot of debugging information whilst parsing the  file, and that includes logging the object passed as the  argument of .Unfortunately, it does this by (indirectly) calling  when it probably should be calling . (Or possibly just not logging debugging information at all when calling the python API functions. The command-line interface has an option for switching on debugging, but it seems this only controls whether the logged information is displayed, rather than whether it is gathered in the first place).It certainly is natural to want to call  at the earliest possible point during initialisation - just as you'd do with . But no matter how you load the ui into your application,  will generate the code in exactly the same way. The only difference with  is that it calls  on the generated code at runtime, whereas with , the same code is just imported as a static module.There a number of ways to solve your immediate problem. Personally, I think I would probably choose to pre-initialise  as class attributes:
Actual answer: move the  call to after you create the s.Comments on code:Only call the constructor once (not once as  and once as )When using , you don't need to also call  -- that's what  does.If writing Python3 only code, your  call can leave out the  portion and just be
