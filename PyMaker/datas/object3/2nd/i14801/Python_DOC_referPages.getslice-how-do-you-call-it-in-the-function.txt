I have a  with a magic method function I am not understanding how to call that function ? I am trying to do slicing of words. so for example if the string is  , and I slice it at [0:1] , I expect to get I am getting instead this error: Here is my code:Also where can I learn more about magic method functions ? As it seems I am having trouble calling the functions more than writing them
When you do  you are actually trying to slice the method . That is why it is failing with the errorImportant Note:  is deprecated since Python 2.0 and it is not available in Python 3.x. Quoting the official documentation of ,Deprecated since version 2.0: Support slice objects as parameters to the  method. (However, built-in types in CPython currently still implement . Therefore, you have to override it in derived classes when implementing slicing.)So you should use  for slicing. Quoting the question,for example if the string is "HELLO WORLD, james" , and I slice it at [0:1] , I expect to get "HELLO"Since you want to get words with slicing, if the key passed to  is a  object, then call  and slice the returned object like shown belowNote 1: You don't have to explicitly call  when you are  subscripting the  object. You can simply doThis will internally call  with  as .Note 2: Same as the previous one. You don't have to explicitly call  and that can be implicitly called with the arithmetic operator , like thisNote 3: In your  implementation, you are using  method (which is a deprecated dictionary method on a string. So, at runtime, your program will fail withPerhaps you meant to use  operator.PS: I am not sure what this  method tries to achieve.
 was deprecated in Python 2.6 and is removed in Python 3. You should instead use  which will receive a slice object when called with slice notation. i.e.You can refer to the datamodel documentation for details on all the magic methods.
