I am trying to assign multiple keys to the same value in a single step and am having trouble.I would like to assign a range of numbers like  all to  without having to assign the individually.Is this possible?
You can use a dictionary comprehension:
You can use .fromkeys() method:If the dictionary is already existing, use .update():Which let's you do multiple ranges with different values:Think of it as kinda like a slice for a dictionary. Don't make this mistake with it though:Since value in  is fixed, not interated. 
Define an empty dictionary then iterate over the numbers in the range 1 to 100 then assign  AZ to each number as dictionary key.
No, it is not possible, but it is easy to do via dictionary comprehension:
