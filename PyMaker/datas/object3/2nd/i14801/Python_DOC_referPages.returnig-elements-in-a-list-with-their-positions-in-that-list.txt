I have a list, and i want to return each element in that list along with its position in it.for example: should return:The following is how I've approached it:which returned to me:The function should behave exactly like the built-in enumerate function, but I'm not allowed to use it. 
Your program produces cartesian product of all the indexes and elements of the list. It takes each index and produces all the strings with the elements in the list. Also, note that, you should iterate only till the length of the list, when you do , you are actually exceeding the actual length of the list.You can use only the first loop, like thisYou can also use a simple list comprehension, like thisNote 1: In Python 3.x, you don't have to use the positions in the format string unless it is necessary. So,  is enough.Note 2: If you actually wanted to return tuples, like , then you should not use string formatting, instead prepare tuples like thisNote 3: If you actually wanted to simulate  like it works in Python 3.x, then you should better use a generator function, like thisNote 4: More good news is, you can write the same , with  and a generator expression, like this
If you write it as a generator, it will even work with infinite generators:
You can do it in a one-liner pretty easily using , , and :The above would be the Python 2 version. Note that in Python 3,  returns a generator, which actually may be just what you need, but if you absolutely need a list, you can just wrap the returned expression in a  call.
