I need to compare directories. I use follow code (sample):But code show different files only for root directory: http://i.stack.imgur.com/zUf2i.png. See screenshot with real different between directories:http://i.stack.imgur.com/FpQTe.png.What is wrong?
It sounds like the subdirectories  and  are only present in one place (there is no  directory nor a ). The comparison by  doesn't recurse into those directories, since it knows ahead of time that every file will be unmatched.If this isn't what you want, you should probably treat unmatched directories differently from unmatched regular files, using  to inspect their contents. Try something like this:This should print all files that exist in only one folder (even if they're within a directory that only exists in that one). Note that the  object you're getting already has the information you need for your recursion on the . Check out its  attribute. You could refactor your code so that you only call  once, and then pass the results into a recursive function to print them out.
