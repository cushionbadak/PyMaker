I have a class MenuWhat I am trying to do here is format the repr function so that it prints all the options. Right now it will correctly printBut can I throw a for loop in that return statement, or is there a proper way of fixing this?
You can join all the values in the list, with  function and return it like thisNote:If you are creating an attribute called  in , it will shadow the class level attribute , when you access it with . will not create a new list when you assign. It will make both  and  refer the same list object passed. So, if you change , it will be reflected in  as well. If you want to make a copy, you can use slicing like this
