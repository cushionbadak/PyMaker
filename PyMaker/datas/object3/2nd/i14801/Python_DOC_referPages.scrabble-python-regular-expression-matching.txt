I am attempting to create a simple scrabble solver program that can create a list of all 3 letter words in the Python words corpus dictionary. I have had a read up on searching for regular expressions in python, however have not yet been able to come up with a solution for my problem.I am a beginner to python, so this may be a very easy fix or program, but any help would be much appreciated. Here is my expression, which is meant to return every 3 letter word consisting of only vowels within the dictionary, however it is currently returning every word in the dictionary that contains a vowel! I have a feeling it may be to do with my metacharacters but am unsure.
To store all 3 letter words, consisting only of vowels:  would match either ,  or .  would match exactly 3 of those.  matches the beginning of the string.Alternatively, if you want to avoid regular expressions: If a non vowel is found,  breaks and its  is not reached, so the word is not stored.
I'd use anchors, add the  letter that also can be a vowel, and  character class:If 'y' is yielding unwanted results, you can remove the  letter from the character class.
