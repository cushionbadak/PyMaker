I am converting a c++ code into python. C++ code reads a binary file and then converts it to a different endianness. I am facing problem doing the same in python. Can someone help me on the same?Here is the C++ code:Here,  is a structure. I am using ctypes in python to create same structure and using  function to read the structure from the binary file. Can someone help me on what is the best way to do this?Currently Written Python Code:Thanks.
Most of the code that you copied does is a very complicated way of byte-swapping  values. The  module can readily handle it for you, so you do not need to worry about it.The real problem there is to read the actual  using its actual layout.Say, you have a structure with the following layout:and you are reading it from little-endian and writing it to big-endian. The format for that is ; and the flag for big-endian is , and the little-endian is ; thus we get:
