My code currently reads in a string (made of numbers -) and uses that value to blit a tile to the screen in a corresponding array. Since I use numbers it's easy to slice the string to get one character and cast that value to an int to use it as a index, e.g.:Since I use this method, I can only have 10 elements in the tiles array (because I cant slice a number like ). Can anyone think of a way around this to get, let's say, 20 elements in the tile array?
In the same way that e.g. hexadecimal uses  for ,  for , and so on, just use letters for numbers beyond :One advantage of this is that  in Python already implements this for s beyond :which simplifies your implementation.
