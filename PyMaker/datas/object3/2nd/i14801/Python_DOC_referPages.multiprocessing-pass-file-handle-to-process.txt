My program spawns multiple processes to do some time consuming calculations. The results are then collected in a queue and a writer process writes them into an output file.Below is a simplified version of my code which should illustrate my issue. If I comment out the flush statement in the  class,  is empty at the end of the program.What exactly is happening here? Is  not closed properly? Was it naive to assume that passing the file handle to an autonomous process should work in the first place?
The writer is a separate process. The data it writes to the file might be buffered, and because the process keeps running, it doesn't know that it should flush the buffer (write it to the file). Flushing manually is the right thing to do. Normally, the file would be closed when you exit the with block, and this would flush the buffer. But the parent process doesn't know anything about its children's buffers, so the child has to flush it's own buffer (closing the file should work too - that doesn't close the file for the parent, at least on Unix systems). Also, check out the Pool class from multiprocessing (https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing.pool) - it might save you some work.
