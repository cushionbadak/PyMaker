I have 2 programs, one is calling the other through subprocess. Running this in pyCharm. My issue is that the call to the second program doesn't print out the desired string (see programs). What am I doing wrong, or is my understanding of the subprocess wrong?this is something.py:this is diff.py:I decided to try subprocessing instead of importing for the purpose of running the calls concurrently in diff threads in the future. For now I just wanted to make sure I grasp subprocessing but I'm stuck at this basic level with this issue and get figure it out.
You must use python to run python files.I would be careful to understand the layout of how pycharm saves files. Maybe consider trying to run a program that already exists for the Windows command line if you are just trying to learn about the subprocess module.returns 
Thank you. subprocess.call("python something.py", shell=True) now works as intended but for some reason the very same call from pyCharm does not return the second string from diff.py  I assume the issue is with pyCharm then
To run  script from the current directory using the same Python interpreter that runs the parent script:do not use  unless it is necessary e.g., unless you need to run an internal command such as , you don't need  in most casesuse  instead of  to raise an exception if the child script returns with non-zero exit codeWhy[When] I try python something.py pyCharm fires up to interpret it.You should associate  extension with  (Python launcher). Though if running the command:literally brings up PyCharm with the file  opened instead of running the script using a Python interpreter then something is really broken. Find out what program is run then you type  (without arguments).Make sure you understand the difference between:Try to run it from the command-line () and from IDLE () and see what happens in each case.You should prefer to import the Python module and use ,  modules if necessary  to run the corresponding functions  instead of running the Python script as a child process via  module.
