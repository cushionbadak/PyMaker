I'm currently trying to write a small Python script which parses a SVN  file and writes the result to a  which can easily be opened in Microsoft Excel or similar programs. However, I'm stuck at the parsing part, more precisely at the line sorting. The file I want to parse looks like the following.To easily parse the file and write keys that belong together next to each other into a table, I need to sort it by key pairs, so it looks like the following. That way, I'll be able to run through the file easily.Is there a build-in way to do this kind of sorting or a simple alternative?
Yes, there is! You can use the  (or ) functions with your own sorting function:
There are many ways to do it by implementing the 'key' in sorted(). Here is a demo for a crude method.
