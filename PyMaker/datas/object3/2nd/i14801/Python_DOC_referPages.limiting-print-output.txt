I have a number of objects that I need to print out to the terminal (for debugging). The normal  function is almost perfect, except that some objects are too large, so  would create millions of lines of output. I'd like to create a function that does what  does, except that the output is truncated after a predefined number of characters, replacing the rest with .What's a good way to do that?Note that performance is a concern, so ideally I'd prefer not to save a gigabyte-sized string and then take the first few characters from it; similarly,  is a bit of a problem since it sorts keys in dictionaries (and with millions of keys it takes a while).Example:Python 3, if it matters.
The  module (Python 3.x only) suggested by @m0nhawk is made exactly for this purpose. Here's how you would use it:If you're fine with the default limits, you can simply use :Output:In order to customize the available limits, simply create a  instance and set the appropriate instance attributes:Output:If you're dealing with sequence objects that refer to themselves, you can use  to limit the recursion depth:Output:Note that  returns a string, but doesn't  it (unless you're in an interactive console where the result of every expression you enter gets evaluated and its representation displayed). 
Why not just make a simple slice wrapper over the  function? does the same thing as  before writing to the output stream. So what you want to do is do that casting early, before passing it into print, and then slice off a chunk of it that has a max size of whatever you want.Python slicing is graceful, so a string slice like  evaluates simply to  rather than raising an error.
