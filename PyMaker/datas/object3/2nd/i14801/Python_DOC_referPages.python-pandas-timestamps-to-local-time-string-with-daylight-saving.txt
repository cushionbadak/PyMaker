I have a dataframe with a TimeStamps column. I want to convert it to strings of local time, ie with daylight saving. So I want to convert ts[0] below to "2015-03-30 03:55:05". Pandas seems to be aware of DST, but only when you call .values on the series.Thanks
DST is relative to your location (e.g. London DST began a few weeks after NY).  You first need to make the timestamp timezone aware: See pytz or datetime for more information.
