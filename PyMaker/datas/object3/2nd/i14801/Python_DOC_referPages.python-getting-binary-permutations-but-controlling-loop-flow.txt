For starters, I read this: all permutations of a binary sequence x bits longThis is similar to what I want, but I don't want to generate all permutations in advance. What I want is more of a generator that I can step through and stop whenever I want (for efficiency reasons, I have cutoff conditions where I want to halt).I was wondering if there is an elegant way to do this Python. The answers to the question above all involved ".join"s, but I don't think that will work here. I assume I need to use itertools.Any ideas?
Since you like the solution in the answer you link to, here's the generator version:Using parens instead of square brackets  gives you a generator that creates the values on demand. It's easy to turn almost any function into generator; see the python tutorial for the details.
