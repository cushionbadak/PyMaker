I am working in . I have created the following files:In :In :When testing the script with python, it looks OK:I then launch the webserver and the scheduler locally. My problem is that I don't see any DAG with id . There is no  file being created. What is being done wrong? Why isn't the code in  being executed?
To be found by Airflow, the DAG object returned by  must be in the global namespace of the  module. One way to place a DAG in the global namespace is simply to assign it to a module level variable:Another way is to update the global namespace using :The later may look like an overkill, but it is useful for creating multiple DAGs dynamically. For example, in a for-loop:Side Note: Any  file placed in  (even in sub-directories, such as  in your case) will be parsed by Airflow. If you do not want this you can use packaged DAGs.
You need to assign the dag to an exported variable in the module. If the dag isn't in the module  airflow's DagBag processor won't pick it up.Check out the source here: https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/master/airflow/models.py#L428
