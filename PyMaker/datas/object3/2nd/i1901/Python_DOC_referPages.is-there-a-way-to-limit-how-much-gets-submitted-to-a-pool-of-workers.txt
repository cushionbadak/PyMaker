I have a Pool of workers and use  to submit work to them.I do not care for the result of the function applied to each item.The pool seems to accept any number of  calls, no matter how large the data or how quickly the workers can keep up with the work. Is there a way to make  block as soon as a certain number of items are waiting to be processed? I am sure internally, the pool is using a Queue, so it would be trivial to just use a maximum size for the Queue?If this is not supported, would it make sense to submit a big report because this look like very basic functionality and rather trivial to add?It would be a shame if one had to essentially re-implement the whole logic of Pool just to make this work.Here is some very basic code:
So something like this?I dunno how fast you're expecting each worker to finish, the  may or may not be necessary or might need to be a different time or whatever. 
an alternative might be to use 's directly:mostly stolen from example Python's  module:https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html#queue.Queue.join
