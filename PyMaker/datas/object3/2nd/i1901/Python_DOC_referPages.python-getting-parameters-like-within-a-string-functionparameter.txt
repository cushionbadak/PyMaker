I'm trying to get the type of MySQL columns, and I'm retrieving them as strings in python. They are not really functions but datatypes that can be or can't be signed.example:needed from the string :if type has no specitfed limit or can't be signedneeded from the string :
A regular expression can directly extract the fields you describe: and  match the start and end of the string. capture a group named  matches one or more characters that are not  matches an optional group contained in parentheses capture a group named   matches one or more digitsNote that you may want to pre-compile the regular expression if you need it often. See the documentation for Python's builtin regular expression module.If you want to avoid regular expressions, you can also use string methods. This allows you to partition and strip the input step by step:This trades speed and robustness against readability.Note that in both cases, you get the  as a string, not integer. You must convert it explicitly:
An important thing to note here is that  means an 8-byte integer that is padded to 20 characters in length when displayed, and not a 20-byte integer.You can use the  object to easily fetch this information by using the  attribute. It provides meta information about the column types of the last query that was executed. eg.You can find out more about the contents of the descriptions here: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/#cursor-attributes
