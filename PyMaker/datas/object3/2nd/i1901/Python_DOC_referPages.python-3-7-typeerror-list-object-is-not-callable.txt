This question already has an answer here:I'm getting “TypeError: 'list' object is not callable”. How do I fix this error? [duplicate]                    3 answers                Im hoping somebody can help me out in why the function I'm writing to convert a string into a list of list of binary numbers isn't working.Here's the error I'm getting when running the function with these arguments.Thanks for the help.
 is a reserved keyword in python. Use another name for your variable.
 is a Python built-in method but you named your final list  so when you get to  you've overwritten it. The error you get is because  now refers to a list which you then try to call like a function.Just rename  to something else.Also,  is not a great name for .
You have defined first bin as a list and then you are using it as a function.I think you want to do  instead
