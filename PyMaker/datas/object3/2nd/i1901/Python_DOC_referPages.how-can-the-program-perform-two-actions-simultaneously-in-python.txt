I wish to make a program that will print numbers from  to , and simultaneously count time, and both execute simultaneously in console. How can I do that? For example, I want to make program wich will count time while the computer writes numbers from  to : I want to these two  code blocks to execute simultaneously.
First of all, I'm not exactly clear on what you are trying to achieve (the general purpose of the code).But for the specific code question, you could try it with a single  loop, maybe like this:I don't know how to easily print on two different lines in the terminal, so my code just prints on the same line, one line per iteration. If you want to go into that, have a look at this answer and other similar ones.
If you want to measure the time it takes to print the number, you can try the  module:Or if you want, you can also measure the time difference using :Note that printing output consumes a lot of time; just the iteration without printing will take a lot less time.
