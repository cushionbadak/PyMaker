I have a set of files that do not have any extension. They are currently stored in a folder that is referenced by this variable "allFiles". I am trying to add an extension to each of the files in allFiles. Add .csv to the file name. I do it using the below code:Next I try to append each of these csv files into one as per the below code.When I run the above code, I get an error stating one of the files do not exist.But file1 has now been renamed to file1.csvCould anyone advice as to where am I going wrong in the above. ThanksUpdate:
Before running your loop, do:EDIT for clarity:Basically, the problem is that you're changing the file names, but you're not changing the strings in your list to reflect the new file names. You can see this if you print allFiles. The above will make the necessary change for you.
