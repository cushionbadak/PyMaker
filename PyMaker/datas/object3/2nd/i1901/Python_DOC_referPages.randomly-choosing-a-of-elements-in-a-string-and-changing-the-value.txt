I have a sting and need to randomly replace 5% of the elements, and flip them to 0 if they are 1, and flip them to 1 if they are 0.I have a string that looks like this:Effectively, 5% of the values in the string will change from a 0 to 1, or vice versa.I have tried this but it does not seem to work, and isn't guaranteed to only replace 5% of the elements:
This will work on Python 2.7 and 3.6 (tested; probably newer as well).I have tried this and it works, and is guaranteed to only replace 5% of the elements.It toggles exactly 5% -- the length of  divided by 20, which is 5% -- characters from  to  and from  to , without duplicates. Toggling is done with XOR operator and random.sample picks indices to replace "unique elements", i.e. without duplicates.
You need to change two thingsstrings are immutable. So,  before your loop, and  after itChoose in advance which elements you want to changeFirst, choose  random indexes. One option is using  without replacementand then modify the values as before.
