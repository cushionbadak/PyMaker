I mean to define a function  that replaces , such that in addition to printing the result of an expression it prints the expression itself. If I simply pass the expression as a string and use  inside , it will not know any variable local to the caller function.My current code isBut when usingI get (no surprise)I mean to getI conceived two ways of working around this. Use a Python like alternative for C preprocessor macros. Something like C Preprocessor Macro equivalent for PythonPass all local variables to print_echo.Something like Passing all arguments of a function to another functionSince I find inconvenient aspects for each of the two,Is there any alternative to these?Note that expr is a generic expression, not necessarily the name of a variable. 
Important Note: There can be more error handling to this case.For more info, you can see inspect and explore it further.https://docs.python.org/2/library/inspect.html
 only takes the global namespace, and the namespace local to where it is called, into account.In your case, you need the namespace of where  is called (i.e., the "parent" namespace of where  is called) as the local namespace, which you can get by using the  module and pass to  as an argument.Python 3 output:
