Natural Text
I tried the following codeOutput I got isThe first string  is printing on two lines.  then makes the second string print from the start of the 2nd line. I wanted the second string to print from the beginning of the first string. Is it possible to do it with  or should I use any other functions?
This is a feature of the terminal emulator you're using. Yes you can use print to do this, you need to output the appropriate terminal escape sequence for your terminal type.For example, if you're in an xterm like terminal emulator, the escape sequence is described here (that page is for bash, but python had very similar syntax). The escape sequence you'll likely most be interested in is:Save cursor position: \033[sRestore cursor position: \033[uIf you are doing something a lot more complex, you'll likely also be interested in the curses library.
It's tricky. First of all, not all terminals have same capabilities. For example,  and  that Lie Ryan talked about don't work on my terminal. It is safer to read the control sequences from the terminal database:However, this will not work on Windows. Also, it just saves the coordinates of the cursor in view, not in scroll history; so if you save the cursor on the last line, print something that scrolls the screen and restore cursor, you will not move at all (as it will go back to - the last line!)The workaround I was suggesting in comments before is this:Because this doesn't work with coordinates but actually moves cursor up from its position, it works whether at the bottom or not.Since this also queries the Terminfo database using , it won't work on Windows either. Whether or not it would work if you hardcode , I don't know (not a Windows person).
