this is my problem:consider a number like 29.8245,given an amount for precision first this number should be rounded,for instance for  it would be 30.Now this number should be center aligned in a string with a given width. for instance if  then the final result would be:For this particular example I came up with:the problem is that now the numbers are hard coded and I don't know how to fix that to get the inputs into my code.I know that :is what we use in normal cases but in this problem I don't know how to combine these two codes(I don't even know is it possible or not).Also is there a better approach  to solve the problem?
This is exactly why format strings support nesting:
Here is another possible solution that doesn't rely on f-strings
Here's one way to do it the will work in "old" versions of Python (before 3.6) and will continue to work in it as well:As you can see, format string syntax supports nesting.Output:The values used for  and  are expressions, so could involve calculations rather than being hardcoded constants as shown.
