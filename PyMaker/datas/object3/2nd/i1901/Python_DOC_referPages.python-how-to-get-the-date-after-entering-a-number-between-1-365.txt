Natural Text
How would you write a Python program that prompts a user for a year, a day of the year (an integer between 1 and either 365 or 366 to account for leap year), and gives the month, day and year?
You can use  to add a number of days to a starting date. Use  to create the starting date with January 1st of the year.
