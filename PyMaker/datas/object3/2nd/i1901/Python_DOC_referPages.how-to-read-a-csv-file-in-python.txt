I need to read a  file (named ) and this is the code I have:But when I try to run it, nothing is output.I am not sure how to continue; this only leads into more advanced tasks I need to complete, which is difficult if I can't even figure this out.
Try this code EDIT As Ralf said " is not necessary when using a with block"
An easier way of reading csv files using pandas library -or you can try modifying your code as below -
You have imported the csv module but never used it.So try .
I suggest you follow the example from the docs of the python  module:Analizing your code, there are a few issues:you don't need to call  if you use a  statement, the file will be closed automatically when exiting the  blockyour print statement should go inside the  block, as the variable  is defined inside ityou would need to iterate  (), because you already used  so that iterating over  will no yield anythingyou are overwriting  each time, so I don't know why you want to it that way
