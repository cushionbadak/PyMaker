Noting that negative ranges and negative list indexing work fine, you can use instead .With Python, you don't need to loop over ranges at all here. Instead, you can use list slicing and  to iterate the values themselves rather than indices:Of course, a manual loop is not required here, you can extend via :If you also need to remove these items from , you can do so via slicing:
With accessing element in list you can do it by slicing
