I have a dictionary with , sayand I am trying to write a key function for heapq.nlargest() that sorts based on count and if there are ties I have to sort based on alphabetical order(a-z) of keys. I have to use heapq.nlargest because of very large N and small k = 10. This is what I got until now, But, this would be incorrect in case of breaking ties with alphabetical order. Please help!
Simplest may be to switch to  and redefine your sort key:Alternatively, you can use  and take the negative for ascending order:Remember to use  if you need to normalize the case of your string.
