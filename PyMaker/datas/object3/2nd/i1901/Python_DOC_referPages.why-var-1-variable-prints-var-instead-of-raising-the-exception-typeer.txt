I was debugging my debug module, and I rely on a try ... catch to detect TypeError and format correctly log my message, then, I noticed that when dictionaries are passed, Python does not raise the traditional exception.This is a minimal example with the logging module:Running it you get:As you can notice, the last  message was lost.As a work around for this problem I come up with the following solution:Which runs correctly: 
I think the observed behaviour is in line with docs.If format requires a single argument, values may be a single non-tuple  object. [5] Otherwise, values must be a tuple with exactly the number  of items specified by the format string, or a single mapping object  (for example, a dictionary).Note [5]:To format only a tuple you should therefore provide a singleton tuple  whose only element is the tuple to be formatted.This explains that a tuple is accepted only if it exactly matches format string requirements. A tuple with one item which itself is not a tuple cannot possibly match any format string and always raise an exception.It also explains that a dict is always accepted as a type, but may produce other errors.And just for the case I'm wrong, there is a catch-all possibility that you have just discovere another "quirk". They warn explicitly:The formatting operations described here exhibit a variety of quirks  that lead to a number of common errors (such as failing to display  tuples and dictionaries correctly). Using the newer formatted string  literals or the str.format() interface helps avoid these errors.
