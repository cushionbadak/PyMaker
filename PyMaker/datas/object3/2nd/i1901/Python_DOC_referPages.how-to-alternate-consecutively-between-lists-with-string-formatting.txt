In Python, is there a good way to interleave two lists of the same length?Say I'm given  and . I'd like to transform those into .
Having posted the question, I've realised that I can simply do the following:where  and  are the two lists.If there are N lists to interleave, thenFor more recipes, follow Best way to interleave a list with its suffix values. Some of the methods demonstrated there can be generalised to two or more lists of equal length. 
For python>=2.3, there's extended slice syntax:The line  is used as a simple way to create a new list of the exactly the right length (at this stage, its contents are not important). The next two lines do the actual work of interleaving  and : the first one assigns the elements of  to all the even-numbered indexes of ; the second one assigns the elements of  to all the odd-numbered indexes of .
GivenCodeAssuming lists of equal length, you can get an interleaved list with  and :AlternativesMore generally with unequal lists, use  (recommended):Many lists can safely be interleaved:+A library that ships with the  itertools recipe,  and .Finally, for something interesting in Python 3 (though not recommended):+Install using 
Alternative:This works because map works on lists in parallel. It works the same under 2.2. By itself, with  as the called functions,  produces a list of tuples:Then just flatten the list of tuples. The advantage, of course, is   will work for any number of lists and will work even if they are different lengths:
I needed a way to do this with lists of different sizes which the accepted answer doesn't address.My solution uses a generator and its usage looks a bit nicer because of it:And its usage:
I like aix's solution best. here is another way I think should work in 2.2:and one more way:and:
As long as you don't have  that you want to keep
