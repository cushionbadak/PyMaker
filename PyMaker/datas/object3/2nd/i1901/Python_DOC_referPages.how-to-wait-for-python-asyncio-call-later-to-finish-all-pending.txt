I want to write a program that utilizes call_later to signal something (or things) to happen later, which themselves might add more routines to be invoked, and then signal to the program to run until there's nothing remaining to be run. For an example, I can do the following:But you'll notice that  is a bespoke coroutine.Is it possible to use the event loop's , but somehow inspect the event loop or otherwise await the completion of all pending callbacks?
You may introspect using asyncio.all_tasks() but it's probably the wrong way to do it.The right way would be to create futures and allow  to mark them as done:Keep in mind  is used for normal functions and not coroutines. If  needs to be a coroutine, you should add  or  into the mix.Adding them does come with more complications -  you'll need to add a few more functions to take 's resulting future, and chain it with your waiter in a similar way to .I highly suggest using your own coroutine in that case, as you have already done.
