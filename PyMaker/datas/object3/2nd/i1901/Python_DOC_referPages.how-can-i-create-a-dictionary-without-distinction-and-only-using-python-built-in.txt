I have two lists. Both of sizes are 1013x1. They look like below;I am trying to create dictionary with them. l1 should be key and l2 should be value. The code is here:and d looks likeWhy is size of d 20? As I understand it is distinct with l1. How can I create a dictionary without distinction only using python built-in funtions?
Each key can only appear once in a dictionary, but you can have a list as the value:
Your dictionary is of size 20 because you have duplicate keys in . Onle the last given  of each  "lives" the others are overwritten. You can append all  to a , if you store a  instead only the  stored by that .As alternative to a plain dict you can leverage the  from the  module:Output:This is only feasable if you consider imports of basic modules as "python built-in functions".
