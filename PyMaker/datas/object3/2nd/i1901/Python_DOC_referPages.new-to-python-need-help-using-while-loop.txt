The assignment:Write an interactive application in Python to display asimple menu to the user. Have them pick a choice for a boy (b), girl (g), or quit (q) to quitthe program. The program should keep looping until the user chooses to quit. This application will use loops and conditions to accomplish the task.Your program should output the average boy score and average girl score. The code:Not sure what to do being new to python. I understand what I need to do and the error messages I get but implementing it in python is where I am getting stuck.The errors I have gotten: after inputting a value for b and trying to input another for b i get an error saying scoreG isnt defined
Actually, the biggest problem was the indentation.This should work:
This is indeed an indentation problem (or a logic flow problem). For most programming languages that wouldn't matter, but it is essential in python.Here's what your code is actually doing:Here's what your code should be doing:Unlike most other programming languages, python requires indentation to define the scope of a compound block of statements. I sometimes use a do-nothing  statement with a comment to show my intention:The  statement is just a placeholder that does nothing, but it helps me make the intended control flow clearer, and that can help me detect design errors.Another diagnostic tool you can use is the print() statement.When you test the program with those print statements included, you will be able to confirm that each command does what you expect. After you've verified the logic works, you can just put a  in front of the print statement to turn it into a comment.Just for completeness, the official python tutorial mentionsThe body of the loop is indented: indentation is Pythonâ€™s way of  grouping statements
