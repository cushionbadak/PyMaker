I've got an image database with a set of images named [frame01.png, frame02.png, ..., frameN.png].My directory path is ./img, and iteratively I'd like to read one by one, do some image processing until reaching the last one. Since I'm not familiar with strings concatenation in python, what's the easiest way to do it?
should give you a list of all you files.To read them you can have:Then inside :Alternatively, you could have:If you are just looking for a quick way to create the list with this particular names:If your last image is 20 then replace MAX_NUM with 20 + 1 applies for any other number x, x + 1. How/what you use to read the files depends on you. You can use  as in the examples or whatever works for you.
