How do you run the command line in order to read and write a csv file in python on a MacBook?
I would suggest using pandas:https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.htmlhttps://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.to_csv.html
You can find everything about reading and writing with csv files in Python here: CSV File Reading and Writing - Python 3 Documentation.First, we need to import CSV: Basically, if you want to read a CSV file, first open one up. In the Python Shell (the command line for Python), opening a file in order to read it and storing it in the variable  would look like this:After that, we need to treat the file. Reading the rows from a csv file works as follows:now we want to print the every row of the csv file. We just add the following code:If you want to write to a file, it is a bit different:First, we open the file (1) and specify that we want it to write to it (by adding the parameter ). Then, we define a writer (2) that we will use to write to the CSV file. At last, we use the writer (3) and add a row to our file with the  method. Notice that we used a list (). Each element of that list will be converted to a row into the CSV file. Knowing that the list hast 3 elements, we will add 3 rows into the CSV file with the contents ,  and . I hope this answers you question as fully as possible. The code I suggested is writeable into the Python Shell, without executing a separate file.
