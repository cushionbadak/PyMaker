I am trying to write a stochastic program in Python to replicate a fair dice (one dice) roll, such that this one dice is rolled 100 times. I intend to display the output of the dice rolls as a histogram.I thought histograms had a specific n shape but this is what I have been getting with the code I used below.myweirdhistogramAlso, is there an easier way to plot a histogram in python when you have, e.g ages as [10,3,5,1] and the frequency in a table as [2,3,4,4]? Do I have to type out the entire frequency of the ages in a list like this: age = [10,10,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,1,1,1,1] before I write the program? please see what I mean in the code below:So far, its easier to plot a histogram with random numbers but not a table for me. Here is my second weird output:mysecondweirdhistogram
Use zip to pair each age with it's frequency; then use the frequency to add that many to a new container. is a generator expression which will produce  's when iterated. The  method consumes (iterates over) the generator expression.  We typically use  for values that we aren't going to use.
