Let's say you are in the python interactive shell and you type the first two lines:As you can see the result was printed without using a print function.Now if we save the executed code inside a file named :The question is whether is it possible to load/execute the file inside the python shell that results in printing the result?Update: what I really want to do is executing lines of code that were saved in a file and make python shell treat it as if they were typed inside it. In other words, what I require is to write a few lines of code in a file instead of entering it manually inside the repl and have them both result in an equal output. Node.js repl has this feature: More Clarifying Update: Expected Behavior**Question**: Does python have that ?
You can run the python file inside the python shell. Like this,Where  will be like this.If we removed the  in the  while executing from the shell it won't print anything.If  like this.Result in the shell will be like this.NB:  is in .
Thanks for clarification, I've edited my answer based on your update. Also I'm not sure, about what you need to print as your python file can have n no. of variables and methods. The best possible way is to execute your python file and save your file's executed objects in a dictionary which can be used as below:-test.py :-actual python script :-Now to print the value of the method return_out you can use:-Or to get the variable a:-This will work for both python versions python2 and python3
If you are willing to sacrifice the stdout to output without using print statement, i believe you could use python -i tempcode.pyyou can use -i command-line parameter while execution, this should execute your code and at the end give you control without having to rewrite the whole file in your REPL. You will be able to access all the variable and other content of your file as usual.You can find more info in python doc here
