Natural Text
I have a python (3.7.0) script file which takes more than 17,000 text files and then processes each file line by line to fill the required data into a pandas data frame. So the code is like following is the Script1.py file:Now the above python script upon runs over 17,000 files to make the pandas dataframe X which needs to be computed only once to get data (and computation is quite expensive). I need to use this dataframe in another script file (say) Script2.py to make a Machine Learning model and so to test my model, I would need to access X, again and again, i.e. I would need to run the Script2.py again and again.Can anyone suggest anything? I would be very thankful to you.
You could use the builtin pickle module:In :In :You could also load the built in to_pickle methods on dataframes:In :In :
