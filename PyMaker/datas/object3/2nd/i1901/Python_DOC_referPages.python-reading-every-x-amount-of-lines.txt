Natural Text
What I want is to have 5 threads reading the contents of a file, line by line.The first thread must read the line, and I want the threads to read every 5 lines starting at different points.And so on.Currently I've tried to use modulus to do it, however there are issues where prime numbers such as 15 cause issues. This isn't the final piece I had, however it's what I'm showing as what I'm using is awful and doens't make sense.Long story short, I need some help and I'll be incredibly thankful to the person that helps me sort out this issue.Just looking for something to iterate over the lines of a text file.
Here's an example of what I was suggesting. This process stdin,sending lines to a collection of five workers.  The first worker willget lines 0, 5, 10, 15, etc., the second worker will get 1, 6, 11, 16,etc, and so forth.
