I'm trying to make a game in Python using pygame, but I accidentally had disabled the error checking in PyCharm. As a result, this is how I tried to initialize a :After I re-enabled the error checking, PyCharm gave me an error message, telling me to use  instead. After I did, the error message disappeared and the code worked.Now for the actual question: While the error messages were disabled, I wrote a lot of bad code like the example above. Strange enough, the code actually ran fine. The game could init and run properly, even while half the code had errors.Could someone explain to me why the example above works, yet why it is considered bad?Full code:
The problem here is that PyCharm doesn't know what the real signature of the  method should be, because the file is distributed as a .pyd file (like a .dll). You can verify this by using the "Go to... Declaration" (Ctrl+B) function in pycharm on  in your code, and then on  in pyame's  until you reach the code of .  Here you'll see a declaration like this:Observe also the note at the top of this  file:PyCharm is doing its best to try and generate something that looks like the actual code, but it is just a guess.In short, you are right and pycharm is wrong in this case.The exact same type of problem is described here:Why do some built-in Python functions only have pass?
