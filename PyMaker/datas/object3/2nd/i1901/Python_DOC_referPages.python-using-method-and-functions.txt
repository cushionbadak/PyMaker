I want to write a script that is able to read a structure from a AutoDesk Inventor Model. Inventor is installed and running and a connection to it through win32.com is established.After loading the model an setting a few variables I'm stuck.I have this listoStructuredBOMView.BOMRowsI can reference one itemAnd with a dir I can display all functions/methodsThis ist the point I can't exceed. How can I use this functions/methods to extract more information? Example:
First, sizeof is no valid python function so your second try won't work.Second, your attribute of the BOMRows Item object is named , so you have to use that and not just 'sizeof':Third, those are just attributes of the object, they may or may not be functions/methods, you can find out which are callable with:See https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#callableUpdate: You can try to  all the attributes (this is kind of obvious, so you maybe already tried that). As I don't know anything about AutoDesk Inventor models, I can't help you with a direct response, but you could try to dig deeper into the object. If the attribute is a 'primitive type' (read: printable object or object that has some string representation) you can use it directly. If your attribute returns another object, then you have to analyze it again with  or  again. You can ignore most of the double underscore attributes, as they are most likely from python.Example of trying to print all attributes of an unknown object:But I am sure there should be some documentation available how to use the Autodesk Inventor objects.
The inventor object browser is your best friend to see the properties and methods of each class in inventor. To open it go to the VBA editor and press F2.This tells you that the class is BOMRow. Type the class name into the search field and go from there.
