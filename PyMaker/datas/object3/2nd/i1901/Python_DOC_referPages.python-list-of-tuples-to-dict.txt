This question already has an answer here:Nested defaultdict of defaultdict                    4 answers                There is a python listI need to convert it into python dict with the following structureAre there any efficient ways to convert?
I'd do this with a  that produces  instances as default values.DemoTo match your desired output exactly (although I don't see much reason), build a regular dictionary from  with  values.ExplanationThe  initializer accepts a callable (in this example an anonymous  function is used). Whenever a key is missing, that callable is called and the return value is used as a fallback-value.The lineis creating a  which creates another  when a key is missing. The second defaultdict creates a  when a key is missing.
Sure. Use :Result:
No need for any special things, simple dictionary methods work:Output:Although more experienced ppl suggest not using this, because its slower. So it is better to work with the defaultdict-approach provided by the other answers.
