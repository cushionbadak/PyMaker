I am writing a Python script to scrape the top 100 games from metacritic.com. I used the bs4 findAll() to create a ResultSet for the list of elements with {"class":"product_row game"}.When I checked len(prods) it returned "98". Upon inspection I noticed that the first and last elements on the list have {"class":"product_row game first"}  and {"class":"product_row game last"} respectively. My plan was to create 3 separate ResultSet's and combine them, but I cannot find the resources online to do this. Is it feasible/smart to do it this was? If so, a pointer would be appreciated. If not, how should I change my approach?Thanks in advance,Gavin :)
You can combine them all into one ResultSet by adding one line:  If you run , it now has all 100 items

You do not mention why you want to combine the three. But if you want to iterate through all the elements, you could use :Note that  returns a  object, while  returns a  object that can be iterated over to yield  objects. Since  expects all arguments to be iterables, I create a list of  objects using / in the code example above.
If what you are after is simply "get all divs that has class product_row and class game", then using a CSS selector is likely the best approach:Documentation links:https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#searching-by-css-classhttps://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#css-selectors
