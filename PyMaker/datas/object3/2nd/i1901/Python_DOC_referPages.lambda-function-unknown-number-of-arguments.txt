Currently, this is how I resolve a "and" function using lambda with two arguments:But how can I resolve an unknown number of arguments, like:Anybody had this issue before?Thanks and Greetings!
You can use "*args":Which indeed is the same as just using "all":To be general, you can use "functools.reduce" to use any "2-parameters" function with any number of parameters (if their order doesn't matter):(same results as before)
You can use argument unpacking via the  operator to process any number of arguments. You would have to resort to  (Python2) or  (Python3) in order to combine them all with  in a single expression (as needed by the lambda):Note: this is not the same as , like many here suggest:
Why not just using the all function?
First, use  to store an unknown number of arguments as a tuple. Second,  only return  or  but  operation may return value (Here is why). So we need to use .Here is the solution:Test 1: arguments are Ture or FalseTest 2: arguments are valuesTest 3: arguments are a combination of bool and valuesNote the three tests are correct according to the definition of Logical AND (and):Return the first Falsey value if there are any, else return the last  value in the expression.
