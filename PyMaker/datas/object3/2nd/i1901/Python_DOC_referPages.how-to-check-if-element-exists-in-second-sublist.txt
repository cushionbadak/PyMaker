If I had a list like this:I know that I could check if e.g.  was contained in any of the sub lists by using  in the following way:But how would I go about searching through second sub lists, i.e. if the list was initialized the following way:I tried chaining the  expressions like this:However, this crashes because .
First write your logic as a regular  loop:Then rewrite as a generator expression with the  statements in the same order:
You can use  twice, like this:
If you don't need to know where 'f' is located you can leverage  here as well.This will flatten your nested lists and evaluate each list separately.  The benefit here is if you have three nested lists this solution would still function without having to continue writing nest  loops.
