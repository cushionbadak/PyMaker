I have a list of names within a file.Each time my program turns to one name from the list, and extracts data.The problem is that sometimes some of the name(s) are not available (temporarily and randomaly). A name that was unavailable yesterday, will be available today. but, another name that was available yesterday, will not be available today).As soon as the program reach unavailable name then the program gets stuck.What can you do for the program to skip a name(s) that is not available at this moment? so that the program always work and not get stuck.Hope i am clear... :)my list:Name_1Name_2Name_3Name_4Name_5my program:
use a  /  statement with the error you get as an exception.EDIT: I don't know what '''Do something''' is. Apparently it gives an  if the  does not exist. It is good practice to look exactly which statement cause this error and put this exception in the  block. See also this post: Why is "except: pass" a bad programming practice?For general information about a  block see: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html
