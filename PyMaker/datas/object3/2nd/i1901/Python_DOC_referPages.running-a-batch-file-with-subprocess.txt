I'd like to execute a simple batch file using Python. But I'm getting some error back from the process saying the file, directory or disc name is not right. I guess the best way to start is to show the code:I extended this with appending to system path and changing the working directory:The batch file contains just a few echo commands for debugging. So I'd expect the code above to print the contents of the echoes. I've verified that I'm able to call it inside a command prompt from any folder. Previously I was getting some file permission error (), so that might be related especially as the file is in Program Files. This error was not from the process, but Python itself.I also tried it with an executable, and a similar error was raised: . Any idea where I'm stumbling?AttemptsWhen the  keyword is removed, the  is backWhen  is called with  and the batch file is run with , no errors are thrown, and the output contains the echoes. However batch files should run without explicitly opening a command prompt, I presume.
Use a command-line string instead of an args list when passing  or when running a batch script with the default . On Windows,  processes an args list into a command line that's compatible with VC++ argument parsing. But cmd.exe don't use VC++ argument parsing rules, and even for an executable that does use VC++ rules (e.g. python.exe), the extra quotes you're adding (i.e. ) get backslash-escaped as literal quotation marks in the command line.
