Natural Text
I am trying to create an E (mathematical constant) approximation script. But it only gives me 15 decimals places. I then added a  which increased the number of decimal places but was still limited to 50 decimal places. Is there any way to print all decimals. (If not, what's the limit?)Here's my code:
Casting your floating point result to  is, of course, not enough.  You have to perform all of the computations using  objects and, if you need a large precision, you have to tell  about that
Try  from numpy. They offer more precision
