Natural Text
So the code I'm writing is intended to replace all the vowels with alternate letters, and then return "Error" if any character in a particular string is a non letter. I got the first part to work but how do I check for a non letter?
As Paul suggests, use  to check if a string contains only letters:Using  in this way will raise an error if the name contains a non alphabet character.Your vowel conversion can be simplified: Use  to convert the character to an integerIncrement this by oneUse  to build a character back from the integer
