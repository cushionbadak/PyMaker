I would like to install some Python module, namely the MATLAB Engine. MATLAB is installed globally under , so I change to the  corresponding directory and then run  as explained in the linked documentation. However, I am not root, so I added the  flag, as documented by the official Python Docs.So this is what I get:Apparently it tries to build the module in the current directory, where I have no write access. I can sidestep this by runningBut then I don't know how to install that. Also I cannot combine those 2 approaches as  does not recognize the  option.I furthermore tried to copy the whole  directory somewhere else and run  there, but this yieldsI guess it does not find the  anymore.So how do I build and install some source located somewhere under  without being root?
You can use Virtualenv or venv to deal with this kind of issues. Edit: As we went a bit deeper into issue itself, we managed to figure out the answer. If you wish to use virtual environment: If you wish to accomplish what @Feodoran asked for:  Useful links: https://de.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/install-matlab-engine-api-for-python-in-nondefault-locations.htmlhttps://python.org/3.2/install
