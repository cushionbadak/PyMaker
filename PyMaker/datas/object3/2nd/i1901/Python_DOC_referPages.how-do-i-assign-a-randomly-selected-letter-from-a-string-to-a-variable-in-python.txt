Natural Text
First, I would like to say I am new to coding and python in general. I just learned about importing and the random function.Anyways, I am trying to create a text game, in python, where a letter is chosen randomly from some string/word and the user has to try and guess which letter was chosen. I think I understand how to do for loops well enough so that it continues until the correct letter is chosen, but I have no idea how to even go about randomly choosing the letter. I would just like some help getting started. Thank you. 
Since strings are sequences in Python, you can use  to pick a random element from a list - in your case, a random letter in a string.The 's are from the REPL console (running Python by itself) and shouldn't be included if you include the code in a python file.
There is a library for randomizing things. Simply use it like this:and you get your random letter from a sequence in that case which is saved in .
Since you are relatively new to programming, I'd like to give you an informative example of the game to clarify some concepts.String  is implemented as sequence in Python (you can think that a string is an array of chars). So it supports indexing  shows .The standard library  includes a bench of functions to carry out randomized operations. As mentioned in the other answers that the function  randomly pick an element from a sequence. So it can be used to randomly pick a character from a string.You mentioned loops and you seem to be able to master them. So I hereby use another approach called recursion to continue the game until the desired answer is found.The game is written in an Object-Oriented manner. If you gonna be a developer latter in your career, it's good practice to see this.Here is the Code:Some test runs:
