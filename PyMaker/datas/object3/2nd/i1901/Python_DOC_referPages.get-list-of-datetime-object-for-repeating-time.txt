The problem:I have this list of specific time, for example:Now I am trying to create a function that would output a list of n number of datetime objects like this:My progress:So I tackled this issue with this solution:Though I got stuck in creating this function  which should calculate the next datetime object.Also if anyone has any other alternative solution that is better than mine, please share it with me.Edit 1 (just for clarification)Input: Function: Output: Note: the output is dependent on the current . In the example above, the current time was 
You'd want to create  objects, then make the sequence cyclic with  and combine these with  objects:The above uses  as a sentinel to detect that a the date value needs to be incremented a step, and the time strings are accepted as separate arguments, and you can pass in a different reference date (the default is to use now).It's also an endless a generator, so you can iterate over it step by step, or use  to limit the number of results.Personally, I'd alter make the function accept  objects rather than pass in strings, so you just sort the arguments without having to parse and go from there.Demo:
another solution is to create date time objects till it reaches the how_many. Then sort it and return the first how_many items.Sample code isOutput is
