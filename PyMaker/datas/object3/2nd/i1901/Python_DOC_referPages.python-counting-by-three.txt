How can I make python begin at a single multiple of three and then count from there? I'm not sure where to go after the elif statement.Here's my code so far...
Although you generally just see it being used with the stop parameter alone, the  function actually has start, stop, and step parameters. e.g.So just gather the starting value, and calculate the stop parameter from the start value and the number of multiples desired, and fix the step parameter at three.
