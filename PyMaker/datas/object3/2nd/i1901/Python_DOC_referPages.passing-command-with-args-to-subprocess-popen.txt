Following script works fine when I try passing a batch file (that doesn't require any arguments) to the function.However, when I try passing below command to the function, it fails.Output:Below command used to work fine when I didn't create a function.As you can notice from the output of  command, I was successfully able to somehow (by using the messy single and double quotes combination) pass the exact command that I was able to run when this function was not created but it seems it sill needs some work for  variable to expand.Any idea how I can fix this?

You're passing a  for command. Note that your working example has a . You just need to get rid of all the extra quoting and pass a list.
