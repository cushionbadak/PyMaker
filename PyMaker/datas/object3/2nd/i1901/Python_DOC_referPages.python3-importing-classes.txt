I'm just starting to learn python and I thought a good way to practice would be by building a custom linked list class. I was able to get my custom list to work properly when everything was in one file. However, I wanted to practice importing, so I split my code into three files: ListNode.py, mySLL.py, testMySll.py. All of these files are under the same directory "codingPractice". I'm trying to import listNode.py into mySLL.py and mySLL.py into testMySll.py. How would I do this?
Importing modules in Python is pretty straight forward. For a thorough explanation see this guide on modules. However, to give you a quickstart using the examples you provided, you can import modules like this:The same workflow goes for importing mySSL.py into the testMySll.py file. Keep in mind that imported modules act like objects so you call the functions using  and any variables that are global in the module can be called using .
