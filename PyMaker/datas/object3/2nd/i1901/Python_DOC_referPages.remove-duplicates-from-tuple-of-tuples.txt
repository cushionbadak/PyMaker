Consider in input_tuple first place digits are key and we need to check duplicate on [3] index, but please skip first two chars. below are two scenarios we need to look:-1) self duplicate check: now if there is any duplicate being found on the 3rd index we need to remove that row2) across duplicate: once we checked self duplicate then we need to check across duplicate and if anything found we need to replace with first occurrence3) across duplicate in pair: in this scenario I want to check across duplicate, but check should happen only if there is pair duplicate across. i have edited in input_tuple in last: eg:since its duplicate with below:hence, it should also be eliminated.Code which i tried:(its working fine in 1st scenario)
No need to reinvent the wheel to drop duplicates. The  docs has a  recipe, also available in 3rd party libraries via  or . The second part is a bit messy, but you can use a custom function to define your splits and then use a tuple comprehension.
