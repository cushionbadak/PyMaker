I'm using Pyodbc in Python to run some SQL queries. What I'm working with is actually longer than this, but this example captures what I'm trying to do:In the above, since there are only two , I'm passing  to  twice. However, in the more complicated version I'm working with, I have 19 , so I'd imagine this means I need to pass ' to  19 times. I tried passing this as a list, but it didn't work. Do I really need to write out the variable 19 times when passing it to the function? 
I agree with the comments, pandas.read_sql has a params argument which prevent from sql injection.See this post to understand how to use it depending on the database.Pyodbc has the same parameter on the execute method. To answer to the initial question, even if it is bad practice for building SQL queries : Do I really need to write out the variable 19 times when passing it to the function? Of course you don't :   or : Python 3.6+ : Note the usage of f before """ ... """
Consider using a  query to avoid the temp table needs and parameterization where you set qmark placeholders and in a subsequent step bind values to them. And being the same value multiply the parameter list/tuple by needed number:
