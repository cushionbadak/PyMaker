Natural Text
So my text file says something like this:What I want to do is replace the variables in this file (, ,  etc..) with the appropriate data for each person.Can I do this? Store variables in a text file and access them? Or is there a better way of doing this?Edit:An attempt using @Guilio's example.I get the following error: AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'split'
Create a "template", then fill in the placeholders  using the values stored in a dictionary.For each row of your CSV file,  is going to be something like .P.S.: you can also do something like this with the $placeholders by some method included in the  module, but I think that's kind of osbolete. By the way, using multiline strings (with three quotes) you don't need to explicitly include newlines (unless you use "raw strings" like ) just leave a blank line.EDITAssuming you have 4 scores called score1,score2,score3,score4 then (cfr. https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#index-3) for each row do this.The  part takes care of a trailing  if any.
