I am trying to encode datetime format for strings that are of the form: '06JAN2018' or '31DEC2017'.I think this is format = '%d[xxxx]%Y' but I don't know how to encode the month portion of it.Is there a list anywhere of every type of encoding possible for this?
The list of these codes is in the  module's strftime() and strptime() Behavior documentation.: Month as localeâ€™s abbreviated name.In your case,  is .If what you're actually looking to do is to encode a datetime object or Pandas/NumPy datetime array to strings, you'll probably need to do the uppercasing yourself:
