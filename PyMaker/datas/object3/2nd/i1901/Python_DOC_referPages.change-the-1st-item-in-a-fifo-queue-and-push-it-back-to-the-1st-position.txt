Is it possible to change the 1st item in a FIFO queue and push it back to the 1st position? I can't seem to find any relevant resources. The following is what I have achieved so far, but it pushes to the last item. Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks!
Why you're doing this at all?Is this a  object?If so, you have access to underlying  attribute, which is deque itself. And it does support  method.Despite, I highly recommend not doing so, this violates FIFO interface, and it made this way for a reason. If it doesn't suit your needs, look for something that does.  operates with put/pop for a reason, there's a lot of logic on top of simple 
You're looking for something analogous to ungetc; this is not a standard operation of a queue, as it violates FIFO (first in first out). Thus it's not an operation Python's queue module provides, either. But there is a container type perfectly suited to the task: collections.deque. This has both append and appendleft operations. So you can use it with put=appendleft, get=pop, unget=append.
