Given string "lion" is should get the following output of substrings,["ion", "lin", "in", "io", "li", "on", "lion"]This is what i have so far,my current output is ['lion', 'ion', 'on', 'io', 'lio', 'io', 'li']I'm missing substrings "lin" and "in" and I shouldn't have "lio".I haven't been able to figure it if I need a different method or if I need additional statements?
You can use  on each length of a possible substring:By the way, in your example, I think you miss some valid options.Every output in my function is a substring of .
There's a one-liner for this that doesn't require . Depending on what you're used to, it may be more or less legible.Note that the  cast is only for printing; without it, Python will give you a generator, which is much more efficient if you're iterating over it.For substrings of length 2 or greater:
Here is a solution that doesn't involve using any special libraries.Basic idea:Look at the first char of your string. A possible sub-string can either contain it or miss it.
