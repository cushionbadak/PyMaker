I'm new to python so please excuse the layman description.Question : Given a sentence, return a sentence with the words reversedMy Solution:Output:the code works the way it is supposed to but my question is, why can't i make a function call directly from the returned result of the previous function. i,ewhy can i not do something likereturn ' '.join(text.split().reverse())this would work just fine in java since i get List object from text.split() to which, i would operate on with the reverse() function which would return me the inverted list which would then be used by the join() to make this list into a string.This, is also something that i have tried:text.split() returns a List, and applying .reverse() function on it SHOULD return the elements of the same list in reverse order, but when i execute this line,, i get  
Because  returns None, and updates the list, so so None is not valid for .Yeah so  is  function so no way to fix that.So Use :Or :From docs:You might have noticed that methods like insert, remove or sort that only modify the list have no return value printed â€“ they return the default None. [1] This is a design principle for all mutable data structures in Python.After code example.https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html
which would return me the inverted list ..Here's the problem. In Python, calling  doesn't return the reversed list. It just reverses it in place.What you need is:
Instead of using  You can use python list iterator to reverse:
