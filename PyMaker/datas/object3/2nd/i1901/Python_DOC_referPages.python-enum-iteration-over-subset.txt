I would like to iterate over a subset of the following enumSay I want to:is there a shortcut? or do I need to list each item to iterate over?
Using  you can iterate through a slice of your  class 
Python enums can have methods. I'd suggest you write a method that returns an iterable. Probably a set, in this case:Then:
There is nothing built-in to  to iterate over a subset, but since you can use  on them:
do I need to list each item to iterate over?No -  classes are iterables, each value has attributes  and , so you can filter on either as you see fit. For example:is there a shortcut? Depends on what you want to do. Here are a few ways you could use the fact that Enums are iterables: => get the first 4 elements as sorted by their ordinal value => get all items with an ordinal value < 5 => get a dictionary of all name/value pairs given a filteretc.NoteAccording to the documentation you can get the Enums ordered dictionary by  and thus you could use  on that to get the key/value mappings. However what you get as the value (in the dictionary) is in fact an object instance that has the  and  attributes.However I find the first method more intuitive.
