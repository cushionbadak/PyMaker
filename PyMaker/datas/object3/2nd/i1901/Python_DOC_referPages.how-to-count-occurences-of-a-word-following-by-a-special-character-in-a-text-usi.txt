Natural Text
I want to count the number of occurrences of the word 'people' in a text using python. For that I use Counter and Python's regular expression:Yet, here my code does not take into account of the occurrences of people. people! people? How can I modify it to also count the cases when the word is followed by a specific character?Thank you for you help,
You can use an optional character-group in your regex:The ? specifies it can occure 0 or 1 times - the  specifies what characters are allowed. There is no need to escape the  (or f.e. ) inside  although they have special meaning for regex. If you wanted to use a  inside  you would need to escape it as it is used to denote ranges in sets  == .See: https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax[] Used to indicate a set of characters. In a set:Characters can be listed individually, e.g. [amk] will match 'a', 'm', or 'k'.  Ranges of characters can be indicated by giving two characters and separating them by a '-', for example [a-z] will match any lowercase ASCII letter, [0-5][0-9] will match all the two-digits numbers from 00 to 59, and [0-9A-Fa-f] will match any hexadecimal digit.  [...]
This will allow you to only match with people? people. and/or people!So if you add a few more  you will be able to do something like thisYou need to use the  to escape the special charactersAlso this is a good resource when you are experimenting with python regular expressions: https://pythex.org/ The site also has a regular expression cheat sheet
You can use a modifier statement at the end of the 'people' part of your Regex pattern. Try the following:The ? is for zero or more quantifier. The above pattern seems to work on regex101.com but I haven't tried in out in a Python shell yet.
Does it have to use regex? Why not just:
