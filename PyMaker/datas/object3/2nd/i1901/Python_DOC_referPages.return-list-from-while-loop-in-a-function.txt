I'm trying to return a list  created within function  to use in the function . I keep getting the error my_list is not definedfor when I ask to print it, after calling "make_list". What am I doing incorrectly in trying to return "my_list"?
You are trying to access the local variable . You have to use the returned value instead by assigning it to a variable:On a side note, you probably want to slightly modify :The  unpacks the list and passes its elements to the  function. Otherwise, when passing a single positional argument to , the  parameter will never be used.
You need to assign the return of your function to a variable:The variable  is destroyed when you leave the scope of your function that defined it. That is why you return it.See Short Description of the Scoping Rules? and PyTut: Scopes and namespaces
