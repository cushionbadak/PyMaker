Is there a better way for looping over every combination of multiple lists in Python? For example...I ask because I would like to break out of both loops once a value is found. I do not want to use a bool flag to break out of the top level loop. All answers I have seen so far say to use zip, but that is not the same thing. zip would produce the following.If you use map, you get the following, which is also not what I am looking for.
You can use  like so: returns a generator with all of the possible permutations of the 2 lists. Then, you simply iterate over those, and search until you find the value you want.
Have you tried using a list comprehension
If you don't want to use  as suggested in another answer, you can wrap it in a function and return:Output:
If you need to know where you were in the scan when the break condition arose, you can use  list comprehensions and  together
You can use the  function.You can read more in hereRoughly equivalent to nested for-loops in a generator expression
You might like to see  used in a simple code.In this case  is an iterator that returns elements of the cross-product of  and  one at a time.Within the -loop we watch for the appearance of a certain pair, and  out of the loop if and when we encounter it.--
