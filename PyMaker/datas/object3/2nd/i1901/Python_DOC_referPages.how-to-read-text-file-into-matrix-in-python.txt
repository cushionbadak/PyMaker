Natural Text
I'm newbie in Python.I have a text file like following:I want to import this text file as a matrix in Python.I can find examples similar to this, but they don't have quotation marks for each value so it doesn't work directly for this case. How I can read only numerical values from text and save it as a matrix?Thanks

Note, these are not the usual quotation marks around a string declaration, but actual text. We iterate through the values and remove them, then convert the remaining string to integer. We then append each row to a matrix:output:
