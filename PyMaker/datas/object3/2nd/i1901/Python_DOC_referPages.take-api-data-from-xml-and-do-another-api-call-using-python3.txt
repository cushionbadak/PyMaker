Natural Text
I've got XML API data from which I need to take a value and run another API call from it.There's about 100 clients in this file and what I need is to be able to take the ClientID value for each one and run it through another API call (I'm assuming I can set it as a variable?)How would I go about taking the multiple client IDs and running them through api calls to get more data? 
You could use  to extract the data and then feed that into a list to make your second API call. This post might help:Extracting text from XML using python
