I'm trying to set the user agent for my urllib request:and finally:What would be the best way to set the user-agent header to
With  we have two options, as far as I know.   returns a  object, which has an  attribute. We can change the user-agent and other headers with that attribute.Alternatively, we can install the OpenerDirector object to the global opener with  and use  to submit the request. Now can use  to set the headers.  Personally, I prefer the second method because it is more consistent. Once we install the opener all requests will have the same handlers, and we can continue using urllib the same way. However, if you don't want to use those handlers for all requests you should choose the first method and use  to set headers for a specific OpenerDirector object.  With  things are simpler.  We can use the  attribute if we want to change the user-agent or other headers for all requests,  or use the  parameter if we want to set headers for a specific request only.
