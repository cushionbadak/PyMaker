Natural Text
I have xml fileI need to find all country tags check the text with the current position of my list of countries if they are not the same we replace the country name by the right name from my list. It should also create a log.txt file (this part is ok). For example, some names are not in order (Panama's neighbors are not Austri and Switzerland) so they need to be replaced and this is a long xml so I want to write a script that will do it automatically. I know I can replace text on xml file this way.However when I pass a list (righ_data[] and child.text) as arguments it does not like it and it gives me the error described above. 
I stopped using find() method. See below for how I solved the problem. Key and val are my dictionary. customDict = {'Soap':'Dial', 'Shampoo': 'H&S'}This will find the tag, check that it is the right tag and modify it accordingly.
