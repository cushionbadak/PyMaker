I am trying to build a winzip file cracker without a dictionary attack (For an essay on password security). It needs to scroll through the "combos" iteration trying each combination until the passwords is found. So close to being done but currently it needs the password entry as a single string which is required to be converted to bytes whereas I need it to try each output of the combostotalThank you in advance for any helpI have saved it in a sandbox https://onlinegdb.com/ryRYih2imLink to the file is here https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rpkJnImBJdg_aoiVpX4x5PP0dpEum2fSClick for screenshot
