I'm trying to code a little script that checks whether a file passed as a command line parameter is well or badly parenthesized.I've created an exception to handle the functions stop point but can not seem to raise it properly.When I test the code in a Python interpreter, it seems to work (ie it recognizes it should the raise the exception, but when I test my file with the sample files I have (that are badly parenthesized), it still prints out that it was successfully checked Do you have any ideas ?Best,Code :
You are iterating over the given file name, not the created filehandle. File names probably have no unbalanced brackets in them, hence no exception.You should switch toto make sure to close the file even if you get exceptions thrown - its the prefered way of file handling, see docs.python.org - reading and writing filesI am unable to test this (no stack module - if needed I use lists for that), but this should be faster:
