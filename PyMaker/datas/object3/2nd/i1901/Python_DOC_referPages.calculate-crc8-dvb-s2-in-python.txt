I need to calculate the crc8 dvb s2 checksum in python but I can't find any useful information on how this checksum really works, so I tried to convert this working C code:in python code:But there is something wrong with it that I can't seem to understand.If I give the C function the bytes '\x00d\x00\x00\x00' it gives my as a result '\x8f' ( which is right), while the Python function gives me the OverflowError: int too big to convert.There's clearly something wrong with my code that makes the numbers bigger and bigger but I wasn't able to figure out what exactly.Full backtrace: 
The documentation of  says:An  is raised if the integer is not representable with  the given number of bytes.It seems as if the number on which you use  is larger than 255 (the highest number representable by one byte).This:can only work if  is between 0 and 255, and I don't understand what would be the point of converting the same value from integer to bytes and back.Do you intend to calculate the lowest 8 bits of the binary representation of ? Then you should use .You should be able to translate this C function almost literally to Python, without the need for helper functions like  or :
