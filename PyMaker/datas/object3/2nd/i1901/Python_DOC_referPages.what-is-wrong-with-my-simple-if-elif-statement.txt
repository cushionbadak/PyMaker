This script takes whatever is inputted and formats it into a  type format.It works with the first two  statements, but when moving onto the third it still assigns the  infront of the numbers. It's supposed to jump to  and  as you see below.Your help is greatly appreciated.
The problem is where you're trying to chain comparisons:This checks to see if  and . Since  is always true, this block will catch anything where . What I assume you mean to do is:This will only catch the cases where  is between 53 and 100 (inclusive). You'll need to make similar changes to the rest of the  blocks.
Your error is here:This translates to (you can read about chained comparisson operators):and will allways be  because of the second part; so thats why the later  never get reached.My suggestion:
You got your if-conditionals mixed up. Fix:Output:You got some missing port ranges, 50 f.e. is not covered and would result in ValueError.
