I would like to retrieve the data inside a compressed gz file stored on an FTP server, without writing the file to the local archive.At the moment I have doneThis, however, writes the file "localfile" on the current storage.I tried to change this inbut,  does not output the output of its callback.Is there a way to do this?
A simple implementation is to:download the file to an in-memory file-like object, like ;pass that to  parameter of  constructor.The above loads whole .gz file to a memory. What can be inefficient for large files. A smarter implementation would stream the data instead. But that would probably require implementing a smart custom file-like object.See also Get files names inside a zip file on FTP server without downloading whole archive.
