I'm trying to read a dataset and set the integer value of the JSON file as the array of the list. This is the example JSON file, Right now, I have just tried with reading the JSON file and putting everything to a defaultdict(list), this messes things up. Assume I read everything to L1If I try to get L1[1234] this would give an error as 1234 is not a valid index in the L1 and the indexes are 0,1. If L1 was printed, I understand that the list has my potential value for the index as a value stored and in unicode (makes it worse). So how to turn L1 into or a method so if I try to pull up L1[1234] it would pull up the 'hello world', Thank youEdited: Changed the JSON.
Assuming you have a list of dicts you could do something like this:OutputThe above dictionary comprehension is equivalent to the following nested loops:
Or try merging list of dictionaries:Whole thing:
I think you can read this in as a python dictionary, where 1234 and 5678 are "keys" and the respective strings are the values. For example,You can index into it as you have mentioned,  and you will get 'hello world'.You can read a bit about dictionaries here. 
Change your json like thisor create function
In case you are reading from a json file, when json is loaded the type of data is dictionary and you can directly read the keys of loaded data.Still if you want to create a list out of it, please refer below code My sample.json file{    "1234": {        "id": "blabla",        "iscategorical": "0"    },    "5678": {        "id": "valore"    },    "8975": "value",    "6985": {        "id": "valore"    }}Code in separate python file:import jsonimport iofrom collections import defaultdictwith io.open('sample.json') as data_file:print(data_loaded)print(type(data_loaded))l1 = defaultdict(list)for key in data_loaded:print(l1)print(l1['1234'])
