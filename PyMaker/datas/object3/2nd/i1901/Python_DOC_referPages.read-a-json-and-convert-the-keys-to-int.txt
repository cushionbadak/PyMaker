It is well known that  converts integer keys of a dict to string:What's the cleanest way to restore integer keys when loading it back?I was thinking about:but is there a cleaner way to deal with dictionaries with integer keys with JSON / Python, not requiring keys conversion a posteriori?
Use  to define a custom function and perform operations:From docs: is an optional function that will be called with the  result of any object literal decoded (a dict). The return value  of  will be used instead of the dict.Or, you could also use  that lets you iterate through pairs and saves the  call (Thanks @chepner):From docs: is an optional function that will be called with the  result of any object literal decoded with an ordered list of pairs.  The return value of  will be used instead of  the dict.
