I have a program that accepts coordinates over UDP, moves some equipment around, and then replies when the job is done.I seem to have the same issue as this guy:Python sendto doesn't seem to sendMy code is here:The program behaves as though the sendto call is just passed over; it accepts the packet, executes the print statements, and loops back around (It can execute the loop multiple times but never replies).  I'm looking at wireshark and no packets are ever sent outbound.  No errors are ever thrown.Any ideas why this is happening?
From the documentation:The string must contain two hexadecimal digits per byte, with ASCII  whitespace being ignored.So this happens:Try this:if that's what you mean.Note that your  is catching all the exceptions, not just the ones you're expecting, so you're not seeing the error you're causing. Consider using something like  here instead.Also, think about reducing the amount of code in your  sections:This way you're protecting only the code which you want to.
