You need to use the  Python module. You can read the doc here, and look the examples here. Is better to use this module than implement you own timer, because  handle: the Garbage Collector of Python to prevent that process from skewing the results by scheduling a collection run at an inopportune moment.it picks the most accurate timer for your OS,  or .it repeats the tests many times to eliminate the influence of other tasks on your machine, such as disk flushing and OS scheduling.Plus:  include the  magic function for this purposes (source).
