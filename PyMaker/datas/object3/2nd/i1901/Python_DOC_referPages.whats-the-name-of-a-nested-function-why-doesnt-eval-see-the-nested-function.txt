This question already has an answer here:Python: How can I run eval() in the local scope of a function                    2 answers                I get the below error when I try to run this code. I'm trying to initialize a list with function pointers. It appears the eval doesn't see the functions. I'm guessing there's some kind of scoping going on that I don't understand. It works when I create the table by hand as you can see. I'm trying to avoid having to maintain a list of functions. This also worked when I made the functions global.
The problem is you are not passing  explicitly, so . From the docs:If both dictionaries are omitted, the expression is executed in the  environment where eval() is called.However, the environment is the list comprehension, which creates it's own scope, and neither of those functions are in the list-comprehension's local namespace, nor in the global namespace. You want 's local namespace So note, this works:Pass  and  explicitly! But you have to use them as free variables to the list-comprehension's scope, since it is essentially like another nested function scope, you can't just do this either:Indeed, that is equivalent to not passing the arguments at all.You could do:
