I have a python program that accepts three command line arguments -f (file1) -n (file2) -o (file3). The program is structured as follows:What I am trying to do is:If any of the arguments (-f,-n) are missing, then print a corresponding error.Print the error message - whatever it might be - to a file "err.txt".However, the err.txt file is empty. I am not sure what is going on. I have seen many questions where stderr is written to a file, but it does not seem to answer my question. 
If you are open to changing your approach, I would recommend not trying to re-invent the wheel, and checking out some of the existing python libraries to accomplish this functionality.There is a library called argparse  that does well at parsing out command line arguments and returning appropriate error messages, maybe you would find it helpful.In terms of error logging, you could try using the python logging library. This library can be configured to log information to stdout, text files, etc. and is likely flexible enough for your requirements.
