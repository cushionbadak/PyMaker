See the above line of code. It requires that the positional argument be specified, but it returns a list. To access , I need to access . I'd like to access it as  as it's confusing to see this list that can only ever be one item, and in fact must be one item as it's required.If I specify  it's no longer required but is returned as a string.
nargs isn't a required parameter and its removal will return a string and not a list as specified above.
