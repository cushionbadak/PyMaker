Spent a long time struggling with this relatively simple question about populating a tic tac toe board. The output was given to me and can't be replaced. I'm having two problems here. I can't get the row inside the [] without deleting the brackets and starting over. If I were to print ticTacToe I'd get  instead of Unwanted quotation marks keep appearing. If  , when I append it into ticTacToe it shows up as  instead of Not sure where I'm going wrong and any help would be appreciated. Thanks.
You should read about lists: PyTut listsOutputs:   If you want to add 3 things to each of the inner lists, you need 3 appends to each of the inner lists.Other nice read: string formatting and f-strings:You are using the 2.7 style printing, for 3 and 3.6 format and f-strings are better:Output (all):
You could use a simple loop through input splitted on space and append to  list:Sample run:Or, the whole thing in one line:
Firstly, in python the quotation marks indicate a string, so you must have them there.Since  is a list of lists, you're appending your inputs to the outermost list. To append to the inner lists:However, going off of the output code, it would seem that this is not what your instructor wants you to do.Instead, each of the lists need to contain a single character and not the entire string of characters.It would look something like this:There are many ways to do this, but here is one:The  method takes a string and converts it into a list provided a delimiter, a '' in this case. It then assigns (not appends) to the inner lists. (Note: this won't work if you put a space after your commas, but I'll let you figure that one out)
